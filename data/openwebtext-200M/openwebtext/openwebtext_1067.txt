AFTER decades of solitary research , having first mastered the mysteries of the Time Cube , we have at last been able to assemble this ultimate , definitive listing of the fundamental laws of the universe .
Well , actually , one of our clandestine operatives obtained this document from the top secret files of an influential creationist think tank — which we shall not name .
As a public service , we ’re making it available here .
The Ten Laws of Creationism and Intelligent Design
Note :
In case this document is ever disclosed in a courtroom , remember : this is a statement of scientific principles .
We do n’t use the word “ creationism . ”
The operative term is Intelligent Design , or ID .
Similarly , we do n’t use the word “ miracle . ”
The operative expression is “ product of ID . ”
In applying these principles while speaking to the public , be sure to emphasize that what we do here is science , not theology .
This is vital for litigation purposes .
1. The Law of Evidence : Everything is Designed ; therefore everything is evidence of ID .
No evidence supports evolution .
2 . The Law of Conservation of Arguments : Discredited arguments are never discarded , they can always be recycled .
3 . The Law of Reproducible Results : Anything found in nature was Designed , unless it can be reproduced in the lab .
Corollary : Anything intentionally done in a lab is not natural ; it ’s a purposeful result .
Therefore , all lab results are evidence of Intelligent Design .
4 . The Law of Completeness : Anything which has not yet been found or explained will never never be found or explained .
Gaps and mysteries are evidence of ID .
5 . The Law of Complexity , Improbability , and Inexplicably : That which is complicated or improbable and has not been explained , cannot exist naturally .
6 . The Law of Impossibility : Complex and improbable things , being naturally impossible , must be the product of ID .
7 . The Law of Persistence of Design : Once something has been declared a product of ID , no natural explanation is acceptable .
If one of proffered , it is evidence only of the fact that the naturalists are desperate .
8 . The Law of Supernatural Superiority : Whenever two explanations of a phenomenon are presented , one natural and one supernatural , the latter is always better .
Naturalistic bias must be avoided .
9 . The Principle of Life : Life ca n’t arise naturally , and yet it exists .
Therefore life is the product of ID .
10 . The Principle of Universal Design :
The universe is made for life , which is highly improbable ; therefore the universe is the product of ID .

On their website yesterday , Weezer revealed a few more details about their forthcoming LP .
As the band report , it 'll be out on October 27 , longtime industry mainstays Jacknife Lee and Butch Walker produced it , and it 's called ...
Raditude .
Yes , Raditude .
No , we do n't know what that means .
First single " ( If You 're Wondering If I Want You To ) I Want You To " leaked yesterday , and it 'll be out officially on August 25 .
We posted a YouTube stream of the track yesterday , but do n't go to that post if you want to actually hear that song .
( Go to the Hype Machine instead . )
On that particular YouTube clip , someone has taken Weezer 's song and replaced it with what sure seems to be " Beg & Plead " , a slice of syrupy adult - contempo R&B balladry from the smooth jazz artist Glynis John Martin .
( Thanks , Google ! )
It says something , though , that this song actually could plausibly come from circa -2009 Weezer .

A pregnant woman critically ill with swine flu is getting the " best possible treatment " after being flown to Sweden for specialist treatment , the Scottish health secretary said today .
The 26 - year - old patient was transferred to the hospital in Stockholm yesterday after suffering a rare and severe reaction to the H1N1 virus .
The health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio programme : " She 's now getting treatment that gives her the best possible chance of survival .
" She 's now in hospital in Sweden .
Doctors were pleased with how she coped with the journey .
So she 's now in very good hands , getting the best possible treatment and I 'm sure we all wish her well and hope she makes a full recovery . "
The woman had been admitted last week to Crosshouse hospital in Kilmarnock , East Ayrshire , where she was put on a ventilator .
NHS Ayrshire and Arran 's specialist intensive care team recommended she receive a highly specialised procedure known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( Ecmo ) .
This involves circulating the patient 's blood outside the body and adding oxygen to it artificially – a relatively new technique that is used when a person 's lungs are functioning very poorly even with ventilation and high levels of oxygen .
The UK has a national Ecmo unit in Leicester but all five beds are in use .
A bed was , however , found in a similar unit in Stockholm , and the woman was transferred under pan-European arrangements for sharing such scarce facilities .
Sturgeon said the treatment " might , and hopefully will , save her life " .
She added : " It 's a highly specialised procedure and that 's why , given a bed was found for her in Sweden , the decision was taken by her clinical team to recommend transfer there . "
Before the woman was transferred , a medical team from Sweden came to Scotland to assess her .
Dr Robert Masterton , the executive medical director of NHS Ayrshire and Arran , said : " Once an Ecmo bed was identified in Sweden , our intensive - care specialists worked closely with our Swedish colleagues to make sure the patient was stable before being transferred . "
He added : " The family have been fully involved in this decision and support this referral .
They have asked for privacy while they concentrate on the patient 's treatment and recovery . "
However , Sturgeon stressed this particular case was unusual .
She said : " It remains the case that for the overwhelming majority of people who get this virus the symptoms are very mild and they will make a full recovery within a matter of days without any complications whatsoever .
It 's that fact that should continue to give the public a lot of reassurance . "
DENVER — One new law set to take effect Wednesday will allow Colorado homeowners to collect rainwater , if they can prove they ’re not infringing on other water users ’ rights .
That ’s right , rainwater .
It will be legal for homeowners to use rainwater for fire protection , animals , irrigation and household use .
It ’s a touchy issue in the state , which does not import water from other states or regions and is forced by law to send it on to other states downstream .
The law establishes a pilot program that people will have to apply for .
The program ’s size has n’t been determined .
“ People are shocked that some developer or water provider owns the water that falls out of the sky , ” said Rep. Marsha Looper , a Republican from rural Calhan , southeast of Denver , who sponsored the legislation .
“ Every drop of water that hits the ground belongs to someone , ” said Kevin Bommer , a lobbyist for the Colorado Municipal League , which opposed past attempts to ease the rules .
Recent dry spells convinced lawmakers this year it was time to try harvesting rain — not that anyone was prosecuted under the old ban .
Water rights are a complicated matter in Colorado , and water districts , farming cooperatives and municipalities each have a claim , with the oldest claims getting priority .
It will be up to the state water engineer to determine if the law hurts water providers .
Another 56 laws go into effect Wednesday .
One raises vehicle registration fees to pay for highway and bridge repairs .
Another will impose new fees on hospitals .
The fees will be used to get federal matching dollars for a total of $ 1.2 billion a year .
The money will be used to expand the number of people covered by Medicaid and the state ’s health insurance program for children .
It will also be used to increase payments to hospitals that treat the uninsured .

The alcohol - content of wine has increased People are drinking more alcohol by " stealth " because of the stronger drinks on the market , an analysis of consumption in the UK suggests .
The amount of alcohol consumed per person has risen by 10 % since 2000 - despite drink sales remaining steady .
Researchers Mintel said wines and lagers were becoming stronger and people were unaware of the changes .
It comes as latest figures show a third of men and a fifth of women drink more than the recommended daily limits .
The NHS recommends a limit of three to four units of alcohol per day for men , and two to three units for women .
Consumers have limited information to help them make healthy choices about their alcohol consumption
Don Shenker , of Alcohol Concern Mintel carried out its own surveys as well as using data from a range of sources including the NHS and sales information from shops , bars and pubs to compile its report .
Binge drinking among the young is often blamed for growing alcohol consumption , but the Mintel research showed those drinking at home were the group which saw the greatest rise .
Moreover , in a sign that binge drinking may be becoming less socially acceptable , 22 % fewer 18 - 24 - year - olds agreed with the statement , " the point of drinking is to get drunk " than did five years ago , the report added .
In total , drink sales have hardly changed since 2000 , but the amount of pure alcohol consumed has risen by nearly a tenth from 8.4 litres per year per person to 9.2 litres .
The report said the changes were likely to be down to the stronger drinks that were on sale .
The alcohol content of wine is now normally around 13 % , while in the past it would have been closer to 11 % .
Premium 5 % lagers were also becoming more popular .
Jonny Forsyth , a senior drinks analyst at Mintel , added : " It may be that the majority of consumers are not aware of ABV ( alcohol by volume ) .
" So despite a greater societal concern with being healthy leading to a decline in drinking penetration , by stealth we are drinking more pure alcohol than ever . "
Labelling
The government has attempted to encourage greater awareness of the alcohol content of drinks throught the Know Your Limits advertising campaign .
Manufacturers have also been encouraged to provide labelling on drinks .
But Don Shenker , chief executive of Alcohol Concern , said : " Consumers have limited information to help them make healthy choices about their alcohol consumption .
" There is often no information about units and even rarer information about sensible drinking levels on the labels of alcohol products .
" The increasing strength of wines and beers means we are often drinking at harmful levels without realising it . "
He also said there should be more lower - strength drinks on the market for people to " enjoy without harming their health " .
" With alcohol consumption being linked to more than 40 different diseases or conditions surely the drinks industry has a responsibility to provide clear information and a greater choice of lower strength beers , wines and ciders which people can enjoy without harming their health . "

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
A top Iranian general said government troops are " ready to sacrifice our lives " rather than back down in the face of protests over June 's disputed presidential election .
Iranians have held mass protests , such as this one on June 15 , over the recent disputed presdential election .
Gen . Sayyed Hassan Firouzabadi , chief of Iran 's Joint Armed Forces , said Iranian soldiers were willing to die as they did in the brutal eight - year Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s , according to the state - run Fars News Agency .
" Some may think that by protesting and chanting their slogans against us , we will back down , retreat and give up , " Firouzabadi said .
" We are ready to sacrifice our lives , as we showed during the time of the Sacred Defense [ the Iran - Iraq war ] . "
The government has cracked down on Iranians who protested the outcome of the June 12 election in which hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner over his chief rival , reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi .
Moussavi called the vote fraudulent and his supporters took to the streets by the thousands , sparking clashes between demonstrators and government troops , and members of a pro-government paramilitary force .
" The military uniform , in the system of the Islamic Republic , which is the system of the holy Quran , is the uniform of the Prophet 's faithful , Firouzabadi said .
" It is the uniform of service to the supreme leadership and the people . "
Meanwhile , Brig .
Gen. Azizollah Rajabzadeh , Tehran 's police chief , announced the creation of a 50,000 - strong constable - like force called the " honorary police officers " that will assist police units , state - run Press TV reported .
Rajabzadeh said the honorary police force could eventually expand to 300,000 nationwide .

We were shell - shocked when Global Gaming Factory X AB , a Swedish software corporate , announced it was acquiring The Pirate Bay for $ 7.8 Million .
The Pirate Bay , the world 's epicenter for torrents and illegal P2P file distribution , sold to a company that intended to give it a new , legal business model ?
It sounded too insane to be possible .
I guess we should n't be shocked then to learn that The Pirate Bay acquisition may not happen after all .
Multiple sources are reporting that the acquisition may be cancelled in one week 's time if Global Gaming X AB can't provide investor guarantees .
It does n't help that the major studios are suing it , either .
Just a strange series of events
The basic story is this : after Global Gaming made the deal public , it hired Wayne Rosso , the former head of Grokster , to negotiate with music and film giants to get legal licenses to their content .
He specifically told CNET that he does n't think that Global Gaming even has the funds to make the deal happen , and that the Global Gaming has n't been straightforward with him .
Thus , he 's left Global Gaming :
" I and my colleagues have very strong doubts that the funding is in place , " Rosso said .
" And there are other issues regarding Mr. Pandeya 's credibility that trouble us greatly . "
The second nail in the coffin is a lawsuit that nearly a dozen studios have filed to shut The Pirate Bay down , including Disney and Paramount .
Their claim is that The Pirate Bay has n't stopped their activities after being sentenced to prison .
There 's also a separate lawsuit already in progress by the four major music labels .
Combine the lawsuit with losing Rosso and apparent funding problem and you can see why the Pirate Bay acquisition is in doubt .
The Pirate Bay saga is just keeps getting stranger .

I was sad to hear of the passing of Ted Kennedy this week .
While his policy views often stood in stark contrast with those held by many Latter - day Saints in the United States , he was , nevertheless , a consummate legislator who truly knew how to put political differences aside and reach across the aisle to find common ground on pressing issues facing our country .
More importantly , though , and in spite of whatever mistakes he may have made in his life , Ted Kennedy struck me as a good man intent on making America a better place .
He is also one who seemed to take to Mormons , from his long - running friendship with the late Wayne Owens , who served as Kennedy ’s Chief of Staff for over two years before running for congress himself and who always insisted that Kennedy meet with LDS Church presidents when in Utah , to his close bonds with Senator Orrin Hatch and former Senator Gordon Smith , with whom he often worked across the aisle to produce a good deal of significant bipartisan legislation .
Of his differences with Hatch , Kennedy once said : “ We have a difference in terms of perhaps how we are going to achieve the objectives , but I do n’t really feel that I have a difference with Orrin in terms of what the objectives ought to be .
If you build upon that kind of understanding and respect , you can get a lot of things done . ”
Kennedy ’s relationships with these men were clearly much deeper than any sort of convenient political arrangement though .
Kennedy was one of the keynote speakers at a Memorial Service for Owens after his unexpected passing in 2002 .
Owens ’ son said that Kennedy “ gave a loud , funny storytelling talk that meant a lot to our family . ”
When Smith ’s son committed suicide in 2003 , Kennedy reached out to him repeatedly , approaching him with tears in his eyes , often unable to speak .
Kennedy and Hatch went on to co-author the introduction to a book Smith wrote in 2006 that reflected on his son ’s death .
Upon hearing of Kennedy ’s passing , Smith said : “ I consider it one of my life privileges to have worked with him across the aisle on many issues .
It has been a pleasure and a privilege knowing him . ”
In the wake of Kennedy ’s death , Hatch penned a column in Newsweek , in which he noted :
I remember a time in my life when I was falsely accused of impropriety and was being savaged in the press .
At the same time , my father , Jesse , was dying , and he slipped away in the midst of this tumult .
Sadly , many of my Senate colleagues avoided me until I was cleared of all wrongdoing .
But not Ted Kennedy .
He called and consoled me , talking about his struggle to come to terms with the death of his father and brothers .
Concerning the press battles , he said , “ Ah , Orrin , everyone knows you did nothing wrong .
Everything will work out . ”
He was the only one , Republican or Democrat , who did that .
Hatch also spoke at Kennedy ’s Memorial Service two days ago ( see here , here and here ) and shared a number of touching anecdotes regarding “ his dear friend , ” a couple of which I thought were relevant to recount here .
The first involved Hatch ’s former administrative assistant , Frank Manson , who had just become the Mission President of the Boston , Massachusetts mission .
Hatch said Manson called him soon thereafter requesting several favors : whether Hatch would be willing to address the mission ’s 200 missionaries , whether he would ask Kennedy to come speak as well , and whether he could ask Kennedy to secure Faneuil Hall for the meeting .
Hatch said he ’d try :
“ On one occasion after a particularly late night in the Senate ” Hatch said Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd were ‘ feeling no pain ’ ( a little tipsy ) , and while Hatch was walking off the Senate floor , “ Teddy put his arm around me and he said , oh , Orrin , I want you to come up to Hyannis Port and I want you to go sailing with me .
Yes .
You want to do this ?
Yes , I want you to do that .
Yes .
I said , now , Teddy , I have a favor to ask of you .
He said , you do , so what ’s that ?
I said do you remember Frank Manson , my administrative assistant ?
He said oh , yes , good guy , good guy .
“ I said , well , you know , he ’s asked that you and I come and speak to his — and I said he’s now the mission president in the Mormon church , over 200 Mormon young missionaries in Boston , Massachusetts .
My hometown , and I said yes ….
well , how about he would like you and me to come up and speak to his 200 young missionaries .
He said done .
Just like that .
I said , well , I have another favor to ask of you .
What ’s that ?
I said , well , he would like you to get Faneuil Hall .
He said done .
“ So the next day I got into the office and I got this nice letter for Teddy .
And I got it over to him .
And I saw him later in the day and he ’s holding that letter and his hands were shaking .
And he said , Orrin — he said , what else did I agree to last night ?
… After telling these things , my eyes start to water , my nose starts to run .
It was just a mess , I tell you .
But in any event , Teddy Kennedy and Orrin Hatch appeared before 200 young Mormon missionaries in Faneuil Hall and they will never forget the tremendous altruistic talk that he gave to them on that day .
“ Well , all I can say is it was really something .
He did n’t try to weasel out of it .
Instead , he produced the hall and he gave that beautiful speech .
I was impressed as usual .
And those missionaries will never forget that .
And though they were of a different faith , he commended them for their willingness to serve a cause bigger than themselves and thanked them for their selflessness .
This is just one example of the graciousness of my dear friend , Ted Kennedy . ”
The second involved the controversy surrounding the completion of the Boston Temple :
“ I was approached by several people working in the temple and informed that the city would not allow a spire to be placed on the top of the temple with an angel on top of it as is customary on Mormon temples .
” I immediately called Ted and asked for help .
Not long after that conversation , he called me back and said , ‘ All of western Massachusetts will see the Angel Gabriel on the top of the Mormon temple . ’
“ Though I was tempted to leave it alone , I had to inform Teddy it was actually the Angel Moroni , a prominent figure in the LDS faith .
And at that point , Teddy replied , does this mean I ’m going to get another Book of Mormon for Christmas ?
Of course he did . ”
Whatever one ’s views were of Kennedy ’s politics , I think we can all join in mourning the passing of an elder statesman who gave nearly fifty years of public service to the Senate and who fought tirelessly during that time in support of many policies he intended to aid the poor and less fortunate , often reaching across the aisle to build consensus in order to do so .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) --
On the surface , China presents a fiscal study in contrast with the United States , keeping a remarkably low ceiling on debt even as it spends its way out of the financial crisis .
But when Chinese leaders meet their U.S. counterparts this week , they should pause for reflection before venting any criticism , because hidden liabilities mean China 's books are uglier -- potentially much uglier -- than at first sight .
Thanks to successive years of fast economic growth and even faster government revenue growth , the official debt - to - GDP ratio was 17.7 % at the end of last year , far lower than almost any other major economy .
The trouble is that excludes local government borrowing , the current surge in loans backstopped by Beijing and bad assets cleared from the banking system but still floating about .
When all are thrown into the pot , analysts estimate that China 's debt may be closer to 60 % of GDP , putting it in virtually the same league as the United States , which was at 70 % at the end of 2008 before it launched its massive economic stimulus program .
To be sure , Washington is now set on a path of exploding debt that Beijing will largely avoid .
The United States budgeted for a federal deficit of 12.9 % of GDP this year , whereas China is aiming for just 2.9 % .
But China 's finances are deteriorating more quickly than the government expected , fueling a rise in the stock of both explicit and disguised debt that will constrict its wriggle room .
" It is serious because , one , much of it is hidden and , two , local governments are currently doubling down on their bets , " said Stephen Green , economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai .
" As with all fiscal deficits , it limits space for further stimulus . "
This is probably a moot point , for now .
With China 's economy back on track and private - sector investment kicking in , few think Beijing will need to ramp up spending beyond its existing 4 trillion yuan ( $ 585 billion ) , two - year stimulus plan .
But the narrowing of options still discomfits Chinese leaders .
" Our fiscal work is very grim , " Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told officials last week .
Eroding finances
Government revenues declined 2.4 % in the first half compared to a year earlier , well shy of the official goal of an 8 % rise .
Expenditures were ahead of target and set to surge in the second half on the back of infrastructure projects .
Tax intakes are , of course , closely tied to economic activity , so China 's upturn should deliver cash to government coffers .
But improvement in June came mainly from land sales , a one - off revenue source that masks the difficult road ahead .
" Even when we are already factoring in relatively optimistic revenue growth due to the economic recovery , the deficit is quite sticky at around 5 % per year for the next three years , " said Isaac Meng , economist at BNP Paribas in Beijing .
But the real worry is the thickening morass of indirect debt .
Officials at the Ministry of Finance estimated earlier this year that local government debt already topped 4 trillion yuan , or 16.5 % of GDP , much more than previously assumed .
Above and beyond that are 400 billion yuan in bad loans in banks ' hands and at least 1 trillion yuan in non-performing debt hived off their books and assigned to asset management companies .
The buck stops with Beijing on all of these .
The record surge in bank lending this year means that its sum of liabilities is about to swell in size .
Banks have showered money on infrastructure projects that are seen as having iron - clad government guarantees .
Green said he " conservatively " estimates that Beijing 's bill for covering loans issued this year alone will be 1.75 trillion yuan , enough to push its 2009 deficit to 10 % of GDP .
" Debt bomb "
Most troublesome of all is the potential for a " debt bomb " , in the words of China 's Economic Observer newspaper , at lower levels of government as officials engage in financial engineering that is both opaque and highly leveraged .
Rules prevent Chinese banks from lending to governments the equity capital which they need to obtain further loans for investment .
But local officials and banks are now exploiting a vast loophole thanks to intermediaries known as trust companies .
The process is simple enough .
Trusts create specially designed " wealth products " , which banks sell to their clients .
Banks then give the funds to the trusts and they , in turn , funnel them to governments as equity capital .
Local authorities , in short , are piling debt on top of debt .
The Chinese banking regulator has started to warn trusts and banks of the growing risks , state media recently reported .
It was not long ago that bad loans in China 's banking system seemed to pose a massive debt threat to the wider economy .
The core solution over the past decade was sustained double - digit growth , vastly expanding the denominator in debt - to - GDP ratios and generating the taxes to pay down the numerator .
Beijing is already looking to raise taxes where it can -- increasing the levy on cigarettes , for example -- but a return to super - charged growth is again its principal debt reduction plan .
In the meantime , China needs to fund its rising deficit .
On that front , at least , the government can be supremely confident , even if it has to issue more than the planned 950 billion yuan in bonds this year and yet more to cover shortfalls in coming years .
" There is so much saving and so much liquidity , so there is definitely not a problem that China will not be able to finance its deficit , " said Tao Wang , UBS economist in Beijing .
Thomas has vitiligo , a disorder in which pigment - making cells are destroyed .
White patches appear on different parts of the body , tissues in the mouth and nose , and the retina .
" There is no cause .
There is no cure , and it's very random , " Thomas says .
" I could turn all the way white or mostly white . "
As many as 65 million people worldwide have the disorder , including up to 2 million in the United States .
Few people , outside medical professionals and those with the disease , had heard the term " vitiligo " until Michael Jackson revealed in the early 1990s that the disorder was behind his skin turning brown to white .
It is not fatal , but experts say vitiligo robs people of self - confidence , evokes ridicule and unpleasant stares , and pushes some into unforced seclusion .
The 40 - year - old Thomas says that 's not where the disorder needs to be .
He openly talks about vitiligo and how it has affected his life and career , and has written a book about his journey titled " Turning White : A Memoir of Change . "
Along the way , Thomas says he has met others with the disorder and has become a celebrity spokesman for the Columbus , Ohio - based National Vitiligo Foundation .
Vitiligo attacks the soul and psyche , foundation executive director Robert Haas says .
" When was the last time you saw someone with vitiligo handling your food ?
It is the public 's image that it is some leprosy - type of disease , " he says .
" A lot of folks feel this disease has trapped them and kept them away from their life goals . "
That was Thomas ' fear .
He uses a combination of creams and makeup to cover the growing patches of skin - which he calls devoid of colour - on his face , hands and arms .
Viewers , co-workers and , for years , his basketball buddies , were none the wiser .
Only family members and those closest to him knew the secret he had kept since age 25 .
Thomas first noticed a change after getting a haircut while working in Louisville , Kentucky .
He looked in a mirror and thought the barber had nicked him .
A closer look revealed a pale spot , about the size of a quarter .
" I got two more on the other side of my scalp , on my hand and one in the corner of my mouth , " he recalls in an interview from the station 's studio .
" That 's when I went to the doctor and got diagnosed . "
He did not let it slow down his blossoming career .
From Louisville , he soon landed at WABC in New York for three years beginning in 1994 .
After a short freelancing stint in Los Angeles , Thomas found his way to WJBK in Detroit in 1997 .
He has carved a niche in the Motor City market with his quirky , upbeat and humorous reporting style ; his confidence , constant smile and positive air on the set mirrors his demeanor off the set as well .
Even though Thomas uses makeup to conceal his skin discolouration , he realised the vitiligo was becoming more obvious when he could not hide it from a preschooler during a story about a playground .
His two - toned hands frightened the girl , who began to cry .
" I thought my career was over , " says the Emmy award winner who routinely travels to Hollywood for one - on - one interviews with celebrities including Will Smith , Tom Cruise and Halle Berry .
So he gathered himself one day and approached the station 's news director , prepared to walk away from television .
" She said , ' Let 's just see what happens , " ' Thomas recalls .
" As it got worse , she kept encouraging me to tell my story . "
Dana Hahn , WJBK 's vice president of news , says the station was concerned about Thomas possibly leaving because of the condition .
" Lee is also a friend and we wanted to help , " she says .
" He had covered it up so well , we really did n't realise the impact it was having or how far it had spread . "
Thomas finally agreed to tell his story on television in November 2005 .
After the first segment on Thomas ' vitiligo aired , Hahn says he took a leave of absence and missed the initial response from viewers .
" I received 40 to 50 e-mails a day the entire time he was gone , " Hahn says .
" So many people found support and encouragement in his story .
I 've never seen the kind of response to any story in my 12 years at Fox 2 . "
At the time , Thomas was already writing his book .
" As all those things happened , the tone of the book changed , " he says .
" I was writing for all those people who were afraid to come outside . "
Dr Sancy Leachman , associate professor of dermatology at the University of Utah , calls vitiligo stigmatising , driving some to even consider suicide .
" They feel people are looking at them all of the time , " she says .
" They are very self - conscious about people staring at them in the grocery line .
It can be a very demoralising condition . "
Thomas acknowledges he even preferred the security of solitude to the awkward stares of strangers when not wearing his makeup .
" There were times when I would not come out of the house , " he says .
" I call it a mental war .
It was me saying , ' I do n't want to deal with it today . '
I never stayed in for very long .
I know people who stay in now for months at a time . "
When he's out socially now , Thomas forgoes the makeup he wears on camera .
He met his girlfriend of seven months , Karen Tate , at a vegetarian restaurant they both enjoy .
She said when they 're out together , she notices some people staring and making muffled comments about his appearance .
" He does n't say anything , " Tate , 28 , says .
" It does n't really bother me .
Some people are just rude . "
She says she sees past what some people can't .
" He just has a very free spirit .
He is just a very nice guy .
He opens up completely in his book .
It is something he really wanted to do . "
Surprisingly , Thomas gives vitiligo some credit .
" Having this disease forces me to focus on what I am : kind , caring , honest , " he says .
" There are people who have diseases that will kill them . "

Here ’s the thing , the more I enter into political debates and discussions online , the more I notice the very large presence of people who would be classified to be on the “ Libertarian ” right .
That includes proponents of Austrian Economics , Randroids , Ron Paul Stormtroopers , “ Anarcho ” - Capitalists and the occasional crypto - “ Libertarian ” Conservative / Republicans .
The weird thing about this , is how common they are , in the English speaking part of the net at least , compared to how scarce they are IRL .
Before I went political on the net , I spent the better part of a decade without even encountering one such person , even though I found it impossible to not meet Communists or Anarchists .
But online , the roles are reversed .
Right - “ Libertarians ” and general proponents of Free Markets are dime a dozen , while one is hard pressed to find the occasional outspoken Anarchist or Communist in discussion boards or any other non-partisan location .
Obviously there is something in the Internet which gives the vulgar proponent of capitalism an advantage over their actual representation , at least in political debates .
I ’ve written in the past on why Conservatives are so few online , so I might as well throw my half - arsed opinion on the proliferation of this ideology .
1 . The internet is full of IT geeks
Why is this important ?
Well IT geeks tend to generally be smart and extremely rational as these are aspects of personality which would make someone like stuff like programming and gaming .
Incidentally these are the kind of interests that make people less social and more individualist .
We are all familiar with the concepts of the lone gamer or the asocial programmer in his parent ’s basement and while these are far from the norm , the archetype was not achieved without any basis in reality .
Then there ’s the fact that the Internet and IT technology is extremely young , disruptive and on which comprehensive barriers to entry have not yet been erected by the big players .
All of these as a result allow any geek with a dream of success to try his hand at a start - up with very little upfront cost , especially since the means of production are , if not free ( such as programming languages ) , at worst very affordable .
Ther result of this mix , is a culture where it seems as if the smartest and more capable are the ones that can succeed .
Add to this the obvious lack of government intervention and regulation of the online IT industry and one tends to draw the same conclusions : Rugged individualism works for the best .
In short , you have an environment skewed very much towards the progressive strata of society .
Unfortunately , these conclusions look at only half of the greater picture ( eg , they ignore that it ’s the workers which own the means of productions in this environment ) and end up drawing the wrong conclusions .
The current situation is quite similar on general with the pre-depression auto industry , when the economic boom and low maturity of the technology made it profitable for many to create cars .
However it has little relation to the real world .
But for for asocial or antisocial IT geeks , the idea that looking at one ’s immediate material self - interest is socially constructive and that the smartest will always prosper if the government does n’t interfere makes obviously for a positive candidate for the right - libertarian ideology .
That is not to say of course that most geeks are right - “ libertarians ” or that most right - “ libertarians ” are geeks but it ’s rather to point out the obvious fertile ground for such ideologies .
2. Economics
Mathematics is pure logic .
It is the explanatory method we use to transfer arithmetic information and because of this it is quite interesting to those with more rational minds .
This ties somehow with the first point above , specifically with the aspect of rationality that most geeks have .
But how does mathematics help increase the pool of right - “ libertarians ” ?
Economics .
Economics , at least the mainstream kind , attempts to describe reality through a mathematical perspective .
As such , it promises to achieve a rational certainty that is impossible in any other social science .
All the certainty of science , without any of that pesky scientific method or empirical evidence .
All you need is to find the few irrefutable axioms and Bob ’s your uncle .
It is then unsurprising that almost all right - “ libertarians ” you will meet online will at one occasion or other claim that you need to learn economics before you can argue with them .
I ’ve actually yet to meet a right - “ libertarian ” who ’s advocacy of stateless ( or minarchistic ) capitalism does not follow from them accepting a particular economic school as correct .
3 . Most people online are middle to upper class
This is pretty self - explanatory really .
It is an obvious fact that those of us who can afford to waste time arguing and debating online , must come from the part of society which is well off enough to use it like this .
The poor , the homeless and the exploited , in short , the vast majority of humans either do not have access to the Internet at all , and even if they do , it ’s unlikely that they have enough time or interest to tackle with apologists of the system that is keeping them down .
As such , online discussions are generally full of middle - class progressives , students from better off families ( which can afford them a PC and online connection ) and the occasional struggling individualist who is annoyed at the guv’ment putting them down .
Which is incidentally why you ’re more likely to see a US Liberal ( ie Social Democrat ) vs Libertarian argument than anything else .
As the Internet is still a luxury for most , it is in fact those who ’s life is on the better track which will be using it the most , and the perspective of those , is unlikely to understand the socialist point of view , as things are simply not bad enough .
4. English - speaking Internet is a USA ( and friends ) dominated zone
The last thing I believe adds to the popularity of this ideology is because most people who are active in the english - speaking online world are those who come from USA and the UK .
This is understandable as those two nations especially have a hugely inflated middle class ( see above ) .
Furthermore . both bastions of Capitalism and neoliberal policies .
Especially US is so dominated by right - wing ideology where their whole political terminology needed to take a turn to the right as a whole so as to avoid the “ Social Democrat ” label .
Mix then the recent popularity of right - “ libertarian ” icons such as Ron Paul , Peter Schiff , Pen & Teller etc to the viral nature of Web2.0 and one can see what is cooking .
It is precisely because of this recent rise of interest to the Free marketeer personas that more and more right - “ libertarians ” feel brave enough to state and argue for their chosen ideology .
Fortunately , this effect is mostly concentrated in the English speaking online world , as other nations have a far larger ( and occasionally brighter ) history with socialist movements .
Unfortunately this means that those of us who have a international perspective cannot throw a virtual stone in an online location without hitting someone claiming that taxes are theft , greed is good or some other such nonsense .
So what is a socialist to do ?
To tell the truth , in the English speaking online world there ’s not much we can do .
It ’s impossible to do anything to reverse the turn towards the right political spectrum of UK and US and as such we can expect their discussions to keep being dominated by “ Liberals ” and “ Libertarians ” .
Two things are going to probably change the balance of opinions however .
First the coming crisis is certainly going to make those who ’s life is being turned upside down re-evaluate their positions .
Those of them already used to the online interaction , might become allies .
Second , if the Capitalist system manages to persist , the Internet will slowly but surely start being dominated by larger and larger players ( see : Google ) which will lead to the classic barriers to entry starting to be erected .
Perhaps it will take the form of removing or hijacking “ net- neutrality ” .
Perhaps it will be through “ for the children ” Internet censorship , but whatever it is , creating a start - up will not be as easy anymore .
The obviousness of the progressive agenda will be weakened .
And finally , as the Internet is popularized more and more and the difficulty of getting online is reduced ( See : netbooks and more cheap technology ) , the poor and downtrodden will find it easier to get online and state their opinion as well .
Of course , whether the Internet we will have by then will remain the same open environment we have now or transform into a politicized and propagandistic system such as the mass media is now , is another question altogether .
Whatever happens , it ’s unlikely that it will serve as a bastion of right - “ libertarians ” forever .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Job losses slowed dramatically in May , according to the latest government reading on the battered labor market , even as the unemployment rate rose to a 26 - year high .
But some experts cautioned that the job market remains weak .
Employers cut 345,000 jobs from their payrolls in the month , down from the revised decline of 504,000 jobs in April .
This was the fewest jobs lost in a month since last September , when the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers caused a crisis in U.S. financial markets and choked off credit for many businesses .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a loss of 520,000 jobs in May .
There were still widespread job losses , as most sectors of the economy , including manufacturing , construction , retail , and business and professional services posted declines in jobs .
But there were also some signs of growth , notably in education and health services , as well as the leisure and hospitality sector .
Nearly one third of industries added jobs during the month , the highest level of gains since last October .
Still , the unemployment rate rose to 9.4 % from 8.9 % in April .
Economists expected unemployment would increase to 9.2 % .
Strangely enough , economists said the rise in unemployment is partly a sign of an improved jobs outlook .
That 's because people who had stopped looking for work started looking once again , and thus were classified as unemployed rather than " not in the labor force " - which is how the Labor Department counts most discouraged workers .
" As conditions improve more people flock to the labor market , " said Robert Brusca of FAO Economics .
He believes the economy is poised to start adding jobs before the end of this year .
" Jobs are doing what they do at the end of recessions and in early recoveries , " he said .
" No one can be optimistic enough to catch the turn when it comes . "
But other economists cautioned that even though it was a better - than - expected jobs report , there are still signs of weakness .
Kurt Karl , chief economist at Swiss Re , said he does n't expect a monthly gain in jobs until at least the middle of 2010 .
With employers still cutting jobs and hours , he said consumers wo n't have enough money to spur an economic recovery in the near term .
" I think things are turning for the better .
But it 's a disappointingly slow turn , " he said .
" Consumers can't consume more with this kind of picture . "
Karl pointed out that the loss of 345,000 jobs in a month was worse than any one - month drop in the previous three recessions .
There have now been 6 million jobs lost since the start of 2008 , with nearly half of them occurring in the first five months of this year .
" That 345,000 , while an improvement , is still a lot of jobs , " he said .
" We 're not out of the woods yet . "
The unemployment rate was the highest since August of 1983 .
And the official unemployment rate only captures part of the pain being felt by job seekers .
More than a quarter of unemployed people have been out of work for six months or more , and the number of long - term unemployed reached nearly 4 million , the highest reading on records that go back to 1980 .
There were also 9.1 million people who were working part - time jobs because they could not find full - time work or they had their hours cut back .
This was also a record high .
When counting people who wanted full - time work who are working part - time , as well as some of the people who are not counted as unemployed because they had stopped looking for work , the so - called underemployment reading rose to a record level of 16.4 % .
What 's more , the average work week slipped again to a record low 33.1 hours .
That pushed average weekly wages down as well during the month .
Tig Gilliam , chief executive of Adecco Group North America , a unit of the world 's largest employment staffing firm , said the average hours worked will have to increase before the economy will be ready to start adding jobs again , as employers will be cautious about restarting their hiring .
Gilliam is also concerned that the number of temporary employees fell for the 17th straight month , another sign of employer wariness .
" That 's does n't suggest a dramatic improvement in hiring soon , " he said .
" We 're still in a difficult labor market and it's going to take us time the rest of this year to work through to where companies are adding back jobs . "
Watts Bar Unit 2 * Location : On the Tennessee River near Spring City , Tenn . * History : Construction permit granted in 1973 ; work was suspended in 1988 and resumed in October 2007 .
* Investment : TVA spent $ 1.7 billion on the unit before work halted ; completion of the reactor is estimated to cost another $ 2.5 billion .
* Power output : 1,180 megawatts , or enough power to supply more than 250,000 homes .
* Construction work force : 1,849 today , rising to 2,400 next year .
* Schedule : Completion planned by 2012 , but environmental groups do n't want the NRC to grant operating license * *
What 's next : NRC administrative panel will review safety objections to license application .
KNOXVILLE --
The sluggish economy is cutting electricity use in the Tennessee Valley by nearly 7 percent this year , but TVA is n't slowing its plans to finish America 's first new nuclear reactor in more than a decade .
TVA Senior Vice President Ashok Bhatnagar said the $ 2.5 billion , five - year plan to finish a second reactor at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant is on schedule and within budget .
Nearly 1,850 TVA and contract employees are now working at the plant and at TVA 's headquarters here to finish the Unit 2 reactor at Watts Bar by 2012 .
" Power demand may fluctuate year to year , but we know we need this power just to help reduce what we already are having to buy from others on the grid , " Mr. Bhatnagar told a conference here for journalists on nuclear power .
But last week , five anti-nuclear groups served notice they will ask federal regulators not to license another reactor at Watts Bar .
The groups filed a petition to intervene against TVA 's license request before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
The groups contend another reactor could unduly heat up the Tennessee River and poise an undue risk to the public .
" The community is really worried about the Tennessee River and the quality of our water resources and TVA has n't done anything to reassure us that they know what they 're doing , " said Ann Harris , executive director of We the People Inc. and member of the Sierra Club who lives near the existing reactor .
" TVA 's recent coal ash spills and now building more nuclear reactors all along the river -- this insanity has got to stop . "
Ms. Harris and other environmentalists also objected to the license for the first Watts Bar unit in the early 1990s .
But in 1995 , the NRC granted an operating license for Watts Bar Unit 1 -- the only new reactor added to America 's nuclear fleet in the past 25 years .
Other environmental groups that joined the petition to ask the NRC not to license Watts Bar Unit 2 include the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League , Sierra Club , Southern Alliance for Clean Energy , Tennessee Environmental Council , and We the People , Inc .
Edwin Lyman , senior staff scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists , said the risk to too great to license Watts Bar , in part , because of the vulnerability of its ice containment design .
Although used in nine other reactors including two at Sequoyah and the other Watts Bar reactor by TVA in Tennessee , Mr. Lyman said the risk from a hydrogen explosion within the reactor containment building is much greater than at other plants .
" There could be thousands of deaths from a major accident at Watts Bar II , " he said .
Mr. Lyman is expected to soon testify before an NRC judicial panel , known as the Atomic Safety and Licensing Panel , which will try to decide if the Watts Bar reactor should be licensed .
Mr. Bhatnagar said TVA is spending $ 230 million on additional equipment as part of its current construction project and he said the work originally done in the 1970s and 1980s is structural sound and well documented .
TVA estimates the Watts Bar Unit 2 reactor every year will avoid the emission of about 60 million metric tons of greenhouse emissions linked with global warming .
The second reactor at Watts Bar is the first commercial reactor in the country to seek a license since 1995 and could be the last reactor of its generation to be built .
By next summer through the end of 2011 , more than 2,500 workers will be employed on the project .
TVA began construction of Watts Bar in 1973 , but work was suspended in 1988 when TVA 's growth in power sales declined .
After mothballing the unit for 19 years , TVA 's board decided in 2007 to finish the reactor because it is projected to provide cheaper , no carbon - emitting power compared with the existing coal plants or purchased power it may help replace .
Love Land will include sculptures of naked humans , giant genitalia
China is building what is billed as its first sex theme park , aimed at improving both the sex education and the sex life of its visitors .
Due to open in Chongqing in October , Love Land will include displays of giant genitalia , naked bodies and an exhibition on the history of sex .
The park will also offer sex technique workshops and safe - sex methods .
Among the attractions is a giant rotating statue of the lower part of a nearly naked woman .
" Sex is a taboo subject in China but people really need to have more access to information about it , " the park 's manager , Lu Xiaoqing told the China Daily state newspaper .
" We are building the park for the good of the public .
I have found that the majority of people support my idea , but I have to pay attention and not make the park look vulgar and nasty . "
He was inspired to build the park after a visit to South Korea 's popular sex theme park in Jeju .
Critics say Love Land is a vulgar concept , and that the Chinese people are not ready to talk publicly about sex .
" These things are too exposed , " Liu Daiwei , a Chongqing policewoman , was quoted as saying by the China Daily .
" I will feel uncomfortable to look at them when other people are around . "
The NHL may have corrected their recipe for success , but their general managers and front office officials are still no better than a 1950s dad in the kitchen .
They have n’t learned from their predecessors ’ mistakes : bad and long contracts , no confidence in their young and upcoming stars , and foolish trades .
Alexei Yashin and Rick DiPietro have benefited from those front office mistakes .
But the Calgary Flames and Philadelphia Flyers could be the next teams to crumble under the pressure and make foolish blunders .
In 2001 , the New York Islanders signed Yashin to the longest contract in the history of the NHL at that time : 10 years for $ 87.5 million .
In 2006 , those same Islanders , but with a new general manager , one - upped themselves .
They signed DiPietro to a 15 - year $ 67.5 million contract .
Both contracts have worked out horribly for the Islanders and have not lead to success for the second - rate New York team .
There ’s a reason why other teams have not bought in to this strategy ; it ’s as bad an idea as betting your life savings on Heidi Montag ’s music career .
Those contracts are only part of the problem though .
Foolish moves , like the ones made by the Flyers and Flames on Friday and Saturday , respectively , are the other problem .
The Flyers desperate move
Looking to add intimidation to their defense , the Flyers made a gigantic trade during the 2009 NHL Draft on Friday .
They traded Joffrey Lupul , Luca Sbisa , a 2009 and 2010 first - round pick , and a conditional third - round pick in 2010 or 2011 for aging superstar Chris Pronger and prospect Ryan Dingle .
Trading for the 34 - year - old Pronger is not a bad move .
The Flyers need toughness and defensive help , and they did n’t have to give up any of their top young offensive stars .
However , how did the Flyers give up so much for one defenseman with one year left on his contract ?
Lupul is a decent second or third line winger who is becoming a solid two - way player .
Sbisa is a first - round draft pick and only 19 .
Including Lupul ( who was a first - round draft pick ) , the Flyers traded four first - round players for Pronger and a prospect .
Explain to me how that was a smart move ?
Maybe if the Flyers win the Stanley Cup next year , people can forgive ( not forget ) this trade .
Yes , Pronger has gotten better with age and become more of a scoring threat .
The fans in Philadelphia will love Pronger ’s physical play and hustle .
However , there ’s no way to believe he will lead the Flyers to a championship by himself .
He ’s not that type of player .
If the Detroit Red Wings and all their fire power and defensive stars could n’t stop the Pittsburgh Penguins , then one old defender wo n’t slow down Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin , let alone Alex Ovechkin .
This was a great short - term move , but a horrible franchise move .
The Flyers will regret this trade .
Trading a draft pick for a soon - to - be free agent
Very rarely do you a read about an interim general manager trading a soon - to - be free agent and a third - round draft pick for another soon - to - be free agent .
However , that was the case between the Florida Panthers and Calgary Flames .
The Panthers sent Jay Bouwmeester to the Flames for Jordan Leopold and a third - round pick .
Panthers interim GM Randy Sexton is getting much credit for trading Bouwmeester ( who was not even going to consider signing with Florida ) for a draft pick .
He turned a disappointing situation into a winner – something that does n’t happen often for the Panthers .
However , this may not be a win - win trade .
The Flames could have bumbled away a solid third - round pick if they ca n’t sign Bouwmeester to a long - term contract at a reasonable price .
Let ’s not forget that Vezina Trophy finalist Steve Mason and Norris Trophy winner Zdeno Chara were third - round picks .
Bouwmeester may be a young defenseman , but he has played in the league for the past six years .
His potential is limited .
He ’s an offensive defenseman with decent passing abilities .
His biggest knock is the fact he does n’t play much defense .
He has a career +/- of - 27 .
Most of that can be attributed to the terrible teams he has played on over the years , but in 2006 - 2007 , he had a +/- of +23 .
It makes you wonder if he ’s more concentrated on scoring than keeping the puck out of his own net ( the first and most important duty of a defenseman – hence the position name ) .
The other question for the Flames is if he will get time on the powerplay .
Bouwmeester has recorded 40 percent of his career points while playing with the man advantage .
His skill level could be even more hampered if the Flames keep Dion Phaneuf ( a more talented offensive defenseman ) on the powerplay .
With that said , the Flames did n’t risk much on trading for Bouwmeester and this trade was n’t as bad as the Flyers move .
If the Flames are able to keep Bouwmeester off the market and not overpay to retain his services , this might not be a bad move .
At the very least , it will reduce the stress for the front office of competing with other teams to sign him .
Still , teams have to value their players and moves .
I believe the Flames would have been front - runners in signing Bouwmeester in the offseason anyways – especially after their biggest offseason competitors , the Flyers , traded for Pronger .
NHL teams need to find a way to balance the short - term and long - term successfully .
They have to take risks but calculated risks that make sense for the franchise .
It ’s for the betterment of American hockey .
The sport cannot afford to have successful teams with a proud history carelessly throwing away their futures .
That goes against what the NHL is shooting to accomplish .

The Open Shortest Path First ( OSPF ) protocol , defined in RFC 2328 , is an Interior Gateway Protocol used to distribute routing information within a single Autonomous System .
The OSPF protocol is based on link - state technology , which is a departure from the Bellman - Ford vector based algorithms used in traditional Internet routing protocols such as RIP .
OSPF has introduced new concepts such as authentication of routing updates , Variable Length Subnet Masks ( VLSM ) , route summarization , and so forth .
An OSPF network can be divided into sub - domains called areas .
An area is a logical collection of OSPF networks , routers , and links that have the same area identification .
A router within an area must maintain a topological database for the area to which it belongs .
The router does n’t have detailed information about network topology outside of its area , thereby reducing the size of its database .
All areas in an OSPF autonomous system must be physically connected to the backbone area ( area 0 ) .
In some cases where this physical connection is not possible , you can use a virtual link to connect to the backbone through a non-backbone area .
You can also use virtual links to connect two parts of a partitioned backbone through a non-backbone area .
The area through which you configure the virtual link , known as a transit area , must have full routing information .
The transit area can not be a stub area .
Example :
Suppose to manage a network running an OSPF process .
The network has three areas : area0 ( the backbone ) , area2 and area3 .
The area0 has four networks :
1.0.0.0/24
1.0.1.0/24
1.0.2.0/24
1.0.3.0/24
The area2 has two networks :
2.0.0.0/24
2.0.1.0/24
The area3 is connected to the area0 via area2 and it has two networks :
3.0.0.0/24
3.0.1.0/24
In this example , we must configure three routers : Ciscozine1 , Ciscozine2 and Ciscozine3 .
Ciscozine1 belongs to Area0 and Area2 , Ciscozine2 belongs to Area2 .
Ciscozine3 belongs to Area2 and Area3 , but due to OSPF constraint ( all areas in an OSPF autonomous system must be physically connected to the backbone area ) , the Ciscozine3 router requires a Virtual - link .
Tips :
For convenience , the networks 1.0.0.0/22 and 3.0.0.0/23 will be defined using loopback interfaces .
To advertises the loopback subnet as the actual subnet configured on loopbacks , the “ ip ospf network point - to - point ” command is configured under loopbacks .
Router ID : It ’s a 32 - bit number assigned to each router running the OSPF protocol .
This number uniquely identifies the router within an Autonomous System .
RID is the highest logical ( loopback ) IP address configured on a router , if no logical / loopback IP address is set then the Router uses the highest IP address configured on its active interfaces .
In this example , to have more control , I have chose to define statically the RID using the “ router - id ” command
Below , the router configurations based on four steps :
Interface configuration Test connectivity OSPF configuration Virtual Link
The three ( partial ) router configurations :
Ciscozine1 # ! interface Loopback0 ip address 1.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip ospf network point - to - point !
interface Loopback1 ip address 1.0.1.1 255.255.255.0 ip ospf network point - to - point !
interface Loopback2 ip address 1.0.2.1 255.255.255.0 ip ospf network point - to - point !
interface Loopback3 ip address 1.0.3.1 255.255.255.0 ip ospf network point - to - point !
interface FastEthernet0/0 description Link - to- Ciscozine2 ip address 2.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 !
router ospf 1 router - id 1.0.0.1 area 2 virtual - link 3.0.0.1 network 1.0.0.0 0.0.3.255 area 0 network 2.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 2
Ciscozine2 # ! interface FastEthernet0/0 description Link - to - Ciscozine1 ip address 2.0.0.2 255.255.255.0 !
interface FastEthernet0/1 description Link - to- Ciscozine3 ip address 2.0.1.1 255.255.255.0 !
router ospf 1 router - id 2.0.0.2 network 2.0.0.0 0.0.1.255 area 2
Ciscozine3 # ! interface Loopback0 ip address 3.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip ospf network point - to - point !
interface Loopback1 ip address 3.0.1.1 255.255.255.0 ip ospf network point - to - point !
interface FastEthernet0/0 description Link - to- Ciscozine2 ip address 2.0.1.2 255.255.255.0 !
router ospf 1 router - id 3.0.0.1 area 2 virtual - link 1.0.0.1 network 2.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 2 network 3.0.0.0 0.0.1.255 area 3
Remember :
To display parameters about and the current state of OSPF virtual links , use the “ show ip ospf virtual - links ” command in EXEC mode .
Note :
You can also build a generic routing encapsulation ( GRE ) tunnel between two routers and put the tunnel in Area 0 .
The main differences between a GRE tunnel and a virtual link are :
GRE Tunnel Virtual Link
All traffic in the tunnel is encapsulated and decapsulated by the tunnel endpoints .
The routing updates are tunneled , but the data traffic is sent natively .
Tunnel headers in every packet cause overhead .
Data traffic is not subject to any tunnel overhead .
The tunnel can go through a stub area .
The transit area cannot be a stub area , because routers in the stub area do not have routes for external destinations .
Because data is sent natively , if a packet destined for an external destination is sent into a stub area which is also a transit area , then the packet is not routed correctly .
The routers in the stub area do not have routes for specific external destinations .

Four more cars were set ablaze overnight in San Francisco , bringing the number of arson attacks since this weekend to a dozen , authorities said Wednesday .
The fires have cut through a wide swath of the city , and vehicles of all types have been targeted , from a Volvo to a Ford F - 150 pickup .
No arrests have been made in the fires , which have all occurred late at night or before dawn .
Authorities do n't even know if the same person is responsible for all 12 .
The most recent fire happened about 3:25 a.m. Wednesday when a Honda was burned at La Playa and Balboa streets near Ocean Beach .
The blaze charred a vehicle parked behind it .
A Porsche and an Infiniti were found on fire at Francisco and Powell streets in North Beach at 2 a.m.
Another blaze happened at Newcomb Avenue and Selby Street in the Bayview about 11 p.m. Tuesday .
Wednesday 's fires came a day after someone burned three cars and tried to torch a fourth on streets off of Geary Boulevard .
Over the weekend and early Monday , there were four additional fires .
" It 's very upsetting .
We just hope it stops , " Jamie Tapia , 38 , said Wednesday , a day after her husband , who works with the state Employment Development Department , found his state - owned Chevrolet on fire near 48th Avenue and Geary Boulevard .
" It 's not fair , " Tapia said .
" Hopefully , the police can do something , catch the people responsible for doing this . "
The attacks are being investigated by an arson task force that includes San Francisco police and fire officials .
Police say there is no direct evidence linking all the incidents , despite a number of similarities .
The arsons come as authorities continue to investigate a series of portable - toilet fires that began late last year .
In some cases , the arsonist ignited outhouses with newspaper , authorities said .
In one of the car - related incidents early Tuesday , someone saw a burning newspaper under a Ford truck , kicked it away and doused the fire with a water bottle .
The use of newspapers as kindling is a clue , said Candice DeLong , a former FBI profiler and psychiatric nurse .
" If I had a series of arsons only being started by a newspaper , that would be something I would consider in developing a personality and lifestyle sketch - i.e. , a profile , " DeLong said .
Both the car and toilet fires are considered " nuisance arsons , " crimes that are typically committed by young people , DeLong said .
" They 're not a nuisance to the owners , but compared to seeing a forest fire or an apartment building on fire , the nuisance - fire offenders tend to be those who are more on the youthful side , say their late teens or early 20s , " DeLong said .
Arsonists typically strike in areas close to where they live or work , DeLong said .
It 's possible , but not likely , that the arsonist has something against cars , she said .
In 2005 , Caltech graduate physics student William Cottrell , then 24 , was convicted of a series of Los Angeles - area firebomb attacks of sportutility vehicles and car dealerships in the name of the Earth Liberation Front .
Investigators in the San Francisco fires will probably cast a wide net , she said .
" Could it be a homeless person ?
Yes , " DeLong said .
" Could it be an ecoterrorist ?
I suppose .
But I rather doubt it 's a hardened , middle - aged criminal . "
Catalina Perez , 54 , whose Volvo was one of two cars destroyed early Tuesday on Bertie Minor Lane in Japantown , figures " it 's either someone who 's a little crazy or kids that are out of control . "
" School 's out and they do n't have much to do , " Perez said .
" They 're completely unsupervised , if in fact it 's kids . "
Updated
As its custom - built file system strains under the weight of an online empire it was never designed to support , Google is brewing a replacement .
Apparently , this overhaul of the Google File System is already under test as part of the " Caffeine " infrastructure the company announced earlier this week .
In an interview with the Association for Computer Machinery ( ACM ) , Google 's Sean Quinlan says that nearly a decade after its arrival , the original Google File System ( GFS ) has done things he never thought it would do .
" Its staying power has been nothing short of remarkable given that Google 's operations have scaled orders of magnitude beyond anything the system had been designed to handle , while the application mix Google currently supports is not one that anyone could have possibly imagined back in the late 90s , " says Quinlan , who served as the GFS tech leader for two years and remains at Google as a principal engineer .
But GFS supports some applications better than others .
Designed for batch - oriented applications such as web crawling and indexing , it 's all wrong for applications like Gmail or YouTube , meant to serve data to the world 's population in near real - time .
" High sustained bandwidth is more important than low latency , " read the original GPS research paper .
" Most of our target applications place a premium on processing data in bulk at a high rate , while few have stringent response - time requirements for an individual read and write . "
But this has changed over the past ten years - to say the least - and though Google has worked to build its public - facing apps so that they minimize the shortcomings of GFS , Quinlan and company are now building a new file system from scratch .
With GFS , a master node oversees data spread across a series of distributed chunkservers .
Chunkservers , you see , store chunks of data .
They 're about 64 megabytes apiece .
The trouble - at least for applications that require low latency - is that there 's only one master .
" One GFS shortcoming that this immediately exposed had to do with the original single - master design , " Quinlan says .
" A single point of failure may not have been a disaster for batch - oriented applications , but it was certainly unacceptable for latency - sensitive applications , such as video serving . "
In the beginning , GFS even lacked an automatic failover scenario if the master went down .
You had to manually restore the master , and service vanished for up to an hour .
Automatic failover was later added , but even then , there was a noticeable service outage .
According to Quinlan , the lapse started out at several minutes and now it 's down to about 10 seconds .
Which is still too high .
" While these instances - where you have to provide for failover and error recovery - may have been acceptable in the batch situation , they 're definitely not OK from a latency point of view for a user - facing application , " Quinlan explains .
But even when the system is running well , there can be delays .
" There are places in the design where we 've tried to optimize for throughput by dumping thousands of operations into a queue and then just processing through them , " he continues .
" That leads to fine throughput , but it 's not great for latency .
You can easily get into situations where you might be stuck for seconds at a time in a queue just waiting to get to the head of the queue . "
GFS dovetails well with MapReduce , Google 's distributed data - crunching platform .
But it seems that Google has jumped through more than a few hoops to build BigTable , its ( near ) real - time distributed database .
And nowadays , BigTable is taking more of the load .
" Our user base has definitely migrated from being a MapReduce - based world to more of an interactive world that relies on things such as BigTable .
Gmail is an obvious example of that .
Videos are n't quite as bad where GFS is concerned because you get to stream data , meaning you can buffer .
Still , trying to build an interactive database on top of a file system that was designed from the start to support more batch - oriented operations has certainly proved to be a pain point . "
The Importance of Cash Flow Management
One of the things that can make you or break you financially is your skill at cash flow management .
For the purposes of personal finances and individual wealth management , your cash flow is the way money moves through your own small financial system .
It ’s the way your income flows into your bank accounts and then flows out to expenses and investments .
And what is left over .
Figuring out how your cash moves through your personal financial system is vital if you want to turn your money to better use , and if you want to be financially successful .
Figuring your cash flow
You will want to know whether your cash flow is positive , negative or zero .
With a positive cash flow , you will have a surplus at the end of the month .
With a negative cash flow , it will appear that you are overrunning your income — leading to excess debt and additional costs due to interest .
And , finally , zero cash flow means that your inflows and outflows are balanced .
( If you are into the zero - based budget , your goal is to reach zero cash flows . )
One of the easiest ways to figure your cash flow is to use a calculator .
However , you can also do it on your own .
First , add up your monthly income from all sources , including what you get from dividends or other income investing .
Pay attention to where you are getting your money from .
Next , add up all of your expenses .
This includes money that you put into savings , retirements accounts and other investments , and money that you give to charity or your church .
Catalog where your money is going .
There are many tools available in the market , some even online , that can help you understand and plan your income , expenses , debt and savings .
I like to take it a step further , and look at when I receive income and when expenses are due .
In cash flow management , when matters .
I found this out the hard way a couple of years ago .
Excited about a new client , I wrote a bunch of checks for bills , even though some of then were n’t due until the end of the month .
What I forgot to figure was that my mortgage payment came out automatically on the 15th .
And my mid-month income did n’t come until that day — and it takes three to four business days to get it from PayPal into my bank account .
As you might imagine , overdraft charges ensued ( no bounced checks , though ) .
$ 300 in bank charges taught me to schedule bill payments in a manner that matches up with when I am paid .
Tweaking your cash flow
After you have an idea of where you are at ( a calculator or personal finance software can provide it for you in all it ’s color - coded glory ) , it ’s time to tweak the way money moves through your personal financial system .
Look at your expenses .
As much as possible , they should be focused on things that will pay you back some how .
Examine your priorities to see what provides you a benefit .
If you enjoy eating out , but you are n’t that into watching TV , perhaps you should shift some of your resources toward eating out , and cut your cable package .
You should also examine where you can put more money into items that will pay you back down the road .
Being able to increase money outflows into investments are likely to repay you , justifying the expense .
Charitable giving provides intangible benefits such as a feeling of satisfaction from helping others or spiritual benefits ( for believers ) .
And besides , there ’s a tax benefit .
Thoughtfully arranging your spending so that you make the most of the money you have coming in can help you in the future .
Understanding how money moves through your personal financial system right now can help you cut back on waste , and help you create a realistic financial plan that can help you walk the path to financial freedom .
The president of Ireland 's largest trade union is calling for government action to prevent Irish banks hiking their mortgage interest rates .
Permanent TSB is planning to increase its standard variable rate by half a percentage point , blaming the high cost of funds , rising deposit rates and tight margins .
There is speculation that this might open the door for other banks to follow suit .
SIPTU president Jack O'Connor says the Government should take whatever action it can to block the move .
Mr O'Connor says these banks are being kept afloat by the Irish taxpayer and should not be allowed to engage in " immoral " behaviour that could further damage consumer confidence .
He says the Government should threaten to withdraw the State 's deposit guarantee from any bank that hikes interest rates .
Lockpicking and the Internet
Physical locks are n’t very good .
They keep the honest out , but any burglar worth his salt can pick the common door lock pretty quickly .
It used to be that most people did n’t know this .
Sure , we all watched television criminals and private detectives pick locks with an ease only found on television and thought it realistic , but somehow we still held onto the belief that our own locks kept us safe from intruders .
The Internet changed that .
First was the MIT Guide to Lockpicking , written by the late Bob ( “ Ted the Tool ” ) Baldwin .
Then came Matt Blaze ’s 2003 paper on breaking master key systems .
After that , came a flood of lock picking information on the Net : opening a bicycle lock with a Bic pen , key bumping , and more .
Many of these techniques were already known in both the criminal and locksmith communities .
The locksmiths tried to suppress the knowledge , believing their guildlike secrecy was better than openness .
But they ’ve lost :
Never has there been more public information about lock picking — or safecracking , for that matter .
Lock companies have responded with more complicated locks , and more complicated disinformation campaigns .
There seems to be a limit to how secure you can make a wholly mechanical lock , as well as a limit to how large and unwieldy a key the public will accept .
As a result , there is increasing interest in other lock technologies .
As a security technologist , I worry that if we do n’t fully understand these technologies and the new sorts of vulnerabilities they bring , we may be trading a flawed technology for an even worse one .
Electronic locks are vulnerable to attack , often in new and surprising ways .
Start with keypads , more and more common on house doors .
These have the benefit that you do n’t have to carry a physical key around , but there ’s the problem that you ca n’t give someone the key for a day and then take it away when that day is over .
As such , the security decays over time — the longer the keypad is in use , the more people know how to get in .
More complicated electronic keypads have a variety of options for dealing with this , but electronic keypads work only when the power is on , and battery - powered locks have their own failure modes .
Plus , far too many people never bother to change the default entry code .
Keypads have other security failures , as well .
I regularly see keypads where four of the 10 buttons are more worn than the other six .
They ’re worn from use , of course , and instead of 10,000 possible entry codes , I now have to try only 24 .
Fingerprint readers are another technology , but there are many known security problems with those .
And there are operational problems , too :
They ’re hard to use in the cold or with sweaty hands ; and leaving a key with a neighbor to let the plumber in starts having a spy-versus - spy feel .
Some companies are going even further .
Earlier this year , Schlage launched a series of locks that can be opened either by a key , a four - digit code , or the Internet .
That ’s right :
The lock is online .
You can send the lock SMS messages or talk to it via a Website , and the lock can send you messages when someone opens it — or even when someone tries to open it and fails .
Sounds nifty , but putting a lock on the Internet opens up a whole new set of problems , none of which we fully understand .
Even worse : Security is only as strong as the weakest link .
Schlage ’s system combines the inherent “ pickability ” of a physical lock , the new vulnerabilities of electronic keypads , and the hacking risk of online .
For most applications , that ’s simply too much risk .

CIA Documents Provide Little Cover for Cheney Claims
Created : August 24 , 2009 20:08 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Former Vice President Dick Cheney ( Associated Press )
For months , former Vice President Dick Cheney has said that two documents prepared by the CIA , one from 2004 and the other from 2005 , would refute critics of the Bush administration ’s torture program .
He told Fox ’s Sean Hannity in April :
“ I have n’t talked about it , but I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw , that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country , ” Cheney said .
“ I ’ve now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was . ”
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
Those documents were obtained today by The Washington Independent and are available here .
Strikingly , they provide little evidence for Cheney ’s claims that the “ enhanced interrogation ” program run by the CIA provided valuable information .
In fact , throughout both documents , many passages — though several are incomplete and circumstantial , actually suggest the opposite of Cheney ’s contention : that non-abusive techniques actually helped elicit some of the most important information the documents cite in defending the value of the CIA ’s interrogations .
The first document , issued by the CIA in July 2004 is about the interrogation of 9/11 architect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who was waterboarded 183 times in March 2003 and whom , the newly released CIA Inspector General report on torture details , had his children ’s lives threatened by an interrogator .
None of that abuse is referred to in the publicly released version of the July 2004 document .
Instead , we learn from the July 2004 document that not only did the man known as “ KSM ” largely provide intelligence about “ historical plots ” pulled off from al - Qaeda , a fair amount of the knowledge he imparted to his interrogators came from his “ rolodex ” — that is , what intelligence experts call “ pocket litter , ” or the telling documentation found on someone ’s person when captured .
As well , traditional intelligence work appears to have done wonders — including a fair amount of blundering on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ’s part :
In response to questions about [ al - Qaeda 's ] efforts to acquire [ weapons of mass destruction ] , [ Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ] revealed that he had met three individuals involved in [ al - Qaeda 's ] program to produce anthrax .
He appears to have calculated , incorrectly , that we had this information already , given that one of the three — Yazid Sufaat — had been in foreign custody for several months .
This is a far cry from torturing Khalid Sheikh Mohammed into revealing such information .
It would be tendentious to believe that the torture did n’t have any impact on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed — he himself said that he lied to interrogators in order to get the torture to stop — but the document itself does n’t attempt to present a case that the “ enhanced interrogation ” program was a factor , let alone the determinant factor , in the intelligence bounty the document says he provided .
The second newly released document — a June 2005 overview of information extracted from detainees — is , if anything , more caveated .
In making a case that “ detainee reporting ” was “ pivotal for the war against [ al - Qaeda ] , ” it says that “ detainee reporting is often incomplete or too general to lead directly to arrests ; instead , detainees provide critical pieces to the puzzle , which , when combined with other reporting , have helped direct an investigation ’s focus and led to the capture of terrorists . ”
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is the prime example here .
The document also discusses unraveling the network of Indonesian al - Qaeda affiliate Hambali after Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ’s capture .
There are repeated references to the value of “ debriefings , ” which the 2004 CIA inspector general ’s report says are distinct from the “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” but can be used after they occur .
For instance , “ Debriefings of mid-level [ al - Qaeda ] operatives also have reported on specific plots against U.S. interests . ”
Indeed , in a section titled “ Aiding Our Understanding [ al - Qaeda ] , ” a listed example is :
Abu Zubaydah ’s identification early in his detention of [ Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ] as the mastermind of 11 September and [ al - Qaeda 's ] premier terrorist planner and of ‘ Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri as another key [ al - Qaeda ] operational planner corroborated information [ REDACTED ] .
Those revelations , as former Abu Zubaydah interrogator Ali Soufan has testified , came before Abu Zubaydah was tortured .
Similarly , the document contains accounts of how interrogators performed the traditional interrogation labors of cross- checking detainees ’ accounts with each other to determine veracity , and particularly when cross- referenced with “ large volumes of documents and computer data ” :
For example , lists of names found on the computer [ REDACTED ] — a key [ al - Qaeda ] financial operative and facilitator for the 11 September attacks — seized in March 2003 represented [ al - Qaeda ] members who were to receive funds .
Debriefers questioned detainees extensively on the names to determine who they were and how important they were to the organization .
The information [ REDACTED ] helped us to better understand al - Qa’ida ’s hierarchy , revenues , and expenditures , [ REDACTED ] as well as funds that were available to families .
Again , perhaps the blacked - out lines of the memos specifically claim and document that torture and only torture yielded this information .
But what ’s released within them does not remotely make that case .
Cheney ’s public account of these documents have conflated the difference between information acquired from detainees , which the documents present , and information acquired from detainees through the* enhanced interrogation program * , which they do n’t .
In a statement , Tom Parker , the policy director of Amnesty International ’s American branch , said , “ Perhaps unsurprisingly , given Vice President Cheney ’s track record , the two CIA memos released today are hardly the slam dunk we had been led to expect .
There is little or no supporting evidence in either memo to give substance to the specific claims about impending attacks made by Khaled Shaik Mohammed in highly coercive circumstances . ”

The following editorial will be published in the September issue of PLoS Medicine but is being posted on this blog today to coincide with the availability on the PLoS Medicine site of the ghostwriting documents released after our intervention in the Prempro case , which we received last week .
They are posted in the form in which we received them and hence are not categorised .
Nonetheless , even for a casual reader , they are a compelling read .
We have also passed these documents to the Drug Industry Document Archive at UCSF who will be sorting and posting them on their site .
Other postings by Adriane Fugh Berman ( see here and here ) and by Andrew Hyde on this blog have discussed these documents .
We hope by making them freely available that they will be scrutinised in detail .
Our press release on the documents is available here .

Ghostwriting : The Dirty Little Secret of Medical Publishing That Just Got Bigger
The PLoS Medicine Editors
E-mail : medicine_editors@plos.org
The PLoS Medicine Editors are Virginia Barbour , Jocalyn Clark , Susan Jones , Larry Peiperl , Emma Veitch , and Gavin Yamey .
Provenance : Written by editorial staff ; not externally peer reviewed
If you are an editor , author , reviewer , or reader of medical journals , or if you depend on your doctor or health care provider getting unbiased information from medical journals , then the 1,500 documents now hosted on the PLoS Medicine Web site should make you very concerned and angry [ 1 ] .
Because , quite simply , the story told in these documents amounts to one of the most compelling expositions ever seen of the systematic manipulation and abuse of scholarly publishing by the pharmaceutical industry and its commercial partners in their attempt to influence the health care decisions of physicians and the general public .
Here ’s just one sample thread [ 2 ] that gives an idea of the topsy - turvy world invented by the pharmaceutical and medical writing companies involved .
While readers expect and assume that the named academic authors on a paper carried out the piece of work and then wrote up their article or review informed by their professional qualifications and expertise , instead we see a prime example of “ ghostwriting ” : a writing company was commissioned to produce a manuscript on a piece of research to fit the drug company ’s needs and then a person was identified to be the “ author ” :
An email from a writer employed by the medical writing company , DesignWrite , to employees of Wyeth , the company that performed the study , and Parthenon ( another medical writing company ) on November 10 , 2003 concerning manuscripts on Totelle ( a brand of hormone replacement therapy manufactured by Wyeth ) tells the story concisely .
[ our emphasis added ]
“ Thanks to all who have reviewed and approved the manuscripts …
I have received no word on authors for the Totelle 2 mg bone manuscript P3 ( 2 ) , and need input on this matter before this manuscript can move forward ” .
PLoS Medicine became involved in this particular ghostwriting story when we intervened in an ongoing court case in which women were suing Wyeth , the manufacturers of Prempro , a hormone replacement therapy .
During the discovery process for this case , one of the lawyers representing injured women in the litigation , Jim Szaller of Cleveland , Ohio , became aware of many documents that laid out in detail the company ’s ( mostly successful ) attempts to publish papers written by unacknowledged professional medical writers in which the message , tone , and content had been determined by the company but the paper was subsequently nominally “ authored ” by respected academics — in sum a coordinated and carefully monitored campaign of ghostwriting .
Our interest was not in the specific drugs , but in the issue of ghostwriting itself , a topic we have long been interested in and published on [ 3 –6 ]
The intervention , presented by lawyers from public interest law firm Public Justice ( http://www.publicjustice.net), and a similar one from the New York Times , was successful .
On July 24 , 2009 , US District Judge William R. Wilson , Jr. , in Little Rock , Arkansas , granted the Motions of the Interveners , and the similar Motion of the lawyers representing the women , to make the discovery materials public as of July 31 .
This is not the place to review everything written on this topic .
Others have written about ghostwriting campaigns concerning single drugs that have led to catastrophic health effects [ 7 ] , and how even research papers and clinical trials are affected by ghost authors [ 7,8 ] .
What ’s clear is that ghostwriting can no longer be considered one of the “ dirty little secrets ” of medical publishing that nothing can be done about .
While editors , medical schools , and universities have turned a blind eye to , or at the least failed to tackle head - on the pervasive presence of ghostwriting , drug companies and medical education and communication companies have built a vast and profitable ghostwriting industry .
Recruitment of academic “ authors ” appears , within some academic circles , to have come to be considered acceptable , and marketing campaigns are no longer orchestrated around paid display advertisements but instead center on “ evidence ” provided by seemingly respectable academic review articles , original research articles , and even reports of clinical trials .
What , a cynical reader might ask , can I truly trust as being unbiased ?
The answer is that , sadly , for some or even many journal articles , we just do n’t know .
So what can be done ?
The documents that have been made available are a substantial step forward in advancing knowledge of this practice and explaining the mechanics of how ghostwriting campaigns are organized , and will add to the evidence base .
By making them easily and openly accessible we hope that others will quickly delve into the documents and analyze them in detail ( we have yet not done so in the interest of speed in making them publicly available ) .
But we also hope that the papers not only will become the subject of academic scrutiny but will help to guide the way to identifying reforms that will eventually stamp ghostwriting out .
In an environment in which drug companies are beholden to their shareholders , and the drive for profit takes center stage , it is naïve to think that companies will put their own houses in order .
Over the past several years some journals and editors ’ organizations [ 9,10 ] , and even some individual medical writers [ 11 ] , have pursued what might be called a war of attrition against the practice by requiring contributorship statements for authors and publishing them , insisting on the naming of all who were involved in writing , requiring detailed competing interest statements , and detailing and publishing the provenance of non-research articles .
Editors ’ bodies such as the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( ICMJE ) expressly define criteria for authorship in biomedical publications [ 12 ] , and the World Association of Medical Editors ( WAME ) developed a specific policy on ghostwriting [ 10 ] initiated by commercial companies that calls the practice dishonest , unacceptable , and sanctionable .
But it seems that these tactics are simply not enough to prevent ghostwriting , and are being sidestepped by those involved .
Although medical writers can and do have a legitimate place in assisting in the preparation of manuscripts ( and , of course , academics and pharmaceutical companies can have legitimate and appropriate relations , and not all papers in this archive will have been written by ghost authors ) , attempting to hide the presence of ghostwriters or the involvement of writers beyond technical support , such as copyediting , is unacceptable .
We ’d argue , therefore , that all involved must adopt a much tougher approach of complete nontolerance to practices that aim to conceal authors or where the involvement of medical writers goes beyond technical support .
What might this mean in practice for journals ?
Primarily , it would mean a sea change in the thinking and behavior of editors , who should create — and be prepared to enforce — journal policies clarifying that involvement with ghostwriting is a serious and punishable breach of publication ethics .
Of course , prevention is key : possible measures could include requiring statements upon submission from academic authors about involvements by any company whose products are mentioned ( positively or negatively , directly or indirectly ) in the commissioning of a third party to provide editorial assistance , manuscript preparation , or submission of the paper .
But journal polices should also include enforceable sanctions .
For example , if nothing is declared on submission but inappropriate involvement of a medical writer subsequently comes to light , any papers where this breach is substantiated should be immediately retracted and those authors found to have not declared such interest should be banned from any subsequent publication in the journal and their misconduct reported to their institutions .
In the case of the documents deposited here , a good start , and a signal of the seriousness of journals ’ intent , would be the formal retraction of all the papers mentioned in which ghostwriting has been conclusively shown .
Institutions whose academics are shown to be involved should investigate as a matter of urgency .
It ’s time to get serious about tackling ghostwriting .
As has been shown in the documents released after the Vioxx scandal [ 7 ] , this practice can result in lasting injury and even deaths as a result of prescribers and patients being misinformed about risks .
Without action , the practice will undoubtedly continue .
How did we get to the point that falsifying the medical literature is acceptable ?
How did an industry whose products have contributed to astounding advances in global health over the past several decades come to accept such practices as the norm ?
Whatever the reasons , as the pipeline for new drugs dries up and companies increasingly scramble for an ever - diminishing proportion of the market in “ me -too ” drugs , the medical publishing and pharmaceutical industries and the medical academic community have become locked into a cycle of mutual dependency , in which truth and a lack of bias have come to be seen as optional extras .
Medical journal editors need to decide whether they want to roll over and just join the marketing departments of pharmaceutical companies .
Authors who put their names to such papers need to consider whether doing so is more important than having a medical literature that can be believed in .
Politicians need to consider the harm done by an environment that incites companies into insane races for profit rather than for medical need .
And companies need to consider whether the arms race they have started will in the end benefit anyone .
After all , even drug company employees get sick ; do they trust ghost authors ?

One morning in October 2006 a message caught my eye : " Check out the studio as we celebrate 100 days of EA Mythic . "
I did n't need much convincing .
A few days later , I spent an afternoon at the Fairfax , VA , developer to see what they were up to .
They showed me around , showered me with swag and treated me and a few other gaming journalists to an interactive demo of their latest project , Warhammer Online : Age of Reckoning .
As we toured the studio , we walked past the customer service room .
Before me were desks strewn with toys and fake weapons , rows of computer monitors with eclectic backgrounds and charismatic Gen Y nerds toiling in active digital worlds .
It seemed like a fascinating work environment and somewhere I would fit in .
Two years later , as Warhammer Online finally went live , that dimly lit hall of flickering screens would be my workplace - if only for a few months .
Switching Sides
In 2008 , after almost four years reviewing games and covering industry news and events , I lost my job .
In my search for new work , I came across a posting for QA / customer service jobs at Mythic Entertainment for Warhammer Online : Age of Reckoning .
I did n't have much of a technical background aside from being a lifelong gamer , but I had a few years of customer service experience , so I shot them a resume .
I heard back a month later and started at Mythic a week after that .
I initially thought it might be some type of call center job , but my supervisors explained that I would be working within the game itself .
The journalist in me thought it would be a fascinating look behind the curtain at a young MMOG .
The gamer in me thought it would be awesome to finally have the powers of a GM .
I would be like an agent in The Matrix .
Is it capitulation when Mexico , which faces an existential threat from drug cartels , decides to decriminalize drugs ?
Is it cynicism when California , which faces a budget crisis , considers legalizing and taxing marijuana ?
Quips are easy .
But the problems are complex , and we are about to get a look at the consequences , for good or bad , of what happens when governments relax their drug laws .
It is a moment for studied observation .
Mexico's new law decriminalizes small amounts of marijuana , cocaine , heroin , LSD and methamphetamine .
Those caught will be told to seek treatment the first two times ; treatment is mandatory the third time .
Under previous laws , possession could lead to long jail terms .
Treating drug abuse as a social and public - health problem rather than a law - enforcement issue is expected to free up prison space and resources to go after criminal drug cartels , according to Mexican officials .
It may seem contradictory to excuse the user while targeting suppliers .
But in Mexico , which has long supplied the U.S. market for illicit drugs , domestic consumption is a relatively new phenomenon .
According to government statistics , the number of addicts in Mexico has risen by more than 50 percent in six years .
Will Mexico's new policy result in more addicts seeking treatment , or will it create an atmosphere in which more people become addicts ?
Will Mexico provide the necessary treatment for the 300,000 to 465,000 addicts estimated to be in the country ?
Will this change in policy legitimize the drug cartels ?
Or help Mexico 's aggressive campaign against these criminal syndicates , which are responsible for more than 11,000 deaths since 2006 ?
Arizona 's shared border with Mexico also raises concerns about the impact on U.S. visitors to Mexico , particularly spring - break revelers .
Arizona 's western border offers the chance to observe another experiment in moving away from a law - and - order model for dealing with drug use .
In 1996 , California voters approved medical marijuana .
The needed prescription is a small fig leaf that covers a wide variety of " ailments . "
California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , a Democrat , proposes full legalization of marijuana for adult use , with regulation and taxation .
A tax of $ 50 per ounce is estimated to raise $ 1.3 billion annually .
According to one poll , 56 percent of California voters support such a plan .
There also are three initiative efforts in California to put marijuana - legalization measures before voters in November 2010 .
Again , there are more questions than answers .
Both California 's move toward legalization and Mexico 's experiment with decriminalization provide real - life laboratories for observing the effects of new approaches to drug use .
We 'll be watching .
Marsha Blackburn ( Oblivious - TN ) probably could have chosen a better example :
BLACKBURN : Let ’s agree that we ’re going to have PAYGO enforcement .
That we ’re not going to cry ‘ emergency ’ every time we have a Katrina , every time we have a Tsunami , every time we have a need for extra spending , that we do n’t go call for a special appropriation that allows us to circumvent the PAYGO rules .
Well , I 'm sure Blackburn will hold herself to that .
I 'm sure that any time a disaster threatens her state of Tennessee , she wo n't cry emergency and bother to get federal funding to help people in need .
I 'm sure that -
The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Tennessee and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms , tornadoes , and flooding on April 10 , 2009 .
Federal funding is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost - sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms , tornadoes , and flooding in Benton , McMinn , Rutherford , and Sequatchie Counties .
Well , OK , fine , but that 's the President , I 'm sure Marsha Blackburn HERSELF never requested emergency funding for her state of Tennessee --
Members of Tennessee Delegation Urge Disaster Declaration for Five Counties Affected by Flooding WASHINGTON , D.C. U.S. Senators Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) and Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) and U.S. Representatives Lincoln Davis ( D - Tenn. 4 ) , Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn. 6 ) , and Marsha Blackburn ( R - Tenn . 7 ) have joined Governor Phil Bredesen in requesting that Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack issue a federal disaster declaration for five counties in Tennessee " to help farmers who have suffered crop losses and damage to farm equipment and structures as a result of excessive rain and extensive flooding that occurred in May . "
The five counties are Bedford , Hickman , Lewis , Moore and Perry .
According to their letter to Secretary Vilsack , a declaration would allow qualifying farmers " to apply for a variety of federal farm disaster programs - including supplemental farm revenue payments , livestock assistance and low - interest emergency loans - through their local U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Farm Service Agency office . "
OK , one time , fine , but there 's no history of this ---
Title : Letter to The Honorable Mike Johanns , Secretary , U.S. Department of Agriculture Date : 07/12/2007 Alexander , Corker Join Tenn .
Delegation In Requesting Disaster Declaration For Drought from the Office of Senator Bob Corker U.S. Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker joined other members of the Tennessee Congressional Delegation Tuesday in asking U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to issue an agricultural disaster declaration for all 95 Tennessee counties due to the results of the ongoing drought .
Marsha Blackburn Member of congress
What 's your point ?
That Marsha Blackburn is a rank hypocrite whose statements do n't match her actions ?
Oh , that is your point ?
Well , OK , I agree with you , then .
There is a new brand of hybrid Chinese Supercar coming next year , the Tong Jian S11 , which looks totally ravishing and will please you optimally with its intense performance .
This is one of the most exotic looking cars from China that is all set to keep the Japanese market aside .
It is about to compete with the looks of Enzo Ferrari and Ferdinand Prosche .
This car model is however a figure skater and will set aside as a flame of light with its speedy mechanisms and high degree of performance .
This model is agile and very ace in design .
It is absolutely the car of the future that is going to go places .
There are a number of fashionable cars in the market but reviews say that in terms of function most do n’t meet their standards .
This is when a brand like this can step in and fill the gap .
The car already enjoys glaring reviews from critics .

The good judge smelled a rat .
“ Was there some sort of ghost that performed these actions ? ” New York federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff demanded to know Monday in rejecting a deal that would let Bank of America off the hook in yet another banker bonus scandal .
The Securities and Exchange Commission had charged the bank with covering up for outrageous bonuses given out at Merrill Lynch as the bank acquired the failed stockbrokerage , and now it was letting the bank off the hook with a chicken - feed fine .
“ Do Wall Street people expect to be paid large bonuses in years when their company lost $ 27 billion ? ” the judge asked , and Lewis J. Liman , the lawyer for Bank of America , assured him they do : “ My God ! Bonuses on Wall Street ?
It is not a matter of surprise . ”
But for those of us less sophisticated in the ways of Wall Street , it is a surprise that Merrill Lynch executives were rewarded for failure at the same time Bank of America was using $ 45 billion in taxpayer funds to take over the brokerage house .
Six hundred ninety - six executives who helped run Merrill into the ground were granted more than a million bucks each .
BofA lawyer Liman attempted to put an egalitarian spin on this government - sponsored welfare for the superrich by pointing out that all told , another 39,000 Merrill employees averaged only $ 91,000 in bonuses , but the judge was n’t having it : “ I ’m glad you think that $ 91,000 is not a lot of money ; I wish the average American was making $ 91,000 . ”
That ’s the point ; the average American is paying for the banking debacle not only in taxes for the bailout but with lost jobs and homes .
Yet the SEC , which is supposed to be protecting the ordinary citizen ’s interests , decided to give BofA execs a bye .
The question is why Bank of America and Merrill failed to inform their shareholders that such payoffs were part of the deal .
The details of the bonuses were known to BofA CEO Kenneth Lewis and other top bank executives but not mentioned in the merger agreement or proxy statements sent to the company ’s shareholders for approval .
The SEC complaint did accuse BofA of misleading its shareholders , but instead of digging deeply into how such decisions had been made and by whom , a deal was concocted in which BofA got off with a paltry $ 33 million fine .
That is less than the bonus received by one of the Merrill execs .
Yet the SEC deal would have closed the case on how that decision was made .
“ You filed a rather uninformative , bare - bones complaint , ” Judge Rakoff told SEC lawyer David Rosenfeld , who lamely defended the decision to avoid going after the bankers involved , and it is instructive of whose interest he was serving that “ [ t ] he lawyer for Bank of America periodically whispered what appeared to be suggestions to Mr. Rosenfeld , ” as a New York Times article put it .
Whispering between government regulators and the Wall Street honchos ostensibly being regulated is what got us into this mess in the first place .
The SEC looked the other way as the banking bandits piled on hundreds of billions in toxic holdings , and its lawyers evidently still do not get the message that they are not supposed to be facilitators of financial rip - offs .
Thankfully , at least one judge had the courage to challenge the rules of the game and at least delay its predictable outcome .
“ I would be less than candid if I did n’t express my continued misgivings about this settlement at this stage , ” Rakoff said .
“ When this settlement first came to me , it seemed to be lacking , for lack of a better word , transparency .
I did not know much about the facts from the complaint , I did not know much , or really anything , about the basis of the settlement . ”
He said that accepting the settlement “ would leave uncertain the truth of the very serious allegations made ” by the SEC and whether any of the bonus money was “ derived directly or indirectly from the $ 20 billion ” that BofA received from the government .
That is the only error the judge made ; the figure is actually $ 45 billion in government bailout funds for BofA and $ 118 billion more in public money to guarantee its toxic assets .
Given that enormous investment of taxpayer funds , and the trillions more put at risk because of the folly of those richly rewarded banking bonus babies , transparency would indeed seem to be required as the order of the day .
As Judge Rakoff concluded , Bank of America and Merrill Lynch had not only “ effectively lied to their shareholders ” but the money to finance their bonus scam had come “ from Uncle Sam . ”
Why has it been left to one stellar judge to sound the alarm , and why is Congress and the Obama administration looking the other way ?

What is 0 A.D. ?
0 A.D. is a free , cross-platform , under - development , 3D , historically - based , real - time strategy game .
What are you doing ?
Switching from a closed development process to open source : making the code available as GPL and the art content available as CC - BY - SA , and encouraging external contributions .
We 've been working on 0 A.D. in our free time for years , and now we want to show what we 've achieved and make it easier for more people to get involved .
0 A.D. is a very complex and ambitious project .
A lot of work has been put into it , but a lot remains to be done .
We 're not releasing a playable game – you 'll have to wait until much later if that 's what you 're interested in .
There are plenty of major missing features and bugs and rough edges .
We 're releasing this as a work - in - progress , pre-alpha project , aimed at developers who might be interested in this kind of thing , in the hope of sharing resources with a community that would otherwise be excluded from our development process .
This is an experimental step and we do n't quite know what 's going to work best , so we 're going to move carefully and try to adapt based on experience .
This document describes our current plans ; feedback will be appreciated !
Contact us on our forums , or # 0 ad on QuakeNet IRC .
Why should I care ?
We think there 's a good chance we can produce a pretty decent game with some unique features .
Maybe you want to help that game come into existence .
Maybe you want to learn from the experience of working on a complex software project , or particularly on a game .
There 's a wide range of areas involved : graphics and audio , AI and UI , file handling and gameplay scripting and networking and so on .
The basic framework is all in place , and some of it is already very solid , but there 's a lot of scope for diving into the details and working on various components .
Maybe you want to make the game work better on your favourite platform .
Maybe you want to show us how stupid we are and how you can write code that 's much better .
( We 're far from perfect ! )
Maybe you want to use parts of our code or art in your own project .
Maybe you want to use our game for teaching a practical game development class .
And maybe you have other reasons .
Why are you doing this ?
We 've been working on this game in some form or another since 2001 .
We 've come a long way since then , but making this kind of game is really quite hard .
The original team members were largely students , and have now moved on in life and can't devote much time to the project .
Attracting new developers is difficult and time - consuming – few people have the time and skill to learn how to work within our existing code and to make significant contributions .
So we want to lower the barriers to entry , making it easy for people to check out our project and see if it interests them , in the hope that some will decide it does .
Also , we have some ideas and tools and code that we think are quite nice and would like to share .
We ought to clean them up and document them properly so they 're more useful to other people , but making the code available is the first step .
And , particularly on Linux , open source simplifies a number of issues with distribution and debugging , so it makes things easier for us and for users .
Up until now , access to the project has been limited to ' official ' members of our group , though the intent has always been to produce a non-commercial game and membership has always been quite open .
The concept of open source simply was n't considered interesting a couple of years ago , but times have changed and it now seems the natural way to develop our project .
How is the development going to be organised ?
In opening this project , we need to respect the community by providing as much information and communication and support as possible , so you can benefit from participating in the project ( hopefully contributing back and benefiting us , of course ! ) , balanced with our desire to get the game completed to a high standard and with some constraints from our past organisation .
In the past , all developers have been part of the official ' team ' : anyone can apply to join , we 'll have a short interview over IRC to get to know them , and if it seems they have the time and energy and skill to contribute usefully then they 're made a member .
We 're going to keep the core group of developers and the private communication methods – we do n't want to risk destroying the team we 've already got .
We 're going to keep aiming towards a particular design vision , and we do n't want to diverge much from that – we'd rather not add ( and have to maintain ) features that are n't part of that goal .
We 're releasing the art and gameplay data for two of the game 's six civilisations , but holding back the work - in - progress civs until they are more complete and usable .
Apart from those restrictions , we 're opening access to the source control server ( Subversion ) , and the documentation and issue - tracking system ( Trac ) , and moving our technical discussions to an open forum .
Anyone can download , build and run the latest version of the game .
Our initial process for contributions will be very basic :
If you make some changes , you should create a patch and submit it to us , and we should then review it and maybe suggest some changes or commit it to SVN .
Licensing of contributions is an open question .
On one hand , accepting GPL code would guarantee to contributors that we 're not going to unfairly use their work .
On the other hand we'd like to keep our options open by only accepting BSD - licensed code , perhaps to produce a special version linked with proprietary cheat - detection software to discourage multiplayer map hacks that would be trivial to add to an open - source game , or to link with proprietary digital distribution systems to get more widespread distribution .
The ideal solution is not clear , so we'd be interested in discussion of this issue .
What is the code like ?
There 's roughly 150K lines of C++ for the game engine , and another 25 K for editing tools .
Gameplay scripting uses JavaScript .
We build on top of low - level libraries ( OpenGL , OpenAL , ENet , ... ) , not an existing game engine ( like OGRE ) .
The code is n't all extremely clean or extremely modular or extremely well - written .
It 's been written by a wide variety of programmers , and it's far from a " completed " codebase .
We want to continue cleaning things up as part of the normal development process .
We 're not averse to rewriting entire subsystems if that 's the most effective way to make them satisfy our requirements .
But in many areas it 's quite solid .
What reusable code is there ?
Most of our code is specific to the game and not very useful outside it , but some parts could perhaps be interesting for developers working on other projects .
Some examples :
Low - level library providing cross-platform support for resource management ( archive file loading , GL textures and shaders , ... ) , debugging tools ( error reporting , memory tracking , stack dumps ) , timers , asynchronous IO , allocators , ...
) , debugging tools ( error reporting , memory tracking , stack dumps ) , timers , asynchronous IO , allocators , ... Converter from COLLADA models with skeletal animation into a simple game - friendly format .
Binary XML caching system , for faster resource loading .
Automated build tools using Amazon EC2 .
Boring maths code for matrices , vectors , quaternions , etc .
How does this compare to other games ?
We are aware of several other open - source RTS games .
Glest has reached ' stable ' status and is set in a medieval / fantasy world , with less complex gameplay and graphics but with AI opponents ( which are not yet implemented in 0 A.D. ) .
ORTS is a framework emphasizing AI research more than a playable game .
Spring is another RTS engine that appears designed for gameplay similar to Total Annihilation .
0 A.D. is striving to differentiate itself by providing new gameplay ideas , detailed graphics and an an accurate historical setting .
How can I get started ?
See the Getting Started guide to find more information about the game , forums for discussion , instructions for building and running the game , and links to further details .

However , this comes at a cost .
I do n't like biting my tongue continuously .
I have strong opinions on a number of subjects — including politics — and what use is a soapbox if I can't use it from time to time ?
There are some folks I can do without , mind you .
( If you 're a BNP member or voter you can fuck off right now .
I do n't care if you do n't buy my books ; I do n't want your bloody money . )
This blog is not only my personal soapbox , it 's my public face .
Folks who read what I post here may or may not thereafter buy my books .
Consequently , these days I try to avoid writing about stuff that is likely to be controversial .
Call it the chilling effect of capitalism ; I can say what I want if and only if I 'm willing to do without that portion of my book royalties that comes from the folks I piss off .
This brings me to my topic of the day : mercy , and the lack of it .
I 've been suppressing the urge to explode angrily ever since Thursday , when Abdelbaset Al Megrahi was officially released from prison and flown home to Libya .
His release — on compassionate grounds , as he is suffering from terminal cancer and has weeks to live .
Mr Al Megrahi was serving a life sentence , handed down by a rather oddly constituted Scottish court for his part in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 — the biggest aviation disaster ever in British airspace , and one of the biggest acts of terrorism of that decade .
What am I angry about ?
Let 's leave aside the fact that many people ( including the UN observer at the trial ) consider Al Megrahi 's conviction to be a serious miscarriage of justice .
( The allegations of fabricated evidence should to be taken seriously ; the Flight 103 investigation took place in the middle of a very chilly period in US / Libyan relations , and we have seen since then that the CIA is a pliant tool in the hands of those who want to fabricate evidence justifying action against uncooperative Middle Eastern nations .
The CIA is an intelligence and covert operations agency under political direction , not an independent investigatory / detective bureau ; its emissions should be considered with the utmost skepticism . )
What makes me angry ...
Well , to start with it 's worth noting that the loudest denunciations came from the White House — an entity with no legal standing whatsoever in the Scottish judicial system .
But we expect external interference from the White House : it 's what the Imperial Presidency is there for .
What bugs me is the complete lack of comprehension of the quality of mercy that seems to have crept over the US political class this century .
Even if Al Megrahi is a mass - murderer , the fact remains that he is dying .
It is long - standing policy in Scotland to exercise the prerogative of mercy when possible ; in general , if an imprisoned criminal is terminally ill , a request for release ( for hospice care , basically ) is usually granted unless they are believed to be a danger to the public .
That 's because the justice system is n't solely about punishment .
It 's about respect for the greater good of society , which is better served by rehabilitation and reconcilliation than by revenge .
We do not make ourselves better people by exercising a gruesome revenge on the bodies of our vanquished foes .
Kenny MacAskill , the Justice Minister , did exactly the right thing in sending Al Megrahi home to die .
Meanwhile , the angry spectators who 're throwing scat come from a country where prison rape is endemic and tolerated to the point where it's a subject for cheap jokes .
American attitudes to crime and punishment are unspeakable ; disturbing , mediaeval , and barbaric are some of the adjectives that spring to mind .
But above all , the word that most thoroughly applies is merciless .
The commission of a crime is taken as an excuse to unleash the demons of the subconscious , however dark , however disproportionate , upon the perpetrator .
Once labeled a criminal , an individual 's right to fair treatment is utterly expunged , and any violation or degradation , however grotesque , is seen as something that they brought on themselves .
Why ?
Well , let 's pan across the political landscape and look at another current cause celebre that provides a window into the darker corners of the American psyche ; the issue of healthcare reform .
I 've been watching the war of words with increasing disbelief for the past month , trying to get my head around the reason why so many loud , vocal citizens seem to be so adamantly opposed to something that 's in their own best interests — the US healthcare system is utterly dysfunctional , even for those with health insurance costs are spiraling out of control , and the current system is becoming a major drag on economic productivity — many business start - ups abort because the founders can't obtain healthcare , many novelists of my acquaintance are in serious financial trouble or are terrified of giving up the day job ( that comes with insurance ) , and so on .
The current mess is responsible for 22,000 avoidable deaths per year — a 9/11 scale catastrophe every six weeks .
And yet we hear rhetoric about death panels , idiotic allegations that Stephen Hawking would be dead if he lived in the UK and was dependent on the NHS ( this just in : Stephen Hawking is British and , er , alive because of the NHS ) , and so on .
What 's going on ?
What 's noticable is that the " debate " is n't about the need for healthcare , or about actual medical issues .
It 's about ideology , and outlook ...
Near as I can work it out from over here ( caveat : I 've spent somewhere between four and eight months of my life in the USA — this does n't make me an expert ) there is a small but significant proportion of the US population who hate the poor and want them to die .
( Or at least to go somewhere where they 're invisible and can't act as a perpetual reminder to the haters that their own security is at best tenuous . )
I 'm not sure why there 's this hatred — my personal feeling is that it springs from numerous sources : from prosperity theology ( if you 're poor it 's because you 're ungodly and deserve to suffer ) , insecurity , lack of empathy , or a combination of these factors in different people .
Other observers have different theories : M'Learned Friend opines that it's because the American conservative movement rejects Rawls 's preconditions for justice .
( That does n't go far enough for my taste ; they also seem to want to reject the entire concept of the Social Contract . )
And then there 's the growing tendency towards eliminationist rhetoric against socially sanctioned out - groups .
( Arguably the endorsement of maltreatment of convicts is an emergent part of this trend , feeding into and normalising it . ) .
The subjects vary — crime and penal policy , healthcare , do n't get me started on foreign policy — but there is an ideological approach in America that is distinguished by one common characteristic : words and deeds utterly lacking in the quality of mercy .
There is a cancer in the collective American soul — a mercy deficit that has in recent years grown as alarmingly as the budget deficit .
Nor is it as simple as a left / right thing : no political party has a monopoly on merciless behaviour .
Rather , a creeping draconian absolutism has cast its penumbra across the entire arena of public discourse , tainting every debate , poisoning and hardening attitudes across the board .
Calls for revenge on a sick and dying man are part and parcel of the pathology , as are shrieks of outrage against the mere idea of subsidizing healthcare for the indigent or unlucky , or rough talk about " every now and again ... pick[ing ] up a crappy little country and throwing it against the wall just to prove we are serious " .
Mercy , it would seem , is a scarce commodity in the Empire .
Are you ashamed yet ?
If not , you 're part of the problem .
( And by the way , I do n't want your money . )
Suck it up , conspiracy theorists , because soon your cuckoo stories about the US simulating the Moon landings will be over forever .
NASA has confirmed to Gizmodo that the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will take photos of all the Apollo landing sites :

Jesus Diaz : Would the LRO return images of the moon landings when it flies over them ?
Grey Hautaluoma ( NASA Headquarters , Office of Public Affairs ) : Yes , it will .
We do n't have a timeline yet for viewing the Apollo sites , but it will be in the near future .
There you have it .
Soon we will have photos showing the remains of the Apollo Lunar Modules , also known as LEM ( Lunar Excursion Module . )
Built by Grumman Aircraft Engineering , the Lunar Module was 20.9 - foot tall , with a 14 feet diameter and a landing gear span of 29.75 feet .

However , the Lunar Reconnoissance Orbiter will only be able to take photos of what is known as the Descent Stage , the bottom part of the LEM that housed the main propulsion system .
This part was left on the Moon 's surface , while the Ascent Stage launched after each mission to rendezvous with the Command Module orbiting around the Moon .
Other remains left on the Moon include the Lunar Roving Vehicles , used in the Apollo J- class missions : Apollo 15 , Apollo 16 , and Apollo 17 .
Since they are 3 - meter long , the LRO will be able to distinguish them as well .

Earlier this month , Grzebik Design completed work on what they are calling the " world 's largest solar powered loudspeaker system " in the Taiwan National Stadium in Kaohsiung .
It is capable of cranking out 105 dB of sound to 40,000 spectators .
The Taiwan National Stadium makes use of 60 distributed Apogee Sound AE - 7SX weather - resistant loudspeakers for primary seating area coverage , 12 Apogee Sound ALA - 5WSX weather resistant Acoustic Linear Array loudspeakers provides field coverage , and 2 Apogee Sound AFI - 205 and two AFI - Point5 loudspeakers provide Control Room audio monitoring .
The 76 loudspeakers are powered by 52 Peavey Electronics model PV2600 and 3 model PV1500 power amplifiers .
Additional signal processing equipment includes Apogee Sound loudspeaker controllers , Symetrix SymNet Digital Signal Processing equipment , an Altair 48 - channel mixing desk , Tascam CD , DVD and cassette players , Peavey Electronics , microphones , and CUE Touch Panel Controllers , all wired together with 9,500 meters ( 5.5 miles ) of Klotz Cable .

Naturally , going 100 % solar with an installation like this requires a buttload of green tech :
The ultra-modern $ 5 billion Taiwan National Stadium , designed by renowned Japanese architect Toyo Ito , and constructed for the 2009 World Games , features a stunning 14,155 square meter roof incorporating 8,844 solar panels , which emulates the form of a flowing river , and generates 1.14 million KWh annually preventing the release of 660 tons - per-annum of atmospheric carbon dioxide .
On days when the Taiwan National Stadium is not in use , the electricity generated from its roof is fed back the city 's electrical grid where it will meet almost 80 % of the area 's energy requirements .

Indeed , if you look at the images of the roof , it seems to be completely covered in " a flowing river " of solar panels .

A Net Assessment Re-examined
Despite the rhetoric , the Iranian nuclear program was far from producing a deliverable weapon , although a test explosion within a few years was a distinct possibility .
Iran essentially was isolated in the international community , with major powers ' feelings toward Tehran ranging from hostile to indifferent .
Again , rhetoric aside , this led Iran to a cautious foreign policy designed to avoid triggering hostility .
Russia was the most likely supporter of Iran , but Moscow would avoid becoming overly involved out of fears of the U.S. reaction , of uniting a fractious Europe with the United States and of being drawn into a literally explosive situation .
The Russians , we felt , would fish in troubled waters , but would not change the regional calculus .
Potential Russian Responses to Washington
The Strait of Hormuz : Iran 's Real Nuclear Option
The Russian Existential Counter
For the past several weeks , STRATFOR has focused on therelationship between Russia and Iran .
As our readers will recall , a pro-Rafsanjani demonstration that sawchants of " Death to Russia , " uncommon in Iran since the 1979 revolution , triggered our discussion .
It caused us to rethink Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's visit to Russia just four days after Iran 's disputed June 12 presidential election , with large - scale demonstrations occurring in Tehran .
At the time , we ascribed Ahmadinejad 's trip as an attempt to signal his lack of concern at the postelection unrest .
But why did a pro-Rafsanjani crowd chant " Death to Russia ? "
What had the Russians done to trigger the bitter reaction from the anti-Ahmadinejad faction ?
Was the Iranian president 's trip as innocent as it first looked ?
At STRATFOR , we proceed with what we call a " net assessment , " a broad model intended to explain the behavior of all players in a game .
Our net assessment of Iran had the following three components :
This view — in short , that Iran was contained — remained our view for about three years .
It served us well in predicting , for example , that neither the United States nor Israel would strike Iran , and that the Russians would not transfer strategically significant weapons to Iran .
A net assessment is a hypothesis that must be continually tested against intelligence , however .
The " Death to Russia " chant could not be ignored , nor could Ahmadinejad 's trip to Moscow .
As we probed deeper , we found that Iran was swirling with rumors concerning Moscow 's relationship with both Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Little could be drawn from the rumors .
Iran today is a hothouse for growing rumors , and all our searches ended in dead ends .
But then , if Ahmadinejad and Khamenei were engaging the Russians in this atmosphere , we would expect rumors and dead ends .
Interestingly , the rumors were consistent that Ahmadinejad and Khamenei wanted a closer relationship to Russia , but diverged on the Russian response .
Some said the Russians already had assisted the Iranians by providing intelligence ranging from Israeli networks in Lebanon to details of U.S. and British plans to destabilize Iran through a " Green Revolution " like the color revolutions that had ripped through the former Soviet Union ( FSU ) .
Equally interesting were our Russian sources ' responses .
Normally , they are happy to talk , if only to try to mislead us .
( Our Russian sources are nothing if not voluble . )
But when approached about Moscow 's thinking on Iran , they went silent ; this silence stood out .
Normally , our sources would happily speculate — but on this subject , there was no speculation .
And the disciplined silence was universal .
This indicated that those who did n't know did n't want to touch the subject , and that those who did know were keeping secrets .
None of this proved anything , but taken together , it caused us to put our net assessment for Iran on hold .
We could no longer take any theory for granted .
All of the foregoing must be considered in the context of the current geopolitical system .
And that is a matter of understanding what is in plain sight .
TheU.S. - Russian summit that took place after the Iranian elections did not go well .
U.S. President Barack Obama 's attempt to divide Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Putin did not bear fruit .
The Russians were far more interested in whether Obama would change the FSU policy of former U.S. President George W. Bush .
At the very least , the Russians wanted the Americans to stop supporting Ukraine 's and Georgia 's pro-Western tendencies .
But not only did Obama stick with the Bush policy , he dispatched U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to visit Ukraine and Georgia to drive home the continuity .
This was followed by Biden 's interview with The Wall Street Journal , in which he essentially said the United States does not have to worry about Russia in the long run because Russia 's economic and demographic problems will undermine its power .
Biden 's statements were completely consistent with the decision to send him to Georgia and Ukraine , so the Obama administration 's attempts to back away from the statement were not convincing .
Certainly , the Russians were not convinced .
The only conclusion the Russians could draw was that the United States regards them as a geopolitical cripple of little consequence .
If the Russians allow the Americans to poach in what Moscow regards as its sphere of influence without responding , the Russian position throughout the FSU would begin to unravel — the precise outcome the Americans hope for .
So Moscow took two steps .
First , Moscow heated up the military situation near Georgia on the anniversary of the first war , shifting its posture and rhetoric and causing the Georgians to warn of impending conflict .
Second , Moscow increased its strategic assertiveness , escalating the tempo of Russian air operations near the United Kingdom and Alaska , and more important , deploying two Akula - class hunter - killer submarines along the East Coast of the United States .
The latter is interesting , but ultimately unimportant .
Increased tensions in Georgia are indeed significant , however , since the Russians have decisive power in that arena — and can act if they wish against the country , one Biden just visited to express American support .
But even a Russian move against Georgia would not be decisive .
The Americans have stated that Russia is not a country to be taken seriously , and that Washington will therefore continue to disregard Russian interests in the FSU .
In other words , the Americans were threateningfundamental Russian interests .
The Russians must respond , or by default , they would be accepting the American analysis of the situation — and by extension , so would the rest of the world .
Obama had backed the Russians into a corner .
When we look at the geopolitical chessboard , there are two places where the Russians could really hurt the Americans .
One is Germany .
If Moscow could leverage Germany out of the Western alliance , this would be a geopolitical shift of the first order .
Moscow has leverage with Berlin , as the Germans depend on Russian natural gas , and the two have recently been working on linking their economies even further .
Moreover , the Germans are as uneasy with Obama as they were with Bush .
German and American interests no longer mesh neatly .
The Russians have been courting the Germans , but a strategic shift in Germany 's position is simply not likely in any time frame that matters to the Russians at this juncture — though the leaders of the two countries are meeting once again this week in Sochi , Russia , their second meeting in as many months .
The secondpoint where the Russians could hurt the Americans is in Iran .
An isolated Iran is not a concern .
An Iran with a strong relationship to Russia is a very different matter .
Not only would sanctions be rendered completely meaningless , but Iran could pose profound strategic problems for the United States , potentially closing off airstrike options on Iranian nuclear facilities .
The real nuclear option for Iran does not involve nuclear weapons .
It would involve mining the Strait of Hormuz and the narrow navigational channels that make up the Persian Gulf .
During the 1980s , when Iran and Iraq were at war , both sides attacked oil tankers in the Persian Gulf .
This raised havoc on oil prices and insurance rates .
If the Iranians were to successfully mine these waters , the disruption to 40 percent of the world 's oil flow would be immediate and dramatic .
The nastiest part of the equation would be that in mine warfare , it is very hard to know when all the mines have been cleared .
It is the risk , not the explosions , which causes insurance companies to withdraw insurance on vastly expensive tankers and their loads .
It is insurance that allows the oil to flow .
Just how many mines
Iran might lay before being detected and bringing an American military response could vary by a great deal , but there is certainly the chance that Iran could lay a significant number of mines , including more modern influence mines that can take longer to clear .
The estimates and calculations of minesweepers — much less of the insurers — would depend on a number of factors not available to us here .
But there is the possibility that the strait could be effectively closed to supertankers for a considerable period .
The effect on oil prices would be severe ; it is not difficult to imagine this aborting the global recovery .
Iran would not want this outcome .
Tehran , too , would be greatly affected by the economic fallout ( while Iran is a net exporter of crude , it is a net importer of gasoline ) , and the mining would drive the Europeans and Americans together .
The economic and military consequences of this would be severe .
But it is this threat that has given pause to American and Israeli military planners gaming out scenarios to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities .
There are thousands of small watercraft along Iran 's coast , and Iran 's response to such raids might well be to use these vessels to strew mines in the Persian Gulf — or for swarming and perhaps even suicide attacks .
Notably , any decision to attack Iran 's nuclear facilities would have to be preceded by ( among other things ) an attempt to neutralize Iran 's mine - laying capability — along with its many anti-ship missile batteries — in the Persian Gulf .
The sequence is fixed , since the moment the nuclear sites are bombed , it would have to be assumed that the minelayers would go to work , and they would work as quickly as they could .
Were anything else attacked first , taking out the Iranian mine capability would be difficult , as Iran 's naval assets would scatter and lay mines wherever and however they could — including by swarms of speedboats capable of carrying a mine or two apiece and almost impossible to engage with airpower .
This , incidentally , is a leading reason why Israel cannot unilaterally attack Iran 's nuclear facilities .
They would be held responsible for a potentially disastrous oil shortage .
Only the Americans have the resources to even consider dealing with the potential Iranian response , because only the Americans have the possibility of keeping Persian Gulf shipping open once the shooting starts .
It also indicates that an attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities would be much more complex than a sudden strike completed in one day .
The United States cannot permit the Iranians to lay the mines .
The Iranians in turn cannot permit the United States to destroy their mine - laying capability .
This is the balance of power that limits both sides .
If Iran were to act , the U.S. response would be severe .
If the United States moves to neutralize Iran , the Iranians would have to push the mines out fast .
For both sides , the risks of threatening the fundamental interests of the other side are too high .
Both Iran and the United States have worked to avoid this real " nuclear " option .
The Russians see themselves facing an existential threat from the Americans .
Whether Washington agrees with Biden or not , this is the stated American view of Russia , and by itself it poses an existential threat to Russia .
The Russians need an existential counterthreat — and for the United States , that threat relates to oil .
If the Russians could seriously threaten the supply of oil through the Strait of Hormuz , the United States would lose its relatively risk - free position in the FSU .
It follows from this that strengthening Iran 's ability to threaten the flow of oil , while retaining a degree of Russian control over Iran 's ability to pull the trigger , would give Russia the counter it needs to American actions in the FSU .
The transfer of more advanced mines and mining systems to Iran — such as mines that can be planted now and activated remotely ( though most such mines can only lay , planted and unarmed , for a limited period ) to more discriminating and difficult - to - sweep types of mines — would create a situation the Americans could neither suppress nor live with .
As long as the Russians could maintain covert control of the trigger , Moscow could place the United States , and the West 's economies , in check .
Significantly , while this would wreak havoc on Persian Gulf producers and global oil consumers at a time when they are highly vulnerable to economic fluctuations , a spike in the price of oil would not hurt Russia .
On the contrary , Russia is an energy exporter , making it one of the few winners under this scenario .
That means the Russians can afford much greater risks in this game .
We do not know that the Russians have all this in mind .
This is speculation , not a net assessment .
We note that if Russo - Iranian contacts are real , they would have begun well before the Iranian elections and the summit .
But the American view on Russia is not new and was no secret .
Therefore , the Russians could have been preparing their counter for a while .
We also do not know that the Iranians support this Russian move .
Iranian distrust of Russia runs deep , and so far only the faction supporting Ahmadinejad appears to be playing this game .
But the more the United States endorses what it calls Iranian reformists , and supports Rafsanjani 's position , the more Ahmadinejad needs the Russian counter .
And whatever hesitations the Russians might have had in moving closer to the Iranians , recent events have clearly created a sense in Moscow of being under attack .
The Russians think politically .
TheRussians play chess , and the U.S. move to create pressure in the FSU must be countered somewhere .
In intelligence , you must take bits and pieces and analyze them in the context of the pressures and constraints the various actors face .
You know what you do n't know , but you still must build a picture of the world based on incomplete data .
At a certain point , you become confident in your intelligence and analysis and you lock it into what STRATFOR calls its net assessment .
We have not arrived at a new net assessment by any means .
Endless facts could overthrow our hypothesis .
But at a certain point , on important matters we feel compelled to reveal our hypothesis not because we are convinced , but simply because it is sufficiently plausible to us — and the situation sufficiently important — that we feel we should share it with the appropriate caveats .
In this case , the stakes are very high , and the hypothesis sufficiently plausible that it is worth sharing .
The geopolitical chessboard is shifting , though many of the pieces are invisible .
The end may look very different than this , but if it winds up looking this way , it is certainly worth noting .
Archeologists find 20,000 - year - old hearth in Taitung
EARLIEST HUMAN RELIC
The stone hearth unearthed at the Baisandong Historical Site proves that humans have been living in Taiwan for more than 20,000 years
STAFF WRITER , WITH CNA
A team from Academia Sinica has recently discovered a neolithic stone hearth in a cave in Taitung County that has been confirmed as the earliest human relic to have been discovered in Taiwan , Taitung County Government said yesterday .
After a year of investigation and research , the prehistoric archeology research team discovered the hearth at the Basiandong ( Eight Deities ) Historical Site ( 八仙洞遺址 ) , which carbon - dating reveals to be 20,000 years old , an official with the county ’s Cultural and Tourism Bureau said .
“ The sample proves that humans were living in Taiwan more than 20,000 years ago , ” the official quoted Tsang Chen - hua ( 臧振華 ) , deputy director of Academia Sinica ’s Institute of History and Philology , who led the research team , as saying .
In addition to the fire place , the research team also discovered seven new caves , bringing the number of caves discovered at the Basiandong Historical Site to 24 , the Taitung official said .
Taitung Cultural and Tourism Bureau said the Basiandong site attracted the attention of Japanese archeologists during the colonial period and they explored the main cave , located in a coastal cliff area in the county ’s Changbin Township ( 長濱 ) .
Between 1968 and 1969 , a National Taiwan University archeology team led by professor Sung Wen-hsun ( 宋文薰 ) worked on the Basiandong Historical Site again , discovering four samples that were later carbon dated as being between 5,000 and 15,000 years old .
To verify the dates of the relics , the Council for Cultural Planning and Development asked Academia Sinica to conduct a new round of research .
“ The discoveries by Tsang and his team are tremendously important in terms of Taiwan ’s neolithic archeological research , ” the official said .

Jafar Husain shows an interesting technique : using LINQ to generate code at runtime .
While I think this is a cool idea , I think he missed a trick that could have taken it a step further .
The main problem I have with the example is that the code is harder to read than it needs to be .
It took me a little while to work out what was going on .
I 'll talk through what he 's doing , and then show how I think we can tweak it to get a little more out of LINQ .
This change might make it more readable , although that 's probably a contentious claim .
( By the way , the original article is called LINQ to Code , although that sounds backwards to me : the convention seems to be that with phrases of the form LINQ to X , X is usually the source data type .
That would make the original example a case of LINQ to Reflection .
However , the code generation technique is the more interesting part , so I guess the title is just poetic license . )
How Jafar Husain's Example Works
The goal of the example is to use reflection to drive the generation of code that performs deserialization .
This is n't a new idea : as he says , the example deliberately imitates the .NET XmlSerializer model .
However , the example uses two features from LINQ to achieve its goal , and shows that LINQ can make this kind of thing much easier .
The first trick is to use the new query syntax in C# 3.0 to work with the information provided by the reflection API .
This illustrates that you can use these query features of LINQ against any bunch of objects whose collections implement IEnumerable .
( E.g. , in this particular case we 're just querying a plain old array of Property Info objects . )
Here 's a simplified version of Husain 's code to illustrate the idea :
var props = from property in typeof ( T ) . GetProperties ( ) let attributes = property .
GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( FieldRangeAttribute ) , true ) where attributes .
Length > 0 let fieldRangeAttribute = ( FieldRangeAttribute ) attributes [ 0 ] select new { property , fieldRangeAttribute } ;
This evaluates to a sequence of tuples , one for each property to which an attribute of type FieldRangeAttribute has been applied .
( That attribute type is specific to this example by the way , so do n't look for it in the docs .
You can find the source in the original article . )
Each tuple contains the property to which the attribute has been applied , and the attribute itself .
Of course we could have done this just as easily without LINQ .
Here 's a C# 2.0 implementation using the iterator syntax to generate a similar collection :
public struct PropAndAttribute { public PropertyInfo property ; public FieldRangeAttribute fieldRangeAttribute ; } static IEnumerable < PropAndAttribute > GetProps ( Type t) { foreach ( PropertyInfo property in t.GetProperties ( ) ) { object [ ] attributes = property .
GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( FieldRangeAttribute ) , true ) ; if ( attributes .
Length >
0 ) { PropAndAttribute item = new PropAndAttribute ( ) ; item.property = property ; item.fieldRangeAttribute = ( FieldRangeAttribute ) attributes [ 0 ] ; yield return item ; } } }
The lack of anonymous types in C# 2.0 means I 've had to define this PropAndAttribute type to act as the tuple , but otherwise this code does much the same thing as the query based example .
If you prefer your examples old - school , we could just build a collection object and return that :
static IEnumerable < PropAndAttribute > GetProps ( Type t) { List < PropAndAttribute > items = new List < PropAndAttribute >( ) ; foreach ( PropertyInfo property in t.GetProperties ( ) ) { object [ ] attributes = property .
GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( FieldRangeAttribute ) , true ) ; if ( attributes .
Length >
0 ) { PropAndAttribute item = new PropAndAttribute ( ) ; item.property = property ; item.fieldRangeAttribute = ( FieldRangeAttribute ) attributes [ 0 ] ; items .
Add( item ) ; } } return items ; }
These three examples all amount to the much same thing .
I 'm not going to try and argue which of these is the most readable .
The interesting point , I think , is that the new query syntax works fine against an array .
When you first see the query syntax in C# 3.0 it looks so SQL - like that it 's easy to get the impression that there 's some sort of inline database query here .
But the fact that there 's no database involved in this particular example illustrates that the syntax is actually a whole lot more general - purpose .
It 's designed to be reminiscent of SQL , but it 's not actually SQL .
( Daniel Moth has a good explanation of what the C# 3.0 query syntax really means . )
So that 's the first of the two LINQ techniques Jafar Husain 's example shows .
The second , and arguably the more interesting , is the code generation .
Runtime code generation is n't new , of course .
In .NET v1 the Code DOM gave us the option to construct code and compile it at runtime , which is how ASP .
NET builds pages on the fly .
System .
Reflection .
Emit gave us the ability to emit IL at runtime , something the regular expression engine can exploit .
( IL is . NET 's byte code , for those of you with a Java background . ) . NET 2.0 added LCG ( Lightweight Code Gen ) , which simplifies certain aspects of IL generation , and also removes certain overheads .
But both the source - centric and the IL - centric techniques have issues .
Firing up the compiler is a bit of a heavyweight operation .
Building your own IL is rather grungy , and you do n't get a lot of help in ensuring the generated code is verifiably type - safe .
( The CLR can verify the generated code for you after you 've generated it , but it 's nicer to have a model that does n't let you get it wrong in the first place . )
LINQ introduces a new approach that is somewhere between the low - level IL - based techniques and the heavyweight compiler - based techniques .
It introduces a runtime representation for expressions .
You could think of this as a language - neutral abstract syntax tree .
With a single method call , you can compile these things into IL .
So this gives you what is arguably the best of both worlds : a quick , lightweight way to generate runnable code from data at runtime , without the need to dive down to the IL level .
Jafar Husain 's example uses this technique .
But this is where I started to find it hard to follow , and figured there was room for improvement :
var type = typeof ( T ) ; var lambdaParameter = Ex . Parameter ( typeof ( string ) , " line " ) ; var subStringMethod = typeof ( string ) . GetMethod ( " Substring " , new Type [ ] { typeof ( int ) , typeof ( int ) } ) ; var expr = Ex .
Lambda < Func < string , T >>( Ex .MemberInit( Ex . New ( type.GetConstructor( new Type [ ] { } ) ) , from property in type .
GetProperties ( ) let attributes = property .
GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( FieldRangeAttribute ) , true ) where attributes .
Length > 0 let fieldRangeAttribute = ( FieldRangeAttribute ) attributes [ 0 ] select ( MemberBinding ) Ex .
Bind ( property , Ex . Call ( lambdaParameter , subStringMethod , Ex .Constant ( fieldRangeAttribute .Start ) , Ex .Constant ( fieldRangeAttribute.Length ) ) ) ) , lambdaParameter ) ; Func < string , T> parse = expr.Compile ( ) ;
You should recognize parts of this from earlier .
It 's using LINQ to retrieve properties from reflection as before .
The two main differences are what 's being done in the ' select ' clause , and what we 're doing with the results .
( Note that in this example , Ex is presumed to be an alias for System .
Linq .
Expressions .
Expression .
You 'd need to add using Ex = System .
Linq .
Expressions .
Expression ; to the top of your source file if you want to try this code out . )
The majority of this code builds a lambda expression .
This is the expression object model 's representation for a lambda , which is a form of anonymous method in C# 3.0 .
This particular lambda takes a single parameter , which is signified by the lambdaParameter parameter .
The lambda 's body is represented by a member initialization expression , i.e. an expression which creates an object and then initializes some or all of that object 's members .
The type of object is identified by T here .
( That 's the name of a type parameter : in the original example this code is part of a generic method . )
The select clause generates MemberBinding objects by calling Ex. Bind ; it'll create one for each property that the query finds .
The member bindings tell the member initialization expression how to initialize each of the members of the newly created object .
The property to be initialized is identified by the Property Info passed as the first parameter .
So this basically generates a sequence of property assignments , one for each of the properties generated by the query .
( I.e. , one for every property in the source type that has been annotated with the FieldRangeAttribute . )
The second parameter to Ex . Bind is an expression that will provide the value for the property .
In this case , it 's a function call expression .
The function in question is the Substring method of the normal .NET String class .
The target string for the call is identified by lambda Parameter here , which is a placeholder identifying the parameter of the lambda that the whole piece of code generates .
Remember the code builds a lambda expression that takes a single parameter , and this part just says to feed that parameter back in here as the target of the method call .
Finally , two values from the attribute applied to the target property are passed in as the parameters for the call to Substring .
It took me a while to see the wood for the trees here .
But the core of the trick is placing this call to Ex . Bind inside of the select clause .
This results in that part of the expression tree being generated based on what the query returns .
So if you apply that code to a type such as this :
public class Customer { private string address ; [ FieldRange ( 0 , 35 ) ] public string Address { get { return address ; } set { address = value ; } } private string name ; [ FieldRange ( 35 , 10 ) ] public string Name { get { return name ; } set { name = value ; } } }
it effectively generates an expression equivalent to this function :
Func < string , Customer > parse = input => new Customer { Address = input .
Substring ( 0 , 35 ) , Name = input .
Substring ( 35 , 10 ) } ;
Notice that the property initializers correspond directly to the properties of the target class to which the FieldRangeAttribute has been applied .
That , in a nutshell , is what this example is doing .
The important thing to notice is that this ends up being compiled code .
Notice that in the generative code , the final line is a call to the generated expression 's Compile method .
That builds runnable IL from the tree .
So reflection only occurs during the method generation .
Once you 've built the method , it 's JIT compiled like any other , and it's no longer relying on reflection .
So it should run just as fast as that final equivalent bit of code shown in the last snippet .
So that 's pretty cool .
However , I do n't know about you , but I actually found the code pretty hard to follow .
It was only after trying it out and then writing this explanation that I really followed what was going on .
Perhaps we can do better .
Putting the Compiler to Work
As I mentioned way back in 2005 when I first wrote about C# 3.0 expressions , the C# compiler can build these abstract syntax trees for us from C# source code .
We do n't normally need to go to the effort of building up the object model from scratch .
So why does this example do that ?
The reason this example does the work itself is that it wants to build the expression based on the data fetched at runtime .
However , this does n't mean we need to completely disregard what the C# compiler can do for us here .
Here 's my modified version :
public class TextRecordSerializer < T > where T : new ( ) { public static Func < string , T> parse ; static TextRecordSerializer ( ) { var lambdaParameter = Ex . Parameter ( typeof ( string ) , " line " ) ; var expr = Ex .
Lambda < Func < string , T >>( Ex .
MemberInit ( Ex . New ( typeof ( T ) . GetConstructor ( new Type [ 0 ] ) ) , from property in typeof ( T ) . GetProperties ( ) let attributes = property .
GetCustomAttributes ( typeof ( FieldRangeAttribute ) , true ) where attributes .
Length > 0 let fieldRangeAttribute = ( FieldRangeAttribute ) attributes [ 0 ] select BindToExpression ( str => str.Substring ( fieldRangeAttribute.Start , fieldRangeAttribute.Length ) , property , lambdaParameter ) ) , lambdaParameter ) ; parse = expr.Compile ( ) ; } public static MemberBinding BindToExpression ( Expression < Func < string , string >> expr , PropertyInfo property , ParameterExpression lparam ) { return Ex .
Bind ( property , Ex . Invoke ( expr , lparam ) ) ; }
Notice that the call to Substring is now using ordinary C# function call syntax .
However , even though this code does not explicitly build a tree of expression objects , one is still created implicitly .
That 's because of the Bind ToExpression helper function I added .
It takes a parameter of type Expression < Func < string , string >> .
The Expression generic type is a special type recognized by the compiler .
If you assign a lambda into this type , the C# compiler does not compile the code in the normal way .
Instead it generates an expression tree that represents the lambda .
Since I 'm passing the lambda that contains the call to Substring into BindToExpression , that lambda will be turned into an expression tree .
I also made the helper function do the work of building the MemberBinding .
This is n't strictly necessary .
It just removes some of the clutter from the main loop .
To be fair , the result is still somewhat mind bending .
I 'm not sure this technique is actually a good idea , as I suspect the only reason I can look at the code and know what it does is because I wrote it .
I have no idea how long it would take me to understand it 6 months from now .
Also , I do n't know if it 's usefully more readable than the original .
It 's slightly more compact certainly , but you could argue that by enabling the use of ordinary C# 3.0 syntax to define the expression subtree that is to be generated , I 've actually made it harder to distinguish between the code that generates the expression and the generated expression itself .
It feels somewhat akin to writing an ASP.
NET page using server - side JavaScript that generates client - side JavaScript , all mixed into one source file .
Doubtless there are ways I could break it up to make it easier to read .
But I 'm not yet sure I know what the best way to do that is .
Right now it all seems like minor variations on an essentially obscure theme .
Conclusion
None of this will be new to LISP developers .
The idea of writing code that uses data to drive the generation of code is several decades old in that world , as is the idea that the compiler can take ordinary source code and give it to you as a data structure .
Still , I think it 's cool that we can now do the same in C# 3.0 .

TCA Tour : Gordon Ramsay
During
Fox ’s session to promote Gordon Ramsay ’s three series on their network , we enjoyed a rare bit of interactivity between panelist and audience , and …oh , wait : if you ’re a Ramsay fan , then you probably noticed that I said that he has three series on Fox .
Well , okay , you ’re right , he does only have two at the moment , but come December 15th , you can say “ hello ” to his latest endeavor , “ Gordon Ramsay : Cookalong Live . ”
To celebrate this development , Chef Ramsay led us all through an attempt to whip up some topping for Baked Alaska , promising that the person who did the best job would earn themselves a table for four at Hell ’s Kitchen .
Sadly , I did not win…and when I say I did n’t win , what I mean to say is that it was n’t even close .
I added too much of the egg - white mixture , resulting in a topping so pitiful that Chef Ramsay took one look at it and said sadly , “ Oh , mate … ” But I took comfort in the fact that it still had enough substance to it to be browned a bit when he took his pocket blowtorch to it , and when I met up with him post - panel , it definitely seemed to be a case of “ no harm , no foul . ”
( What , like he ’s not used to dealing with the occasional sub - par chef… ? )
I just want you to know that your sad delivery of the words , “ Oh , mate , ” about my Baked Alaska will ring in my ears forever .
Oh , shit .
Really ?
Was it that bad ?
No , thankfully , there were others that were worse .
But it was just the way you said it …
Well , I just wanted to have a little bit of interactivity … and it was fun doing it as well !
I had the added bonus of Fox ’s photographer snapping a picture of me when you were hitting my Baked Alaska with the blowtorch .
Oh , really ?
Even better .
So , Gordon , when do you sleep ?
You ’ve got three shows now on Fox , and that ’s not even counting what you ’ve got going in the UK .
Yeah , good question !
Chefs are n’t very good at sleeping , anyway .
Guy Savoy said to me 20 years ago , when I was in his kitchen and said , “ Sorry , Chef , I ’m a little bit tired , ” he said , “ Tired ?
How many hours sleep did you have last night ? ” I said , “ Six . ” He said , “ Fucking way too much . ” I said , “ What ? ” He said , “ Think about it : the average person sleeps for eight hours a day , so when you get to sixty years of age , that means you would ’ve slept for twenty years .
Does that scare you ? ” I said , “ Yeah ! ” He said , “ So shut the fuck up , sleep four hours a night , get to sixty , and only have slept for ten years of your life ! ”
And so that ’s ringing in now .
That ’s in there now .
Is every contestant who appears on “ Hell ’s Kitchen ” really an aspiring chef ?
Because you get someone like Joseph on there , and he ’s too good for TV to actually be real .
If I had to cast for that program , then I would be looking at one - star , two - star , three - star Michelin chefs all day long .
Did they try with Thomas Keller ?
Did they spend time with Jean Georges or Daniel ?
Did they come out and advertise ?
Because I want to be surrounded by , sort of , chefs in that environment .
Out of respect for them , I never get to see any of their resumes before we meet , and so it ’s quite an interesting fact because they all seem excited and motivated on winning the challenge .
This year ’s responsibility in terms of running that restaurant at the Araxi up in British Columbia , Vancouver , is a perfect setup .
99.9 percent of the ingredients are located within a hundred miles of that radius .
So , from a chef ’s point of view , it ’s a dream come true , even the wine , meat , fish , vegetables located within a hundred miles of that radius .
So that outburst was ridiculous because no one could ever foresee what was going to happen .
I did n’t realize that he was acting , you know , the way he was behind the scenes of the dorm .
I never see any of that stuff going on because it ’s unfair for me to judge them on the downtime because that is purely off my limits , and I did n’t know what to do in terms of — I asked him a very simple question three times , and he did n’t want to answer it .
It was hard because I ’ve been to Afghanistan , and I ’ve been out , cooking for the Marines last year for a thousand of them , U.S. and the U.K. , and the atmosphere was electric .
The banter was phenomenal , and to go and change their view and give them something that they deserve in terms of a decent meal on Christmas Eve was a dream come true .
So to have that kind of negativity from him , I think there were issues on a personal front that needed to be solved before he came into “ Hell ’s Kitchen . ”
Which “ Hell ’s Kitchen ” contestant over the years has surprised you the most from when they started to when they finished ?
Elsie ( from Season 1 ) .
Yeah , what , from a Waffle House chef to cooking the most amazing , authentic American food ?
And then an extraordinary palate like that …?
That was amazing .
Yeah , Elsie .
She ’s good .
Are you surprised when people take your comments as personally as they do , given that they ’ve gone out of their way to be on your show ?
I ’ve gotten a little bit sort of surprised , in a way .
But I do n’t edit it , because I ’m a chef , not an entertainer , so I call it as I see it .
If you had to come in my kitchen tonight at The London West Hollywood , and things went wrong , of course I ’m going to cane someone ’s ass !
But when things go right , I ’m going to equally compliment them !
When we ’re in the middle of that pressurized environment , getting straight to the point is the healthiest thing .
I do n’t want it becoming cancerous , where they come into work the next day and it ’s still on their shoulders .
I get straight to the point .
Do n’t question me in there ; question me after it .
When we come out of it , if you want to talk to me and you want insight , fine .
Because it ’s not that one incident , it ’s the 25 chefs behind and 180 people sitting in the dining room as well .
So sitting and discussing it at length … ?
You have n’t got that time .
It ’s live , and …that ’s what I said earlier about the “ Cookalong . ”
For me , it ’s how I am , and cooking along …
I think it ’s going to be a huge insight into what I can really do , because not enough people see me cooking , and that ’s been frustrating for the last three or four years !
All they say is , “ Stop cursing and cook more ! ”
So I ’m going to do it !
And , lastly , are you surprised that your shows have taken off as well as they have in the States ?
Because , y’know , we ’re not always necessarily known for embracing the abrasive .
No , I suppose I just try to keep it real .
I am somewhat surprised , but , y’know , we work hard at it .
That ’s the most important thing .

Wish you could ’ve been here , sir ; I know you would ’ve dug it . )
ck Nitschke , a UW - Madison professor of psychiatry , has found that uncertainty intensifies a person ’s perception of a bad experience .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Anyone who has spent a sleepless night anguishing over a possible job loss has experienced the central finding of a new brain scan study : Uncertainty makes a bad event feel even worse .
A new study by University of Wisconsin - Madison brain researcher Jack Nitschke shows that the emotional centers in the brain respond much more strongly to disturbing photos if the person did n't know what was coming .
" These results have obvious relevance to our current economic times , " says Nitschke , a professor of psychiatry in the UW - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health .
" Expectations have a dramatic impact on many aspects of our lives , including performance at work and school , interpersonal relationships and health .
Expectations can alter perceptions of negative events as well as neural and emotional responses . "
The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to chart the reaction in two parts of the brain important for emotional responding : the insula and the amygdala .
The study , published online Aug. 13 by the journal Cerebral Cortex , shows much stronger neural responses to negative stimuli when the event is preceded by uncertainty .
" This line of research is helping us understand how expectations influence our emotional responses to events , " Nitschke says .
For the study , 36 UW - Madison student volunteers had their brain activity charted in a fMRI machine at the UW - Madison Waisman Center .
The students wore goggles that presented a series of pictures that were either neutral , such as a chair , or aversive , such as a badly wounded person .
Before each image , the subject saw a symbol signaling one of three things about the image that would follow : a circle to show it would be neutral , an " X " to signal it would be disturbing or a question mark , which indicated uncertainty .
The insula and the amygdala both responded more strongly to the actual aversive picture if it was preceded by the question mark .
Interestingly , those brain areas brain responded less strongly to aversive pictures if they received a cue warning that the disturbing picture was coming .
Nitschke , a psychiatrist who treats people with anxiety disorders , says the results have clinical implications .
" If we can reduce people 's feelings of uncertainty , we can reduce their anxiety and their response to bad experiences , " Nitschke says .
" Given that uncertain expectations are paramount in clinical and subclinical anxiety , these data suggest that more attention be paid to targeting those expectations in treatment . "
After the test , subjects were asked how often the question mark was followed by an aversive picture .
While they saw an equal number of neutral and aversive photos , nearly 75 percent of subjects overestimated the frequency of aversive pictures following uncertain cues .
The brain 's increased response to uncertainty explained these overestimations .
Nitschke 's co-authors are former and current members of his lab and include Issidoros Sarinopoulos , of Michigan State University ; Daniel Grupe , of the UW - Madison departments of Psychiatry and Psychology ; Kristen Mackiewicz of the University of Colorado ; John Herrington of Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia ; Mai Youa Lor of the Columbia University School of Social Work ; and Eric Steege of West Virginia University .

Do n’t you just love it ?
Rich men telling poor people what ’s good for them .
In Australia the Orwellian Fair Pay Commission has frozen the minimum wage and effectively cut the real wages of the 1.3 million lowest paid workers .
The Australian Council of Trade Unions estimates that this is an award wages cut of about $ 16 per week , and wipes out the Rudd Government ’s stimulus package of $ 900 almost completely .
The Fair Pay Commission has cut real wages to supposedly save jobs .
It wo n’t .
At best it might delay by a few months some sackings .
And what hypocrisy .
Can you really imagine the big bosses as caring sharing employers whose only interest is jobs ?
Give me a break .
These are the same bastards who are cutting tens of thousands of jobs already and who are preparing to sack hundreds of thousands in the name of profit .
It ’s their crisis .
Make them pay .
The crisis of profitability in Australia and globally will see unemployment here , on the Government ’s own figures , reach 8.5 per cent next years from its present level of 5.7 percent .
That ’s one million unemployed workers .
If we take into account workers who want to work more hours then the real level of unemployment will soon be over 15 percent .
Cutting wages might bolster profits in some industries .
But there is no guarantee that this tiny bit of extra profit will go to keeping jobs .
It could for example go into new machinery , or dividends , or paying off debt or taking over a competitor on the cheap .
None of these is job creating in the short term .
Indeed freezing wages may tip others into receivership as aggregate demand declines further .
In 1931 the Arbitration Commission cut wages by ten percent .
Unemployment went up .
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard has attacked the decision .
She would , would n’t she ?
If they were serious the new Keynesians in the Labor Government would introduce legislation into Parliament increasing the minimum wage from its current $ 543 a week to say $ 580 as an interim measure , with real wage increases of ten percent a year .
This would force a cut to profits .
If we are all in this together then that is completely acceptable .
Rudd Labor wo n’t do anything to improve the wages of the low paid because they accept ( as Gillard and Rudd have both said ) that one person ’s wage increase is another person ’s job .
This is code for putting profit before people .
So the decision fits perfectly into Rudd Labor ’s thinking .
Rudd and Gillard will huff and puff for a while and then go about the job of undermining unions which are pushing for real wage increases .
The minimum wage decision gives them the ammunition to do that .
As an aside that ’s why the Australian Building and Construction Commission exists – to smash those unions which could lead a real wages fight .
Rudd Labor could borrow more money and pay another stimulus package to the low paid to make up for what has been lost .
They wo n’t because secretly they welcome the decision .
Remember , Rudd and Gillard are the Labor people who from 1 July this year have given tax cuts of more than $ 41 a week to the bosses , and less than $ 3 a week to those on the minimum wage .
That shows starkly where the ALP ’s priorities lie .
The ACTU could mount an industrial campaign for real wage increases for all with no job losses .
They wo n’t because they too accept the wage slave system .
They have already said they will mount a catch up at next year ’s hearings .
Too late .
That does n’t feed the kids now .
And it gives confidence to employers and their allies all across the country that they can freeze wages of all workers with no action from the ACTU .
The trade union movement needs real leadership .
The Lords of the Cinque Ports who currently run the union movement are battling with their barques in the bath .
There may be a problem in this decision for capital .
It does n’t go far enough to restore profit rates to something that will save the system from long term decline .
Only deeper cuts to wages , coupled with lengthening the working day and acquiring competitors on the heap , might be able to do that .
But such an attack could provoke a political and industrial backlash .
Of course , fear is not necessarily an organiser for militant trade unionism .
It could have the opposite effect – producing a reluctance to take any action .
There is another problem for the bourgeoisie .
This cut has been painted as being about saving jobs .
When it does n’t , some workers might begin to think they ’ve kept their side of the bargain but the bosses have n’t .
They could begin to understand that wage cuts are about saving profits , not people .
Workers might realise that we are not all in this together .
That could lead to industrial action .
The ACTU and Labor Party strategies of neoliberal Keynesianism and trade unionism have failed .
The reality for the working class is that to defend jobs and living standards they will have to strike , despite the opposition of Rudd Labor and the ACTU .
As the Building Labourers ’ Federation used to say , if you do n’t fight you lose .
John predicted this outcome in March in his article The bosses ’ wage terrorism begins .
Tristan Ewins also has an article on this on his blog , Left Focus .
It ’s called ‘ Wages decision a “ kick in the guts ” for the most vulnerable workers ’ .

July 29 , 2009  --
What began as a government internship for a one - time honors student with a questionable past has become a full - blown sex scandal that ensnared a married Tennessee state senator and led him to resign .
Republican Sen. Paul Stanley had maintained a low profile until his announcement late Tuesday that he was resigning from the state Senate effective Aug. 10 , after his affair with a 22 - year - old intern and a subsequent extortion attempt was revealed to the public .
Stanley , a 47 - year - old evangelical Christian with two children , said in his resignation letter that he has " decided to focus my full attention on my family . "
" Whatever I stood for and advocated , I still believe to be true , " he told Memphis radio station WREC - AM Tuesday .
" And just because I fell far short of what God 's standard was for me and my wife , does n't mean that that standard is reduced in the least bit . "
He had been engaged in a sexual relationship with intern McKensie Morrison when her boyfriend , Joel Watts , contacted him , according to an affidavit filed in Davidson County by prosecutor Douglas Long .
Watts threatened April 8 to release nude photos of Morrison at the senator 's apartment unless Stanley paid him $ 10,000 , the affidavit claimed .
Watts , 27 , allegedly discovered a memory disc with explicit photos of Morrison that were taken in Stanley 's apartment on a cell phone .
" Watts communicated to Stanley if he did not pay the money , the photographs would be sent to other individuals , including the media , " the document states .
" Good morning , sir .
How are you this fine day ?
McKensie and I have been talking , and I feel that I have a video and some pictures you might be interested in seeing , " Watts allegedly texted to Stanley , according to a transcript read aloud during the hearing , as reported by The Associated Press .
Tennessee Senator 's Sex Scandal
Instead , Stanley contacted the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation .
" He came to us for help , " TBI spokeswoman Kristin Helm told ABCNews.com .
" We explained to him that we were going to take that information to the district attorney general who did turn around and ask us to open an investigation . "
After recovering the threatening text messages , TBI instructed Stanley to play along with Watts ' demands , according to court documents .
The TBI provided Stanley with the $ 10,000 Watts had requested and on April 9 , the two met behind a Mexican restaurant to exchange the money for the disc .
Once the cash and the disc were swapped , Watts was arrested , charged with theft of property and extortion .
After a preliminary hearing last week , Watts ' case was sent to a grand jury for extortion .
The theft charge was dismissed .
Neither Watts nor Morrison could be reached for comment .
ABC News '
Nashville affiliate WKRN reported that Stanley released a statement last week , saying he was " the victim and a witness to a crime . "
" At this time , I have been advised by authorities and the district attorney 's office not to comment .
There is already misinformation being inferred regarding this matter which I look forward to clearing up at the appropriate time , " the statement read .
Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey 's office also declined to return repeated messages today .
But Ramsey , who is also the speaker of the Senate , told Tennessee media at a fundraiser this past weekend that he considered Stanley to be a close friend and that Stanley had been having marital problems for some time .
" First of June , end of May he was in my office , he told me he and his wife were going to be separated , " said Ramsey , " and obviously we had a good conversation about that .
Both of us were upset about that . "
Helm said Stanley was " very cooperative " throughout the investigation , adding that the TBI 's active investigation is now closed and she does not expect Morrison to be charged at this time for playing a role in the senator 's alleged extortion .
Cop Says No Evidence to Charge State Senator 's Mistress
" I do n't really know what her involvement was as far as how much she played a part , " Helm said .
" But obviously , if we had the evidence to charge her at the time Joel Watts was charged , we would have charged her . "
Morrison is no stranger to controversy .
According to an article published this week in the Orlando Sentinel , the former central Florida high school honors student has been arrested for cocaine possession and was married to a man who is now in prison for beating a 75 - year - old man in the head with a hammer in her presence .
Though Stanley is a state - level politician , he joins the ranks of numerous other elected officials who have made more headlines for their dalliances with mistresses than for their policy - making .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford came under fire not only for admitting to an affair with an Argentinean mistress , but for disappearing with her on vacation without telling staffers and then apologizing in a drawn - out , nationally televised press conference .
Last year , former presidential candidate John Edwards finally owned up to an affair with campaign staffer Rielle Hunter after more than two years of denying that he was cheating on his terminally ill wife , Elizabeth Edwards .

Rep. Betty Sutton ( D - Ohio ) speaks about clunker cars during a news conference in April . | John Shinkle / POLITICO
Cash - for - clunkers deal moves ahead
A controversial auto bill that would reward consumers with tax credits for trading in their old cars and buying more - fuel - efficient ones passed the House on Tuesday , inching closer to becoming law .
The “ cash for clunkers ” proposal , which would give consumers a tax credit of up to $ 4,500 for switching from their gas guzzlers , has been under consideration for months by lawmakers trying to strike a balance between giving an economic boost to struggling auto companies and promoting their environmental goals .

Auto manufacturers argue that the bill is critical to stimulating lagging car sales and saving jobs at dealerships , automakers and parts manufacturers .
Despite billions in government aid to shore up the nation ’s car industry , U.S. auto sales dropped 34 percent last month compared with May 2008 , according to industry analysts .
China , Japan , England , Germany and several other countries have already passed fleet modernization bills .
“ The U.S. is already well behind other major economies in adopting a fleet modernization program , and many buyers are now delaying purchase decisions until the Congress acts , ” Dave McCurdy , president of the Auto Alliance , a group of 11 vehicle manufacturers , wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ We strongly urge the Congress to send a message to American car buyers by sending a bill to the president ’s desk without delay . ”
But environmentalists say the legislation is not tough enough and should require more serious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
Under the House bill , introduced by Rep. Betty Sutton ( D - Ohio ) , car owners would receive a $ 3,500 voucher for switching to a vehicle with just 4 miles per gallon better mileage — trading an old vehicle getting as much as 18 mpg for a new one with 22 mpg .
If the mileage of the new car getsat least 10 more miles per gallon than the old one , the voucher would be worth $ 4,500 .
Owners of light trucks or SUVs with gas mileage of at least 18 mpg are eligible for $ 3,500 vouchers if the new vehicle gets at least 2 more miles per gallon than the old one .

“ The House deal really undercut the possibility of ensuring that taxpayer dollars go to subsidizing the most efficient vehicles out there , ” said Ann Mesnikoff , director of the Green Transportation Campaign at the Sierra Club .
“ Subsidizing vehicles that are nominally better does n’t make a lot of sense . ”
The bill was pushed along by President Barack Obama , who helped broker a deal that included a compromise version of Sutton ’s proposal in the climate legislation that passed the Energy and Commerce Committee in May .
It is now a stand - alone bill scheduled for floor time this week .
Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) has introduced a similar version of the legislation in the Senate .
The voucher would be redeemable for a year , and traded - in vehicles would be recycled , giving an additional economic boost to auto parts resellers and recyclers .
A group of senators , led by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein , is backing an alternative proposal that imposes tougher mileage limits on the trade - in program .
Feinstein ’s bill mandates that the old vehicle must get 17 mpg or less , and new passenger cars with at least 24 mpg are eligible for vouchers .
To receive the full $ 4,500 voucher , the new vehicle must get at least 13 miles to the gallon more than the old car .
“ Just a 2 - mile change in each of the categories achieves 32 to 38 percent greater savings in gasoline , in oil and in global warming gases not going into the atmosphere , ” Feinstein said Monday .
But in a nod to the power of the auto industry , Feinstein said her proposal was unlikely to become the primary legislative vehicle in the Senate .
“ I could make an amendment in the conference committee , but I would n’t win , ” she said .
Senate appropriators are also debating providing $ 1 billion in a supplemental war funding bill for the cash - for - clunkers program .
But the one - year program is expected to cost $ 4 billion , so lawmakers would have to find additional funds .
Chamber of Commerce , NAM Rebuked For Opposition to Climate Change Bill
An alliance of 14 organizations that support climate change legislation has sent letters to companies that are members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers , urging them to demand a refund of any dues being used by the two groups to oppose a cap - and - trade system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .
The letter urges companies to ask the Chamber and the NAM , which oppose climate legislation currently moving through the House , to return the portion of their dues that fund the pair ’s climate and energy lobbying activities .
The letter from the alliance , led by the Center for Political Accountability , explains that the refund is “ essential to assure that the company is not funding its opponents and undermining its interests through its trade association payments . ”
The letter was sent to 26 companies , including Xerox , Ford Motor Co. , Alcoa , IBM and General Electric .
The Center for Political Accountability says it has received positive responses from Air Products and Chemicals , American Electric Power and Dow Chemical and is in the process of following up with those companies .
The Chamber of Commerce already is taking heat from several corporate members over its opposition to the global warming legislation .
Last month , Johnson & Johnson sent a letter to the Chamber asking the organization to refrain from making comments on climate change unless they “ reflect the full range of views , especially those of Chamber members advocating for congressional action . ”
When the gay clientele of a New York bar staged a revolt against police harassment in June 1969 it sparked the awakening of the homosexual liberation movement .
But 40 years on from the Stonewall rebellion , Britain 's gay community is riven by a dispute over which should come first : politics or partying .
As thousands take to the streets of the British capital today for Gay Pride , which traditionally commemorates the US riots , critics hit out at Pride London for " depoliticising " the event and failing to feature its history in its literature or website .
Peter Tatchell , of the lesbian gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) human rights group , OutRage , and a patron of Pride London , condemned this year 's slogan " Come and Play " as " totally anodyne " and accused the LGBT community of " huge apathy and complacency " .
He said : " I 'm shocked that Pride London has hardly mentioned the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots on its website or in its magazine .
Most of the content is about entertainment and partying .
To ignore and downplay this important anniversary is an insult to the veterans who began our momentous fight for freedom . "
Citing police statistics showing a 63 % rise in homophobic hate crimes in Manchester last year and a recent report from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers showing the term gay is still the most frequently used insult in schools , he said : " Lots of people assume that we 've won equality and everything is hunky dory .
But the battle for LGBT equality is still far from being won .
Same - sex marriage is banned and there is a ban on gay and bisexual blood donors .
LGBT refugees are often sent back to renewed persecution to violently homophobic countries like Uganda and Nigeria .
Police refuse to prosecute fundamentalist clerics and reggae singers who openly advocate the murder of LGBT people .
The government 's current equality bill gives protection against harassment on all grounds except sexual orientation . "
Echoing Tatchell 's call for a stronger political message , Anisa de Jong , the director of the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group , said : " Gay Pride should be providing more of a political space in line with its history which is about visibility being a political statement in itself .
The whole Pride issue is not just about celebrating our identity but about making a political statement about our identity and addressing injustices . "
Joseph Galliano , the outgoing editor of GT magazine ( formerly Gay Times ) , welcomed the celebratory aspects of the march but warned against the loss of its heritage .
He said : " I do n't want to be po-faced about it but that celebration is standing on the shoulders of people who made great sacrifices and they should be remembered . "
Paul Birrell , of Pride London , defended the decision not to feature the Stonewall riots on the website , but said it would be mentioned in the rally at Trafalgar Square after the march today .
" We decided that the Stonewall anniversary would get a lot of mainstream press interest and , short of being a commemoration event of the Stonewall riots , there 's not much Pride can do .
We will talk about it on stage on the day . "
He stressed that London was one of the few Pride UK marches to retain a campaigning element , but admitted that its focus had changed in recent years to attract more people .
" There 's no point in having a march just for already politicised LGBT group members – you would be preaching to the converted , " said Birrell .
" If you want to campaign , you have to have an audience , so you need to make it fun .
When we took over in 2004 , only 10,000 people attended , but last year we had 823,000 .
Our predecessor , mardi gras , was run on a more militant basis , but no one was interested .
It collapsed in 2003 . "
Birrell said the campaign behind the march this year was to protest against the ban on gay men donating blood , but there would be " important but boring " speeches from , among others , Harriet Harmen , the deputy leader of the Labour party , on anti-discrimination issues such as the Single Equality Act .
When asked if sponsorship was a factor in deciding the march 's message , Birrell replied : " To a degree .
If we were heavily politicised , there 's no way we would be in Oxford Street and Regents Street .
The traders would n't want it and they have a lot of clout with the council , but when they can see it attracts people into the city , they 're happy . "
Soho Pride cancelled its event this year due to a lack of sponsorship , while the recently elected mayor of Doncaster , Peter Davies , has threatened to cut funding to the town 's Gay Pride event as part of his pledge to fight political correctness .
We Recommend a Singular Value Decomposition Posted August 2009 .
In this article , we will offer a geometric explanation of singular value decompositions and look at some of the applications of them .

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction
The topic of this article , the singular value decomposition , is one that should be a part of the standard mathematics undergraduate curriculum but all too often slips between the cracks .
Besides being rather intuitive , these decompositions are incredibly useful .
For instance , Netflix , the online movie rental company , is currently offering a $ 1 million prize for anyone who can improve the accuracy of its movie recommendation system by 10 % .
Surprisingly , this seemingly modest problem turns out to be quite challenging , and the groups involved are now using rather sophisticated techniques .
At the heart of all of them is the singular value decomposition .
A singular value decomposition provides a convenient way for breaking a matrix , which perhaps contains some data we are interested in , into simpler , meaningful pieces .
In this article , we will offer a geometric explanation of singular value decompositions and look at some of the applications of them .
The geometry of linear transformations
Let us begin by looking at some simple matrices , namely those with two rows and two columns .
Our first example is the diagonal matrix Geometrically , we may think of a matrix like this as taking a point ( x , y ) in the plane and transforming it into another point using matrix multiplication :
The effect of this transformation is shown below : the plane is horizontally stretched by a factor of 3 , while there is no vertical change .
Now let 's look at which produces this effect
It is not so clear how to describe simply the geometric effect of the transformation .
However , let 's rotate our grid through a 45 degree angle and see what happens .
Ah ha .
We see now that this new grid is transformed in the same way that the original grid was transformed by the diagonal matrix : the grid is stretched by a factor of 3 in one direction .
This is a very special situation that results from the fact that the matrix M is symmetric ; that is , the transpose of M , the matrix obtained by flipping the entries about the diagonal , is equal to M .
If we have a symmetric 2 2 matrix , it turns out that we may always rotate the grid in the domain so that the matrix acts by stretching and perhaps reflecting in the two directions .
In other words , symmetric matrices behave like diagonal matrices .
Said with more mathematical precision , given a symmetric matrix M , we may find a set of orthogonal vectors v i so that Mv i is a scalar multiple of v i ; that is Mv i = λ i v i where λ i is a scalar .
Geometrically , this means that the vectors v i are simply stretched and / or reflected when multiplied by M.
Because of this property , we call the vectors v i eigenvectors of M ; the scalars λ i are called eigenvalues .
An important fact , which is easily verified , is that eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal .
If we use the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix to align the grid , the matrix stretches and reflects the grid in the same way that it does the eigenvectors .
The geometric description we gave for this linear transformation is a simple one : the grid is simply stretched in one direction .
For more general matrices , we will ask if we can find an orthogonal grid that is transformed into another orthogonal grid .
Let 's consider a final example using a matrix that is not symmetric :
This matrix produces the geometric effect known as a shear .
It 's easy to find one family of eigenvectors along the horizontal axis .
However , our figure above shows that these eigenvectors cannot be used to create an orthogonal grid that is transformed into another orthogonal grid .
Nonetheless , let 's see what happens when we rotate the grid first by 30 degrees , Notice that the angle at the origin formed by the red parallelogram on the right has increased .
Let 's next rotate the grid by 60 degrees .
Hmm .
It appears that the grid on the right is now almost orthogonal .
In fact , by rotating the grid in the domain by an angle of roughly 58.28 degrees , both grids are now orthogonal .
The singular value decomposition
This is the geometric essence of the singular value decomposition for 2 2 matrices : for any 2 2 matrix , we may find an orthogonal grid that is transformed into another orthogonal grid .
We will express this fact using vectors : with an appropriate choice of orthogonal unit vectors v 1 and v 2 , the vectors Mv 1 and Mv 2 are orthogonal .
We will use u 1 and u 2 to denote unit vectors in the direction of Mv 1 and Mv 2 .
The lengths of Mv 1 and Mv 2 -- denoted by σ 1 and σ 2 -- describe the amount that the grid is stretched in those particular directions .
These numbers are called the singular values of M . ( In this case , the singular values are the golden ratio and its reciprocal , but that is not so important here . )
We therefore have Mv 1 = σ 1 u 1
Mv 2 = σ 2 u 2
We may now give a simple description for how the matrix M treats a general vector x .
Since the vectors v 1 and v 2 are orthogonal unit vectors , we have x = ( v 1 x ) v 1 + ( v 2 x ) v 2
This means that Mx = ( v 1 x ) Mv 1 + ( v 2 x ) Mv 2
Mx = ( v 1 x ) σ 1 u 1 + ( v 2 x ) σ 2 u 2
Remember that the dot product may be computed using the vector transpose v x =
vTx which leads to Mx = u 1 σ 1 v 1 Tx + u 2 σ 2 v 2 Tx
M = u 1 σ 1 v 1 T + u 2 σ 2 v 2 T
This is usually expressed by writing M = UΣVT where U is a matrix whose columns are the vectors u 1 and u 2 , Σ is a diagonal matrix whose entries are σ 1 and σ 2 , and V is a matrix whose columns are v 1 and v 2 .
The superscript T on the matrix V denotes the matrix transpose of V .
This shows how to decompose the matrix M into the product of three matrices : V describes an orthonormal basis in the domain , and U describes an orthonormal basis in the co-domain , and Σ describes how much the vectors in V are stretched to give the vectors in U .
How do we find the singular decomposition ?
The power of the singular value decomposition lies in the fact that we may find it for any matrix .
How do we do it ?
Let 's look at our earlier example and add the unit circle in the domain .
Its image will be an ellipse whose major and minor axes define the orthogonal grid in the co-domain .
Notice that the major and minor axes are defined by Mv 1 and Mv 2 .
These vectors therefore are the longest and shortest vectors among all the images of vectors on the unit circle .
In other words , the function | Mx| on the unit circle has a maximum at v 1 and a minimum at v 2 .
This reduces the problem to a rather standard calculus problem in which we wish to optimize a function over the unit circle .
It turns out that the critical points of this function occur at the eigenvectors of the matrix MTM .
Since this matrix is symmetric , eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues will be orthogonal .
This gives the family of vectors v i .
The singular values are then given by σ i = | Mv i | , and the vectors u i are obtained as unit vectors in the direction of Mv i .
But why are the vectors u i orthogonal ?
To explain this , we will assume that σ i and σ j are distinct singular values .
We have Mv i = σ i u i
Mv j = σ j u j .
Let 's begin by looking at the expression Mv i Mv j and assuming , for convenience , that the singular values are non-zero .
On one hand , this expression is zero since the vectors v i , which are eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix MTM are orthogonal to one another : Mv i Mv j = v i TMT Mv j = v i MTMv j = λ j v i v j = 0 .
On the other hand , we have Mv i Mv j = σ i σ j u i u j = 0
Therefore , u i and u j are othogonal so we have found an orthogonal set of vectors v i that is transformed into another orthogonal set u i .
The singular values describe the amount of stretching in the different directions .
In practice , this is not the procedure used to find the singular value decomposition of a matrix since it is not particularly efficient or well - behaved numerically .
Another example Let 's now look at the singular matrix
The geometric effect of this matrix is the following :
In this case , the second singular value is zero so that we may write : M = u 1 σ 1 v 1 T .
In other words , if some of the singular values are zero , the corresponding terms do not appear in the decomposition for M .
In this way , we see that the rank of M , which is the dimension of the image of the linear transformation , is equal to the number of non-zero singular values .
Data compression Singular value decompositions can be used to represent data efficiently .
Suppose , for instance , that we wish to transmit the following image , which consists of an array of 15 25 black or white pixels .
Since there are only three types of columns in this image , as shown below , it should be possible to represent the data in a more compact form .
We will represent the image as a 15 25 matrix in which each entry is either a 0 , representing a black pixel , or 1 , representing white .
As such , there are 375 entries in the matrix .
If we perform a singular value decomposition on M , we find there are only three non-zero singular values .
σ 1 = 14.72
σ 2 = 5.22
σ 3 = 3.31 Therefore , the matrix may be represented as M=u 1 σ 1 v 1 T + u 2 σ 2 v 2 T + u 3 σ 3 v 3 T
This means that we have three vectors v i , each of which has 15 entries , three vectors u i , each of which has 25 entries , and three singular values σ i .
This implies that we may represent the matrix using only 123 numbers rather than the 375 that appear in the matrix .
In this way , the singular value decomposition discovers the redundancy in the matrix and provides a format for eliminating it .
Why are there only three non-zero singular values ?
Remember that the number of non-zero singular values equals the rank of the matrix .
In this case , we see that there are three linearly independent columns in the matrix , which means that the rank will be three .
Noise reduction
The previous example showed how we can exploit a situation where many singular values are zero .
Typically speaking , the large singular values point to where the interesting information is .
For example , imagine we have used a scanner to enter this image into our computer .
However , our scanner introduces some imperfections ( usually called " noise " ) in the image .
We may proceed in the same way : represent the data using a 15 25 matrix and perform a singular value decomposition .
We find the following singular values : σ 1 = 14.15
σ 2 = 4.67
σ 3 = 3.00
σ 4 = 0.21
σ 5 = 0.19
...
σ 15 = 0.05 Clearly , the first three singular values are the most important so we will assume that the others are due to the noise in the image and make the approximation M u 1 σ 1 v 1 T + u 2 σ 2 v 2 T + u 3 σ 3 v 3 T This leads to the following improved image .
Noisy image Improved image Data analysis
Noise also arises anytime we collect data : no matter how good the instruments are , measurements will always have some error in them .
If we remember the theme that large singular values point to important features in a matrix , it seems natural to use a singular value decomposition to study data once it is collected .
As an example , suppose that we collect some data as shown below :
We may take the data and put it into a matrix : - 1.03 0.74 - 0.02 0.51 - 1.31 0.99 0.69 - 0.12 - 0.72 1.11 - 2.23 1.61 - 0.02 0.88 - 2.39 2.02 1.62 - 0.35 - 1.67 2.46 and perform a singular value decomposition .
We find the singular values σ 1 = 6.04
σ 2 = 0.22
With one singular value so much larger than the other , it may be safe to assume that the small value of σ 2 is due to noise in the data and that this singular value would ideally be zero .
In that case , the matrix would have rank one meaning that all the data lies on the line defined by u i .
This brief example points to the beginnings of a field known as principal component analysis , a set of techniques that uses singular values to detect dependencies and redundancies in data .
In a similar way , singular value decompositions can be used to detect groupings in data , which explains why singular value decompositions are being used in attempts to improve Netflix 's movie recommendation system .
Ratings of movies you have watched allow a program to sort you into a group of others whose ratings are similar to yours .
Recommendations may be made by choosing movies that others in your group have rated highly .
Summary
As mentioned at the beginning of this article , the singular value decomposition should be a central part of an undergraduate mathematics major 's linear algebra curriculum .
Besides having a rather simple geometric explanation , the singular value decomposition offers extremely effective techniques for putting linear algebraic ideas into practice .
All too often , however , a proper treatment in an undergraduate linear algebra course seems to be missing .
This article has been somewhat impressionistic : I have aimed to provide some intuitive insights into the central idea behind singular value decompositions and then illustrate how this idea can be put to good use .
More rigorous accounts may be readily found .

Abandoned fishing gear was among the debris found by scientists Scientists have confirmed that there are millions of tonnes of plastic floating in an area of ocean known as the North Pacific Gyre .
The first of two ships on a voyage to study plastic pollution there has recently returned to port .
Scientists on board say they found increasing amounts of plastic of all sizes as they travelled into the gyre .
They plan to analyse the effects of the waste on marine life and will propose methods to clear it up .
The North Pacific
Gyre is a slow - moving clockwise vortex where four major ocean currents meet .
Little lives there besides phytoplankton .
Larger than Texas However the currents have carried millions of tonnes of rubbish into the centre of the gyre , which now covers an area estimated to be larger than the US state of Texas .
The two ships from Project Kaisei set off for the gyre from San Francisco more than three weeks ago .
The research vessel New Horizon from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography arrived back earlier this week .
The second , the tall ship Kaisei , will be back on Monday .
The scientists conducted more than 50 surface debris trawls in 17 sites , studying and detailing debris and invasive species .
This collection of plastic was pulled from the ocean in just one hour
They were shocked by the amount of plastic they found .
Project director Doug Woodring said : " One thousand miles from shore with no sign of human life for days , yet our human footprint is now apparent in even one of the most remote places on the planet . "
Mary Crowley , Project Kaisei co-founder , said : " More than 30 years ago , on my first trip to the North Pacific Gyre I found a few glass ball fishing floats , one net and there were , in four days , perhaps two pieces of floating plastic .
" Returning now with Project Kaisei .. the marine debris situation shows a startling change in this same area .
In 30 minutes one easily can count up to 400 pieces of plastic on the sea's surface . "
Tiny pieces of plastic film can be ingested by sea jellies
The team found a variety of invertebrates living in the debris , including crabs , sea anemones , barnacles , sponges and algae , sparking fears that the plastic may aid the spread of invasive species .
The researchers now plan to carry out extensive laboratory testing and analysis on the pieces of plastic they have collected , looking for toxins such as DDT and PCB .
The ultimate aim of the project is to develop sound scientific sampling of marine debris , to assess prototype technologies for removing the waste and to gain insight into how future clean - up programmes might work .

My 88 - year - old husband was prescribed Ambien for insomnia .
After the first dose , he fell while getting up to go to the bathroom , gashed his head and had to go to the emergency room for stitches .
A year later , I gave him a half - dose ( again prescribed ) , and within minutes , his legs collapsed on him .
I had the hardest time getting him into bed .
Ambien ?
Never again !
Your experience reminds us that sleeping pills may pose a serious risk for older people who have to get up at night to go to the bathroom .
This is a dilemma , because many seniors suffer from insomnia .
Even over - the - counter sleep aids that contain the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine ( Advil PM , Nytol , Sominex , Tylenol PM , etc. ) may contribute to unsteadiness and urinary retention .
Older people should be careful with sleeping pills like Ambien .
Other side effects may include reflux , next - day memory impairment , dry mouth and dizziness .

I found that by applying solid antiperspirant to my bikini area following shaving , I have no bumps or irritation .
Bikini bumps are called pseudofolliculitis barbae and result from emerging hairs curling back under the skin instead of growing through it .
Washing carefully before shaving and using a product such as Hydroglide or Razor Rash Relief ( www.mooreunique.com) helps soften hair for easier shaving and prevent post - shaving irritation .
After shaving , 1 % hydrocortisone cream also may reduce inflammation .

For instance , such decisions abound in the original Star Wars trilogy , to the point that the entire plot is basically driven by people using the worst judgment possible .
How else can you explain ...
Here at Cracked we do n't hesitate to hold our leaders accountable for bad decisions .
Even if those leaders are childhood heroes .
And are entirely fictional .
7 Admiral Motti Insults Darth Vader
In Episode IV , Admiral Motti , riding high on the whole " Death Star " thing , finally decides he 's going to tell Vader off just like he practiced over the phone with his mother .
After bragging that he's not scared of Vader , he tells him that his " sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes , or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels ' hidden fortress ... [ Choking sounds ] . "
Clearly Motti does n't realize that he was only named for the sake of the action figure packaging and will not be returning for any of the sequels .

Relative Anonymity : Ages 4 & up .
Why It Was a Bad Call :
Even though Darth Vader is a seven - foot - tall bionic killing machine with a sword that can cut through anything , making a personal attack against the man 's religion is totally uncalled for .
Any manager , be it of the Galactic Empire or Dunkin Donuts , is probably going to fire you if you interrupt a board meeting to call him the equivalent of " a fucking Jew . "
Even if you were partially responsible for an incredible new product with limitless planet - destroying potential .
What did you think we were talking about ?
Of course Darth Vader , being that seven - foot - tall bionic killing machine , has a definition of " fire " that is more in line with the common definition of " strangle to death " .
If Grand Moff Tarkin had n't told Vader to stop , he probably would 've thrown Motti out the goddamn window like Patrick Swayze in Road House .
As it stands , we 're pretty sure the Admiral had been promoted to cleaning toilets on the detention level by the time Luke blows the place up at the end .

The point of the scene seems to be that somehow Motti did n't know Vader had magic telekinetic strangling abilities .
But even so , and even if an Imperial officer like Motti somehow also missed the memo on what not to say to a Dark Lord of the Sith , that still means that he thought Vader only had about 37 different ways to instantly kill him instead of 38 ( most involving a lightsaber neatly carving through his groin ) .
What we 're saying is that Motti was hired not for his tactical acumen but purely for his ability to sneer .
More than half a century ago , the great media critic AJ Liebling memorably described the first amendment 's outer boundaries .
" Freedom of the press , " he wrote , " is guaranteed only to those who own one . "
It 's an elemental truth you can be sure Glenn Beck is pondering these days .
Beck 's highly rated programme on Fox News , and indeed his career , hang in the balance because of his recent comments that Barack Obama is a racist with " a deep - seated hatred for white people " .
Not that Beck 's incendiary remarks hurt him with his audience – which , one imagines , comprises mostly unemployed white men with nothing better to do when his show comes on at 5 pm than to sit in front of the TV set while polishing their guns .
The problem , rather , is that an increasing number of advertisers – 36 at last count – do n't want to be associated with Beck 's show .
And that 's got to have Rupert Murdoch , the owner of Beck 's press , wondering whether his newest star is worth the hassle .
Beck 's grotesque description of Obama is hardly out of character .
We 've all seen the YouTube video of Beck talking about the president against a backdrop of goose - stepping Nazis .
Earlier this year , in a too - nice New York Times profile , those of us who are not regular viewers ( that is , just about everyone who is reading this commentary ) learned Beck was passing along rumours that Obama was building concentration camps .
Then , too , the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America has been documenting Beck 's outrages for years , going back to his days of denying global warming on CNN Headline News .
What is different this time ?
A concerted effort by an African - American social - action organisation called ColorofChange.org to pressure advertisers into pulling out .
By early this week , executives of such powerful corporations as Wal - Mart , Lowe's , AT&T and Verizon Wireless had announced they no longer wanted to be associated with Beck 's dangerous rhetoric .
As much as many liberals detest Beck and other rightwing cranks ( the closest analogue is CNN 's Lou Dobbs , a giver of aid and comfort to the so - called birthers , who question Obama 's national origin ) , they are reflexively squeamish over the notion of anyone trying to interfere with freedom of speech .
Indeed , when Bob Garfield , co-host of National Public Radio's
On the Media , interviewed ColorofChange.org executive director James Rucker a few days ago , Beck 's right to speak was Garfield 's principal line of inquiry .
But Beck 's freedom to say what he wants would be threatened only if the government were trying to censor him .
Beck 's first amendment rights can hardly be violated simply because James Rucker is exercising his own first amendment rights .
And if the measure of one 's freedom of expression is being the highly paid host of a national cable news programme , well , damn it , I demand my rights , too .
In the American media system , commerce is a rough substitute for conscience .
You may recall that , in 2007 , Don Imus lost his nationally syndicated radio show when advertisers pulled out over Imus 's description of black members of the women 's basketball team at Rutgers University as " nappy - headed hos " .
( Not that it was much of a come - uppance .
Within months another network came along and put him back on the air . )
We live in a moment when gun-toting extremists show up at anti-Obama rallies to denounce the president as a socialist Nazi who wants to set up death panels modelled after Hitler 's campaign to eliminate disabled people .
Emotions are running high – higher than they might were Beck not spreading his hateful lies .
If Fox News were a responsible news operation , it would have taken Beck off the air months ago .
If Wal - Mart and Lowe 's can do what Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes wo n't , then good for them .
Let Glenn
Beck exercise his first amendment rights like most of his ilk do – on a street corner somewhere , ranting to strangers , hoping a few passersby might toss a dollar or two into the empty coffee can at his feet .
MOSCOW -- Russia 's economy is so bad that the government is bailing out one of its traditional souvenirs : nesting dolls .
The nation 's Industry and Trade Ministry recently announced that the government will spend up to $ 28.4 million for the Kremlin and state agencies to purchase large quantities of nesting dolls and Russian hand - painted dishes to give as gifts .
The move is aimed to help the native craftsmen whose sales have plunged in the financial crunch .
And it comes as Russia struggles with declining oil prices , growing unemployment and the global economic crisis .
A sign of the country 's woes is the plummeting number of Russian billionaires on Forbes ' list of the richest people — 32 from 87 a year ago .
The government handout is good news for Yulia Kolesnikova — whose family has been making nesting dolls for generations .
When the economy was humming , she never wanted Russia 's army of bureaucrats and tax inspectors to look at her business .
After months of sagging sales , she hopes the promised bailout can salvage her business .
" Something terrible happened around September last year , and it 's like all orders simply dried up .
Simply no one was calling , " Kolesnikova , 46 , says .
" And then there was all these talks about a crisis on the television .
Why should a crisis affect a thing of beauty ?
At first we thought this was only an American problem . "
In her workshop , which is little more than a car garage outside Moscow , some of her nesting dolls , or matryoshkas , are on display — adorned with colorful hand - painted portraits of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev .
There are also scandal - themed dolls depicting former president Bill Clinton in a sharp suit , with Monica Lewinsky and other women linked to him , and another set with smiling former president George W. Bush .
" This is a quintessentially Russian craft , and it is unfortunate there were no tourists around as before to buy them , " Kolesnikova says .
" Obama 's matryoshka could be a hit anytime he decides to visit us . "
A visit by the U.S. president is a way off , but the Russian government is trying to ensure its native crafts will be around .
Industry and Trade Minister Viktor Khristenko said the government might also offer tax incentives for the artists , along with help selling their crafts at home and abroad .
Kolesnikova said she and her husband , who have two children , used to make a decent living from the nesting dolls .
" We renovated this house with proceeds from selling matryoshkas .
So , you see , it 's not a small business after all , " she says .
She learned the craft from her parents , starting at age 6 or 7 painting the dolls .
Most of the early dolls she made had only five places — each doll nested inside another is called " a place . "
" Since we became a democratic nation ( after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ) , we 've had a boost in the number of orders for the matryoshkas , " she says .
" Big companies order nesting dolls with portraits of the bosses , and even government offices place orders . "
Prices vary ; a high - quality , 10 - place doll can cost as much as $ 1,500 .
Kolesnikova hopes the government can help her business stay afloat .
" If the authorities in Moscow keep their word and place orders for matryoshkas , we would only be too glad , " she says .
" That would at least keep us going again , and we can sell off all the stuff lying on those shelves . "
Staff at London 's only secure children 's home were last night occupying the centre after resisting attempts to close it for good .
Care workers , managers and teachers at Orchard Lodge in Anerley , south London , took the action after being dismissed and being given less than two hours to collect their belongings and leave .
About 45 employees occupied every room on the six - and - half acre site , including boys ' dormitories and bathrooms , to prevent security officers from bolting shut the doors and windows .
The home has been earmarked for closure since March after the Youth Justice Board said it was cutting the number of beds at secure children 's units in England and Wales .
But a legal attempt to keep it open was launched by the Glen Care Group – the private firm which bought the lodge from Southwark council in March 2006 but that apparently failed .
At 3.30 pm yesterday staff were summoned to a meeting and told they were dismissed and to leave the site by 5 pm , a Unison official said .
Most of the boys at the 24 - bed home have been relocated .
But one remaining child was escorted away " in great distress " yesterday afternoon , staff said .
Senior care worker Paul Raythorne told the Guardian the teenager had been looking forward to a parole hearing in two weeks ' time .
" He was bundled out in a flash and was clearly very upset .
He was on a manslaughter charge and like many of the children who were here , he was extremely vulnerable , " said Raythorne .
Raythorne said staff had been hopeful the centre would remain open after being told that the legal challenge was going well .
But he said : " All of a sudden our manager was summoned into a meeting by the owners and told that we were all dismissed .
" We have not been given anything in writing .
One of the owners and a couple of security guards came down and were trying to screw and bolt the doors closed but we have been forced to occupy the building . "
Raythorne said he and his colleagues were prepared to face a police stand - off if necessary and were planning to stay overnight .
He said he understood many of the boys who had been moved to less specialised units had since been subjected to violence .
Orchard and other children 's homes are different to units such as young offender institutions and secure training centres because they give more intensive care and have ratios of staff to children .
No child has ever died in a secure children 's home , but there have been 30 deaths in YOIs and STCs since 1990 .
Daniel Peppiatt , regional representative for Unison , said attempts to dismiss the staff were " unlawful " .
" This is an example of the worst possible practice .
The staff are enraged .
Glen Care have failed spectacularly to consult with their staff . "
A Glen Care spokesman refused to comment .
The 13 other secure children 's homes around the country belong to local authorities .

Planned talk / speaker notes :
The Shy Connector : How to get strangers to talk to you .
Hi , I ’m Sacha Chua , and I ’m an introvert .
< clapping >
You might be , too .
Do you prefer bookstores over bars ?
Puzzles more than parties ?
Close friends instead of crowds ?
If so , you might be an introvert .
It can be hard to connect as an introvert .
LinkedIn and Facebook can feel like popularity contests .
How many friends do you have ?
Should you say yes to invitations from strangers ?
Meetups can be overwhelming .
So many choices to make , so many people to meet …
So what can you do if you ’re shy ?
There are plenty of books and blogs about social networking , because success and happiness often depend on whom you know and who knows you .
“ Sell yourself ! ” “ Brand yourself ! ” “ Attend as many events as you can ! ” “ Talk to people in the elevator ! ” they advise .
Right .
Most of the networking tips I ’ve read are geared toward extroverts who do n’t need tips on how to talk to strangers .
Me , I hate starting conversations .
I find it hard to make small talk .
I ’m too shy to reach out .
Following up takes focused effort .
Sound familiar ?
Ever felt that way , too ?
Here are seven things I ’ve learned about connecting as an introvert .
I hope these tips will help you play to your strengths .
Tip 1 : It ’s okay to be an introvert .
You do n’t need to fake being extroverted .
You do n’t need to be a glad - handing , business - card - throwing networker in order to connect .
Just listen and ask a few questions during conversations .
Give yourself quiet time to recharge .
Connect online if you feel more comfortable that way .
Figure out what works for you .
For me , blogging often works out better than going to events .
Now that I understand that about myself , it ’s easier for me to say , “ No , I ’m planning to stay home ” when faced with an invite .
I ’m much more comfortable blogging than partying , and I can share in a way I simply can’t do in person .
Tip 2 : Change your perspective .
It ’s not about selling yourself .
It ’s not about marketing your personal brand .
It ’s not about figuring out what other people can do for you .
It ’s about focusing on what you can do to help other people .
Focus on what can help other people be happier and more successful .
Ask questions .
Explore ideas .
Focusing the spotlight on the other person makes it easier to make conversation and get to know others .
Tip 3 : Give people reasons to talk to you , both online and offline .
Most people find it hard to start a conversation , too .
Do them a favour and give them an excuse to approach you .
An interesting hat makes you easy to find in a crowd .
Accessories with character draw remarks .
Keywords on your nametag lead to conversations .
Online ?
Share your interests and thoughts .
People can find you through search engines and reach out to learn from you .
My favourite ?
Giving a presentation .
Talking to a hundred people at once is easier than talking to two at a time because I can rehearse what I want to say .
I reach way more people this way , and I do n’t have to start any conversations !
Tip 4 : Look for ways to help .
While you ’re listening , think :
What do I know ?
Who do I know ?
How can I help ?
Have I read a book they might like ?
Have I talked to someone they should meet ?
Do I have an interesting idea that can save them time ?
Even if you ca n’t help right away , if you make it a point to remember their need , you may be able to connect the dots later .
Tip 5 : Give yourself homework .
Following up with someone is easier when you ’ve promised to send them a link or introduce them to someone else who can help .
That ’s why you should always carry something you can use to take notes .
Why worry about forgetting when you can write things down ?
Tip 6 : Make it easy to get to know you .
So you ’ve met someone , learned about their interests , and followed up .
How do you build the connection from there ?
Even if you do n’t like talking about yourself , you can make it easier for other people to get to know you .
Share your interests , skills , and goals .
The more people know about what you can do , the more you can find opportunities to help them .
A personal website or profile page is a good way to start .
Link it in your e-mail signature and put it on your business card .
A blog is even better .
If you share tips , ideas , and a bit of a personal touch , people might even subscribe and really get to know you over time .
They might even help you grow ! =)
Tip 7 : Keep growing , and your network will grow with you .
As you develop your passions , improve your skills , and grow your network , you ’ll be able to create more value — and more , and more , and more .
The more you understand your passions , the easier it is to communicate them .
The more you improve your skills , the more you can help others .
The more people you know , the more introductions and connections you can make .
If you share what you ’re learning with people , your network can grow along with you .
Then you wo n’t have to fake being an extrovert or drain yourself of energy ; people and opportunities will simply flow to you .
Which of these tips would you like to focus on , practice , and learn more about ?
How can I help you explore your networking potential ?

These tips are slightly different from the presentation , but still have the same flavour .
I love the insights people have shared in the comments .
Feel free to check them out and add your own tips !

I ’m planning a presentation called “ The Shy Connector : How to talk to strangers How to get strangers to talk to you ” .
I realized that most networking books focus on helping people act more extroverted , but I ’ve found ways to use my introverted nature to connect with people .
Here are some of my weaknesses and how I ’ve worked around them :
Weakness Strength
In practice Hate starting a conversation with strangers Comfortable with being different Some of my quirks and interests turn out to be great conversation - starters .
People often start conversations by asking me about my hat , my computer , my technology interests , my speeches , or even just my obvious happiness and energy .
Hate making small talk Love learning and asking questions I never ask people what they do .
I ask people what they ’re interested in , what they ’re passionate about , or what could help them be happier or more successful .
That makes people think , and it results in conversations that can teach me something new , change the way I think , and help me remember people .
Hate going out Comfortable with hosting people I sometimes feel overwhelmed in places people like going to “ hang out ” , such as busy restaurants and bars .
I prefer to host small get - togethers at home , where I can keep group numbers low and I ’m in familiar territory .
Hate searching for common ground Love learning and sharing things online
One of the things I do n’t like about talking to strangers is looking for common interests we can talk about .
Instead of going to general networking events , I prefer to go to conferences and talks where the presentations naturally give us topics of conversation .
I ’m also comfortable sharing what I ’m learning online .
Many of my conversations now start with someone else telling me that they ’ve read my blog , and the conversation goes straight to interests we both have .
Hate blathering Love writing and reflecting Blogging helps me relax and communicate in real - life conversations .
If I ’ve written about something , it ’s easier for me to talk about it because I ’ve spent some time thinking about what I want to say and how I want to say it .
The result : more confidence during conversations , and clearer communication too !
Here ’s a rough list of the tips I plan to share :
1 . Be yourself .
You do n’t have to be a fake extrovert .
You do n’t have to learn how to enjoy small talk or put on a new personality .
You can use your characteristics as an introvert to connect with people , and you might even be able to connect with more people and at deeper levels than the popular kids in your high school would .
2. Reframe the situation .
It ’s not about selling yourself .
It ’s not about becoming popular .
It ’s about finding ways you can help other people , and it ’s about learning more .
3 . Give people reasons .
If you hate talking to strangers because you ’re afraid of those awkward moments when you ’re both looking for reasons to talk , skip that by giving people reasons to talk to you .
Me , I find it easier to present to a thousand people than to talk to a single person , because I can prepare for presentations ( and it ’s fun ! ) .
That gives people reasons to come up to me afterwards and start a conversation with me about something we ’re both interested in .
I also do quirky things : wear interesting hats , smile a lot , have an awesome business card–all of which have led to interesting conversations I did n’t start .
Most people are just as scared of starting conversations as you are , so make it easy for them .
4 . Help others .
Treat conversations as learning opportunities .
Find out what could help people become happier or more successful .
What books or blog posts have you read that they might be interested in ?
What tools have you tried or heard of that might fit their needs ?
Even the act of asking questions helps people clarify their thoughts .
You might not be able to help them right away , but you might meet someone else who can help , and then you can connect the dots .
You ’ll learn a whole lot in the process , too .
5 . Look for homework .
Following up is hard .
I ’ve come home from conferences with stacks of business cards that I did n’t know what to do with aside from sending a quick note about how nice it was to see people .
It ’s much easier to follow up with people and continue the conversation if you focused on helping people .
If you follow up with an article someone is interested in or an introduction to another person who could help make things happen , your follow - up email or note has real value .
Carry a notebook with a flap for business cards , a PDA , or some other note - taking device , and use it to keep track of your homework .
6. Build history .
Extroverts have this easy .
They ’re out having coffee with their buddies or golfing with their bosses .
If you ’re anything like me , you have a hard enough time finding ways to comfortably hang out with your close friends , much less acquaintances .
You need stories and shared experiences to deepen relationships , though .
Build that history by making it easy for people to keep in touch with you .
Me , I find it difficult to call people up or invite them to hang out , but I ’m comfortable blogging .
I might be too shy to reach out to people I ’ve just met , but they can read my blog to learn more about who I am , and they can continue the conversation in the comments if they want to .
If they blog , that gives me a way to get to know them too .
Make it easy for people to keep in touch with you .
7. Practice .
The more you listen , the more you think , the more you write , the more you speak , the more clearly you ’ll know what you want to say and how you want to say it .
It ’s good for self - discovery , too .
Listen to people and figure out what you resonate with and what you ’re interested in .
Try different ways of expressing your thoughts .
Treat small talk as a game , and use it to develop your skill at asking questions and sharing what you think .
Use it to try different techniques .
When you ’re not personally invested in it –when you ’re not worrying that a conversational stumble is equal to personal rejection and failure –things become easier and almost fun .

There ’s something interesting in here that I ’d like to figure out and share .
Is there anything that particularly resonates with you ?
Is there anything you ’d like to learn more about ?

( I ’m a female customer sitting in a pub .
I ’m approached by a male customer while I read a book . )
Male Customer : “ Hello , my name is [ Name ] . ”
Me : “ That ’s nice . ”
Male Customer : “ So can I have your number ? ”
Me : “ Oh. Actually , I ’m gay . ”
Male Customer : “ You want to have sex with women ? ”
Me : “ Well , not right now .
Right now , I just want to read my book . ”
Male Customer : “ That ’s bull - s***!
If you ’re a lesbian then you want to have sex with women ! ”
Me : “ Honestly , I just want to read my book . ”
Male Customer : “ You ’re lying to me ; that ’s very rude !
I ’m going to complain ! ”
Male Customer : * to a waitress *
“ That girl over there is being really rude .
I want you to do something , it ’s disturbing my day .
She just lied to me and told me that she was a lesbian , and now she ’s mocking me . ”
Waitress : “ What am I supposed to do about that ?
Make her straight ? ”
Male Customer : “ Just do something about it ! ”
Waitress : * to me * “ Hello , there . ”
Me : “ Hello .
I ’m sorry about him . ”
Waitress : “ Oh , it ’s no problem !
So , can I have your number ? ”
Male Customer : * looks horrified *
Me : “ Er , yeah , sure .
Here . ”
( I write my number on a napkin and she takes it , still smiling . )
Waitress : * to male customer * “ See ?
She ’s a lesbian . ”
Male Customer : “ That ’s not what I wanted you to do !
I did n’t want you to ask her out , I wanted you to make her leave !
I demand to speak to your manager ! ”
Waitress : “ Oh , he ’s just popped out .
I can get his boyfriend for you though if you want ? ”
Male Customer : * storms out cursing *
( It turned out that the waitress was kidding about her manager , but she was n’t kidding about asking me out ! )
If you 're a regular reader of Mashable , you 're likely a firm believer in the power of social media .
We 've highlighted how the social web can improve your career , aid charitable causes , transform businesses and even change the world .
In short , we 're convinced .
But what do you say to someone who does n't get it ?
Maybe you have a boss who thinks social branding a waste of time or chatted with a friend who does n't believe that Twitter can help land her a great job .
Maybe they have no clue what social media even is .
Last year , marketing director Marta Kagan helped solve this problem with her presentation What the F**k is Social Media ?.
It was quickly a social media hit for its wit and its very convincing case for the raw power of social media .
With the tremendous growth of Twitter , Facebook , and blogging in the last year though , Ms. Kagan thought it was time for a sequel .
We could n't agree more .
The stats she cites and the savvy she employs in What the F**k is Social Media : One Year Later makes it a worthy successor .
The next time you need to explain the benefits of social media to someone , just send them this post and make sure they flip through the entire presentation .
Here it is :
You know that feeling you get when you open up a piece of code you ’ve never seen before and it ’s a complete and total morass of crap .
It ’s that sinking feeling in your stomach when , no matter how big your screen is , the code just does n’t seem to fit .
You do n’t get even a glimmer of indication of what the code is meant to do by giving it a quick skim and the unit test are , if anything , worse than the code ( crappy unit tests are worse than crappy code ) .
You know you will need to start at the beginning and go through this sucker line by line to pry even a semblance of meaning out of it .
I really hate that feeling and I hate the people who make me feel like that ( of course I do n’t really hate them , but you sure do wish you could go all Homer Simpson on them – when he chokes Bart – just for a couple of minutes ) .
What I would hate most of all though , is for someone else to feel like that about me and my code .
We ’ve all heard that old maxim about leaving code in a slightly better state than when you found it , but you know what , sometimes you feel like the code is so disgusting that you just want to get out of there as soon as you can .
It ’s a bad situation for a piece of code to end up in , not conducive to being improved , not worthy .
And I am well aware that sometimes , depending on what you ’re working on , it is damn tough to write pretty code .
But , here is the way I view it , at the very least , your code should be worthy of improvement !
I want people to feel at home when they look at my code , but failing that I ’d like them to not immediately want to throw up when they come for a visit .
In my mind it all starts with being explicit .
Being Explicit When You Code
We all have our little quirks when we code and for the most part this is fine , but there are certain conventions that tend to clarify the meaning and we should all endeavor to adopt them if we can .
descriptive variable names – it is not that difficult to use full words , we are not writing assembly code .
So everything will be a little longer , but – fPtr vs. file Pointer– which one is easier to understand ?
Maybe both of those are pretty clear , but what if you have a fully Automated Widget Factory vs. flAutWidFact , all of a sudden the sailing is not as smooth .

descriptive method names – ditto for this one , make the method name tell the story of what it does ( do I even need to mention class names that make sense )
– ditto for this one , make the method name tell the story of what it does ( do I even need to mention class names that make sense ) structuring , classes and method in a way that makes sense – private and public methods mixed together in classes , classes themselves broken up along arbitrary boundaries .
It takes very little time to extract chunks of code that have a relationship and make sense ( when you refactor ) and you will understand your code better yourself .

classes of reasonable size – this one is just a no - brainer , if you need to scroll for 5 minutes to find anything , it ’s crying out to be split up and simplified .
– this one is just a no - brainer , if you need to scroll for 5 minutes to find anything , it ’s crying out to be split up and simplified .
methods of reasonable size – another no brainer , if it ca n’t fit on one 19 inch screen , it is long overdue for a refactor ( and I am being extremely generous ) .
– another no brainer , if it ca n’t fit on one 19 inch screen , it is long overdue for a refactor ( and I am being extremely generous ) .
no long trains of method calls – chaining 20 method calls together – not a good idea .
It might make perfect sense to you because you know the code , but to someone else it is just groan - worthy .
Be sensible , have some compassion for your fellow developers .

etc .
There are dozens more I can list , but seriously , it if looks bit suss it probably is !
Sometimes following some of these will actually prevent you from using all the funky features / shortcuts of your favorite language , but I believe it is a small price to pay for a little bit of extra clarity and readability .
And I am aware that most of those are basics and yet so many people just do n’t do it , which is just not nice .
Not nice for those who have to maintain and modify the code later .
Using Technologies That Obfuscate Meaning
Sometimes in the interests of being cool and cutting edge or simply because it seems like a good idea , we use technologies that obfuscate our code beyond the level that anyone should reasonably be forced to endure .
Here are my two pet examples of this phenomenon .
Spring Autowiring – I ca n’t really think of a situation where this is a good idea .
Sure it might make wiring up your integration tests a little easier , but only in the short term .
Wait until half the people on your team are new and see how much they like it .
– I ca n’t really think of a situation where this is a good idea .

Aspect Oriented Programming ( AOP ) – do n’t get me wrong , the idea of AOP is just great .
And to be honest there are a some specialized situations where it is a good idea to use it judiciously ( transactions , security etc. ) .
But , use it without thinking and you make your code an order of magnitude more complicated than it has to be .
It was designed for a purpose do n’t try to retrofit it into somewhere it ’s not meant to be .
Every time you ’ve got a new library you want to try out or want to make your code a little bit more ‘ hip ’ , stop and think .
Is it adding to the clarity of the solution or detracting from it ?
If you had to come in and work with this code would this make your life easier or harder ?
If the answer is harder , find another way to do what you want . _
This is software , there is always another way_ , and if it happens to be a little bit more verbose , well maybe that ’s fine .
If the verboseness is adding readability , then bring it on .
The Other Side Of Convention Over Configuration
Convention over configuration is great , I have nothing against it .
When we all use the same conventions it makes everyone ’s life easier .
But what happens when the convention does n’t suit your needs any more and you have to break it ?
The more you do this the dirtier and ‘ hackier ’ your code will seem to those who are used to the convention .
So , if you ’re working within a system where convention over configuration is the norm , think long and hard before you have to break the convention .
Perhaps if you find yourself doing this often early on , it may not be too late to make a different technology choice , where the conventions are not as strict .
Of course , sometimes you will not have the luxury , in that case do try to stick to the convention , diverge only when you have no other choice .
Always remember to think of those who will come after you when you make decisions , after all , you probably want them to think of you when they make theirs .
These are just my thoughts , to me , being explicit is important .
You might have different ideas on what constitutes ‘ nice ’ code , but if you get nothing else out if it I hope you will at least agree with this .
The way to get others to leave your code in a better state than they found it , is to make it worthy of improvement in the first place !
If we all strive towards that , ultimately , everyone will be better off for it .

89 year old Russell C. tells how he was blown up in a tank , and avoided capture , just inside the German border , 65 years ago .
I went back to Ohio to visit my mom on her 90th birthday , and she introduced me to her " boyfriend " .
I thought his stories were too important not to preserve and share .
A colorful character with detailed memories of WWII .
Even after having his leg shattered , and his hearing impaired , he went back to his company to give the Germans some more .
Dont take my word for it :
“ President Obama may mouth very different rhetoric , ” said Anthony D. Romero , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ He may have a more complicated process with members of Congress .
But in the end , there is no substantive break from the policies of the Bush administration . ”
Americanly Yours ,

The most massive known black hole in the universe has been discovered , weighing in with the mass of 18 billion Suns .
Observing the orbit of a smaller black hole around this monster has allowed astronomers to test Einstein ’s theory of general relativity with stronger gravitational fields than ever before .
The black hole is about six times as massive as the previous record holder and in fact weighs as much as a small galaxy .
It lurks 3.5 billion light years away , and forms the heart of a quasar called OJ287 .
A quasar is an extremely bright object in which matter spiralling into a giant black hole emits copious amounts of radiation .
But rather than hosting just a single colossal black hole , the quasar appears to harbour two – a setup that has allowed astronomers to accurately ‘ weigh ’ the larger one .
The smaller black hole , which weighs about 100 million Suns , orbits the larger one on an oval - shaped path every 12 years .
It comes close enough to punch through the disc of matter surrounding the larger black hole twice each orbit , causing a pair of outbursts that make OJ287 suddenly brighten .

General relativity predicts that the smaller hole ’s orbit itself should rotate , or precess , over time , so that the point at which it comes nearest its neighbour moves around in space – an effect seen in Mercury ’s orbit around the Sun , albeit on a smaller scale .
Bright outbursts
In the case of OJ287 , the tremendous gravitational field of the larger black hole causes the smaller black hole ’s orbit to precess at an incredible 39° each orbit .
The precession changes where and when the smaller hole crashes through the disc surrounding its larger sibling .
About a dozen of the resulting bright outbursts have been observed to date , and astronomers led by Mauri Valtonen of Tuorla Observatory in Finland have analysed them to measure the precession rate of the smaller hole ’s orbit .
That , along with the period of the orbit , suggests the larger black hole weighs a record 18 billion Suns .
A couple of other black holes have been estimated to be as massive , but their masses are less certain , says Valtonen .
That ’s because the estimates were based on the speed of gas clouds around the black holes , and it is not clear whether the clouds are simply passing by the black holes or actually orbiting them .
But Tod Strohmayer of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland , US , says he is not convinced that Valtonen ’s team has really measured the mass of the large black hole in OJ287 accurately .
That ’s because only a handful of the outbursts have been measured with high precision , making it difficult to determine if the precession scenario is responsible for the outbursts .
“ Obviously , if subsequent timings continue to agree with the model , then that would provide further support , ” he told New Scientist .
No limit
Just how big can black holes get ?
Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas in Austin , US , says it depends only on how long a black hole has been around and how fast it has swallowed matter in order to grow .
“ There is no theoretical upper limit , ” he says .
The new research also tested another prediction of general relativity – that the black holes should spiral towards each other as they radiate energy away in the form of gravitational waves , or ripples in space .
This radiation affects the timing of the disc crossings and their accompanying outbursts .
The most recent outburst occurred on 13 September 2007 , as predicted by general relativity .
“ If there was no orbital decay , the outburst would have been 20 days later than when it actually happened , ” Valtonen told New Scientist , adding that the black holes are on track to merge within 10,000 years .
Wheeler says the observations of the outbursts fit closely with the expectations from general relativity .
“ The fact that you can fit Einstein ’s theory [ so well ] … is telling you that that ’s working , ” he says .
The research was presented on Wednesday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin , Texas , US .
Câmeras de segurança de uma agência bancária da Vila Ré , na Zona Leste de São Paulo , registraram toda a ação de uma quadrilha suspeita de furtar caixas eletrônicos na cidade .
Para retirar os equipamentos do chão , os criminosos , armados com fuzis , usaram picaretas e destruíram a agência bancária .
Veja o site do SPTV
As gravações mostram tudo : do momento em que o bando invade a agência até o instante em que os equipamentos recheados de dinheiro são levados embora .
A partir da análise das imagens , a Delegacia de Roubo a Bancos conseguiu identificar e prender três integrantes .
Eles têm passagem por assalto de agência bancária .
Segundo a polícia , eles furtavam caixas eletrônicos em São Paulo , no interior do estado e no Paraná .
A investigação descobriu que o próximo passo era atacar um banco em Foz do Iguaçu .
No total , quatro câmeras registraram as imagens .
A invasão foi tática , e lembra uma ação policial .
Todos os envolvidos estão de preto , com os rostos cobertos e fuzis nas mãos .
Pouco sobrou dos caixas eletrônicos .
Divisórias foram arrebentadas , cabos destruídos e fios cortados .
Foram necessários cinco minutos de muito esforço para soltar parte do equipamento .
As cenas se repetem com o caixa ao lado , até que a máquina vai para o chão .
Em tempo real , o que ocorria dentro do banco era comunicado por celular para os criminosos que davam cobertura do lado de fora .
O mesmo ladrão que não tira o telefone da orelha abre uma das portas de vidro , e a outra é espatifada .
Depois , um carro com baú encostou no local , preparado para levar um dos caixas , com R$ 100 mil .
Um dos chefes do bando , de capacete branco , ordena que o serviço seja terminado em outro equipamento .
Ele exige reforço de outros homens , e a agência fica cheia .
Nesse momento , podem ser contadas 25 pessoas no local .
Após a retirada do segundo caixa , outro carro encosta na agência e leva o equipamento , também com R$ 100 mil .
A ação toda durou pelo menos 15 minutos .
Pedestres que passavam pela rua da agência aparecem do lado de fora nas imagens , com as mãos para o alto .
A agência não tinha vigilantes , apenas um alarme .
Entretanto , quando a Polícia Militar chegou , já era tarde .
Os policiais encontraram a agência destruída , mas nenhum vestígio dos ladrões .
De acordo com a polícia , as ações eram planejadas em uma casa que a quadrilha alugou no bairro do Valo Velho , na Zona Sul da capital .
No local , foi encontrado um agasalho usado por um dos presentes no ataque à agência da Vila Ré. Também foram apreendidas armas , coletes da Polícia Civil , um colete à prova de balas e uma máquina eletrônica de contar dinheiro .
Os presos ainda são suspeitos de envolvimento no assassinato de dois PMs no fim de abril , em Santo André , no ABC .
Na ocasião , o carro dos policiais foi atingido por mais de 50 tiros de fuzil .

Time is of the essence and senators can vote as early as today on whether to add an amendment to Defense Authorization Bill that would also pass the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act ( S. 909 ) .
The house has previously passed the bill in April and President Obama promises to sign the bill into law should it reach his desk .
This bill expands the coverage of existing hate crime laws to include hate crimes based on the victim 's actual or perceived sexual orientation , gender , gender identity , or disability .
It also provides the federal government jurisdiction to prosecute hate crimes in states where current law or local law enforcement action are inadequate .
Click here to find contact info for your two state senators and urge them to vote in the affirmative or call ( 202 ) 224-3121 and ask the operator to connect you to your senators .

Mac OS X Trojan Attack Changes DNS Settings
Researchers spot new variant of malware that prepares machines for botnet recruitment and other cybercrime uses
A new Trojan attack aimed at Mac OS X machines poses as a media player update but instead changes the Domain Name Service ( DNS ) settings on the victim 's machine .
Researchers at Trend Micro recently spotted the Trojan , which poses as a QuickTime Player update and goes by the fake name " MacCinema Installer , " in the wild .
It 's a new variant of an existing Trojan , but with a twist : " What 's interesting is that it 's a DNS - changing Trojan " for Mac OS X , says David Perry , global director of education for Trend Micro .
Perry says the malware , which Trend Micro has identified as OSX_JAHLAV.D , is basically a stage one infection , meaning that it 's likely more a way for cybercrime brokers to set up infected machines for sale later .
" The reason they get DNS control is so that later in the game you can sell these assets to a criminal enterprise , " which can then change the DNSes and redirect the infected machines , he says .
" We do n't know the ultimate use of the machine ... but it 's being set up to sell later . "
The good news is that the attack does n't really do any major damage -- yet -- and it 's fairly simple to clean it up .
Trend suggests dragging and dropping " MacCinema " in the Mac trash box and then changing your machine 's DNS settings to " auto . "
" This version just changes your DNS .
That 's just stage one , " says Jamz Yaneza , threat research manager for Trend Micro .
But the machine is basically set to be automatically updated by the bad guys , although this version of the Trojan does n't do so at this time , he says .
While the conventional wisdom is that Macs do n't get viruses , this attack shows they are n't immune from attack , says .
" That might be true [ that Macs do n't get viruses ] , but they get Trojans and everything else , " he says .

“ It ’s organic and informal , and it ’s on our terms , ” said Nancy Manahan of Minneapolis , who helped care for her sister - in - law , Diane Manahan , after she died of cancer in 2001 , and was a co-author of a book , “ Living Consciously , Dying Gracefully , ” about the experience .
“ It ’s not having strangers intruding into the privacy of the family .
It ’s not outsourcing the dying process to professionals . ”
While only a tiny portion of the nation ’s dead are cared for at home , the number is growing .
There are at least 45 organizations or individuals nationwide that help families with the process , compared with only two in 2002 , Mr. Slocum said .
The cost of a death midwife , as some of the coaches call themselves , varies from about $ 200 for an initial consultation to $ 3,000 if the midwife needs to travel .
In Connecticut , Indiana , Louisiana , Michigan , Nebraska and New York , laws require that a funeral director handle human remains at some point in the process .
In the 44 other states and the District of Columbia , loved ones can be responsible for the body themselves .

Families are typically required to obtain the death certificate and a burial transit permit so the body can be moved from a hospital to a cemetery , or , more typically , a crematory .
But even in states where a funeral director is required , home funerals are far less expensive .
“ I think with our economy being the way that it currently is , and it ’s getting worse , that many people who may not have chosen to do these types of things may be forced to because of the finances , ” said Verlene McLemore , of Detroit , who held a home funeral for her son , Dean , in 2007 .
She spent about $ 1,300 for a funeral director ’s services .
The cloud ships that could cancel out effects of global warming this century for £ 5.3 bn
Special ships that create clouds by spraying seawater into the air could be the most cost effective way of tackling climate change , new research has found .
The technique , known as marine cloud whitening , would create clouds above the Pacific Ocean that would have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight away from Earth .
A wind - powered fleet of nearly 2,000 ships would criss - cross the sea , sucking up sea water and spraying it upwards through tall funnels .
' When you spray saltwater into the air , you create nuclei that cloud condenses around , creating bigger and whiter clouds , thus bouncing more sunlight back into space , ' said David Young from the think - tank that commissioned the study .
Lonely as a cloud :
A flotilla of 1,900 ships would cruise the Pacific creating clouds to reduce ocean warming
The paper by Professor Eric Bickel and Lee Lane looked into the costs of potential climate engineering projects .
It was commissioned by the Copenhagen Consensus Centre that advises governments how to spend aid money .
It found that cloud whitening would effectively wipe out the effects of climate change this century for no more than £ 5.3 billion .
This is a fraction of the £ 150 billion that leading nations are considering to spend cutting CO2 emissions each year .
It is also more than 25 times cheaper than the £ 140 billion cost of developing the alternative of stratospheric aerial insertion .
This scheme would mimic the cooling effect of volcanoes by creating a hazy layer of particles like soot , which would scatter and absorb sunlight creating a cooling effect for at least a year .
The final suggestion considered was the plan to deploy tiny sunshades into space to shield Earth from some of the Sun 's rays .
However , this was discounted due to its astronomical cost of £ 236 trillion .
The authors also compared the overall cost of the schemes with the cost benefits that reducing temperatures would have .
These would include the human costs on health , impact on different industries such as agriculture and tourism and the effect of flooding .
They found every £ 1 spent on stratospheric aerosols would reap £ 15 of benefits , however every £ 1 spent on cloud whitening would bring £ 2,000 of benefits .
The Sarychev Volcano on the Kuril Islands is snapped by the International Space Station .
A £ 140 billion scheme would mimic the effects of such clouds to reduce global temperatures
The authors argued both of these technologies would have an immediate impact on global - warming , while we can expect a major lag between making carbon cuts and seeing a reduction in world temperatures .
They added that developing non-fossil fuel energy sources will take a very long time .
Although hybrid and electric vehicles are available in Britain , they are still a niche market despite government incentives to ' go green . '
David King said : ' Marine cloud whitening could achieve as much for the planet as carbon cuts would , but at a fraction of the cost . '
But he warned that these techniques should not be viewed as a replacement for long - term solutions to tackling climate change .
' It 's important to note that this technology would n't reduce carbon emissions or tackle the causes of global warming , but would mask its effects , ' he said .
Air France 447 may have crashed due to computer error
Experts are now suggesting that , while there is no definitive proof as of yet , the most probable cause of Air France Flight 447 ‘s downfall could have been massive system - wide computer failure .
Modern aircraft systems are now mostly run on automatic computer commands , with minimal human intervention .
Newer generation pilots are trained from this at the get - go , so unlike pilots from past decades , they may be more hesitant to actually swim into the controls should an aircraft ’s computer systems malfunction , reports the Wall Street Journal .
Analysis of the accident suggests that the plane may have flown into a thunderstorm , which threw the metrics of the plane ’s computers off .
Evidence points to the idea that pilots tried to regain control of the plane as the plane was breaking apart due to great speed .
This can be attributed to two similar cases involving Airbus A330 jets , the jet model of Flight 447 .
US investigators have disclosed last Thursday that a Northwest Airlines A330 flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo just this week reported computer malfunctions right after flying through a small storm .
The flight suffered air - speed function failure , which resulted in severe system malfunction .
Fortunately , the pilots managed to land the plane safely .

The 2010 Chevrolet Camaro is off to an impressive start in the U.S. , with inventories sold out in spite of the general economic slowdown .
The resurrected muscle car will get the opportunity to repeat this success overseas , as GM has confirmed that the Camaro will be sold in Europe .
No on - sale dates or pricing have been released .
Auto Motor und Sport reports that Jurgen Keller , general manager at Chevrolet Germany , confirmed GM 's plans to export the Camaro to Europe .
Sale dates will likely be forthcoming as production catches up .
There 's no word as to which of the Camaro 's three available engines will make the leap across the Atlantic .
In the U.S. , the Camaro is available with a 304 - horsepower 3.6 liter V6 and a choice of 400 or 426 - horsepower 6.2 liter V8s , depending on transmission choice .
GM 's fuel - saving Active Fuel Management is available on the 400 - horse V8 .
The Camaro also sports a four - wheel independent suspension and available stability control .
The ride and handling are uniquely American , a fact that will be considered a good thing to some European buyers and a bad thing to others .
Possible styling changes to meet Euro regulations have also not been discussed .
U.S. pricing for the Camaro starts at $ 23,040 for the V6 and $ 35,425 for the V8 - powered SS .
That 's about € 16,400 and € 25,215 , respectively .
GM has not yet released German or any other European pricing information for an exported Camaro .

Chancellor Alistair Darling has come out against calls for a new commission to curb " excessive " pay .
One hundred public figures joined a pressure group 's campaign for a High Pay Commission , to act as a watchdog over high City salaries .
The centre - left Compass group 's campaign called for steps such as maximum wage ratios and bonus taxes .
Mr Darling said he was " not persuaded by that " , but criticised the culture of huge bonuses at banks .
The campaign compared the wage levels of the highly - remunerated to those of employees who worked a 40 - hour week earning the minimum wage .
It argued someone earning the minimum wage would have to work for about 226 years to receive the same annual pay as a FTSE 100 boss .
' Unjust rewards '
The campaign 's backers include Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable and Labour MP Jon Cruddas , who argue that high levels of pay and bonuses led to the financial crisis .
The group urging for control over pay issued a joint statement , which said the " unjust rewards " of a few hundred " masters of the universe " exacerbated the risks to which the British economy was exposed .
But Mr Darling said it was not the government 's role to interfere in wage negotiations .

" I do think that government has a role in trying to stop undesirable practices , such as excessive risk - taking through bonus payments in the banking system where we all stand to lose if that goes wrong , " Mr Darling said .
" But generally , I think that pay agreements ought to be reached by employers and employees meeting together . "
The Conservatives were similarly unimpressed : " It is one thing ensuring city pay structures do n't jeopardise the banking system - and quite another trying to reintroduce a prices and incomes policy across the economy , " said shadow chancellor George Osborne .
Public anger
The campaign said that in the same way that the Low Pay Commission was set up in 1997 to advise on the minimum wage , a High Pay Commission was needed to introduce " a wide - ranging review " of pay at the top and bring in new measures to curb excessive remuneration .
" Remuneration and performance pay cycles are too short ; rewards for failure are too great , to the detriment of the long - term future of these companies and the wider economy , " the campaign argued .
" There is no justification for massive pay and bonus awards in financial institutions , the most important of which are guaranteed or owned or have been rescued by the taxpayer , " Mr Cable said .
Concern over high bonuses is not new , but it has prompted anger in recent months , at a time when the global economy has been in recession .
Much of the fury has been directed towards the possibility that the same banks that played a crucial role in the financial crisis and received state aid will , in time , return to handing out large bonuses while workers in the general economy still suffer .
Media reports on Monday suggested Barclays was seeking to hire five JP Morgan bankers with bonus deals totalling £ 30 m .
JP Morgan declined to comment .
Separately , the Times said Barclays paid million of pounds to its head of Barclaycard , Anthony Jenkins , for a role that never came to fruition .
Barclays declined to comment on both reports .
Global issue G20 leaders addressed the topic of bonuses and high pay at their meeting in London in April .
One member nation , France , has been particularly vociferous on the topic .
Christine Lagarde , France 's finance minister , told French radio on Monday : " What we need to collectively eradicate is this rat race - the race for bonuses . "
The US House of Representatives has voted in favour of laws to prevent banks paying bonuses that encourage excessive risk - taking .
However , the British Bankers ' Association has said pay rules are already " more stringent " in the UK than in any other country .

Guaranty Financial Group warned its Guaranty Bank of Austin , with $ 2.1 billion in uninsured deposits , would ' not be able to continue as a going concern . '
Guaranty Financial Group
( GFG )
signaled its Guaranty Bank of Austin probably would " not be able to continue as a going concern , " after the holding restated the bank 's first - quarter financial statements late Thursday .
Guaranty Financial was directed by the Office of Thrift Supervision to announce a $ 1.5 billion writedown of private mortgage - backed securities , as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $ 107 million .
This left Guaranty Bank with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of - 5.78 % and a total risk - based capital ratio was - 5.52 % as of March 31 .
These ratios need to be at least a positive 5 % and 10 % for most banks and S&Ls to be considered well - capitalized under
regulatory capital
guidelines .
Under an OTS cease and desist order from April 6 , the bank was required to raise capital sufficient for it to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8 % and a total risk - based capital ratio of 11 % .
The company said that the OTS and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were still pursuing " potential alternatives for the business of the bank .
Any such transaction would not be expected to result in the receipt of any proceeds by the stockholders of the company . "
Guaranty Financial also said that its board of directors had complied with an OTS request for it to consent to handing the FDIC operating control of Guaranty Bank , although this had not yet occurred .
" In the meantime , the board continues to function , but the OTS is exercising a significant degree of control over what had heretofore been the functions of the board , " the company said .
Guaranty Bank had $ 13.4 billion in total assets as of March 31 and 164 branch offices .
The thrift also reported uninsured deposits totaling $ 2.1 billion .
TheStreet.com Ratings
had assigned Guaranty Bank a financial strength rating of E - plus ( very weak ) based on the original March 31 Thrift Financial Report , which showed the institution was adequately capitalized .
The rating has been downgraded to an E - minus , and will soon be update on

Much of the water used in paddy fields is pumped from underground
Parts of India are on track for severe water shortages , according to results from Nasa 's gravity satellites .
The Grace mission discovered that in the country 's north - west - including Delhi - the water table is falling by about 4 cm ( 1.6 inches ) per year .
Writing in the journal Nature , they say rainfall has not changed , and water use is too high , mainly for farming .
The finding is published two days after an Indian government report warning of a potential water crisis .
That report noted that access to water was one of the main factors governing the pace of development in the world 's second most populous nation .
The situation has to stop today or tomorrow
Dr Raj Gupta
CIMMYT
New crops needed to avoid famines
About a quarter of India is experiencing drought conditions , as the monsoon rains have been weaker and later than usual .
But weather and climatic factors are not responsible for water depletion in the northwestern states of Rajasthan , Haryana and Punjab , according to the Nasa study .
" We looked at the rainfall record and during this decade , it 's relatively steady - there have been some up and down years but generally there 's no drought situation , there 's no major trend in rainfall , " said Matt Rodell , a hydrologist at Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center near Washington DC .
" So naturally we would expect the groundwater level to stay where it is unless there is an excessive stress due to people pumping too much water , which is what we believe is happening . "
State of Grace The Grace ( Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment ) mission uses two satellites flying along the same orbit , one just in front of the other .
Minute differences in the Earth 's gravitational pull cause the two craft to shift slightly in their positions relative to one another .
The Grace satellites provide a twin eye on Earth gravity
Grace twins measure ' potato ' Earth
The mission can measure groundwater depletion because the amount of water in aquifers has a small gravitational attraction for the satellites .
Three years ago , Grace scientists noted a loss of water in parts of Africa - but the Indian result is more striking .
" Over the six - year timeframe of this study , about 109 cubic kilometres of water were depleted from this region - more than double the capacity of India 's largest reservoir is gone between 2002 and 2008 , " Dr Rodell told the BBC .
The northwest of India is heavily irrigated ; and the Indian government 's State of the Environment report , published on Tuesday , noted that irrigation increased rice yields seven - fold in some regions compared to rain - fed fields .
Dr Raj Gupta , a scientist working for the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ( CIMMYT ) , said that the current drought would lead to more groundwater extraction .
" Farmers receive no rains so they are pumping a lot more water than the government expected , so the water table will fall further , " he said .
" The farmers have to irrigate , and that 's why they 're pumping more water , mining more water .
The situation has to stop today or tomorrow . "
Dr Gupta noted that some farmers might be able to switch from rice to crops that demand less water , such as maize or sorghum .
But , he said , that would depend on government policies - which have traditionally promoted rice - and on market demand .
Climate change is likely to be a constraint too , with the area of South Asia suitable for wheat forecast to halve over the next 50 years .

The Trans - Taiga Road is a gravel road that runs 666 km east from near the top end of the James Bay Road .
It was built to access the various dams and generating stations that extend upriver along the La Grande River .
This is an extremely remote road , leading 666 km east - almost to Labrador - with no settlements or towns aside from Hydro Quebec 's settlements for workers ( not open to the public ) .
At the far end you will be 745 km from the nearest town !
This is the farthest you can get from a town on a road in North America !
( Not counting the private Hydro Quebec towns that are not open to the public ) .
Along this road is also the farthest north point you can travel on a road in eastern Canada .
The road from Brisay ( km 582 ) to Caniapiscau is rougher and a 4 - wheel drive vehicle is recommended by Hydro Quebec .
The main reason for this is the very coarse gravel used for this road - there 's large rocks littering the road surface .
However , I have heard from people who have driven this road in ordinary passenger cars and they say it is fine .
You do have to keep your eyes open for the larger rocks though .
You should definitely travel this road only in a reliable vehicle with good tires .
It is not an overly rough road ; passenger vehicles can drive it , but it is gravel .
Vehicle breakdowns here can be very costly .
Flat tires can be a serious ( and expensive ) incident if your tires are damaged .
You could be looking at having tires flown in on a non-scheduled flight - there are no convenient " tire stores " up here !
Please read Driving the Trans - Taiga Road first .
Although there are no towns , there are a couple of outfitters along the way that sell fuel and offer meals and lodging .
Cell phones do not work here .
Generally the scenery is fairly level , but this road is definitely more interesting than the James Bay Road .
For most of the length it runs through taiga : spruce and jack pine forest , bogs , rocks , and low hills .
This is about all you 'll see apart from birds and some wildlife , the occasional cabin a short distance off the road , and Hydro Quebec installations .
I once saw a couple of wolves playing in the middle of this road .
This truly is a * VERY * remote road .
Do not approach a trip along it lightly .
Please read Driving the Trans - Taiga Road before traveling this road .
A week later , the ' paper of record ' fails to correct egregious ' paper ballots ' error in endorsement editorial
Democratic Congressman's own website touts endorsement , repeats same fictitious information about bill ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/1/2009 , 1:19 pm PT
It was a " glaring inaccuracy , " according to VotersUnite.org 's Ellen Theisen last week .
Yet , even though it 's been more than a full week since the New York Times ran an editorial endorsing Rep. Rush Holt ( D - NJ ) 's new election reform bill ( H.R. 2894 ) , in which they included a huge factual error about the legislation , they have failed to issue a correction .
Neither have they even bothered to respond to letters to the editor detailing the error , sent to them when we first pointed out the problem last week .
While several aspects of their editorial misled readers about the bill , as we detailed in our original article , one assertion made by the " paper of record " was just out and out incorrect , when they erroneously asserted the following :
Mr. Holt 's bill would require paper ballots to be used for every vote cast in November 2010 .
On that point , the Times is just plain wrong .
Any reading of the bill would quickly reveal as much .
Theisen would later call it a " complete misrepresentation . "
While the bill , as currently written , would require Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting machines to print " paper trails " ( otherwise known as " voter verifiable paper audit trails " or " VVPAT " ) by 2010 , it decidely does not " require a paper ballot to be used for every vote cast in November 2010 . "
Paper ballots for every voter will not be required by Holt 's bill , as it's currently written , and as it's been introduced in the House , until 2014 .
That 's two federal elections away , including one Presidential election .
The Times is off by four years in their assertion .
That the NYTimes --- again , known as the " paper of record " for a reason --- would get something as important as that blatantly wrong in an editorial endorsing such a sweeping piece of legislation , is rather incredible in the first place .
That they 've not bothered to issue a correction , or even respond to a letter pointing out the error , is mind - boggling .
But their appears at least one reason --- though hardly an excuse --- that the Times might have gotten it so wrong .
Congressman
Holt makes the same wholly erroneous assertion about his own bill on his own Congressional webpage ...
One might think that Holt himself would have notified the Times about such an egregious error , particularly since his office and his supporters have been touting the Times endorsement .
Apparently they have n't .
( Two aides failed to respond to request for comment on this article , though in both cases we received auto - reply emails stating they were gone from the office until after the 4th of July Congressional recess . )
But what 's worse is Holt 's own website making the same incorrect assertion as seen in the Times editorial !
In a bullet point list , described as a " Bill Summary , " Holt 's web page touting the bill , asserts that it :
• Requires a voter - marked or ballot - marking - device paper ballot be produced for every vote cast in time for the November 2010 elections .
That first bullet point is belied by the very next one , which says the legislation [ emphasis added ] :
• Provides that printer - equipped electronic voting systems used in 2008 elections can be used after 2010 but are to be replaced with paper ballots before the first federal election in 2014 .
So in admitting that jurisdictions will not have to offer paper ballots to voters until " the first federal election in 2014 , " it would appear that his office is simply trying to mislead voters about the legislation .
All of this is no small point .
DREs with " paper trails " are no more reliable , or verifiable , than DREs without " paper trail " printers .
Only voter - marked paper ballots can be known to reflect the voters ' verified intent ( presuming chain of custody is kept securely ) .
Holt knows this , which is why his legislation calls for a paper ballot for every voter by 2014 .
" They 're not correct .
That is a complete misrepresentation of the bill , " Ellen Theisen of VotersUnite.org , a non-partisan election watchdog organization told us during a segment of the nationally syndicated Mike Malloy
Show when we were guest hosting last week and asked her about the Times ' editorial .
We had n't yet realized , at the time , that Holt 's own office had been publicizing the same misrepresentation of his bill .
She pointed out the Times ' error as a " glaring inaccuracy " in her " Daily Voting News " newsletter last week , " hoping that they would pick up on the fact that they misrepresented the bill , " as she explained on the radio .
" There could be a lot of people out there thinking ' Yay !
We 'll have all paper ballots by 2010 !'
Not realizing [ that 's ] not so , " she told us .
VotersUnite.org had previously endorsed this year 's version of the bill , before withdrawing their endorsement after a last - minute change to a portion of the bill dealing with voting systems for disabled voters .
Clip from interview with Theisen on this point from the Malloy Show , 6/26/09 , [ appx . 1.5 mins ] ...
[ The entire interview with Theisen , discussing other aspects of the Holt bill , and related election matters , can be heard here , in the ' HOUR 1 ' archive , beginning at the : 22 minute mark ]
The BRAD BLOG has gone out of our way to be incredibly fair in our continuing analysis of Holt 's bill as it's changed over the years .
By way of full disclosure , we were even asked to help with several drafts of the 2007 version of the bill before its introduction , even though we could not endorse that version of the bill due to its many failures , a fair number of them improved in the latest version .
Our most recent analysis of this year 's version , filed just before it was introduced this year , notes both the good and bad it offers .
That Holt 's office still seems to feel it necessary to deceive the public is disturbing , at best .
Regrettably , its not the first time they 've employed such tactics .
That the New York Times appears to have been lazy enough to work from Holt 's talking points , rather than bothering to read the actual bill itself before endorsing it on its pages , represents our corporate media at its absolutely most shameful .
Failing to issue a correction , even after the problem has been pointed out to them , is simply beyond the pale .
The version of Holt 's " Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2009 " ( HR 2894 ) as recently introduced in the U.S.
House , can be read here .

UPDATE 7/15/09 :
It 's now been nearly a month since the Times ' published its inaccurate editorial endorsement , and yet they have still failed to publish a correction .
Rep .
Holt , however , has slightly amended his website in response to the concerns expressed above .

Scientists and journalists alike have been conjuring up different ways to scare the shit out of people for decades , their favorite probably being convincing the public that almost everything they come into contact with causes some form of cancer .
Most of these cancer scares are baseless or at least grossly exaggerated , which unfortunately does nothing to diminish their popularity .
We 're talking about things like ...

The Myth
It all started in 1993 when a man filed a lawsuit against his cell phone company , claiming that his deceased wife 's constant cell phone use gave her a brain tumor .
He claimed that the tumor was " antenna - shaped " and it was on the side of her head .
That 's how cancer works , right ?
Despite this ironclad testimony , the case was immediately dismissed because of lack of evidence ( and an abundance of what legal experts refer to as " not evidence " ) .
The damage had been done , however , and the cell phone industry suffered a public relations disaster , costing them $ 25 million worth of research to crush the allegation .

Why It 's Bullshit
There have been literally hundreds of studies done about cell phone use and cancer since 1993 , most with inconclusive results .
The problem is that cell phones have only been around for a short period of time , long enough to perfect downloading episodes of The Sopranos but not quite enough to determine whether or not the device is x-raying your brain .
Despite the temporary setback , large case - control studies have given enough evidence to researchers worldwide for them to conclude with relative certainty that cell phones wo n't give you a tumor unless you 're sending a Tweet on your BlackBerry from the Bikini Atoll .

The case - control studies examined both people with and without brain cancer and compared all of their past cell phone usage , finding no link between the two .
Also , there was no link between what side of the head the cancer was on and what side the cell phone was used , though there was an alarming connection between patients with severe brain tumors and wallpaper downloads from the Fast & Furious movies .
Artificial trees and tubes of algae on the sides of buildings could absorb most of the UK 's annual carbon dioxide emissions , according to a report from engineers that will be circulated at party conferences in the autumn .
In research examining the role that geo-engineering could play in tackling climate change , a 12 - month study by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers ( IME ) also found that painting city roofs white could also prove to be a simple but effective way to curb excessive global warming .
Geo-engineering is a set of technologies that could prevent or slow global warming - it includes everything from sending mirrors into space to reflect away sunlight to dumping iron into the oceans to encourage the growth of algae , thereby removing atmospheric CO2 .
For their study , the IME searched for ideas that were most practical and could have impacts on CO2 or global energy use levels as soon as possible .
Setting out their recommendations in a report published today , the IME called on the British government to put up £ 10 m aimed at turning the three most promising ideas into reality .
They advocate this being part of a £ 100 m global fund for geo-engineering research .
" Geo-engineering is no silver bullet , it just buys us time , " said Tim Fox of the IME , who led the study .
" We 're not proposing that geo - engineering should be a substitute for mitigation [ but ] should be implemented alongside mitigation and adaptation . "
Top of their list of practical solutions that would be low - carbon to build and require only existing technologies were artificial trees .
These units , invented by Columbia University scientist Klaus Lackner , would be the size of a standard shipping container and could remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere .
" 100,000 trees would take up an area of around 600 hectares , which is less than 10 % of the surface area of the Firth of Forth , and that would be able to absorb the CO2 emissions of the UK 's non-power sector annually , " said Fox .
Currently the UK produces 556 megatonnes of CO2 per year and the 100,000 trees could absorb around 60 % of that amount .
The engineers calculated that forests of artificial trees powered by renewable energy and located near depleted oil or gas fields , where the trapped CO2 could be buried , would be thousands of times more efficient than planting trees over the same area .
Making each artificial tree would require energy and materials but this would only account for 5 % of the CO2 that the device could capture in its lifetime .
On a global scale , between 5 - 10 m artificial trees could absorb the CO2 emitted from all sources other than power stations .
Another geo-engineering solution highlighted by the engineers was attaching tubes filled with algae to the sides of buildings .
" Algae is a naturally - occurring eco-friendly biomass that tends to have a high level of CO2 use in photosynthesis , " said Tom Bowman of IME .
The algae that grows can be collected and turned into charcoal , which can be buried so that the CO2 it has captured is locked away from the atmosphere .
Painting roofs white was recommended by the engineers to counteract the urban heat island effect , where major cities can be up to 4C hotter than their suburbs .
This means more use of air conditioning or other cooling methods and it also speeds up the formation of smog .
The IME said that reflective roofs can reduce the energy use of a building by up to 60 % .
Fox said that global carbon emissions had continued to rise despite two decades of attempts at mitigation , so geo- engineering should not be regarded by policymakers as a plan B , but an integral part of the solution to global warming .
" £ 10 m would get us significantly far forward in terms of sorting out the wheat from the chaff in this debate , " he said .
" The government can then look at piloting them and testing them in the field and then making decisions about their deployment . "
AUSTIN , Texas , Aug. 21 ( UPI ) -- A
Texas lawmaker says the first draft of new standards for history books used by state schools are one - sided and feature " right - wing ideology . "
Rep .
Trey Martinez Fischer , D - San Antonio , is unhappy review committees appointed by the state board of education recommend including conservative figures such as Newt Gingrich , the Houston Chronicle reported Friday .

The board will finalize new standards next spring .
" It 's important that whatever course they take , that it portray a complete view of our history and not a jaded view to suit one 's partisan agenda or one 's partisan philosophy , " Fischer said .
The first draft says students should be expected " to identify significant conservative advocacy organizations and individuals , such as Newt Gingrich , Phyllis Schlafly and the Moral Majority . "
Texas Board of Education member Ken Mercer thinks students should study both liberals and conservatives .
Among the liberal groups Mercer recommends for inclusion are the National Education Association , MoveOn.org and Planned Parenthood .
The Silvio Berlusconi tapes released this week have focused , not surprisingly , on lurid discussions of threesomes , condoms and staying power .
But today Italy 's prime minister was facing the bizarre possibility that the most explosive secret in the recordings was neither sexual nor financial , but archaeological .
In one recording posted on the website of the news magazine L'Espresso on Thursday , Berlusconi is supposedly showing the " escort " Patrizia D'Addario around his estate on Sardinia .
He points out an ice - cream shop built for his guests and then draws her attention to an artificial lake with swans .
After noting that the lake is adorned by a fossilised whale , Berlusconi purportedly adds : " Underneath here , we found 30 Phoenician tombs from 300BC . "
This was news to the archaeological community .
And sensational news , too .
A necropolis under the estate near Porto Rotondo on the Costa Smeralda would be evidence of Phoenician settlement in an area where none were thought to have been situated .
Italy 's National Association of Archaeologists said it would be " of the utmost importance for the study of Phoenician expansion on the island " .
Of more immediate concern was why , if such an obviously important discovery had been made during the excavation of the lake , the authorities were not notified .
Government officials in nearby Olbia knew nothing about it .
This is a serious matter .
Failure to report an archaeological find within 24 hours is an offence in Italy punishable by up to 12 months in prison .
The opposition Democratic party , which had been looking for a way to embarrass the prime minister without getting immersed in his eventful sex life , was not slow to spot the opening .
Representatives in both houses of parliament tabled questions , demanding that Berlusconi and his heritage minister give an explanation .
The prime minister has already reneged on a promise to explain his relationship with a teenager and laughed off the dissemination of the recordings .
It remains to be seen whether the dead will succeed where the living have failed and force him to account for his behaviour .

I saw this on Twitter a few weeks ago , via @amyalkon , and I ’m so going to use when people claim that atheism is just another religion :
“ If atheism is a religion then not collecting stamps is a hobby . ”
Other variations might work too :
… then watching daytime soaps from your parents ’ couch is a career .
… then starvation is just a different kind of eating .
… then not giving to charity is a way of being charitable .
I still prefer the “ not collecting stamps ” version , however .
Any others ?

On June 19 , Rep . Mike Ross of Arkansas made clear that he and a group of other conservative Democrats known as the Blue Dogs were increasingly unhappy with the direction that health - care legislation was taking in the House .
" The committees ' draft falls short , " the former pharmacy owner said in a statement that day , citing , among other things , provisions that major health - care companies also strongly oppose .
Five days later , Ross was the guest of honor at a special " health - care industry reception , " one of at least seven fundraisers for the Arkansas lawmaker held by health - care companies or their lobbyists this year , according to publicly available invitations .

Our thumbscrews are our weaknesses .
In Robert Greene ’s 48 Law’s of Power , Law 33 states :
“ Discover Each Man ’s Thumbscrew .
Everyone has a weakness , a gap in the castle wall .
That weakness [… ] , once found , is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage . ”
I often review where I am in my life , and specific strengths and weaknesses I have .
Many of my articles come out of weaknesses that I have overcome , or that I am still struggling with .
With that , here are some of the specific items that I have to keep in check – ways in which I procrastinate , thumbscrews that hold me back from being my best .
[ reddit-me ]
If I have solutions to specific items on the list , I will list those as well – but I know that not all my solutions are ideal , so I could use some help .
Feel free to jump in if you have any ideas .
My Procrastination Thumbscrews
Wasting Time Online .
Facebook , Twitter , email and general RSS reading are to blame here .
Solution : I do use RescueTime to shame myself into not wasting as much time online , but I know that I can get these activities done faster every day – and when I go days without them , I do n’t miss them .
The only solution I have so far is limiting my time on them – that seems to be sufficient to not allow these activities to take over my day .
I use my start pages to focus myself as well .

Cleaning my room .
The grand daddy of all procrastination techniques .
I lump clearing my desk in with this one as well .
Solution : I do not have a good solution to this , other than to clean my room ( or hire someone to do it ) and unclutter as often as I can , so the excuse is not available to me during times I really need to be productive .
I like my room clean , so leaving it messy is not really an option .

Playing Video Games .
I ’ve never wasted weeks or months playing video games , but I have wasted more hours than I would like .
Solution : I ’ve been limiting myself to only playing video games when I am playing with a friend or a roommate , in the same room .
This is working pretty well , but I have to keep in mind that this is one of my weaknesses – and not let it get out of hand .

Playing Guitar .
Practicing guitar is a gray area for me – is it really productive ?
It ’s leisure , but perhaps it ’s useful since I am developing a skill , even if I am not a rock star .
I know I ’m procrastinating though if I am practicing a lot on days I need to get “ real work ” done .
Solution : I have set hours for guitar practice , and allow short 15 minute breaks ( with a timer ) to practice if I am in the middle of something .

Blaming External Circumstances , but not changing them .
Solution : I ’ve been dealing with things more actively lately , and this is not as much of an issue anymore .
The only long term solution I can think of is not accepting anything as non-negotiable .
One specific thing I do now is , as soon as I hit a wall I ask myself – how can I fix this , or who can I contact for help and advice ?
I do n’t let things just sit unresolved anymore .

Overloading Myself With Commitments .
When I take on too many things , if often leads to a complete stop in all my goals as progress slows to a crawl across the board .
If I ’m taking on too much , it ’s usually a sure sign that I am no longer as motivated or passionate about the activities I already have .
Solution :
This past year , I have been paring down my commitments and responsibilities , and saying no much more frequently when asked for help .
I ’m also dumping many of the commitments that I dread keeping .

Metawork .
I often undertake excessive amounts of reading , research and planning rather than just doing it .
As someone who likes to be extremely prepared , this is one of the hardest habits for me to break .
Solution : Setting a deadline for ending research and settling for good versus perfect are ways I control the amount of metawork I do for tasks .

Watching Television .
This was one of my weaknesses when I was young ( 12 years old or so ) .
I remember my father hooked up a contraption to our TV that allowed us only 8 hours of television watching per week .
In retrospect , this may have stopped us from watching TV , but the scarcity made us value watching TV even more .
Solution :
The main way I stopped watching so much television was taking up additional hobbies , sports and especially playing guitar .
Any advice or thoughts ?
Or do you have any procrastination thumbscrews of your own you would like to add ?

If it 's not Moloch 's altar and you 're not chaotic , your luck is unaffected ( so far ) , but you 've destroyed the altar and angered the priest .

A random demon lord between Juiblex and Yeenoghu inclusive is chosen up to 20 times , in an attempt to find one that has not been created already .
Unless the altar is unaligned , the alignment of the demon lord must match the alignment of the altar .
Currently , Yeenoghu follows Juiblex in monst.c .
Thus only these two demon lords are eligible to appear .
They are both chaotic .
Otherwise a random demon is chosen up to 20 times , respecting extinction and with the same alignment requirements .
If there is space for it adjacent to you , the chosen demon appears , peaceful if it matches your alignment and hostile otherwise .
Three turns pass .
If no matching demon is found , none appears .

If you are n't chaotic , you lose 5 alignment , your god 's anger increases by three , your wisdom decreases by one point , your luck decreases by 5 , and unless you 're in Gehennom , your god potentially punishes you as for praying too much .
If you are chaotic , instead your alignment increases by 5 .
The corpse disappears , and nothing more happens for the case of sacrificing a creature of your own race .
The value of the sacrifice ( calculated immediately preceding this section ) is ignored , so sacrificing a rotten corpse of your own race ( e.g. from a zombie of your race ) has the same effect as sacrificing a fresh one .

If you try to sacrifice a pet , you lose three alignment and gain the aggravate monster intrinsic .
The pet 's corpse has a value of - 1 .
This does not apply if the pet is of your own race , in which case the code does n't reach this point ( bug ? ) .
Yes , that entire conditional is to see if it's a former pet 's corpse .
In order , it does the following : ( Note that if any step returns false , the if fails immediately and the remaining steps are not executed , which prevents lots of nasty invalid pointer dereferencing )
1 . Does the object have extra data ?
( oxlth is " Object eXtra data LengTH " )
2 .
Is the extra data that of a monster ?
3 . Get a pointer to an object containing the traits of that monster and put it in a temporary variable 4 .
Is the pointer non-null ?
5 . Was the monster tame ?

Sacrificing a unicorn on an altar aligned with it will set its sacrifice value to - 5 and reduce your wisdom by 1 .
But sacrificing a non-aligned unicorn on a coaligned altar gives you +5 alignment , and gives it +3 value .
Sacrificing a unicorn of your alignment on an altar not of your alignment sets the value to one and your alignment to - 1 ( actually worse than sacrificing on a coaligned altar ) .
Finally , sacrificing a unicorn not aligned with either you or the altar increases its value by 3 and has no other effects .

It looks as though another game has been accidentally confirmed , this time by an employee working on the title .
A resume ’ posted online has revealed Dead Space 2 is in development , stating that the employee is :
“ Currently working on ‘ Dante ’s Inferno ’ , a fantasy based game and ‘ Deadspace 2 ’ , the second installment of last year ’s critically acclaimed sci- fi horror game by Electronic Arts . ”
Dead Space was released in 2008 to stellar reviews , praised for its unmatched horror experience and incredibly good graphics .
The game has gone on to sell more then one million copies , so it ’s not surprising a sequel is in the works .
The staff at PSLS is pretty excited to see Dead Space 2 in action .
How about you guys ?

Jon Rice called the state 's expert on teaching really smart kids a few months ago and poured out his deepest worries .
His 10 - year - old daughter had just finished eighth grade , and she wanted to go to high school .
" Should n't I just let her be a kid ? " he asked .
When he hung up , Rice told his wife , Christy , what the couple already knew in their hearts .
Their little girl 's thirst for knowledge was so great and so advanced that keeping her out of high school would be a pointless effort to stall a process they had never controlled in the first place .
So , Macyn Rice , who shares a sea - theme bedroom with her 4 - year - old sister , still has some of her baby teeth and is six years away from getting her driver 's license , will start ninth grade at Cumberland Valley High School on Wednesday .
" I 'm going to feel like an ant , " said Macyn , who stands 4 - foot - 3 and weighs 50 pounds .
She said she knows other students will gawk and that she will be an outsider , at least at first .
That happened during a May tour .
Upperclassmen got wind of her visit by the end of first period , said brother , Zachare , 17 , who will be a CV senior .
" They said , ' I hear she 's 10 years old .
Is she really that smart ? ' " he said .
Actually , yeah , he told them .
" She 's taking math I took last year , " said Zachare , who also is a gifted student .
Along with honors precalculus , Macyn will take history , English , German and two honors science classes .
The state Department of Education does n't track the number of students who start high school early .
But Richard Miller , a state expert of gifted education , said she would be in a relatively small group .
Zachare will drive his sister to school , but then she 'll be on her own .
" He 's going to be in the whole other side of the school .
I 'm going to be alone , " Macyn said .
Wo n't that be too much for a kid whose age peers will be in fifth grade ?
" It flies in the face of many things we do in public education , " Miller said .
" People might say she 's going to miss her childhood . "
But this is Macyn's childhood .
" Gifted kids benefit from being able to advance according to their ability , " Miller said .
What about the social challenges ?
" She knows kids can be mean .
Her first day [ of her spring visit ] , she got made fun of , " Christy Rice said .
Macyn , a talkative girl who smiles often and laughs easily , ignored the initial teasing .
" The first day , everyone 's like , ' What are you doing here ? '
By the third day , they were like , ' Hey , can I get a picture with you ? '
They 'd take out notebooks and ask for my autograph .
Most kids were nice , " she said .
Macyn does n't show a trace of conceit .
She is n't going to high school because she thinks she 's better than other 10 - year - olds .
" It 's not that I love the idea .
I just want to get this done , " she said .
Being profoundly mentally gifted is no big deal to Macyn , even if her parents are still adjusting .
Former gifted students themselves , Jon , a department manager for an engineering firm , and Christy , who supplies in - home care for the ill and elderly and has operated a dance studio , knew early that their daughter was precocious .
They do not share their daughter 's IQ , but said , " The saying between us was , ' She 's a sponge , ' " Jon Rice said .
Macyn , who is called ' Macy " by her parents , brother and sister Marah , 4 , started kindergarten at a private school at age 4 .
Teachers said she was ready for fifth - grade work .
The next year , she went to second grade at a public school .
She received half - hour - a - week gifted services , despite testing on a seventh - grade level .
Her parents took her out at Christmas .
" I have n't been in a real school since I was 5 , " Macyn said .
Instead , she zoomed through a virtual , charter school .
Although Macyn's classes came through the Internet at home , her parents do n't teach her .
She took first place in her school 's science fair last spring .
Her entry tried to refute two Notre Dame scientists ' explanation for a noted tendency of children born in winter to be less healthy and less smart .
She filled columns with data she gathered on her own .
" Macy got ticked off because she 's a winter baby , " Christy Rice said .
While she and her husband have learned that they help Macyn most by letting her decide what to learn , they did give her a crash course on dating , drugs and other topics she 'll likely hear discussed in CV 's classrooms and cafeteria .
Christy said she wants her daughter to have as close to a normal high school experience as possible .
" I want her to go to the prom , " she said .
Wendell Potter can remember exactly when he took the first steps on his journey to becoming a whistleblower and turning against one of the most powerful industries in America .
It was July 2007 and Potter , a senior executive at giant US healthcare firm Cigna , was visiting relatives in the poverty - ridden mountain districts of northeast Tennessee .
He saw an advert in a local paper for a touring free medical clinic at a fairground just across the state border in Wise County , Virginia .
Potter , who had worked at Cigna for 15 years , decided to check it out .
What he saw appalled him .
Hundreds of desperate people , most without any medical insurance , descended on the clinic from out of the hills .
People queued in long lines to have the most basic medical procedures carried out free of charge .
Some had driven more than 200 miles from Georgia .
Many were treated in the open air .
Potter took pictures of patients lying on trolleys on rain - soaked pavements .
For Potter it was a dreadful realisation that healthcare in America had failed millions of poor , sick people and that he , and the industry he worked for , did not care about the human cost of their relentless search for profits .
" It was over - powering .
It was just more than I could possibly have imagined could be happening in America , " he told the Observer
Potter resigned shortly afterwards .
Last month he testified in Congress , becoming one of the few industry executives to admit that what its critics say is true : healthcare insurance firms push up costs , buy politicians and refuse to pay out when many patients actually get sick .
In chilling words he told a Senate committee : " I worked as a senior executive at health insurance companies and I saw how they confuse their customers and dump the sick : all so they can satisfy their Wall Street investors . "
Potter 's claims are at the centre of the biggest political crisis of Barack Obama 's young presidency .
Obama , faced with 47 million Americans without health insurance , has put reforming the system at the top of his agenda .
If he succeeds , he will have pushed through one of the greatest changes to domestic policy of any president .
If he fails , his presidency could be broken before it is even a year old .
Last week , in a sign of how high the stakes are , he addressed the nation in a live TV news conference .
It is the sort of event usually reserved for a moment of deep national crisis , such as a terrorist attack .
But Obama wanted to talk about healthcare .
" This is about every family , every business and every taxpayer who continues to shoulder the burden of a problem that Washington has failed to solve for decades , " he told the nation .
Obama 's plans are now mired and the opponents of reform are winning .
The Republican attack machine has cranked into gear , labelling reform as " socialist " and warning ordinary Americans that government bureaucrats , not doctors , will choose their medicines .
The bill 's opponents say the huge cost can only be paid by massive tax increases on ordinary Americans and that others will have their current healthcare plans taken away .
Many centrist Democratic congressmen , wary of their conservative voters , are wavering .
The legislation has failed to meet Obama 's August deadline and is now delayed until after the summer recess .
Many fear that this loss of momentum could kill it altogether .
To Potter that is no surprise .
He has seen all this before .
In his long years with Cigna he rose to be the company 's top PR executive .
He had an eagle - eye view of the industry 's tactics of scuppering political efforts to get it to reform .
" This is a very wealthy industry and they use PR very effectively .
They manipulate public opinion and the news media and they have built up these relationships with all these politicians through campaign contributions , " Potter said .
Potter was witness to the campaign against Michael Moore 's healthcare documentary Sicko .
The industry slammed the film as one - sided and politically motivated .
Secret documents leaked from the American Health Insurance Plans , the industry 's lobby group , detailed the plan to paint Moore as a fringe radical .
Potter now says the film " hit the nail on the head " .
" The Michael Moore movie that I saw was full of truth , " he admits .
Potter was also working for Cigna when it became embroiled in the case of Nataline Sarkisyan , whose family went public after Cigna refused to pay for a liver transplant that it considered " experimental " and therefore not covered by their policy .
Cigna reversed this decision only hours before the Californian teenager died .
" I wish I could have done more in that case , " Potter said .
Such sentiments are rare in an industry that has given America a healthcare system that can be cripplingly expensive for patients , but that does not produce a healthier population .
The industry is often accused of wriggling out of claims .
Firms comb medical records for any technicality that will allow them to refuse to pay .
In one recently publicised example , a retired nurse from Texas discovered she had breast cancer .
Yet her policy was cancelled because her insurers found she had previously had treatment for acne , which the dermatologist had mistakenly noted as pre-cancerous .
They decreed she had misinformed them about her medical history and her double mastectomy was cancelled just three days before the operation .
Last month three healthcare executives were grilled about such " rescinding " tactics by a congressional subcommittee .
When asked if they would abandon them except in cases of deliberately proven fraud , each executive replied simply : " No . "
To Potter that attitude has a sad logic .
The healthcare industry generates enormous profits and its top executives have a lavish corporate lifestyle that he once shared .
Treating patients for their expensive conditions is bad for business as it reduces the bottom line .
Kicking out patients who pursue claims makes perfect economic sense .
" It is a system that is rigged against the policyholder , " Potter said .
The congressional probe found that just three firms had rescinded more than 20,000 policyholders between 2003 and 2007 , saving hundreds of millions .
" That 's a lot of money that will now go towards their profits , " Potter said .
A lot of that money also goes into contributions to politicians of both parties - $ 372 m in the past nine years - and in lobbying groups to run TV ads slamming Obama 's plans .
Many of these ads deploy naked scare tactics .
One report said that the industry was spending $ 1.4 m a day on its campaign .
In the face of that , it is perhaps no wonder that the Senate has delayed its vote , dealing a massive blow to Obama .
" I have seen how the opponents of healthcare reform go to work ... they are trying to delay action .
They know that if they keep the process going for months , and turn it into a big mess , then the political impetus behind it will lessen , " Potter said .
Potter , who now works at the Centre for Media and Democracy in Wisconsin , says the industry is afraid of Obama 's reforms and that is why it is fighting so hard .
It wants to deal him the same blow as it did Bill Clinton when it scuppered his attempt at reform in the 1990s .
Potter admits that he is worried the industry might win again .
" I have seen their tactics work .
I have been a part of it , " he said .
He knows he has no chance of ever working again for a major firm .
" I am a whistleblower and corporate America does not tend to like that , " he said .
But there is one thing Potter is not sorry about : leaving the healthcare industry and speaking out .
" I have absolutely no regrets .
I am doing the right thing , " he said .
Comprehensive healthcare reform in the US has been an ambition of many presidents since the early part of the 20th century .
None has succeeded in creating a system that gives all Americans the right to coverage .
Barack Obama , below , is desperate to avoid the same fate .
Finding a cure
What is the current system ?
It is a complex mish - mash of systems .
Millions of Americans have their own private healthcare plans , either individually or through their employer .
About 47 million Americans have none .
However , systems do exist to cover the very poor and the old .
The system is fiendishly complex and full of loopholes , so even those with coverage can have it withdrawn .
How bad is it ?
US hospitals are the best in the world if you can afford them .
Many cannot , and an accident or sudden illness can often bankrupt someone .
How does it compare with other countries ?
It depends how you measure things .
The US spends about 16 % of GNP on healthcare , far more than France and Germany , which spend 11 to 12 % .
Yet those countries provide universal care .
What is the biggest problem ?
Critics say the biggest issue is the profit motive that drives US healthcare .
This ensures that costs are always rising as the incentive is there to provide expensive treatment .
It also gives health insurers the incentive to refuse treatment to claimants , by seeking to withdraw their cover .
What is Obama 's solution ?
Obama has asked Congress to draw up a government option , allowing all Americans to get some sort of cover .
The sheer size of the state plan should theoretically allow it to drive down costs by economies of scale .
What 's happening now ?
Obama has put his reputation on the line to persuade wavering Democrats and moderate Republicans to vote on legislation by August .
The Senate has said this will not happen .
That 's a major blow , as it puts off the debate until September and could see the political momentum stall .
John Amato :
Nancy Pelosi is once again vindicated by the actions of the CIA and Dick Cheney .
Darth Vader continually opens his mouth to defend his horrific actions , but as more information leaks out it 's quite obvious that he had no regard for the rule of law or the Constitution .
The new breaking story is that Cheney told the CIA to keep their mouths shut and not inform Congress of what they were up to .
This should be reviewed to see if he broke the law .
Normally this would be a shocking revelation under any other administration , but with Bush and Cheney --- this is the norm .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney directed the CIA eight years ago not to inform Congress about a nascent counterterrorism program that CIA Director Leon Panetta terminated in June , officials with direct knowledge of the matter said Saturday .
Subsequent CIA directors did not inform Congress because the intelligence - gathering effort had not developed to the point that they believed merited a congressional briefing , said a former intelligence official and another government official familiar with Panetta 's June 24 briefing to the House and Senate Intelligence committees .
Panetta did not agree .
Upon learning of the program June 23 from within the CIA , Panetta terminated it and the next day called an emergency meeting with the House and Senate Intelligence committees to inform them of the program and that it was canceled .
From Fox News Sunday , Dianne Feinstein and John Cornyn are asked about the recent revelation that the CIA was asked by the Bush administration not to reveal one of their programs to members of Congress .
FEINSTEIN : Oh , I think this is a problem , obviously .
This is a big problem , because the law is very clear .
And I understand the need of the day , which was when America was in shock , when we had been hit in a way we ’d never contemplated , where we had massive loss of life , where there was a major effort to be able to respond and -- but this -- see , I do n’t -- I think you weaken your case when you go outside of the law .
Feinstein feels the concealment may have broken the law and has no problems with Attorney Gen .
Holder appointing an independent I.G. to investigate the Bush administrations interrogation methods .
Cornyn's response is predictable .
WALLACE : In our final moments , I want to turn to another subject , and this involves your role , Senator Feinstein , as chair of the Intelligence Committee .
CIA director Panetta briefed you recently on an 8 - year - old program that he had stopped but that Congress had never been told about .
Now there are reports that Vice President Cheney ordered the CIA not to tell Congress about it .
One , should Congress have been told about this program , which apparently was never fully implemented ?
And what do you make of the vice president ’s apparent role in telling the CIA not to brief Congress ?
FEINSTEIN : The answer is yes , Congress should have been told .
We should have been briefed before the commencement of this kind of sensitive program .
Director Panetta did brief us two weeks ago -- I believe it was on the 24th of June -- said he had just learned about the program , described it to us , indicated that he had canceled it and , as had been reported , did tell us that he was told that the vice president had ordered that the program not be briefed to the Congress .
This is ...
WALLACE : And what do you think of that ?
FEINSTEIN : Oh , I think this is a problem , obviously .
This is a big problem , because the law is very clear .
And I understand the need of the day , which was when America was in shock , when we had been hit in a way we ’d never contemplated , where we had massive loss of life , where there was a major effort to be able to respond and -- but this -- see , I do n’t -- I think you weaken your case when you go outside of the law .
And I think that if the Intelligence Committees had been briefed , they could have watched the program .
They could have asked for regular reports on the program .
They could have made judgments about the program as it went along .
That was not the case because we were kept in the dark .
That ’s something that should never , ever happen again .
In typical Fox News fashion , when we asked a Fox News writer how a Central Park cyclist ended up being dragged on the hood of his SUV for four blocks , he blamed the victim , calling the biker a " vigilante . "
Brian Dooda , a Brooklyn film archivist , was riding his bike on East Dr. in Central Park at about 5 p.m. on Thursday when he says a grey SUV cut him off , nearly swiping his front tire .
Angered , Dooda caught up with the car , which had " NYP " license plates designating its driver as a media representative , at the next red light .
He positioned himself in front of the SUV and told the driver to slow down and observe the park's 25 m.p.h. speed limit .
Here 's what happened next , according to an account Dooda gave to the NYPD and posted on a cycling message board :
The driver then accelerated , lunging straight into me , knocking me and my bicycle to the ground and to the left side of his car .
I quickly got to my feet and positioned myself in front of his vehicle to prevent him from fleeing the scene .
I called out to bystanders to call the police and yelled at the driver that he was insane , he just hit me , and he can't leave .
The driver again accelerated into me , with no intention of stopping , forcing me , prostrate , onto the drivers side hood of his vehicle .
Riding precariously with a 4,000 lb wheel inches from pulling me beneath it , I screamed for the driver to " Stop !!!
Please Stop ! ! " over and over .
He continued to ignore my pleas for some 200 ft.
keeping a steady 5 or 10 mph .
He then stopped suddenly allowing me to fall off the side of the hood .
Just as quickly as he stopped he violently accelerated again knocking me to the side .
This time I managed to stay standing .
The driver then sped off Northbound .
At this point several witnesses came to my aid and reported his license plate .
Dooda emerged from the ordeal with only a scraped elbow , but another poster to the message board who claimed to witness to the incident , painted a pretty scary picture .
( In fact , it was her post that originally prompted Dooda to come forward with the statement he gave to police ) :
It was a bizarre sight ... a cyclist was on the hood , shouting at the driver , to please please stop the car .
That cyclist kept shouting to the guy to stop , he was saying / shouting , " You could have killed me .
Stop , Please stop .
This is my life . " something like that .
We saw his bike in the road , left behind , as the SUV drove on , with the cyclist on his hood .
When the cops arrived and told Dooda that the " NYP " plate meant that the driver who nearly killed him was a journalist , Dooda told Gawker he joked : " I wonder if he 's from Fox News , because he was such an asshole . "
He was !
Gawker tracked down the driver , Don Broderick , who says he is a news writer for Fox News ( he was formerly a reporter for the New York Post ) .
When we first called him to confirm that he was the man to whom the vehicle that dragged Dooda for blocks was registered , Broderick said , " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " and asked if he could call us back .
A couple hours later , he called to acknowledge that he was indeed the driver , but said that he was the victim of a " vigilante " bicyclist who had attacked him : " Whatever this guy is claiming , there 's no truth involved — he punched me .
And I left , because he was attacking me . "
Dooda says he never laid hands on Broderick , whom , he says , stared with " cold psychotic intent " while Dooda was on his hood , and answered his pleas to stop with shrugs of the shoulders and the occasional " get the fuck out of here . "
" He was n't like hanging out the window screaming ' you fucking pussy ! ' " Dooda says .
" He spoke with his car . "
Both men agree that the altercation started because Dooda was riding his bike in the left - hand lane at roughly 25 m.p.h. , which caused a line of ten or so cars to back up behind him .
Broderick 's was the last car to get around him , which is when Dooda says Broderick tried to send him a message by abruptly cutting back over into the left lane in front of him , coming close to his tire .
" He initiated the whole encounter by almost running into me , " he says .
" I 'm sure he felt like I was antagonizing motorists because I was in the left lane riding a bicycle .
But did I attack him ?
If he considers me pointing out that he is an aggressive and dangerous driver to be an attack , yes .
Otherwise , no . "
No matter who started it , actually hitting someone with your car , and then hitting them again , and then dragging them on your hood for 200 feet , and then driving away can't be legal !
Dooda , who was only slightly injured with some scrapes and bruises , filed a police report with the Central Park Precinct , and says a detective has been in touch .
Broderick says he has n't been contacted by the police , and an NYPD spokesperson could n't immediately confirm that an investigation is underway .
New York
Press license plates are issued to members of the working media who can demonstrate that they are employed by a news organization — in Broderick 's case , Fox .
They let reporters park in special reserved spots in New York City and avoid tickets for illegal parking if they 're actually covering a news story .
They also let road - ragers get tagged as media employees , which sparks the interest of bloggers .
A Fox News spokeswoman did n't immediately return calls for comment .

What happens when a rich Mexican drug lord gets busted ?
Massive confiscation of golden pistols , machine guns , mansions and even wild animals of their private home zoo .

Former presidential candidate , physician and Congressman Ron Paul ( Republican - Texas ) introduced HR 1207 with the name " Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 " , but known to its many supporters as the Audit The Fed bill .
Not suprisingly , Federal Reserve Board Chair Ben Bernanke has sought to prevent its passage .
In the House of Representatives it now has 282 co-sponsors , a majority of the Members .
It has been introduced in the Senate as S. 604 .
It provides for audits of the Federal Reserve by the Comptroller - General .
Bernanke and his supporters have contended that the bill would lead to politicized second - guessing of the Fed ’s decision - making on monetary policy .
Examining the bill itself at http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1207, one can read the text and find little to support such a statement .
Moreover , it is not as if the Fed ’s decision - making was not politicized already .
For example , the Federal Reserve under Arthur Burns increased the money supply to depress interest rates in the runup to President Nixon ’s reelection campaign in 1972 .
When I studied public finance with then Professor ( now retired ) C. Lowell Harris at Columbia , we learned the sound principles of accountability and transparency .
Ron Paul ’s Audit The Fed bill brings a most needed accountability to bear on the monetary policy of the USA .
One could support this legislation without sharing the monetary policy views of its author or me .

I recently received in the mail the 2008 Annual Report of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis .
The title of the report is " The Current Economic Crisis : What Should We Learn from the Great Depressions of the 20th Century ? "
After reading the report , it is clear to me that either the Fed has learned almost nothing about 20th - century depressions or it is lying through its teeth in order to shift the blame for causing the current depression ( or both ) .
Relying heavily on another Minneapolis Fed publication , the article in the Annual Report authored by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba and Timothy J. Kehoe asserts that " bad government policies are responsible for causing great depressions . "
So far , so good .
But then the next sentence informs us that " while different sorts of shocks can lead to ordinary business cycle downturns , overreaction by the government can prolong and deepen the downturn , turning it into a depression . "
This is mainstream macroeconomic gobbledygook : downturns in the economy are caused by random " shocks , " sort of like economic lightning bolts from the sky .
The kinds of " shocks " that these authors mention include declining commodity and housing prices , increases in " world interest rates , " and , in the case of Finland , " collapse in trade with the former Soviet Union . "
No mention at all is made of central - bank monetary policy as possibly introducing economic instability .
In light of all the criticism the Fed has received for being the cause of the current crisis , it is intellectually bankrupt for these authors to not address this issue in even a single sentence .
Having ignored the role of central banks in generating boom - and - bust cycles , the " lesson " the Minneapolis Fed economists claim to have learned from their study of past depressions is that the " cure " is even more central bank inflation .
" [ G] overnments need to focus on providing liquidity , " they solemnly intone .
Following Alan Greenspan , they blame the current depression in the United States on a new version of " the yellow peril " : impoverished Asians who have a penchant for saving a large percentage of their income .
" Over the past decade , lending by China and other countries in East Asia … has kept world interest rates low . "
This is what fueled the real - estate boom , they say , ignoring altogether the role of Fed policy , as well as the policy of every arm of the federal government that is involved in housing ( from HUD to Congress to the Fed itself ) to force mortgage lenders to make bad loans to unqualified borrowers to achieve its goal of " making housing more affordable . "
( In reality , worldwide savings rates during the 2001 –2008 period were actually lower than they were during the previous 15 - year period . )
Having totally absolved the Fed of all responsibility in creating the housing boom and bust , the Minneapolis Fed claims merely that " falling housing prices " are what caused all that " systemic risk , " which they say needs to be more heavily regulated by — you guessed it — the Fed .
It is the public that is ignorant of the causes of " systemic risk , " they say , when in reality it is Fed bureaucrats like the authors of this report who are the truly ignorant ones .
Either that , or they are lying to protect their jobs .
This alleged lack of understanding by everyone in the world , with the exception of Fed central planners , " calls for reform and , perhaps , new regulations , " they say , and " central banks … should lend to banks to maintain liquidity . "
That is , they supposedly need to inflate more and create more bubbles .
Fed economists — like mainstream macroeconomics in general — are intellectually bankrupt and clueless at best or dishonest propagandists at worst .
I am writing this on July 11 -- World Population Day .
And I am reflecting on the fact that the world 's population continues to grow year after year , even though our planet and its resources remain finite .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , new Americans are being born faster than the old ones are dying off , yielding a net gain of one person every 11 seconds in this country alone .
And the population worldwide is growing even faster .
This results in ongoing and ever - worsening shortages of food , clean water , shelter , and other necessities of life .
Nevertheless , the right - wing zealots continue to oppose responsible birth control programs .
They like to think of themselves as " pro-life " .
However , they do n't seem to care so much about the quality of life outside their country clubs .
And , indeed , it's in the poorer neighborhoods and developing nations that overpopulation causes the greatest suffering .
Another part of the problem exists at a societal level .
As a woman who has chosen to remain child - free all my life , I am viewed by many as an anomaly .
In our society , parenthood is encouraged , glorified , and glamorized ( see " Jon & Kate Plus 8 " ) .
I frequently see otherwise intelligent people choosing to have three or four children -- or more .
While most surely do n't over - reproduce for malicious reasons , their naivete and / or thoughtlessness strike me as irresponsible , and more than a little narcissistic .
On a more positive note , President Obama has already taken some important steps in addressing family planning issues worldwide as well as domestically .
He repealed the Bush administration 's Global Gag Rule , which had withheld federal funds from nongovernmental health and family planning organizations that provide abortion information or referrals in other countries .
And his budget for FY 2010 eliminates funding for abstinence - only sex education and instead supports a new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative designed to " support community - based and faith - based efforts to reduce teen pregnancy using evidence - based and promising models . "
But , like putting a Band - Aid on a cancer , these programs will not adequately address the underlying societal attitudes that need to change .
Just as the " green " movement has caught on in recent years , educating and inspiring ordinary people to be more environmentally responsible , we need a similar movement for population control .
Society needs to embrace the concept that it is perfectly acceptable -- and , in fact , a positive thing -- for a couple to have only one child , or none .
And adoption should be encouraged for those who want more .
We need to get to a place where reckless over - reproduction is generally regarded as irresponsible and uncool .
Because , in this day and age , it truly is .

Earlier this month , North Korea fired off a barrage of short - range ballistic missiles as part of an ongoing demonstration of its military might .
While the U.S. military did not move to intercept any of those missiles , it just did the next - best thing :
It shot down a target that simulated a North Korean missile .
In a test event dubbed " Stellar Avenger , " the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense - equipped destroyer USS Hopper successfully tracked and engaged an Aegis Readiness Assessment Vehicle ( ARAV ) after the target missile was launched from the Pacific Test Range Facility on Barking Sands , Kauai .
In a statement , Riki Ellison , the plugged - in chief of the Missile Defense Advocacy Association , said the ARAV " represented a ballistic missile similar in speed , acceleration and burn of the same short range missiles fired by North Korea on July 2nd and 4th of this year . "
Equally important , this was an " ascent phase " shoot - down : According to a Missile Defense Agency news release , the interceptor struck the target 1 oo miles above the Pacific Ocean .
By Ellison 's count , this is only the second ascent - phase intercept in 23 at - sea firings by the Aegis missile defense system .
As Axe has noted here before , the sea - based combination of the missile - spotting Aegis radar system and the Standard Missile - 3 interceptor has the best test record of any U.S. missile defense system , and this latest test marks the 19th successful intercept in 23 practice intercepts .
Adding to that , this exercise tested a recent upgrade , and the USS Lake Erie will fire an upgraded SM - 3 using this advanced weapon system sometime late next year .

ALSO :
( CNN ) -- A Muslim woman and the Michigan chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations sued a judge Wednesday for allegedly ordering the woman to remove her hijab , or religious head covering , in court .
Raneen Albaghdady , of Wayne County , Michigan , contends that Judge William Callahan told her to remove her hijab on June 16 when she was petitioning for a name change , according to the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in a U.S. district court in Michigan .
Wayne County is also listed as a defendant in the suit .
Callahan and the 3rd Circuit Court of Michigan said in a written statement that they had not seen the complaint and could not comment on the lawsuit .
However , they said that Albaghdady did not object to removing her head covering and that she had not informed the judge that she wore it for religious reasons .
The lawsuit says Callahan " insisted " that Albaghdady , a naturalized citizen , remove her hijab and that she eventually complied .
It says the judge denied Albaghdady 's petition for a name change , saying that she had filed her petition five days too early .
No further details were offered .
The lawsuit seeks an order declaring the practice of " forcing Muslim women to remove their hijab as a precondition to appearing in court " unconstitutional and illegal .
It asks that the judge and Wayne County not be allowed to " take similar unconstitutional actions . "
The Michigan Islamic relations council released a partial video of the incident Tuesday on YouTube .
In the 30 - second video , the judge can be heard saying , " The head piece ?
No hats allowed in the courtroom . "
The statement from Callahan and the 3rd Circuit said that the YouTube video was " missing some critical footage . "
" In response to Judge Callahan 's direction , ' No hats allowed in the courtroom , ' Ms. Albaghdady responded , " Okay , it does n't matter , ' and immediately removed her head covering , without protest or explanation , " the statement said .
" Judge Callahan and the court have the greatest respect for spiritual practices and all religious preferences .
Had he been informed that the head covering had some religious significance , the judge would have permitted Ms. Albaghdady to continue wearing it in court , " it said .
The suit comes a day after the state 's Supreme Court issued an order allowing lower state courts to " exercise reasonable control " over the appearance of witnesses and parties to lawsuits , a rule change that had been proposed after a Muslim woman refused to remove an Islamic garment in a small claims court .
The order allows courts " reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses " so as to " ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact - finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person . "
The order , which amends a rule of the Michigan Rules of Evidence , is effective September 1 .
The justices had voted earlier this summer to change it .
The amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in Michigan filed by Ginnah Muhammad , who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head , except for the eyes -- to court , the order said .
The judge asked her to remove her niqab , saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth , according to court documents .
Muhammad refused , saying she was a practicing Muslim and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge .
The judge said a female judge was not available and told Muhammad she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed .
She chose the latter , according to court documents .
She sued the judge in federal district court , which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case .
Muhammad has since appealed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , according to court documents .
Michigan is home to about 600,000 Muslims , and close to 500,000 live in the southeastern part of the state , according to the Michigan office of the American - Islamic relations council .
The Detroit area , in Wayne County , ranks fifth nationwide for the number of Muslims , it said .
Last month , the Judicial Council of Georgia adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state 's courtrooms .
Daniel Mach , the director of litigation for the American Civil Liberties Union 's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief , said Wednesday the issue has " come up in a variety of states . "
" We are concerned about the growing number of incidents restricting religious expression in the courtroom , " he said . " ...
This is an issue that affects a variety of religious faiths and others . "

A week ago , I attended the summer ISO C++ meeting in Frankfurt , Germany .
The C++ committee made a lot of progress on addressing national body comments on the full committee draft published last year , and is well on the way to publishing a second and final CD this winter with a final draft international standard a year after that .
To meet that schedule , the committee decided to defer a major feature , “ concepts ” , and not include it in this standard .
I ’m surprised at some of the commentary I ’ve been reading on the web about the deferral of concepts , including not just technical inaccuracies but also that their absence in C++0 x is somehow a big deal for C++ as a language or is a major geopolitical firestorm .
It may feel like a big deal because of the work that ’s gone into concepts and the large number of pages of standardese that were needed to specify the feature , and there was a lot of discussion about important design details including heavy traffic on the committee reflectors this spring and early summer that probably made them look more controversial than they are .
But my opinion is that concepts ’ presence or absence in C++0 x just wo n’t make much difference to most users .
Let me give some reasons why I feel that ’s so , and maybe debunk some common misconceptions along the way , in the form of an unofficial FAQ .
Note that I was never involved in the design of concepts and do n’t speak for the designers , whose views might differ here and there ; the following are observations from my point of view as a participant in the standards body ( including in Frankfurt last week ) , and chair of the ISO C++ committee during the entire time concepts were being developed up to the meeting they were voted into the ISO C++0 x working draft last fall .
Q : Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++ and a primary designer of concepts .
What ’s his take ?
A : Great question .
See Bjarne ’s coverage here , published earlier today in Dr. Dobb’s .
Q : Were concepts removed because of political reason X , Y , or Z ?
A : No . Concepts were removed because of normal project management considerations .
The basic constraint has been phrased in many ways , all of them hitting at the same underlying tension among time , scope , cost , and quality .
Here are two examples : “ You can pick what goes on the train , or you can pick when the train leaves the station , but you ca n’t pick both . ”
“ You can have good , fast , and cheap – pick any two . ”
Fundamentally , the committee members felt that concepts are desirable but many ( though not all ) believed that they were still in design mode and needed more “ bake time ” – a formal poll of committee members in Frankfurt put the expected time at between three and four years – to get up to the quality of a feature that belongs in an international standard .
Therefore , the two major options , and the ones that people generally argued for , were to either :
Prioritize ( bigger ) scope .
Wait for concepts , and accept a delay to the rest of the standard including features that are already finalized and ready to ship .
Wait for concepts , and accept a delay to the rest of the standard including features that are already finalized and ready to ship .
Prioritize ( faster ) schedule .
Finish and ship the standard to get already - done features into users ’ hands , and decouple concepts to continue work on them for a future standard .
The committee decided to prioritize schedule and ship C++0 x sooner while still leaving the door wide open to also adopt concepts later .
Q : Is n’t removing concepts a lot of work ?
Concepts are used pervasively in the C++0x CD published last fall .
A : Yes , but it ’s less work than you ’d think .
We wo n’t have a de-conceptized working draft for the post - meeting mailing , two weeks after the meeting , but should have one soon after that .
( I would be remiss not to add : Thanks to our always - hardworking project editor , Pete Becker ! )
Recall that , until last September , we had a complete draft of C++0 x features specified entirely without the use of concepts .
And many of the uses of concepts in the draft standard library were just replacements of preexisting non-concepts wording or implicit requirements ( e.g. , DefaultConstructible , MemberContainer ) , and will just revert to their previous wording or disappear back into implicitness .
The main C++0 x feature that was always specified in terms of concepts was the new range - based for loop ( e.g. , for ( x : collection ) ) .
I ’ve seen some wonder what we ’ll do about that , but it ’s already done ; the non-concepts text for that feature was already voted in at the same Frankfurt meeting .
Q : Was n’t this C++0 x ’s one big feature ?
A : No . Concepts would be great , but for most users , the presence or absence of concepts will make no difference to their experience with C++0 x except for quality of error messages ( see below ) .
C++0 x is still a major revision with many new major features , including improvements to templates ( e.g. , variadic templates , template aliases ) .
C++’s other major new features include lambda functions ( which unfortunately for Java were rejected for Java 7 ) , move semantics ( aka rvalue references ) , a concurrency memory model , threading and atomics libraries , initializer lists , and more .
Other handy new features include delegating constructors , inherited constructors , defaulted and deleted functions , explicit virtual overriding control , alignment support , static assertions , and more .
Not to mention convenience features like range - based for loops and “ auto ” type inference that are small but will certainly get a lot of use ( as they do in C# and Java ) .
A number of those features are available now or soon in real compilers , including Gnu gcc , Visual C++ 2010 , and Intel C++.
Q : Are n’t concepts about adding major new expressive power to the language , and so enable major new kinds of programs or programming styles ?
A : Not really .
Concepts are almost entirely about getting better error messages .
Yes , concepts would add one truly new expressive capability to the language , namely the ability to overload on concepts .
That ’s inconvenient to simulate without language support .
Concept - based overloading would have been used in a handful of places in the standard library .
But that ’s it .
By far the most visible benefit of concepts lies in clearer template error messages , including the ability to do separate checking – confirming that a template ’s implementation type - checks correctly with all possible valid types without having to instantiate it , and confirming that a given type can be used to instantiate a template without knowing the template ’s implementation .
Q : Were n’t concepts all about bringing templates into the 21st century ?
Where does this leave templates ?
A : Templates are still king of the genericity hill , for all their faults in the area of opaque compiler messages .
It ’s important to remember that , in 1994 , C++ was the only major language whose type genericity capabilities were strong enough to create the Standard Template Library ( STL ) .
Today , 15 years later , that is still true ; you ca n’t express the STL ’s containers - algorithms design separation well , or at all , using generics facilities in Ada , Java , .NET , or any other significant commercial or research language that I know of ; as we learned when doing STL.
NET , you can do the containers well with other generics , but not the orthogonalization with algorithms that is the heart of STL design style .
Concepts or not , that has n’t changed .
So my personal view is that templates have been in the 21st century since about 1994 .
No other language has yet caught up to their expressive power .
And C++0x is adding some further power to templates , in particular by adding variadic templates and template aliases , both of which will help to simplify template code .
Fox News ' ' Red Eye ' recently gained a new correspondent on their show .
An Interplanetary Correspondent , no less , in the guise of Oderus Urungus , frontman for shlock metalheads Gwar .
" It 's really weird , all of a sudden Oderus has been showing up in all these weird places , " Dave Brockie , the man behind the rubber - suited Oderus Urungus , tells Noisecreep .
" We 're developing him as a TV personality in his own right . "
This week Brockie traveled to Las Vegas to do an onsite report from the World Series of Poker tournament for the news - spoofing ' Red Eye . '
Who better to comment on news items and events than a blood - lusting , sexually perverted , extra terrestrial with one hell of a bad attitude ?
" People expect him to say outrageous things and act like a maniac .
But , really , what gets people is when he 's reasonable , articulate , and intelligent , and you actually agree with what he 's saying .
But , then , in a blink of an eye he turns back into a slobbering maniac . "
Mmmm , reasonable ?
We must have missed that part .
During his first two appearances , Oderus badmouthed illegal downloading , Spaceport America , and NASA bombing the moon , keeping it slightly cleaner for broadcast than he might otherwise do .
" That 's the great thing about being Oderus .
It 's like the 800 - pound gorilla .
Where does the 800 - pound gorilla weigh in on Michael Jackson 's death ? " asks Brockie .
" Anywhere he wants to ! "
Gwar , which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year , releases its eleventh album , ' Lust In Space , ' August 18 .
What do his fellow intergalactic scumdogs in Gwar think of Oderus grabbing the spotlight ?
" That 's what a lead singer is supposed to do .
It 's ridiculous if your lead singer is a mousey type , who does n't get any cool gigs .
I would fire that lead singer immediately , " he snaps .
" I'm one of the biggest , loud - mouthed people you 'd ever wish to meet , " admits Brockie – oh , there 's that reasonable thing .
" The band would get mad if I was n't doing stuff like this . "
TechCrunch is the second most influential blog on the planet according to Technorati and with such authority comes a huge responsibility .
Thousands of readers read the content and spread links to newsworthy articles to even more readers via Digg , Delicious , Twitter and so on .
Unfortunately many people only scan headlines and quickly read the through the content which means that if a story is not correct , misleading information quickly spreads across the web .
TechCrunch yesterday published a story with the headline “ Google Maps Do n’t Lie. Sweden And Canada Among Worst Greenhouse Gas Emitters . ”
How sensational , those self - righteous Swedes are worse than Americans .
Yay , I can keep my Hummer .
Such a provocative headline obviously appeals to a lot of people who share the story with their friends .
Tweetmeme has tracked 166 tweets about the article so far and most of them just recycle the headline and the link .
The problem is that the entire story is bunk for several reasons .
First of all , the data that the article is based upon shows that Sweden has had the highest increase ( in percent ) in green house gases from 1990 to 2006 ( with 110 % ) .
While that indeed looks bad it does not mean that Sweden a ) emits most of all countries or b ) emits most per capita .
To the contrary , a quick look at the data reveals that the US and many other countries emit many times more per capita than Sweden .
Second , as is revealed in the comments , the map is based on incorrect data .
Sweden has produced a new report with updated data that show that Swedish emissions in 2006 were at level with 1990 ( zip file ) .
In other words , not even an increase compared to 1990 .
The first point above is just the result of poor journalism by TechCrunch , but the second point is harder to foresee .
But readers quickly pointed out the first mistake that the writer Erick Schonfeld had made so it would n’t have been especially hard to correct the misleading headline and content .
But Schonfeld apparently did n’t see it that way , instead he posted denigrative responses to reader comments .
“ Do you dare question a Google Map ? ”
“ Where did you learn to read , Sweden ? ”
“ That is the default map .
Go petition the UN ( or Google ) if you think it is misleading . ”
Instead of doing the right thing and using the input from readers to improve a poor article , TechCrunch chose to leave incorrect statements up on their site .
Instead of subscribing to Dan Gillmor ’s view that “ my readers know more than I do ” , TechCrunch apparently think that their readers are idiots ( and that Swedes ca n’t read ) .
Any leading publication today , be it a blog or a traditional newspaper , must take responsibility for the content they publish if they want to keep any sort of credibility .
Everone makes mistakes , but news is shared at lightning speed today and if you are the source of incorrect information that spread across the web , you should do everything in your power to stop the false information from spreading any further .
If not , how can anyone trust you in the future ?
I did n’t expect this kind of behaviour from a leading blog in 2009 .
Big fail .

Update on Canada Oil Sands , Part I
Recently , I had the unique opportunity to tour two different oil sands operations near Fort McMurray , in northern Alberta .
I saw a massive open - pit oil sands mine , and the associated reclamation effort , operated by Syncrude Canada Ltd .
I also visited an in situ oil sands recovery project called Surmont , operated by ConocoPhillips .
The trip was sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) , which paid for the airfare and accommodations .
Managers at both Syncrude and ConocoPhillips granted me access to any parts of their operations I wanted to see ( within allowances for safety ) .
And everyone answered any and all questions I asked .
Post - trip , I have complete editorial freedom to write about what I saw and learned .
And I learned a lot .
So this is Part I of a two - part series .
Watch for Part II .
The Past and Future of Oil and Oil Sands
The first thing that struck me about visiting the oil sands of Alberta was how much geological and social similarity there is to the oil patch of Pennsylvania .
Geologic similarity ?
Yes , because the reason that the hydrocarbons are so near the surface in both areas — Pennsylvania and Alberta — is that the Pleistocene glaciers scraped off much of the overlying rock .
When the glaciers retreated about 10,000 years ago , they left hydrocarbon - bearing rock formations exposed near the surface , or buried not too deep .
This led to oil seeps , which led to people being curious about the black , gooey stuff .
To be sure , the hydrocarbon resource is quite different between the two places .
That is , in Pennsylvania , you have light , sweet crude oil that flows easily and is soft and smooth to the touch .
Indeed , Pennsylvania crude feels like hand lotion .
( It ’s the origin of Vaseline , for example .
And some people use it as the basis for a shampoo . )
While in Alberta , the “ bitumen ” from the oil sands is as thick as cold molasses , and very sticky .
It ’s got some sulfur in it as well .
On a warm day in August , oil sands have the consistency of really stiff , dry oatmeal .
Bitumen is a far cry from hand lotion .
And as for social similarities ?
Well , the Indians of old used to skim the oil from streams near Titusville , Pa .
So did people of the “ First Nations ” of Alberta , who used to recover the tarry bitumen from the rocks along the Athabaska River of northern Alberta .
Thus both oil and oil sands have been around for a long , long time .
Early white explorers in both Pennsylvania and Alberta noted the oil seeps .
They wrote in journals and logs that eventually somebody could do something with the substance .
Eventually , both Pennsylvania and Alberta had their oil booms .
In fact , we ’re soon coming up on the 150th anniversary of Col .
Drake ’s oil discovery at Titusville , Pa , on Aug. 27 , 1859 .
Pennsylvania ’s oil boom is colorful history at this point ( although Marcellus Shale development will soon change that ) .
Whereas Alberta is still in the midst of its oil sands boom .
It ’s a boom that ’s going to last for quite some time , I believe .
“ Easy ” Oil Versus Heavy Oil and Bitumen
There ’s a reason Col .
Drake started an oil boom in Pennsylvania more than a century before Alberta enjoyed the same thing .
Col .
Drake found some of that so - called “ easy ” oil .
No , it ’s not easy to find .
It ’s that Col .
Drake ’s oil flows easily from a well .
That is , for all the oil that mankind has pumped out of the ground in the past 15 decades , almost all of it has been the light , sweet stuff that flows easily .
Generally , when people looked for oil they bypassed the heavy oil and bitumen .
Until lately , of course .
When we think about the concept of “ Peak Oil ” today , we need to keep in mind what we ’re talking about .
The curves show oil output peaking in so many parts of the world .
This phenomenon is quite real , as long as you understand that it ’s the “ old fashioned ” kind of oil deposit that Col .
Drake was drilling .
The light , sweet , easy - flowing oil is getting harder and harder to find , certainly in significant quantity .
But there are a lot of other hydrocarbon molecules out there .
Most of those molecules are not light , sweet crude oil .
Indeed , most of the hydrocarbon molecules that the world will use in the future will be “ heavy , ” with lots of carbon atoms and not so many hydrogen atoms .
Here ’s a graph from oil services giant Schlumberger that estimates the world ’s heavy oil and bitumen resources .
Canada ’s 400 billion cubic meters of bitumen translates into something like 1.4 trillion barrels of oil equivalent .
How much is that ?
Well , it ’s about SEVEN times the total oil reserves of Saudi Arabia .
It just so happens that most of that Canadian bitumen is located in Alberta ( with some is in Saskatchewan ) .
And Fort McMurray , about 250 miles north of Edmonton , is the heart of the development process .
Oil Sands — Surface Mining
Large - scale oil sands development began in the 1970s .
It took gigantic levels of capital investment , like tens of billions of dollars .
That ’s not pocket change .
So a group of lease - owners got together and pooled their capital to form privately held Syncrude Canada , a joint venture .
First mining started in 1978 .
The way Syncrude operates , it ’s not really “ mining . ”
It ’s landscape architecture .
Under Alberta law , Syncrude could not turn over its first shovel of rock without a master plan for remediation and restoration at the end of the cycle .
It ’s quite a farsighted model for long - range resource development .
Thus for much of the 1970s , Syncrude performed baseline environmental studies and data gathering .
It started digging in 1978 .
At first , the pit looked like a moonscape of open - pit mining .
See the photo below .
It looks like a mess , right ?
Well , there ’s more to the story .
The mining process is fairly straightforward .
Big shovels ( really big ) scoop large volumes ( really large ) of oil - laden sand ( API number 8 , the “ bitumen ” ) into gigantic loaders ( and I mean gigantic .
The loaders haul the rock to a crusher .
The crushed rock goes to a washing bin , kind of like your washing machine at home except it ’s the size of a high - rise office building .
The Syncrude operation washes the bitumen off the sand using naphtha .
Then it separates the bitumen , recovers the naphtha for reuse and takes the clean sand ( and it ’s clean ) and replaces it in a previously mined pit .
The process uses a lot of water , but not as much as the horror stories you might hear about “ draining the rivers ” of northern Canada .
Each barrel of water is recycled about 18 times .
The process uses a large amount of natural gas , but not as much as you may have heard ( like “ all the natural gas of northern Canada ” ) .
Pretty much everything about the operation is built with cogeneration in mind , so the company continuously recovers the heat at each stage .
That natural gas goes a long way , from what I saw .
If it takes , say , five years to dig a pit , and then it may take five or more years to fill it back up with sand during the restoration process .
Syncrude ’s goal is to handle the rock as little as possible .
Eventually , Syncrude returns the land to original grade , although the company has some artistic license with the contours .
It covers the land with the original topsoil , which has been in cold storage ( northern Alberta … it ’s cold up here for 10 months of the year ) .
Then it replants trees , and that ’s saying something , because the growing season is under two months .
It takes 80 years for your basic spruce tree to reach maturity .
There ’s even a new water table , despite the disturbance of the land .
Where Things Now Stand
So at this stage , after 30 years or so of mining ( with about 80 years to go , at current rates of extraction ) , Syncrude has come to a point of delivering 350,000 barrels of synthetic crude oil per day .
It takes the 8 - API bitumen and upgrades it to oil that ’s competitive with West Texas Light .
Then it delivers it to the JV members , for whatever use the owners want to make of it .
Along the way , the Syncrude process removes the sulfur , so it ’s sulfur free ( refiners like that ) .
In fact , there ’s a mass of sulfur up at Syncrude that ’s about the size of the step pyramid at Saqqara , Egypt .
And along the way , Syncrude sells the sulfur to the chemical industry .
The former Syncrude mine that I visited is about 3.5 miles square , and formerly about 200 feet deep .
Now it ’s restored to grade , with trees growing and a herd of 300 wood bison grazing .
For the cynics out there , I ’d say that it ’s not some environmental Potemkin village , because you ca n’t fake a replanted forest of 25 - year - old trees .
You ca n’t fake a 300 - bison herd .
Not on a former mine site 3.5 miles square .
Sure , there are still issues about land disturbance , settling ponds , water usage , gas usage and myriad of other things that come up when you ’re spending billions of dollars on a major mining effort .
But Syncrude has built its business model around dealing with the “ other ” issues , and not just moving oil sands and recovering oil products .
Do n’t underestimate the ability of the Alberta government to regulate its energy producers .
This is a long way from Appalachia .
Meanwhile , we ’re talking about literally billions of barrels of bitumen ( or oil equivalent ) that the process makes available to the North American marketplace .
And if the U.S. wants to get onto its environmental high horse about the source of the hydrocarbons from the oil sands — and tax or ban their importation — there are other buyers in the world .
Like the Chinese , who have racked up many frequent flyer miles on their treks to Fort McMurray .
That ’s all for now .
In Part II , I ’ll discuss the in situ process that I saw at the ConocoPhillips Surmont site .
Until we meet again ,

ITHACA , N.Y. , July 17 ( UPI ) --
Major crop loss may result from an " explosive " fungus that destroys tomato plants and is rampant in the Northeast , federal agriculture officials said Friday .
Late blight , a highly contagious fungus , can jump from tomato to potato plants and caused the Irish potato famine in the 19th century .
Its spores are common in soil and small outbreaks are familiar to farmers , but the cool , wet weather in June added to the aggression of the pathogen , Martin A. Draper , a senior plant pathologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture told The New York Times .

William Fry , a professor of plant pathology at Cornell University , said part of the reason for the rapid spread is the thousands of plants home gardeners buy at big box stores and the fact the employees at those retailers are n't trained to spot plant diseases as the employees of nurseries are .
" Locally grown tomatoes normally get $ 15 to $ 20 a box " wholesale , said John Mishanec , a pest management specialist at Cornell .
He noted some upstate New York " growers are talking about $ 40 boxes already . "

Gary McKinnon is a British citizen facing extradition to the United States for hacking .
He was looking for UFO evidence .
It can hardly be called hacking when the systems he accessed did not even have passwords , despite this US prosecutors accuse him of “ biggest military computer hack of all time ” .
Gary McKinnon has aspergers .
His fight against extradition has exposed to the British public that Blair signed an unfair one way only extradition treaty .
His trial in the US will however be a further blight on the American Judicial System .
Mr. McKinnon is not James Bond .
He is not a virus writer .
He was not out to sell Army information to hostile Foreign nations .
He did not engage in torture .
He was not behind 9/11 .
He was looking for evidence of little green men .
He did not break any systems .
He did not remotely format hard discs or destroy data , yet US Prosecutors are charging him with for $ $millions in damages , for PCs left online and without any password .
He faces decades in jail for gaining access to unsecured PCs .
Surely if there is any “ criminal damage ” it was caused by the neglect of US Government IT managers , whose failure allowed a man , from England , to remotely access these “ top secret ” computers , without a password .
Perhaps those pointing the finger should be the ones facing prosecution ?
It is known that on occasion virus writers get a job with anti virus software houses .
If these computers were so difficult to hack into without a password , then rather than prosecute him , reward him with a job .
How many more PCs are left unsecure on the Government network ?
Is n’t it better for someone like Mckinnon to find them as opposed to Iran ?
Yes , under the unfair one way treaty with the US , the DofJ has a right to prosecute him , but within that right the US needs to consider whether it is within the public interest to prosecute him .
Mckinnon is not a threat to the US National Security , and the extradition treaty should not be used to cover up for IT staff who failed to do their job .
The treaty was signed on the back of anti-terrorism .
Gary is not a terrorist .
Despite this , the Prosecution allege his conduct was intentional and calculated to affect them by “ intimidation and coercion ” .
Really , an autistic man can intimidate the largest military in the World ?
Even the UK anti terror boss says putting him on trial in the US would be cruel
This is not what the extradition treaty should be used for .
Why Being an Avatar Fan Sucks - Up at Noon
The company I work for has been using reactive programming for quite sometime , and I added our implementation to CLINQ a couple months ago ( You can find it in by getting the latest source and finding the Reactive namespace . )
I noticed that Josh Smith , ( who has an excellent WPF blog ) just posted something along the same spirit .
Of course , I quickly spammed the comments in his blog about ReactiveObject .
I figured I should give an explanation of how it works , and the various issues that you must deal with when solving this problem .
The infamous INotifyProperty Changed requires classes to fire an event in each property ’s setter with a string matching the property name .
Very often , other classes want to observe those property changes and execute code as a result .
These other classes subscribe to the Property Changed and then have to examine the EventArgs and an inevitable switch statement or lookup table is used to map to an appropriate handler .
This leads to hard coded strings , and messy messy code .
However , the spirit of this type of “ reactive programming ” is an excellent way to decouple your code , and is awesome for designing object models that hookup to WPF , or any other UI framework for that matter .
Here ’s where ReactiveObject comes in which , I hope will change how you architect your front end applications .
Here ’s an example of a Person class that follows this model .
In this style of programming , an object wants to execute some code , or react , when properties change on itself or some other object .
( ReactiveObject implements INotifyProperty Changed for you . )
Let ’s say we have Person object , and that person has Brother property which , of course , is another Person .
Now , whenever we change the Brother of a person we want to calculate the age difference between the two siblings .
Also , if someone changes the person ’s age , we would need to do the same thing .
( I ’m not going to deal with the circular reference situation for the sake of brevity , but do n’t worry that works too . )
Here ’s how you would implement the Person class to make this happen .
( Explanation below )
public class Person : ReactiveObject { static Person ( ) { var dependsOn = Register < Person >( ) ; dependsOn.Call ( me => me.
OnMyAgeChanged ( ) ) .
OnChanged ( me => me .
Age ) ; dependsOn.Call ( me => me.OnMyBrothersAgeChanged ( ) ) .
OnChanged ( me => me .
Brother .
Age ) ; dependsOn.Call ( me => me .
UpdateAgeDifference ( ) ) .
OnChanged ( me => me .
Age ) .
OnChanged ( me => me .
Brother .
Age ) ; } private int _ageDifference ; public int AgeDifference { get { return _ageDifference ; } set { if ( value == _ageDifference ) return ; OnPropertyChanging ( " AgeDifference " ) ; _ageDifference = value ; OnPropertyChanged ( " AgeDifference " ) ; } } private int _age ; public int Age { get { return _age ; } set { if ( value == _age ) return ; OnPropertyChanging ( " Age " ) ; _age = value ; OnPropertyChanged ( " Age " ) ; } } private Person _brother ; public Person Brother { get { return _brother ; } set { if ( value == _brother ) return ; OnPropertyChanging ( " Brother " ) ; _brother = value ; OnPropertyChanged ( " Brother " ) ; } } //Executed if this .
Age changes , or if this .
Brother .
Age changes !
private void OnMyAgeChanged ( ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " My age is now " , this .
Age ) ; } //Executed if this .
Brother changes , or if this .
Brother .
Age changes ! private void OnMyBrothersAgeChanged ( ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " Brothers age is now " , this .
Brother .
Age ) ; } //Executed if this .
Age , this .
Brother , or this .
Brother .
Age changes ! private void UpdateAgeDifference ( ) { this .
AgeDifference = this .
Age - this .
Brother .
Age ; } }
The real magic is in the static constructor of the Person object .
This sets up how this object will react to property changes .
The first thing you do is call Register < Person > which returns a little object that you use to do registrations .
You use this registration object to define your relationships .
It uses a simple fluent interface that says : call this function on the object when a particular set of properties change .
Each lambda takes a me parameter .
Conceptually , me is the same as this if you ignored the fact that you ’re in a static constructor .
This is very important to the performance of the system , but understandably a little confusing at first .
The first example above says : call OnMyAgeChanged whenever someone sets my Age property .
The next , and more interesting , example says : call OnMyBrotherChanged whenever you set my Brother property , or if the Age property on my Brother changes .
The lambda expression you pass to OnChanged gets analyzed to any depth , and creates subscriptions on all the objects it encounters .
Also , brother can be null and nothing will break .
The final example shows how you can calculate something that depends on multiple values .
In this case the system will call UpdateAgeDifference when either the person ’s Age , the person ’s Brother , or the person ’s Brother ’s Age changes .
This means that your calculation will always be current no matter what changes underneath you .
Pretty nifty , no ?
I ’ve been part of team that has built an application on exactly this style of programming , and it has been a godsend .
All of your code is very decoupled , and information just flows through your program .
There are a few things to mention as to what ’s going on behind the scenes .
First , all event subscriptions are weak and rely on CLINQ ’s super fast property change manager .
( The one provided by WPF is slow . )
Next , the registration is done in the classes static constructor which means that there is only a one time hit for the lambda analysis and dependency map generation .
Also , you ’ll notice that the handlers also require lambdas , which are open delegates rather than closures .
( Hence , this is why we have the me parameters . )
This is an important side effect of doing registration in the static constructor as closures will cause leaks , and ye olde memory fragmentation .
It 's 6.30 pm , and so far today Dave Fisher has eaten 150g of prawns , a skinless chicken leg , 50g of raw peas , and a few handfuls of blackberries , strawberries , blueberries and nuts .
Dinner is yet to come , and will consist of a lean chicken breast and a small salad .
In total , he will have ingested around 1,600 calories , perhaps a 1,000 fewer than a typical Western man of similar height and age .
Fisher , 51 , is not trying to lose weight , though weight loss is the inevitable result of the dietary regime he began 20 years ago .
At 5ft 10in and 10st 8 lb he is lean rather than skinny and says he appreciates food far more than he did when he was eating a lot more of it .
He eats so little every day because he wants to be healthy well into old age , and because he thinks it could be the key to unlocking 20 or 30 years of extra life .
" There are two goals to a calorie - restricted diet , " says Fisher .
" One is maximum lifetime expansion .
The other is an improvement in health in the meantime , and reducing the chances of succumbing to the diseases of ageing – heart disease , cancer and so on .
I think it 's worth doing for either goal . "

Fisher is one of a growing number of calorie restrictors who believe , to put it simply , that less food can equal more life .
Calorie restriction ( or CR ) may sound faddy and Californian but it has certainly piqued the interest of scientists .
Last week , scientists announced the conclusion of a 20 - year study by a team at the University of Wisconsin on rhesus monkeys .
It is the best known of a plethora of animal experiments that are testing the claim that very low - calorie diets can improve health and extend life .
And like most of them , it has produced striking results in their favour .
The Wisconsin study involved 76 monkeys split into two groups , one on a calorie - restricted diet and a control group that ate normally .
It found that those on normal diets were three times as likely to develop age - related illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases .
By the end of the study , half of the normal eaters had died , while only 20 per cent of the calorie - restricted ones had .
What 's more , calorie restriction appeared to help preserve the brain health of the primates , too , leading to better memory , motor skills and problem solving .
Time after time , in fact , researchers have found that animals which are forced to eat more sparingly seem to age more slowly .
Experiments have suggested that CR can extend lifespans by as much as 30 per cent – at least in rodents .
Similarly , the diet has boosted the longevity of worms , dogs and cows .
For people like Brian Delaney , president of the Calorie Restriction Society and author , with Lisa Walford , of The Longevity Diet , published by Four Walls Eight Windows , the evidence is pretty irrefutable .
" I adopted CR mostly because of overwhelming evidence in laboratory animals , combined with a bit of speculation on how evolution works , " he says .
" The variety of species in which it 's been tested – and shown to work – is so broad that it would n't make sense for this ' longevity diet effect ' to have disappeared from our genes . "
That may be true , but , without evidence from human studies , the message has been easy to ignore .
Humans are more difficult to study .
They tend to sneak in a Mars bar when no one is looking , or fall off the CR wagon completely after a few months .
Nevertheless , two human CR studies have recently been completed , and they hint , tantalisingly , at the possibility that restricting calories really can improve health in a way that holds out the promise of extended life .
There are provisos .
The studies were small and in one case the results are only preliminary findings .
But they 're certainly exciting .
Another study by researchers from the University of Washington showed that the hearts of CR dieters had the elasticity and efficiency of people 15 years younger .
There was even evidence that a calorie restricted diet had reversed – as well as delayed – the normal decline of ageing .
" We do n't know how long each individual will end up living , " says Dr John O Holloszy , one of the researchers , " but they certainly have a longer life expectancy than average because they 're most likely not going to die from a heart attack , stroke or diabetes .
And if in fact their hearts are ageing more slowly , it 's conceivable they 'll live for a very long time . "
The study involved just 25 people , and reducing your chances of age - related illness is n't necessarily the same as increasing your maximum lifespan .
Dave Fisher took part in the Washington study and admits that " definitive proof that CR increases maximum lifespan will only come when someone lives to 130 " .
But another study , at the University of Louisiana , may have fitted another piece into the CR jigsaw .
This found that a strict CR diet reduced age - related DNA damage .
Again , the study was small – 48 people – and only looked at changes over a six - month period .
But microscopic damage to DNA is linked with cancer and other ailments of later life .
The researchers say the results are " striking " .
Nobody believes the apparent benefits of CR can be achieved by simply missing meals or discarding half of your hamburger .
Calorie restrictors optimise nutrition .
Without doing so , they 're just starving themselves .
And critics argue that cutting calories so dramatically while maintaining a healthy nutritional balance is extremely difficult to do .
As a modern lifestyle choice , CR hardly seems compatible with busy lives and snatched lunch breaks , and missing out on vital nutrients would more than undermine any beneficial effects from restricting calories .
CR also seems to contradict our genetic impetus .
In times of plenty , our genes urge us to store fat at every opportunity .
So why would they reward us with longer life for doing the exact opposite ?
In fact , advocates of CR believe this apparent evolutionary contradiction is exactly why the longevity diet is biologically valid .
It 's all down to a nifty piece of biological self - preservation , they argue .
When food is scarce our body temperatures drop , energy is conserved and – at a microscopic level – we activate a survival response .
It gives us a better chance of still being around when there 's plenty to eat again , and when we can get the chance to fulfil our genetic purpose by producing children .
" There is evidence that DNA repair is more efficient on a CR diet , " says Fisher .
" The theory is that , in times of famine , the body puts more resources into keeping itself alive .
When there 's plenty of calories around , the body goes into breeding mode .
It does n't bother to repair itself , because , when you can reproduce and pass on your genes , you – as an individual – no longer matter that much . "
So a CR diet tricks our genes into looking after the body they 've got , rather than looking for immortality in future generations .
At least , that 's the theory .
Not everyone is convinced , but as results begin to filter through from human studies , it 's becoming more and more difficult to dismiss the claims of the longevity diet , whatever its evolutionary purpose .
It 's possible that lifespans of 120 years could be just one ( radical ) lifestyle choice away .
Tiffany Cole , along with three co-defendants , was convicted of the kidnapping and first - degree murder of a Florida couple , Carol and Reggie Sumner .
A Trusted Friend
Tiffany Cole knew the Sumners .
They were a frail couple who had been her neighbors in South Carolina .
She had also bought a car from them and had visited them in their home in Florida .
It was during one of those visits that she learned that they had sold their South Carolina home and made a $ 99,000 profit from it .
From that point on , Cole , Michael Jackson , Bruce Nixon Jr. , and Alan Wade began plotting a way to rob the couple .
The group knew that gaining access to their home would be easy since the Sumners knew and trusted Cole .
The Robbery
On July 8 , 2005 , Cole , Jackson , Nixon , and Wade went to the Sumners ' home with the intention of robbing and killing the couple .
Once inside the home , the Sumners were bound with duct tape while Nixon , Wade , and Jackson searched for valuables .
The group then forced the couple to their garage and into the trunk of their Lincoln Town Car .
Buried Alive
Nixon and Wade drove the Lincoln Town Car , followed by Cole and Jackson who were in a Mazda that Cole had rented for the trip .
They were headed to a spot located right across the Florida line in Georgia ; they had already chosen the spot and prepared it by digging a large hole two days earlier .
When they arrived , Jackson and Wade led the couple into the hole and buried them alive .
At some point , Jackson had forced the couple to tell him their personal identification number for their ATM card .
The group then abandoned the Lincoln and found a hotel room to stay in for the night .
The next day they returned to the Sumners ' home , wiped it down with Clorox , and stole jewelry and a computer which Cole later pawned .
Over the next few days , the group celebrated their crime by spending several thousand dollars that they stole from the Sumners ' bank account .
The Investigation
On July 10 , 2005 , Mrs. Sumner 's daughter , Rhonda Alford , called authorities and reported that her parents were missing .
Investigators went to the Sumners ' home and discovered a bank statement that showed a large sum of money in it .
The bank was contacted and it was learned that an excessive amount of money had been withdrawn from the account over the past few days .
On July 12 , Jackson and Cole , posing as the Sumners , made a call to the Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office .
They told the detective that responded to the call that they had left town quickly due to a family emergency and were having problems accessing their account .
They claimed they were hoping that he could help .
Suspecting that they were not really the Sumners , the detective contacted the bank and asked them not to block any withdrawals from the account so that he could continue his investigation .
He was then able to track the cellular telephone that the callers used .
It belonged to Michael Jackson , and records showed the phone had been used near the Sumners ' home at the time that they disappeared .
There were also several calls made to a car rental company that was able to provide the detective with a description of the Mazda that Cole had rented and was now overdue .
By using the global tracking system in the car , it was determined that the Mazda had been within blocks of the Sumners ' home on the night that they went missing .
Busted
On July 14 , the entire group , with the exception of Cole , was caught at a Best Western Hotel in Charlestown , South Carolina .
Police searched the two hotel rooms that were rented under Cole 's name and found personal property belonging to the Sumners .
They also found the Sumners ' ATM card in Jackson 's back pocket .
Cole was caught at her home near Charlestown after police got her address through the car rental agency from which she rented the Mazda .
Confession
Bruce Nixon was the first co-defendant that confessed to murdering the Sumners .
He provided police with the details of the crimes that were committed , how the robbery and abduction were planned , and the location of where the couple was buried .
Dr. Anthony J. Clark , Medical Examiner for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation , performed autopsies on the Sumners and testified that they both died after being buried alive and their airway passages became blocked with dirt .
Cole Pleads Her Case
Cole took the stand during her trial .
She testified that she thought that the crime would be a simple theft and that she did not knowingly participate in the robberies , kidnappings , or murders .
She also said that she was at first unaware that the Sumners were in the trunk of their Lincoln and that they were being taken to the pre-dug gravesite .
She then said the holes were dug in order to scare the Sumners into giving up their ATM PIN numbers .
Conviction and Sentencing
On October 19 , 2007 , the jury deliberated for 90 minutes before finding Cole guilty of two counts of first - degree murder on both premeditation and felony - murder theories , two counts of kidnapping , and two counts of robbery .
Cole was sentenced to death for each murder , life imprisonment for each kidnapping , and 15 years for each robbery .
She is currently on death row at the Lowell Correctional Institution Annex .
The Co-Defendants
Wade and Jackson were also convicted and sentenced to two death sentences .
Nixon pleaded guilty to second - degree murder and was sentenced to 45 years in prison .
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh launched the country 's first locally built nuclear - powered submarine on Sunday .
Manmohan Singh , center , honors a war victory in New Delhi on Sunday , the same day he launched a sub .
" Today , we join a select group of five nations who possess the capability to build a nuclear - powered submarine , " Singh declared in his speech at the eastern naval base of Visakhapatnam .
Although he billed the submarine as an outcome of a public - private partnership , the Indian leader did mention Russia in his address .
" I would also like to express our appreciation to our Russian friends for their consistent and invaluable cooperation , which symbolizes the close strategic partnership that we enjoy with Russia , " Singh remarked .
Nonetheless , he called for leveraging the strengths of India 's private industry for defense goals .
Singh , however , insisted the submarine launch reflected no aggressive plans by his country .
" We do not have any aggressive designs , nor do we seek to threaten anyone .
We seek an external environment in our region and beyond that is conducive to our peaceful development and the protection of our value systems , " Singh said .
The launch came 11 years after internationally condemned tit - for - tat nuclear tests -- first by India and then by Pakistan -- in May 1998 .

Federal Budget Deficit and National Debt Projections Point to Uncertain US Economic Future
White House released projections indicating that the Federal Budget Deficit will rise by almost $ 9 Trillion by 2019 .
The new figures also indicate that the national debt in 2019 would have risen to about $ 23 Trillion , or 76.5 % of the GDP .
How will we as a country spend $ 9 T more than we take in over the next 10 years ?
Either we will need to borrow the $ 9 T , or we will need to print more money to pay for spending ( or some combination of both ) .
Raising tax burden on personal and corporate incomes are not an answer ( does n’t mean it will not be tried ) as it has been historically observed that the tax receipts manage to stay constant at 19.5 % of GDP regardless of the level of marginal tax rates .
It is also important to note that increase in tax rates will have the effect of suppressing the GDPs so any attempt to raise tax revenues by raising the tax rates will eventually backfire in the form of lower growth and lower tax base .
Let us look at the two remaining options .
US can borrow more to pay for the projected budget deficits : Certainly a part of the budget deficit will be paid for by increasing borrowings .
The problem with this scenario is that already many of our traditional lenders ( read China ) are getting squeamish about the deterioration in the US balance sheet quality and would demand increasing returns in the future if they choose to continue to fund the US borrowings .
This means interest rates will rise to compensate for the increasing lending risk , which will dampen the US economic activity as capital becomes more expensive .
It also means that the debt burden on the future generations will increase significantly and the debt repayments will become a greater proportion of the US national budget .
Even today the US national debt as a proportion of GDP teeters on being unsustainable , and any further worsening may become a trigger for the problem to spiral out of control .
Worse case scenario includes the possibility that the US will default on one or more of its debt obligations .
US can inflate its way out of the problem by printing more money : Most US domestic obligations ( such as medicare and social security ) are inflation adjusted , so printing more money is not likely to improve the fiscal situation in this respect .
However , the interest payments on the currently outstanding debt ( treasuries , munis , federal bonds , etc ) are fixed and printing more money will certainly help in devaluing these debt obligations .
The problem would be any future new debt issues .
Lenders will certainly demand a premium to compensate for the inflation risk .
Worse case scenario includes the nightmare scenario of hyperinflation as the government loses control of the monetary policy .
I personally think that this is a feasible scenario and something that we should all be worried about .
In either case , we can all look forward to a significant devaluation of the US dollar in the world markets , rising interest rates , and high inflation .
The only way to counter high inflation and rising interest rates would be a spectacular spike in productivity in the US ( more production with less capital employed ) .
Maybe alternative energy or nano - technology have the potential to generate this productivity spike .
Maybe not .
In any case , it is prudent to re-arrange your assets so you will be better prepared for inflationary environment .
I will add one more piece of advice if you are convinced that high inflation is a real possibility ( and I do so fully expecting to be chewed up and spat out by the politically correct financial advice providers for doing this ) .
Take as much debt as you can afford today and invest in assets that will retain its value during inflation such as real - estate , commodities , stocks .
And make sure the debt you take on has fixed interest rate .
That way , when the inflation really hits , your income will grow , the assets you invested in will increase in value with inflation , but your debt payments will stay the same ( or decline relative to your overall financial picture ) .
Uncontrolled leverage caused the financial bubble , but prudent leverage can save you in the aftermath .

Last month , when the US Congress failed to pass a bankruptcy reform measure that would have allowed home mortgages to be modified in bankruptcy , senator Dick Durbin succinctly commented : " The banks own the place . "
That seems pretty clear .
After all , it was the banks ' greed that fed the housing bubble with loony loans that were guaranteed to go bad .
Of course the finance guys also made a fortune guaranteeing the loans that were guaranteed to go bad ( ie AIG ) , and when everything went bust , the taxpayers got handed the bill .
The cost of the bailout will certainly be in the hundreds of billions , if not more than $ 1tn when it is all over .
More importantly , we are looking at the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression .
The cumulative lost output over the years 2008 - 2012 will almost certainly exceed $ 5tn .
That comes to more than $ 60,000 for an average family of four .
This is the price that we are paying for the bankers ' greed , coupled with incredible incompetence and / or corruption from our regulators .
Under these circumstances , it would be reasonable to think that the bankers would be keeping a low profile for a while .
That 's not the way it works in Washington .
The banks are aggressively pushing their case in Congress and Obama administration .
Not only are we not going to see bankruptcy reform , but any financial reform package that gets through Congress will probably contain enough loopholes that it will be almost useless .
In this political environment , the poor might get empathy , but Wall Street gets money , and lots of it .
Even when the issue is global warming Wall Street has its hand out .
The fees on trading carbon permits could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars in coming decades .
A simple carbon tax would have been far more efficient , but efficiency is not the most important value when it comes to making Wall Street richer .
This is why it was so encouraging to see congressman Peter DeFazio 's proposal to tax trades in oil options and futures .
DeFazio proposed a tax of 0.02 % on trades in oil futures and options as a way to make up a shortfall in the federal government 's highway trust fund .
This tax could raise billions of dollars each year in revenue and make speculation in the oil market a more dangerous affair .
The logic is very simple .
For someone using these markets to hedge , the tax will be inconsequential .
For example , a farmer that hedges a $ 400,000 wheat crop will pay $ 80 when selling a future .
Similarly , airlines that hedge by buying oil futures will barely notice the higher cost .
In fact , because trading costs have fallen so much in recent decades , a tax at this level would just be raising costs back to their levels of two decades ago , a point at which there was already a very vibrant futures and options market .
However , even a modest tax will make life much more difficult for speculators .
Many of them expect to make quick short - term gains , often buying and selling the same day .
For these traders , an increase in transactions costs of 0.02 % would be a burden .
Of course , a modest tax will not drive the speculators out of the market altogether , it is just likely to reduce the volume of speculation .
For this reason , even a modest tax can still raise an enormous amount of money in a market where tens of trillions of dollars of derivatives changes hands each year .
This tax can best be thought of as a tax on gambling .
Gambling is heavily taxed in every state that allows it .
DeFazio 's bill is effectively a tax on gambling in the oil markets .
It will not stop it , but it would discourage it , and in the process raise a huge amount of money that could go to productive purposes .
The bill faces an enormous uphill struggle in Congress .
As Durbin said , the banks own the place , and they are not going to just step aside and let Congress impose a tax on such a lucrative business .
But , it is important that people know about the DeFazio bill .
First , DeFazio deserves a place on the honour roll for standing up to Wall Street .
Also , it is important for the public to know that there is a relatively low - cost way to make up the shortfall in the highway trust fund .
When Congress raises some other tax and / or cuts a useful programme , people should know that there was a better alternative .
It just did n't happen because , as we know , the banks own the place .

Is smart sexy ?
Our knee - jerk reaction – reinforced by cultural stereotypes of Star Trek - convention attending geeks and a seeming obsession with ditzy , pretty starlets – would argue otherwise .
Nerds are , well , nerds .
But consider Peter Orszag .
As director of the US Office of Management and Budget , he is the nation ’s most powerful pencil - pusher .
Yet Orszag was recently named one of the hunks of Washington DC .
“ He ’s made nerdy sexy , ” Barack Obama ’s chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , said of the 40 - year - old , glasses - wearing son of a maths professor .
They may be onto something .

Brains count
Increasing scientific evidence shows that brains count for a lot in mate choice .
And now – for the first time – researchers have directly linked a male ’s cognitive performance to his luck with the ladies .
“ Males that are better problem - solvers are mating with more females , ” says Jason Keagy , a behavioural ecologist at the University of Maryland in College Park , who studies not the mating rituals of the political elite in nearby Washington DC , but those of a bird native to the forests of eastern Australia .
However ritual is still the best word to describe the sexual behaviour of satin bowerbirds .
Males construct elaborate shrines – bowers – to woo females , who judge males by the quality of their ornately decorated grass bowers and elaborate mating dances .
Bird IQ test
Both features let males show off their smarts , suggests Keagy , whose team developed a bowerbird IQ test , of sorts , then recorded which males attracted the most females over two breeding seasons .
Psychologists studying human mate choice do n’t often have the luxury of tracking their volunteers in the wild , and so have traditionally asked females to rate the traits they value in a potential suitor .
In search of a more relevant test of human desire , a team led by Mark Prokosch at Elon University , North Carolina , presented female university students with videos of males performing various cognitive and athletic feats , and then asked the women to judge each male ’s intelligence and desirability .
Females were n’t very good at determining which were the smartest males .
But when the women were simply asked to pick out which men they found most attractive , those men turned out to be the most intelligent .
Similarly , Keagy is n’t sure how female satin bowerbirds – who were absent when males performed the tests – judged the brainiest birds .
Odious red
His team ’s problem - solving tests required males to remove red blocks , a colour they find odious , from their bowers in two different ways .
In one test , researchers placed blocks under a clear plastic container , which birds had to knock off before removing the blocks .
In a second exam , Keagy ’s team presented males with an unmoveable red block screwed into the ground .
The smartest males determined that covering the block with leaves was the best way to obscure it .
One possibility is that the tests reflect on duties connected to mating , Keagy says .
Males that are better at problem - solving may construct more appealing bowers ; previous research has shown that adding desirable blue parrot feathers to a male ’s bower boosts his odds with females , Keagy says .
Other studies – some with robotic females – have found that bowerbird males who are most responsive to subtle cues from females tend to enjoy more success than males who are blind to their partner ’s desires .
Smart males
Yet why do females , be they bowerbird or human , favour more intelligent males ?
Although the two species last shared a common ancestor tens of millions of years ago and humans tend to practice monogamy , while bowerbird males mate with as many females as possible , there may be a common explanation .
Females could use intelligence as an indicator of the genetic quality of a potential mate and the genes he will pass onto her kids .
“ A male that has a well functioning brain is probably going to be good at surviving , ” Keagy says .
“ It ’s almost like a way of interpreting all this information about the genetic quality of a male . ”
In two recent studies Geoffrey Miller of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his wife Rosalind Arden of King ’s College in London have found provisional evidence for the same effect in humans .
Genetic health
The duo examined medical records of thousands of Vietnam veterans , who took a battery of intelligence and health tests in the 1980s as part of a government study on the after - effects of Agent Orange .
After controlling for lifestyle differences , Miller and Arden found that more intelligent men experienced fewer health problems , such as hernias and cataracts , than less intelligent men .
What ’s more , performance on intelligence was also associated with healthy sperm in a smaller subset of vets .
Miller argues that intelligence is a sexually selected trait females use to gauge the overall genetic health of potential mate .
Female bowerbirds , however , probably are n’t so attuned to the wits of their mates , says Carlos Botero , a behavioural ecologist at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham , North Carolina .
Rather , the birds may fancy males who are better dancers or bower - builders .
“ Females may not be selecting on intelligence but the product of that intelligence , ” he says .
However , Botero thinks that it is n’t so much of a stretch to look for common ground in between satin bowerbirds and Homo sapiens .
“ If we have other systems in which we do find that mates are being selected on the basis of intelligence , it could lead to novel insights about our own species . ”

SAN FRANCISCO  Silicon Valley was abuzz Wednesday with news that the Justice Department had begun an antitrust investigation into the hiring practices of some of the best - known companies in the technology and biotech industries , including Google , Apple , Yahoo and Genentech .
The question being asked most frequently was how the word “ anticompetitive ” could possibly be applied to the industry ’s perpetual fight over talent .
But some employment and antitrust lawyers , recruiters and others said that while Valley companies compete aggressively for top engineers , marketers and executives , it is not a free - for - all .
“ There is a gentlemen ’s understanding all over the Valley that , it ’s not that you do n’t hire , it ’s the process by which you hire , ” said Randy Komisar , a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
Some veteran human resources executives said that hiring was not so much the issue ; employees are free to look for work pretty much anywhere .
But they say major companies often have an unwritten agreement to not actively poach employees from their partners .
There is plenty to criticise in Islam 's view of women .
Last year , the Observer told the story of a man in Basra who stamped on , suffocated and then stabbed to death his 17 - year - old daughter for becoming infatuated with a British soldier .
The relationship apparently amounted to a few conversations , but her father learnt she had been seen in public talking to the soldier .
When the Observer talked to Abdel - Qader Ali two weeks later , he said : " Death was the least she deserved .
I do n't regret it .
I had the support of all my friends who are fathers , like me , and know what she did was unacceptable to any Muslim that honours his religion . "
This was clearly extreme , but the truth is that the God many people believe in - whether Muslim , Christian or Jewish - hates women .
Take America 's Southern Baptist Convention , which declares in its faith and mission statement : " A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband . "
That 's fair enough , is n't it ?
After all , he 's probably stronger than she is .
Or there 's the Catholic church .
The Pope put things more suavely in an address in 2008 : " Faced with cultural and political trends that seek to eliminate , or at least cloud and confuse , the sexual differences inscribed in human nature , considering them a cultural construct , it is necessary to recall God 's design that created the human being masculine and feminine , with a unity and at the same time an original difference . "
The insistence on difference is the necessary first step to insisting on inequality and subordination and it is a step that popes have been taking at regular intervals for decades .
In November 2006 , Nicaragua enacted a ban on all abortion , with no exceptions , even to save the mother 's life .
The law was ratified by the National Assembly in September 2007 .
Both the original enactment and the vote in September 2007 were widely attributed to the influence of the Catholic church .
In a report this month , the United Nations Committee against torture called Nicaragua 's total ban on abortion a violation of human rights .
Then there is Judaism .
In one neighbourhood in Jerusalem , religious seminaries flank streets with yellow signs that warn : " If you 're a woman and you 're not properly dressed - do n't pass through our neighbourhood . "
So why is it so often women who fill the pews ?
Is it a form of Stockholm syndrome ?
Religions do a good job of training people to be obedient and loyal to the authorities and women in particular are raised to be both devout and submissive .
Religions are sticky : they are hard to abandon and that is doubly true for women , given that subordination and unshakable fidelity are their chief duties .
The fact that women are defined as different from men ( " complementary " is the religious euphemism ) and confined to narrower , more monotonous lives as a result , means that they have more need of the excitements and passions of religion .
For women , religion often is the heart of a heartless world .
All they have to give up in exchange is their right to shape their own lives ; as long as they behave themselves , all will go swimmingly .
The intimate and inescapable connection that contemporary liberal believers like to see between God and love , theism and compassion , is largely a modern invention .
It 's far from universal now and it was vanishingly rare in the past .
St Francis was an eccentric , not an exemplar .
The painful truth is that still , to this day , most people who believe in a god believe in a god who is often vindictive , punitive and sometimes just plain cruel .
The Ryan report on abuse of children in Irish industrial schools , released two weeks ago , provides a mountain of searing evidence for that .
For decade after decade , generation upon generation , the religious congregations in charge of the institutions saw nothing wrong .
One survivor of Goldenbridge , the most notorious industrial school for girls , run by the Sisters of Mercy , told the commission : " The screaming of children will stay with me for the rest of my life about Goldenbridge .
I still hear it , I still have n't recovered from that .
Children crying and screaming , it was just endless , it never , never stopped for years in that place . "
Many of those children were there simply because their mothers were unmarried or divorced .
The God we have in the Big Three monotheisms is a God who originated in a period when male superiority was absolutely taken for granted .
That time has passed , but the superior male God remains and that God holds women in contempt .
That God is the one who puts " His " imprimatur on all those tyrannical laws .
That God is a product of history , but taken to be eternal , which is a bad combination .
That is the God who hates women .
So why do so many women put up with it ?
Partly because God gives with one hand what " He " takes away with the other - God consoles people for the very harshness that God creates .
It 's the sad , familiar , heartrending bargain in which the victim embraces the perpetrator , in some complicated , confusing , all - too - human mix of appeasement , need and stubborn loyalty .
The fact that the embrace is all on one side is resolutely ignored .

VLC Media Player 1.0 gets launched after years in development , you download it instantly and launch it up .
“ Huh !
There seems to be nothing new ” , you proclaim .
This is exactly what this post is about , showing you eight new useful features of VLC 1.0 that your faint eye ca n’t see otherwise .
Instantaneous Pausing
“ Is this even a feature ? ” , say ex-vlc fanboys who have ported over to other media players .
In fact , this is one of the many features that has been requested for such a long time .
Instantaneous Pausing allows a user to pause any video the moment he / she hits the pause button , no more delays .
It pauses at the exact frame ( without skipping ) which is quite impressive .
Live Recording
Yup , you heard it right .
The latest version now supports on - the - fly recording for all type of medias .
In case you are wondering how to make recording easier , go to View menu and hit Advanced Controls .
You will now see a Record button next to control buttons .
Frame By Frame Playback
So you are watching a superhero movie with your friends and a huge explosion goes off .
To enjoy it once again , you can now go over it frame - by frame with the frame by frame playback functionality .
When you enable advanced controls from the View menu , apart from Record , Snapshot , and Loop buttons , you will find the Frame - by - Frame Playback button .
Clicking it once will move your video to the next frame , pressing it again will move it to another frame ahead and so on .
Before VLC 1.0 , if you had to take a snapshot of any part of the video the quickest way would be to hit snapshot button at the right time during the video .
If you do n’t get lucky , an alternative way is to try hitting the Pause button which will actually pause the video after missing few seconds .
Frame by frame playback makes tasks such as snapshot much more easier .
Customizable Interface
So you do n’t like the look , right ?
No problem , now you can customize the interface according to your own styles and needs .
Simply head over to the View menu and hit Customize Interface .
Now go ahead and select the buttons that you want , the position at which you want them , and much more .
There are also some pre-configured Profiles that you might want to try out .
AirTunes Streaming
For those who do n’t know what is Airtunes streaming , it is a functionality for Apple ’s Airport Express that allows you to play media files on your home stereo speakers .
Originally it was developed to work with iTunes but now VLC has officially added the support for AirTunes streaming as well .
If you have Apple ’s Airport Express properly installed , all you need to do is to load up your favorite media file on VLC Media Player , head over to the playlist , right - click the media file and hit Stream .
Ofcourse you will need to tweak some basic settings later , but it works flawlessly .
Full screen Interface / Minimal View & Better Video Scaling
Whether you have an old 17 ” monitor or the latest 40 ” LCD , VLC Media Player will now scale your videos better in fullscreen mode .
Do n’t get confused between Fullscreen Mode and Fullscreen Interface , the former is the same old fullscreen when you double - click the video , while the later is the new functionality .
Fullscreen interface and Minimal view , both can be accessed from the View tab and are important in their own terms .
– Fullscreen Interface comes useful when you have to watch the video in fullscreen and at the same time want access to the menus .
( Hotkey : Ctrl + H )
– Minimal view comes useful when you want to watch the video in fullscreen mode and keep watch on other windows in the taskbar as well .
( Hotkey : F11 )
Finer Speed Controls
Remember the good old days when you were able to easily forward and reverse your movie in the VHS Player , such a functionality is back in the latest release of VLC but in a whole new way .
Head over to the Playback menu and you will find all types of Speed Controls from faster / slower to jump forward / backward .
New Formats And New HD Codecs
If you are searching for a good video player that can play HD - DVD and Blu - Ray movies seamlessly , you just found one .
The latest release of VLC brings many new HD codecs , formats , and adds some improvement to various Demuxers and Encoders .
Now you can play Blu-ray and HD - DVD movies without any lag .
Note :
If you experience lagging while playing HD Movies , make sure that your hardware actually supports it before complaining about VLC to the developers .
Miscellaneous
Apart from the features that we have mentioned above it now also supports two new playlists : Windows Media Player Playlist ( WPL ) and Zune Playlist ( ZPL ) .
It also brings some core improvements to the subtitles and allows you to export the playlist in HTML format .
Another important improvement has been made to the video when running in fullscreen mode , you can now zoom inside while keeping the black borders .
To see the full list of changes , check out the changelog .
Have n’t downloaded the latest version yet ?
You can still grab it now .

I am afraid there has been a misunderstanding since that election in 2008 , during which 66,882,230 Americans cast their votes for you .
Perhaps one of your trusted advisors has given you bum information .
Maybe they told you that we voted for you -- walked , marched , prayed , fund - raised and knocked on doors for you -- because we hoped you would try to reunite the country .
Of the total votes cast that long - ago November day , I ’m guessing that about 1,575 people wanted you to try to reconcile the toxic bipartisanship that culminated in those Sarah Palin rallies .
The other 66,880,655 of us wanted universal healthcare .
You inherited a country that was in the most desperate shape since the Civil War , or the Depression , and we voted for you to heal the catastrophic wounds Bush inflicted on our country and our world .
You said that you were up to that challenge .
We did not vote for you to see if you could get Chuck Grassley or Michael Enzi to date you .
The spectacle of you wooing them fills us with horror and even disgust .
We recoil as from hot flame at each mention of your new friends .
Believe me , I know exactly how painful this can be , how reminiscent of 7th - grade yearning to be popular , because I went through it myself this summer .
I did not lower my bar quite as low as you have , but I was sitting on the couch one afternoon , thinking that this adorable guy and I were totally on the same sheet of music -- he had given me absolutely every indication that we were -- and were moving into the kissing stage .
Out of nowhere , I thought to ask him if he liked me in the same way I liked him .

He said , in so many words , no .
And Mr. President , that is what the Republicans are saying to you :
They are just not that into you , sir .
This may have thrown you for such a loop that you have forgotten why you were elected -- which was to lead your people back to the promises of our founding parents .
Many of us no longer recognized our country after eight years of Bush and Cheney , and you gave us your word that you would help restore the great headway we had made on matters of race , equality and plain old social justice .
People , get ready , you said ; there ’s a train a ‘ coming .
And we did get ready .
We hit the streets .
We roared , whispered , cried , whooped and went door to door , convinced that even if Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had not specifically dreamed of you , his dream of justice and equality and pride might come into being through your vision , your greatness , through the hope that your words gave us , through the change you promised .

He dreamed of a leader like you .
Just like you .
And something in the deepest part of this country ’s soul heard .
After eight years of Bush , and then the Palin nomination , we were battered and anguished and punch - drunk .
But in rallying behind you , we came back to life , like in Ezekiel when the prophet breathes the spirit of bearing witness and caring onto the dry bones , and those bones come back to life , become living people again , cherished and tended to .
We did not know exactly how you would proceed to restore our beloved Constitution .
It seemed beyond redemption , like my kitchen floor did briefly last week after my dog , Bodhi , accidentally ate 24 corn bread muffins .
You said you would push back your sleeves and begin , that it would take all of us working harder than we ever had before , but that you would lead .
While acknowledging the financial and moral devastation of the last eight years , you said you would start by giving your people healthcare .
You would do battle with the conservatives and insurance companies .
You said in your beautiful way many times that this was the overarching moral and spiritual issue of our times , and we understood this to mean that you took this to be your Selma , your Little Rock .
I hate to sound like a betrayed 7 - year - old , but you said .
And we believed you .
Now you seem to have abandoned the dream .
That is why moderates and liberals and progressives like myself all seem a little tense this summer .
It is time to call your spirit back .
We will be here to help when you get back from vacation .
We want to help you get over the disappointment of Mr. Grassley ’s cold shoulder , of Mr. Enzi blowing you off , even that nice Olympia Snowe standing you up .
We can and will take to the streets again , march and hold peaceful rallies , go door to door , donate to any causes that will help get out the truth of what a public option would mean .
But we need you to shake off the dust of the journey and remember the promises of Dr. King , and we need you to lead us toward what is no longer so distant a shore .

Do it for Teddy Kennedy , boss .
Do it for the other Kennedys too , for Dr. King , for Big Mama , for the poorest kids you met on the trail , the kids who go to emergency rooms for their healthcare , do it for their mothers and for Michelle .

Second Skin
by Kevin [ Wednesday , 12th of August 2009 - 08:49 PM ]
“ Second Skin takes an intimate look at three sets of computer gamers whose lives have been transformed by online virtual worlds .
An emerging genre of computer software called Massively Multiplayer Online games , or MMOs , allows millions of users to interact simultaneously in virtual spaces .
Of the 50 million players worldwide , 50 percent consider themselves addicted .
From individuals struggling with addiction to couples who have fallen in love without meeting ; from disabled players whose lives have been given new purpose to gold farmers , entrepreneurs and widows , Second Skin opens viewers ’ eyes to a phenomenon that may permanently change the way human beings interact .
In March 2008 , Second Skin premiered opening night of SXSW .
Without any news of a theatrical or DVD release , Second Skin landed extensive coverage in Newsweek , NPR , Wired , BBC , The Dr. Phil Show , Boston Globe , Variety and dozens of other major media outlets .
Second Skin was also voted the # 4 Documentary of 2008 by internet juggernaut Ain’t It Cool News .
This August , Second Skin will become the first widely released movie about virtual worlds - a movie for the 50 million gamers who spend most of their time in virtual worlds , and all those curious to understand this phenomenon .

Trailer :
In theaters August 7th
On DVD everywhere August 25th
It is a highly recommended flick and really approaches the subject matter with a respect I think that many documentaries lack .
I have seen several documentaries that deal with the gaming industry ; they either seemed too abbreviated , like Frag , or too contrived , like King of Kong ( or just outright insulting ...
Yes , I 'm speaking of Gamer , not a documentary but insulting nonetheless ) .
However , Second Skin is a well - crafted look into the lives of these people .
Thankfully , for a limited time , the movie in its entirety is available on Hulu , here .
Judging by the comments , it has already stimulated some dialogue concerning the subject matter as well as the participants .
The documentary earnestly shows how gaming can affect people 's lives - how they lead them and when they decide to change ( if they deem change as necessary ) .
It is the personality of this film that sets it apart from an expose that you may see on the news concerning MMOs .
This is n't a damning feature about how horrible MMOs are , it strives to be a personable film that is easy to relate to , and I genuinely think it succeeds .

FC Schalke 04 are contenders for the Bundesliga title
An anthem sung by fans of the German football club FC Schalke 04 has drawn protests from Muslims because of its reference to the Prophet Muhammad .
The Gelsenkirchen club , which plays in Germany 's top league , the Bundesliga , has asked an Islam expert to consider whether the song might be insulting .
The third verse contains the words : " Muhammad was a prophet who understood nothing about football " .
" But of all the lovely colours he chose [ Schalke 's ] blue and white , " it goes .
The club has received hundreds of e-mails from angry Muslims recently , since Turkish media carried reports about the song .
Police in Gelsenkirchen , in the industrial Ruhr region of western Germany , say they are taking the Muslim complaints very seriously .
The head of Germany 's Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , said his council would not call for a ban on the anthem , but would like " an explanation of its background " .
The song is called " Blue and White , how I love you " and in German the lyrics about Muhammad read : Mohammed war ein Prophet , der vom Fussballspielen nichts versteht .
Doch aus all der schoenen Farbenpracht hat er sich das Blau und Weisse ausgedacht .
The German news website Deutsche Welle says the song was written in 1924 and it is not clear when the Muhammad reference made its way in .
The Claytable by Erwin Zwiers is inspired by the beach .
Specifically , Zwiers noted that the beach is one of the few places where humans leave behind a trail when they pass through it .
Zwiers imagined this experience translated for public spaces in the claytable , something people would be drawn to and could play with as they passed through .
He imagines the table would do well in waiting rooms ( especially for hospitals , schools , or nurseries ) , and interestingly , brainstorm areas for companies .
I think that last one is interesting because there ’s this talk about giving your hands something to do , bringing objects in so people can hold them and play with them as they think .
It ’s interesting because this is also in conjunction with reports that doodling actually can help people stay on task , by preventing the mind from becoming bored .
NPR reported on this and a slightly amusing doodling snafu involving Bill Gates and Tony Blair .
And personally , I ’m just a doodler and fidgeter myself .
Anyways , the table ’s look reminds me of Fredrikson Stallard ’s Pyrenees ( via Yatzer ) .
Enough of Sarah Palin , the victim

I wish Sarah Palin would just go away .
During the 2008 presidential campaign , I wrote about the unfair personal treatment to which the political press corps subjected Palin and her children .
Now I just want her to stop milking her role as GOP martyr .
Palin should stick to her day job - by which I mean , governing Alaska , not being fodder for talk - show humor .
Both parties have their umbrage industries - thanks to true believers , who love nothing better than to see themselves as victims of a perceived double standard .
Last week , comedian David Letterman 's two off - color jokes about a Palin family trip to New York led to an orgy of indignation .
Yes , I know that a politician 's family - especially their minor children - is supposed to be off - limits .
Letterman apparently thought he was joking about 18 - year - old teenage mom Bristol Palin , unaware that 14 - year - old Willow Palin went to Yankee Stadium .
Which , of course , gave the Alaska governor license to huff : " Laughter incited by sexually perverted comments made by a 62 - year - old male celebrity aimed at a 14 - year - old girl is not only disgusting , but it reminds us ( that ) some Hollywood / NY entertainers have a long way to go in understanding what the rest of America understands - that acceptance of inappropriate sexual comments about an underage girl , who could be anyone 's daughter , contributes to the atrociously high rate of sexual exploitation of minors by older men who use and abuse others . "
In that any sex act between an adult male and a 14 - year - old would constitute statutory rape , father Todd Palin chimed in , too : " Any ' jokes ' about raping my 14 - year - old are despicable . "
Now there 's a firedavidletterman.com
Web site and a planned protest outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City today .
If anyone thinks these antics will help Palin in the 2012 GOP primary , guess again .
These stories do n't tell voters that Palin has the smartest energy policy or that she 's been a more successful governor than California 's Arnold Schwarzenegger - they tell voters that Palin 's life is a nonstop soap opera .
Republicans who want to win back Washington would do well to look for a winner .
Not a victim .
Speaking of too much drama : I wish Newt Gingrich would just go away , too .
It 's not just his messy personal life and crash - and - burn House speakership .
It 's his oral opportunism .
One year , Gingrich is sharing a public - service announcement two - shot with Democrat Nancy Pelosi that warns about the dangers of global warming , the next year , he 's attacking " environmental extremism . "
The man will say anything to get on TV .
He is shameless .
The worst of it is , Gingrich is not the right 's most shameless talking head .
That dubious honor belongs to Dick Morris , who turned on Bill Clinton years ago , so now he 's supposed to be a great political mind on the right .
That 's right , he 's our sleaze bucket .
How low the party of Monica jokes has fallen .
In a surprise GDC Europe announcement , CCP CEO Hilmar Petursson has debuted Dust 514 , a strategic first - person console MMO that connects in to the existing EVE Online universe , allowing ground battles for planets to be fought by console teams .
The announcement , with the trailer tagline of " one universe , one war , " came at the end of a talk about the history of CCP .
It left many GDC Europe keynote attendees -- perhaps expecting an announcement for World Of Darkness , CCP 's other rumored project -- significantly surprised .
The trailer , with slick in - game graphics , showcased a space station and then impressive first - person shooter gameplay .
Petursson said that Dust 514 is " our take on a console MMO , " and was made after the company " looked hard at what people wanted to do on consoles . "
It 'll join space - based PC MMO EVE Online , which currently has more than 300,000 monthly subscribers , in the Icelandic - headquartered company 's portfolio .
The project has been in development at CCP Shanghai for almost three years , and a release date and target consoles were not announced .
The team - based game has the player " fighting in a massive war " on existing planets in the EVE Online universe , and is a standalone MMO title , " but is also connected to EVE , " according to the CCP boss .
In fact , when Dust 514 launches , the map of EVE , currently divined only by player structures owned in the PC game , will also take into account infantry successes and failures within the console game .
Players in the PC MMO can " fund mercenaries and give them goals " in the console title .
CCP 's Petursson hope that " these communities will meld over time , " expecting specific Dust 514 corporations to start with , but eventually social structures that bridge across the two .
He quipped of the new game and the relationship between the two titles : " While the fleet does the flying , the infantry does the dying . "
As for the title of the game , Petursson said that he would n't give away why the title was called Dust 514 , but that very clever devotees of the existing EVE Online universe might be able to work things out .
Overview
An intracranial hematoma is a collection of blood within the skull .
It 's most commonly caused by the rupture of a blood vessel within the brain or from trauma such as a car accident or fall .
The blood collection can be within the brain tissue or underneath the skull , pressing on the brain .
Some head injuries , such as one that causes only a brief lapse of consciousness , can be minor .
However , an intracranial hematoma is potentially life - threatening .
It usually requires immediate treatment , which might include surgery to remove the blood .
Symptoms
You might develop signs and symptoms of an intracranial hematoma right after an injury to your head , or they may take weeks or longer to appear .
You might seem fine after a head injury , a period called the lucid interval .
However , with time , pressure on your brain increases , producing some or all of the following signs and symptoms :
Increasing headache
Vomiting
Drowsiness and progressive loss of consciousness
Dizziness
Confusion
Unequal pupil size
Slurred speech
Loss of movement ( paralysis ) on the opposite side of the body from the head injury
As more blood fills your brain or the narrow space between your brain and skull , other signs and symptoms may become apparent , such as :
Lethargy
Seizures
Unconsciousness
When to see a doctor
An intracranial hematoma can be life - threatening , requiring emergency treatment .
Seek immediate medical attention after a blow to the head if you :
Lose consciousness
Have a persistent headache
Experience vomiting , weakness , blurred vision , unsteadiness
If signs and symptoms are n't immediately evident after a blow to the head , watch for physical , mental and emotional changes .
For example , if someone seems fine after a blow to the head and can talk but later becomes unconscious , seek immediate medical care .
Also , even if you feel fine , ask someone to keep an eye on you .
Memory loss after a blow to your head can make you forget about the blow .
Someone you tell might be more likely to recognize the warning signs and get you medical attention .
Causes
A head injury is the most common cause of bleeding within the skull .
A head injury may result from motor vehicle or bicycle accidents , falls , assaults , and sports injuries .
If you 're an older adult , even mild head trauma can cause a hematoma .
This is especially true if you 're taking a blood - thinning medication or an anti-platelet drug , such as aspirin .
You can have a serious injury even if there 's no open wound , bruise or other obvious damage .
There are three categories of hematoma — subdural hematoma , epidural hematoma and intracerebral ( intraparenchymal ) hematoma .
Subdural hematoma
This occurs when blood vessels — usually veins — rupture between your brain and the outermost of three membrane layers that cover your brain ( dura mater ) .
The leaking blood forms a hematoma that presses on the brain tissue .
An enlarging hematoma can cause gradual loss of consciousness and possibly death .
The three types of subdural hematomas are :
Acute .
This most dangerous type is generally caused by a severe head injury , and signs and symptoms usually appear immediately .
This most dangerous type is generally caused by a severe head injury , and signs and symptoms usually appear immediately .
Subacute .
Signs and symptoms take time to develop , sometimes days or weeks after your injury .
Signs and symptoms take time to develop , sometimes days or weeks after your injury .
Chronic .
The result of less severe head injuries , this type of hematoma can cause slow bleeding , and symptoms can take weeks and even months to appear .
You might not recall injuring your head .
For example , bumping your head while getting into the car can cause bleeding , especially if you 're on blood - thinning medication .
All three types require medical attention as soon as signs and symptoms appear so that permanent brain damage can be prevented .
The risk of subdural hematoma increases as you age .
The risk is also greater for people who :
Take aspirin or other blood - thinning medication daily
Misuse alcohol
Epidural hematoma
Also called an extradural hematoma , this type occurs when a blood vessel — usually an artery — ruptures between the outer surface of the dura mater and the skull .
Blood then leaks between the dura mater and the skull to form a mass that presses on brain tissue .
The most common cause of an epidural hematoma is trauma .
Some people with this type of injury remain conscious , but most become drowsy or go into a coma from the moment of trauma .
An epidural hematoma that affects an artery in your brain can be deadly without prompt treatment .
Intracerebral ( intraparenchymal ) hematoma
This type of hematoma , also known as intraparenchymal hematoma , occurs when blood pools in the tissues of the brain .
There are many causes , including trauma , rupture of a bulging blood vessel ( aneurysm ) , poorly connected arteries and veins from birth , high blood pressure , and tumors .
Diseases can cause spontaneous leakage of blood into the brain .
A head trauma can result in multiple severe intracerebral hematomas .
Prevention
To prevent or minimize head injury :
APPLE KEYBOARDS ARE vulnerable to a hack that puts keyloggers and malware directly into the keyboard .
This could be a serious problem , and now that the presentation and code is out there , the bad guys will surely be exploiting it .
The vulnerability was discovered by K. Chen , and he gave a talk on it at Blackhat this year .
The concept is simple , a modern Apple keyboard has about 8 K of flash memory , and 256 bytes of working ram .
For the intelligent , this is more than enough space to have a field day .
The machine and keyboard in the demo
K. Chen demonstrated the hack to S|A at Defcon today and it worked quite well .
You start out by running GDB , and set a breakpoint in Apple ’s HIDFirmwareUpdaterTool .
This tool is meant to update the firmware in human interface devices , hence the name .
The tool is run , a breakpoint set , and then you simply cut and paste the new code into the firmware image in memory .
That ’s it .
The breakpoint , code and presentation
Nothing is encrypted , decrypted , and the process is simple .
You then resume HIDFirmwareUpdaterTool , and in a few seconds , your keyboard is compromised .
Formatting the OS wo n’t do you any good , the code is in keyboard flash .
There are no batteries to pull , no nothing , the keyboard is simply compromised .
While you can re-flash a keyboard , that is fairly hard to do if you do n’t have a keyboard .
Apple internal keyboards are USB devices , as are the external ones , so the same hack works for them too .
Think about that when you count the dwindling number of external USB ports on modern Macs .
The new firmware can do anything you want it to .
K. Chen demo ’d code that you put in a password , and when you hit return , it starts playing back the last five characters typed in , LIFO .
It is a rudimentary keylogger , a proof of concept more than anything else .
Since there is about 1 K of flash free in the keyboard itself , you can log quite a few keystrokes totally transparently .
If you want the code , it is on page 170 of the PDF presentation linked above .
This exploit is simple and does things by the rules .
K. Chen is very careful not to do anything in an illegal way , and you have to do all the steps manually .
It ca n’t easily be done remotely .
That said , bad guys intent on stealing your data probably wo n’t have the same high moral standards , and it probably would n’t take much to exploit the same vulnerability remotely , silently , with code from a compromised web page .
Apple needs to patch this problem ASAP .
It is completely remotely exploitable , and almost impossible to remove , especially if you do n’t know it is there .
This huge hole that Apple has in it ’s hardware turns any remote exploit , Apple is full of them , into a huge security problem .
We would have called Apple to let them know about this , but the last few times we did , they would not so much as return our phone calls .
Until Apple releases a way to detect the validity of keyboard firmware and patches this huge hole in their system , anyone using Apple hardware , regardless of the OS running , is vulnerable .
Do n’t believe them when they try to spin this as minor , owning a keyboard gives you ownership of a system .

Ever since Malthus , there has been a concern about overpopulation .
I thought it would be an interesting excercise to see how much space the human population actually takes up .
For example , how many oil tankers would it take to carry around the volume of humanity if converted to liquid .
Let ’s say there are 6 billion people on the planet and the average mass per person is 100 kg ( this is an overestimate ) .
Hence , the upper bound on the mass of humanity is kg , or a billion metric tons .
Given that we are mostly water , we can assume that this is about litres .
Taking the cube root gives metres or a kilometre .
Thus , if we liquefied the mass of all humans , it would fit in a cube whose sides are a kilometre long .
The largest oil tankers can carry about five hundred thousand metric tons , so two thousand oil tankers could cart around all of humanity .
To put that into perspective , according to Wikipedia , the current fleet of oil tankers moves around 2 billion metric tons a year , so half the world ’s fleet could carry around the world ’s population .
Now , how much area would we take up if we were to stand side by side .
Let ’s say 6 people can fit into a square metre of space , then we would all be able to fit into a billion square metres or 1000 square kilometres , about the size of Hong Kong ( according to Wolfram Alpha ) , or we could all fit 4 to a square metre onto the island of Oahu in Hawaii .
If we each wanted about 100 square metres of space , then we would take up about a million square kilometres or about twice the area of France .
Wolfram Alpha also tells me that there is about square kilometres of arable land in the world .
If we assume that a square kilometre can feed 1000 people ( 10 people per hectare ) , then that puts the capacity of the earth at 15 billion people .
Monsanto and sustainability .
Biotech and green .
Whether these terms can be closely linked or are mutually exclusive , the heart of the matter is the meaning of sustainability — whether we can live within our ecological means .

“ Having lost sight of our goals , we redouble our efforts . ” — Mark Twain
In a recent magazine advertisement , Monsanto — one of the world ’s largest agribusinesses and a purveyor of genetic engineering and agro-chemicals — has appointed itself a representative of “ sustainable agriculture . ”
In a certain context , they have a point .
Monsanto argues in its advertising campaign that we ’ll need to double agricultural production by 2050 to feed 9 billion people in a world afflicted by climate change .
The so - called “ green revolution ” of industrial agricultural that began in the late 1950s allowed us to exploit fossil fuel resources to sustain unprecedented rates of population growth .
Therefore , Monsanto suggests , we ’ll need more and better technology to survive our continuing growth .

At best , this strategy might carry us through the next 40 years or so .
But then what ?
“ Sustainable ” is a buzzword these days , attached to everything from roofing tar to dish soap .
It is the best of our buzzwords — it ’s more descriptive than “ eco-friendly , ” more specific than “ green , ” and more succinct than “ environmentally sensitive ” — but overuse is threatening to change the meaning of sustainability .
At the Happy Valley estate , where large painted signs boast of providing organic tea to Harrods , it was unnaturally quiet .
Usually at this time of year – midway through the second flush , or crop – these steep hillsides of densely planted bushes would be filled with women plucking the leaves and dropping them into woven baskets on their backs .
Instead , they sit inside their small , sheet - metal shacks , idling away the damp afternoon .
Across the Darjeeling hills , life has come to a standstill .
An indefinite strike , or " bandh " , called last week by activists demanding a separate state , has closed down schools , roads , businesses , hotels and – crucially – the tea estates .
As a result , the day labourers who earn just 53 rupees ( 66 p ) a day picking tea to be sold to well - heeled customers in London 's Knightsbridge , are currently getting nothing .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yet – remarkably , in view of the hardship they are enduring – these workers support the strike and its goals .
Most of them are ethnic Gorkhas and believe the creation of Gorkhaland will transform their lives .
" Suffering falls on you when you cannot work , " said one tea picker , a 30 - year - old woman , bouncing a baby on her knee .
" But everything will change if we get Gorkhaland .
We will get good jobs , education , everything . "
The demand for a Gorkha state – but one that would remain firmly part of India – is nothing new .
Two decades ago these steeply forested valleys , around which the mist can wrap itself for days , were awash with separatist violence and a counter - insurgency operation that killed at least 1,200 people before a ceasefire was brokered .
Now , having turned their backs on violence , a Gorkha political party formed two years ago , the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha ( GJM ) , says it is using tactics pioneered by Mahatma Gandhi to try and secure its goals .
The GJM 's green , yellow and white flags can be seen flying from homes and buildings across the hills , or else painted onto walls alongside slogans demanding a homeland .
The agitation for a separate state has both an economic and social basis .
Ever since independence , say activists , the Darjeeling region has been overlooked by the West Bengal state government in Kolkata .
There are not enough schools , not enough hospitals and insufficient development .
Darjeeling , once known as the Queen of the Hills , is now a shabbily - dressed commoner , suffering from broken roads and a crumbling infrastructure .
It is a terrible irony that in one of the wettest parts of India there is a severe shortage of water .
Every day people use plastic containers to collect water from tankers and broken pipes .
Beyond the economic factors , there is an issue of identity .
The Gorkhas , who can be found from Nepal across a swathe of northern India , say they suffer intense discrimination from other Indians .
" Whenever we go anywhere like Delhi or Mumbai , people think we 're foreigners .
They think we are from Nepal , " said Anuphang Subha , who owns a business in the town .
" If we have Gorkhaland , people will know we are from India . "
The drive for Gorkhaland is being led by Bimal Gurung , a former " hard man " who formed the GJM after falling out with another Gorkha leader who had led the separatist movement for the previous three decades .
He is known as a passionate speaker , capable of rousing a crowd .
One morning last week , Mr Gurung spoke in front of hundreds gathered in a large hall at the town 's Gymkhana Club .
The Club was built 100 years ago by the British , who established Darjeeling as a summer retreat and tea-producing area in the mid-19th century .
The event was to launch the publication of a booklet , Why Gorkhaland ?
It was also Mr Gurung 's birthday , and before his speech supporters queued to place silk scarves around his neck – a traditional gesture of respect .
Such was the length of the queue that one of Mr Gurung 's aides had to stand behind him removing the scarves to make space for new ones to be placed around his neck .

The GJM leader had previously said he would publicly shoot himself if he failed to achieve a separate state by March 2010 .
On this morning , however , he asked the audience for patience .
That deadline " was my vision .
We are technically working towards achieving Gorkhaland within that period , " he said .
" However , there would be some delay , or maybe it could be achieved earlier also .
Even God can make mistakes .
I am just a human being . "
The crowd cheered and clapped .
One elegant , grey - haired woman in a green sari , named Moni Mukia , approached to explain why Bimal Gurung was their " saviour " .
" A schoolgirl produced a poster spelling out his first name , " said the enthusiastic wife of a retired tea planter .
" B is for brave , I is for intelligent , M is for merciful , A is for aggressive , L is for liberator . "
In an interview , Mr Gurung said the strike was designed to force the politicians in Delhi to take notice .
The federal government had agreed to another round of three - way talks with the GJM and officials from West Bengal next month , but he said he wanted quicker action .
Asked whether the strike – enforced by GJM supporters who have set up roadblocks across the hills while the police remain inside their buildings – was legal , he responded that " It is beside the point whether it is legal or not legal .
We are doing what we need to do . "
Mr Gurung is aware that one of the key levers at his disposal is to put pressure on the region 's 87 tea estates , many owned by wealthy , well - connected individuals based in Kolkata .
The estates support almost half of the region 's 1.6 million residents and the dilemma for the GJM is that by preventing day labourers from working the strikes have a severe impact on some of the poorest members of the community .
" I feel both sympathy and anger , " said Ashok Lohia , who owns several estates including the famed Chamong tea gardens .
" If you want to work in the area , you have to get on with the local guys .
At the same time , you do n't want to lose money " because of the strikes , he said .
Not everyone agrees with the GJM or its tactics .
There are whispers and grumbles about the impact on the local economy , about how tourists have been kept away , and about the need to obtain permits from the GJM to travel out of town for such necessities as a hospital visit .
Few who live in the town choose to voice these views publicly , and some say that those who speak out are threatened .
" The GJM are not thinking of the public .
People are suffering , " said Jeevan Sharma , a photographic shop owner and one of the few in Darjeeling willing to vent his frustration .
" But if you speak against them , their people threaten you .
I think it 's just a game with the government so that they can demand money . "
However , the GJM does have the backing of one national party .
At the general election held earlier this year , rather than putting up its own candidate , the separatists threw their support behind that of the right - wing Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , after it backed their demand for a new state .
Its candidate , Jaswant Singh , a former foreign minister with a polished - crystal accent , won by a landslide .
" All the hill people , from the north - east to Jammu and Kashmir , have their own state .
Why discriminate against the Gorkhas ? " said Mr Singh .
" All they are asking for is a say in their own social and political destiny . "
That view appears to be commonly shared among the people of Darjeeling , whether or not they are actively involved in the struggle for Gorkhaland .
One evening last week , on the veranda outside the Planters ' Club – another relic of the colonial era , where the pelts of leopards shot long ago still hang from the wall – members sat looking out across the valley .
There was no tea to be had , as the strike had shut down the restaurant and bar .
The members recalled how Darjeeling was once famed for its sanatorium , and how the roads were washed so regularly that British " ladies " could walk in their gowns along the town 's famous Mall without fear of dirtying their clothes .
These days , the town 's basic hospital struggles to manage , and many of the roads are filthy .
" Darjeeling has been in decline since the 1960s .
The area has been badly neglected , " said Amargit Dhir , a retired estate manager .
" There is no other option but to revolt .
This is the start of revolution . "

After building my 1,500 gallon goldfish pond I started checking into filters .
My brother bought a nice one from a local company for eight hundred dollars and it works great for his pond but thatâ€™s more money than I care to spend .
Since I was able to build my own pond I thought I might as well make my own filter .
I checked the local newspaper and found several people selling used fifty five gallon barrels .
The one I bought used to hold wine so it had a lid with a steel ring around it that sealed up very tightly when I pulled the handle .
After a good cleaning it looked like a new one and only cost me twenty dollars .
I wouldnâ€™t recommend purchasing the barrels unless you know what they had in them .
You certainly wouldnâ€™t want one that had chemicals or hazardous materials of any type in them .
I would stick with drums that once contained soap , wine , beer or any materials that wouldnâ€™t be harmful to fish in case they still have slight amounts of residue in them .
I found almost all the necessary fittings I would need for the filter at the local hardware store .
I purchased four eight foot lengths of inch and a half pvc pipe , a tube of silicone , a can of pvc glue , four bags of lava rock , a section of egg crate measuring two feet by four feet , several 90 degree elbows and a submersible sump pump .
While I was at the hardware store I picked up a small inch and a half diameter saw you attach to your drill to cut holes in a door for a dead bolt or door lock .
I bought a shut off valve and a check valve at a swimming pool company .
The last item I needed was a plastic milk crate measuring about 12 inches by 12 inches which I got from the milk man at our local grocery store .
Use your drill and the door saw to cut two holes on opposite sides of the barrel about two inches from the bottom .
The holes will be an inch and a half in diameter .
Cut another hole about two inches from the top of the barrel .
Place the sump pump on the floor of the pond and attach enough pvc pipe to bring the line to one of the holes in the bottom of your barrel .
Install your check valve just before it enters the barrel so it will prevent sludge from back flushing into the pond when you clean it or the power goes out in a storm .
Push the pipe into the hole far enough to glue one of the elbows to the end of it .
Aim the elbow down and put silicone around both sides .
The lip on the elbow will keep the pipe from coming out of the hole when you turn the pump on and the silicone will keep it from leaking .
Place the milk crate upside down on the bottom of the barrel .
Take the barrel lid and lay it on top of the egg crate and trace around it with a magic marker .
There should be enough egg crate to trace out two of these circles .
Cut the circles with a jig saw or break them off with needle nose pliers .
Place both of the egg crate circles on top of the milk crate .
Rinse off the lava rock and dump all of it on top of the egg crate .
The rock should be a few inches from the top of the barrel and below the hole you cut earlier .
Youâ€™ll use the top hole to return the clean water back to the pond .
Just push a pipe through the hole like you did on the bottom one and run it back to the pond .
The other hole on the bottom is for the cleaning the filter .
Glue a piece of pipe about three inches long to the shut off valve .
Push the other end through the bottom hole and attach an elbow .
Put silicone around the hole on both sides of the barrel wall .
Most of the nasty stuff sucked up by the pump will be trapped below the lava rock .
Simply shut off the pump and open the shut off valve .
You can let the water drain on the ground or use it to water your vegetable garden like I do .
Total cost of this poor mans filter was two hundred dollars and it keeps my pond nearly as clear as my brothers eight hundred dollar unit .
The one big disadvantage to my filter is its appearance .
Itâ€™s not the most attractive thing to have sitting next to your pond so I put mine in a shed a few feet away and ran the pipes under ground so the entire filter system would be out of view
Probate : Understanding What Probate is - Steps in the Probate Process
What is probate ?
Probate is the legal process of distributing your assets according to your wishes , which includes determining the validity of your will , gathering your assets , paying your debts and taxes and then distributing the remaining assets according to your last will .
To get the process started Your Personal Representative , the Executor , will submit your will to probate court to have it validated .
The main advantage of probate is that the probate court is supervising the entire proceedings , and the probate laws are being followed .
What Steps are involved in the Probate Process ?
Probate process can be a complicated , lengthy and confusing process , but here is the general process ; the probate process involves two steps :
Pays debts you owe , including taxes
Transfers assets to your beneficiaries , as per your will
The probate court oversees the probate process to make sure everything goes according to the probate laws and your will .
Because probate courts are not federal courts , the processes they follow will vary .
Despite their differences , these courts all pretty much follow the same basic processes :
Swearing in your Executor
Notifying heirs , creditors , and the public that you are , indeed , dead
Inventorying your property
Distributing your estate
Cost of Probate
There can be substantial cost involved in probating an estate , so it makes sense to avoid or limit full probate where possible legally [ we will discuss legal means to do this in the next article ] .
Although probate costs will vary from province to province and state to state , they average range is between 0.5 % and 2 % of your estate .
But that is not all , there are more costs associated with distributing your assets , some other costs are executor and attorney fees , executor fees can range up to 4 % .
Then there are always taxes your estate will have to pay before transferring assets .
How Long Does Probate Take ?
The length of probate will depend on the complexity and seize of your estate , the larger and complicated your estate is the longer it will take to settle .
It also will also depend on if you have a valid legal will and whether it will be contested by others or not .
On average probate process can takes between 1 - 2 years if there are no complications , however in some cases it goes on for decades .
To speed up the process and avoid complications it is highly recommended to have an updated and valid will .
If you need more information regarding probate and estate planning , please consult a qualified estate lawyer and / estate planner .
In the next article we will discuss ways to reduce your probate costs and leave more for your beneficiaries ( legally ) .
CouchDb is a really cool document - oriented map / reduce database that is nowadays an Apache project .
Previously we created the distributed CRM application Ajatus on top of the system and ported CouchDb to Maemo .
Here in Gran Canaria Desktop Summit CouchDb has been somewhat a hot topic , as the Ubuntu project is planning to use it as the content repository for desktop applications .
We had a lunch with Jan Lehnardt today and discussed how to make Midgard2 and CouchDb interoperate better , and as it happens , it is actually very easy : CouchDb has a replication protocol that we can support also in Midgard , making the two repositories able to synchronize content with each other .
There is now a first test implementation of Midgard - to - CouchDb synchronization support , with better Midgard integration and Couch Db - to - Midgard coming soon .
Check out the Midgard MVC component on Github .
Anyway , already pretty cool !

Down 2 -10 Sligo 1-09
Down jumped out into a large lead in this Senior Football contest and then had to survive a late charge form a determined Sligo outfit that were battling to the very end .
Down scored in spurts as they had three points to open the game before a Sligo minor from Conor Brady , then a brace from Robbie Moran and Pakie Downey to put them ahead by 0 - 05 to 0-01 0n twenty minutes .
One of the impressive items in the opening segment was Downs ability to stop Sligo reaching their half until the eighth minute .
They were winning all the kick outs from the Sligo end and could have had a more substantial lead but for a series of wides .
After a Trevor Boland score for Sligo in the 22nd minute , Down rattled of the last three points of the half to seemingly have a very comfortable lead .
In the first ten minutes of the second half the Mournemen extended their lead dramatically .
Points from Brendan McGrourty and Robbie Moran surrounded a brace of goals from the latter player .
The first when Pakie Downey finished a superb solo run with a fist pass that set Moran up , the second when Robbie reacted first to the rebound of a Brian Annett shot .
It gave his side a 2 - 9 to 0 - 02 advantage and one would assume it was over .
Not Sligo .
They rebounded with three points from Naill Moran , Trevor Boland and Naill Higgins .
After a delay in the game when Mark Dobbin and Paul Kelly received early baths , Dobbin also had a head wound that would later require 20 stitches , Robbie Moran had Downs tenth point but also their alarmingly , last .
Sligo had a further pair of scores from Conor Brady ; they preceded a Tony Woods goal when he latched onto a long ball from Trevor Boland to find the net .
Now 2 - 10 to 1-07 momentum was driving Sligo .
Paul Doyle and Naill Moran added points to leave four between the sides and with time dwindling down , Paul Doyle was fouled for a penalty .
The result of it mattered little however as the final whistle sounded .
The kick was taken and Mark Kelly added to his amazing rate of penalty saves at The Mecca , he went low to deny Naill Moran .
The points then to Down but certainly far to close for comfort .
Down 1 Mark Kelly 2 Brian Murray 3 Dermot Hayes 4 Gary Cornyn 5 Sean Kelly 6 James Mitchell 7 Mark Connolly 8 Shaun Munnelly ( 0-01 ) 9 Brendan McGrourty ( 0 - 01 ) 10 Liam Farrell 11 Robbie Moran ( 2-03 ) 12 Michael Sloan ( 0 - 02 ) 13 Pakie Downey ( 0-03 ) 14 Mark Dobbin 15 Barry Annett Sub Cormac Doyle Brian Annett , Ross Connolly

Leitrim 3 - 16 Donegal 1-06
The teams had a point a piece to open the game but it was followed by a ten minute period of Leitrim dominance .
They had three points that pushed them into the lead with John Goldrick cantering forward for the first , Mike Creegan who had replaced an injured Donal Hartnett for the second and Scott Conroy had the third .
The battle between Conroy and Aiden Downes was intriguing to this point with Downes ahead .
Shane Carr had an excellent point after 12 minutes for Donegal but it was followed in quick succession by four Leitrim replies .
They also had a goal chance by way of Mark Smith when he soloed in on goal and shook the net strings .
It took a second for all in the stadium to realize that it was outside the post and not inside .
Smith was having a pronounced effect on the game his best by far in the Leitrim shirt .
It was now 0 - 08 to 0 - 02 with seven minutes left in the half .
Donegal could have sat back but they decided not too .
In fact their recovery started after a Leitrim break out that the Donegal forwards made extremely hard .
They battled defensively and the ball was intercepted by Eoin McNeill on the 21 .
He fed the ball out and CJ Molloy converted a free when Gary Dowd was fouled .
After the kick out again Donegal attacked .
Molloy was fouled and his quick kick found Brian O’Connor at full forward , he turned and blasted to the net .
An Anton Toner point before the break gave the intentions that a recovery was on but it was not to be .
It began to rain scores on Donegal in the first minute of the second half on a glorious evening , by the fourteenth minute it was 3 - 12 to 1 - 04 .
A brace of points started it before the first goal arrived .
Jamie Doolin found a roving Scott Conroy coming strong on the 21 .
His finish was top class to the top right corner .
When John O’Neill ran into trouble in the left corner moments later , Madden , Creegan , Doona , Conroy , and Shane Doolin and then Jamie Doolin finished it by casually placing the ball in the net .
Following a Doona point goal number three arrived .
Mark Smith finished the ball too the net after Jamie Doolin was again involved .
Try as Donegal did , and they managed two points in the last ten minutes , it was easily cancelled pout by five Leitrim scores with Dan Doona having the final three .
Leitrim 1 Pa Ryan 2 Dermot Keane 3 Mark Delaney 4 Alan Foley 5 John Goldrick ( 0-01 ) 6 Shane Doolin 7 Eoin O’Neill 8 Pat Madden 9 John O’Neill ( 0 - 01 ) 10 Mark Smith ( 1-01 ) 11 Scott Conroy ( 0 - 02 ) 12 Jamie Doolin ( 2-03 ) 13 Donal Hartnett 14 Dan Doona ( 0-05 ) 15 Danny O’Sullivan Subs Mike Creegan ( 0-03 ) Tony Cullen ,

The future of the project :
It ’s fairly clear now that Mutter will be an alternative window manager in GNOME 2.28 , and the only window manager in GNOME 3 .
It is therefore taking over the reins from Metacity 2 : effectively , Mutter is Metacity 3 .
But what is to happen to Metacity 2 ?
Your chronicler believes that the community is better served by working on Mutter , and will do so .
Metacity 2 will not be actively developed , other than for bug fixes .
It is possible that some people out there would like Metacity 2 to continue , and if so they are welcome to fork the project and take over , and your chronicler will offer them as much support in doing so as possible .
The future of the bug list :
There are five hundred bugs open against Metacity , more than one maintainer can humanly tackle .
Rather than simply closing them all , I propose working through them ten at a time and deciding for each one whether :
alreadyfixed : it is already fixed in Mutter or gnome - shell ( this is true of several enhancement requests ) , and so should be marked WORKSFORME or similar
it is already fixed in Mutter or gnome - shell ( this is true of several enhancement requests ) , and so should be marked WORKSFORME or similar reassign : it is a Metacity bug that can be reproduced in Mutter , and should therefore be reassigned
it is a Metacity bug that can be reproduced in Mutter , and should therefore be reassigned enhancement : it is an enhancement request which Mutter or gnome - shell could take on board ; these should be discussed on the mutter - list and perhaps also in the squib of the day feature on this blog ;
it is an enhancement request which Mutter or gnome - shell could take on board ; these should be discussed on the mutter - list and perhaps also in the squib of the day feature on this blog ; metacity : it is a bug which should be fixed both in Metacity 2 and in Mutter ;
it is a bug which should be fixed both in Metacity 2 and in Mutter ; wontfix : it is an enhancement request which we WONTFIX .
These could be done as we go along , or could be marked with the relevant keywords and then group - edited .
Gentle reader , might you be willing to take on a block or two ?
How can we best organise this ?
Should we use the wiki and assign blocks to people ?
Those of you here at GCDS , would you like to get into a room somewhere and work through the list together ?
The future of this blog : I want this blog to continue .
I would like to expand it beyond its current focus :
to include discussion of Mutter as well , obviously
to include Mutter data in the Metacity Journal posts ( these are largely automated and only edited by a human )
to include news of interesting developments in window management ( such as the current debate over compositor - specific hints in the EWMH )
to have guest bloggers occasionally ( again , any volunteers ? )
One danger is that your chronicler spends more of their time writing blog posts than fixing code .
Suggestions for solving this problem are welcome .
It may involve delegation to someone who is better at blogging than coding .

After I started raising chickens for eggs I realized just how much that I did n’t know about chickens and sex .
Now , I can talk and write about sex with a man all day long , but when it came to my hens I was completely ignorant .
So then when I told other people that I had chickens , they would ask me about sex , eggs , and roosters and so on .
I had to do some research to get answers for others and myself as well .
I hope that this short blog can answer some of your questions .
Mating of chickens , if you have never seen it happen , can best be described as " just like cats . "
The rooster mounts the hen -- who must " stoop " to take his weight .
He holds her by the feathers on her neck just behind the head .
The sex organs are very like other animals , but kept inside except for the very short duration of mating .
Roosters do not have penises .
If you 've seen one chicken butt , you 've seen them all .
The difference is on the inside .
Both male and female chickens have one exterior opening called a cloaca .
When a rooster mounts a hen , he will tuck his tail under her in what is romantically called the " cloacal kiss " passing sperm to fertilize the egg ( before the shell goes on ! )
The sperm travels up the oviduct , where an egg is released every day or so , and one mating can leave enough sperm to fertilize each egg for up to a week .
The egg travels back down , where it receives the egg - white and the various membranes , and then last of all , the shell is deposited shortly before the hen lays her egg .
Each egg takes a little more than 24 hours from the release of mature ova to laying the egg , with most of that time being the last part -- the formation of the " white " , the membranes and shell .
So each hen will lay her egg a little later each day until she skips overnight and resumes laying early in the morning again .
Also , did you know that the egg is soft until it hits the air , and then it will calcify or harden ?
Roosters can mate with females as often as they like , because roosters can control how much sperm they expend during a sexual encounter , allowing them to use more or less depending on social and environmental factors .
Two important factors are the competition — whether other roosters are mating with the same hen — and whether a rooster has already mated with a particular hen .
Roosters distribute their sperm resources strategically according to several factors , including the reproductive value of the female .
Roosters judge a female 's reproductive value by the size of her comb .
Hens with large combs tend to produce large eggs and lots of them .
Fertilizing these eggs is like hitting the jackpot .
A rooster 's social status influences his allocation of sperm .
When a dominant rooster faces competition from other males , he will expend a lot of sperm and progressively increase the number of sperm .
This is like buying more tickets to increase one 's chances of winning the lottery .
If you are going to have a rooster then I would suggest a quantity of one .
Farmers have always known that over time roosters grow less interested in mating repeatedly with same hen .
Hens also grow bored with mating the same male .
By counting semen , the researchers discovered that roosters also reduce the sperm progressively as they continue to mate with the same female .
But when a new female is introduced , the rooster wants to copulate and secretes more sperm to his new mate .
Hens are not large enough to fight off a sexual advance , but they are able to squirt semen back on a rooster after copulating , which lasts about a second .
I did a lot of research from several different sites on the web to get this information .
A good book , if you want pictures and lots more , is A Guide to Better Hatching .
If you are really interested in raising chickens and the mating process , I would recommend that you purchase this book .
LAPD lieutenant Mike Harrigan ( Danny Glover ) and his cocky detective partner Jerry Lambert ( Bill Paxton ) soon realize that what seemed a bloody feud between voodoo high priest King Willie 's ( Calvin Lockhart ) Jamaican gangs and Ramon Vega 's ( Corey Rand ) Colombian drug gang is actually the work of a scary third party .
Peter Keyes 's ( Gary Busey ) federal team shields the crime scene even for the LAPD , but after forensics proves it must be an alien , who keeps making victims , the chase brings them all together .

A woman from Gaza stands at an Israeli check - point .
We can only see her back but it is clear that in shame she opens her top to a female Israeli soldier to show that her breasts have been removed in an attempt to beat cancer .
Despite this , she is refused entry to Israel on security grounds .
This is the climactic scene from the first major Palestinian attempt at an animated movie and it is based on a true story .
But this is not an anti-Israeli rant .
There are good and bad characters on both sides of the Israeli - Palestinian divide .
The heroine of the movie is called Fatenah .
She is a Gazan woman whose dream of finding love and leading a normal life is torn apart by cancer and the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis .
" Usually Palestinians are treated as numbers , but this is not the case here , " said Saed Andoni , the film 's producer .
" Behind each number there is a long story and that is why we focus on this one individual . "
True story
The animation tells of Fatenah 's fight against cancer ; the removal of both her breasts , Palestinian doctors who delayed her diagnosis and Israeli soldiers who delayed her treatment .
It also tells of a rare friendship between the Gazan and an Israeli woman , Dafna .
The animation is threaded together by a love story between Fatenah and a Gazan man .
The depiction of the impoverished coastal strip is condensed into harshly coloured scenes in the 30 - minute animation ; an Israeli checkpoint , crowded buildings and the sea .
Fatenah has large eyes and a small mouth - symbolic of a woman " compelled to a bitter existence but not empowered to speak " , says director Ahmad Habash .
Fatenah 's struggle and friendship with an Israeli woman is based on the real - life story of a Gazan woman named Fatma .
Fatenah shows one woman 's lonely battle to get treatment for breast cancer
Her fight against breast cancer was told by the Israeli group " Physicians for Human Rights " in a 2005 report after the disease killed her .
" The report was so unbelievable , that when you read it you feel like it is fiction .
It is absurd .
You cannot believe that these things happen even though we as Palestinians live in this situation , " says Mr Andoni .
Health care in Gaza is poor - a legacy of poor training , corruption and shabby equipment .
A blockade tightened after militant group Hamas seized power of Gaza in June 2007 has sealed people in , and kept many medical supplies out .
But Israel says it continues to allow in humanitarian goods despite the blockade .
Seriously ill residents must find treatment in Egypt , Israel , or cross from there to the West Bank or Jordan .
But it can take weeks for Palestinian bureaucrats to organise referrals and for Israel to approve entry .
Physicians for Human Rights says 12 residents have died unnecessarily from their illnesses after Israeli officials refused their applications to enter since Hamas took power .
Aggressive cancer
In 2004 , 28 - year - old Fatma felt a lump in her breast - Palestinian doctors said her cure was in having children or switching bras .
Months later they diagnosed aggressive cancer but refused to make a referral for her to be treated in Israel .
Fatma defiantly sent her medical report to an Israeli hospital where doctors said she needed immediate care .
Israeli activists lobbied defence officials to allow her to enter Israel , but she was frequently delayed and turned back by soldiers .
Sometimes , her ambulance was forced to return to Gaza because of fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants .
The report says the climatic scene in ' Fatenah , ' where she is ordered to disrobe before an Israeli woman soldier took place in real - life in September 2004 .
Fatenah struggles with Palestinian and Israeli bureaucracies
In the animation , Fatenah 's back is to the camera , but she ashamedly reveals a bare shoulder , suggesting she is naked under her long Muslim robe .
In reality , Fatma wore a tee - shirt and a stuffed bra because her breasts were removed to try to halt the cancer .
She was lying on the floor because she was too weak to stand , and an Israeli soldier yelled at her to dress .
The report said she was then sent back into Gaza for failing a security check .
Sullied reputation
The film makers are at pains to say the animation is inspired by Fatma 's story , but it is n't about her .
That nuance was lost in deeply conservative Gaza , where Fatma 's family say it has sullied their deceased daughter 's reputation because of Fatenah 's innocent romance - there is n't any kissing or hand - holding - and the brief scene where her animated breast is shown in the movie .
The film took almost two years to make in the West Bank city of Ramallah on a budget of $ 60,000 ( £ 36,400 ) provided by the World Health Organisation .
It will be sent to film festivals around the world and Mr Andoni said he hopes it lays the foundation for what will become a burgeoning Palestinian animation industry .

TranscendからIndilinxコントローラ搭載のSSDが発売されるようなのですが、そのデータシートがアップされており、そこにSMARTの仕様も記述されていました。Vertexシリーズの最新Firmware(v1.3)で追加されたD2,D3エントリの情報はないものの、それ以外の全ての仕様が明らかになっています。
01( 001 ) Raw Read Error Rate 09( 009 ) Power on Hours 0C ( 012 ) Device Power Cycle Count B8 ( 184 ) Initial Bad Block Count C3 ( 195 ) Program Failure Block Count C4 ( 196 ) Erase Failure Block Count C5 ( 197 ) Read Failure Block Count C6 ( 198 ) Total Count of Read Sectors C7 ( 199 ) Total Count of Write Sectors C8( 200 ) Total Count of Read Commands C9 ( 201 ) Total Count of Write Commands CA ( 202 ) Total Count of Error bits from flash CB ( 203 ) Total Count of Read Sectors with Correctable Bit Errors CC ( 204 ) Bad Block Full Flag CD ( 205 ) Maximum PE Count Specification CE ( 206 ) Minimum Erase Count CF ( 207 ) Maximum Erase Count D0 ( 208 ) Average Erase Count
なお、これらの値の数値表現は伝統的なSMARTの仕様には従っていないため、一般的なSMARTモニタリングソフトでは正しい値は表示されません。正しい値の計算方法は以下の通りです。
CrystalDiskInfo 2.7,4やSpeedfanは、生データを16進数で表示しているので、一度10進数に直して計算する必要があります。また、CrystalDiskInfo 3.0 Alpha 3では、Indilinxコントローラ搭載のSSDを自動識別し、データを全て生の値( 16進数)として表示してくれます。
さて、仕様が分かったのは良いことなのですが、これらのSSDはウェアレベリングのアルゴリズムに問題があるのではないかという気がしています。
CrystalDiskinfo 3.0 Alphaの開発版のサポートスレッドには、Indilinxコントローラ搭載SSD( Vertex , S592など ) の情報がいくつか寄せられていますが
、Average Erase Count とMaximum , Minimumとの差が非常に大きい方が何人もいらっしゃいます。すでにMaximum Erase CountがMLCの書き換え寿命と言われる1万回を越えてしまっている方もいるようです。
そこで、手持ち のVertex ( 30GB ) を用いて、ウェアレベリングの実効性を調べるテストをしてみました。
テスト内容は簡単で 、Iometerを用いて非常に小さいファイル(今回は何となく2MB)にシーケンシャルライトを一定時間繰り返すものです。このテストでは、LBAの狭い範囲内のみ書き換えが発生するため、スタティックウェアレベリングが正しく動作しない場合、AverageとMaximumの値が離れてしまうことが予想されます。
結果は以下の通りです。
Average Maximum Minimum 実験前 365 1241 14 10分後 366 1718 14 20分後 368 2941 14
Maximumの値は容赦なく増えていっています。スタティックウェアレベリングが動作しているとは考えられません。AverageとMaximumの差がより大きくなればスタティックウェアレベリングが働き始めるのかも知れませんが、前述の通り、すでにMaximumの値が10.000を越えている方もおり、その実効性には疑問符をつけざるを得ません。
また、比較実験として 、JMF602を採用しているBuffaloのSHD-NSUM30で同様の実験を行ってみました。
Average Maximum 実験前 174 412 10分後 175 431 20分後 177 436
Average とMaximumの差は若干しか開いていません。これなら、スタティックウェアレベリングが正しく動作していると言えるでしょう。JMF602は、AverageとMaximumの差が一定値*1より離れないようにスタティックウェアレベリングを行っているようです。この結果を見る限り、Indilinxコントローラのウェアレベリングアルゴリズムの性能は明らかにJMF602に劣っています。
この現象は、もしかすると寿命の定義が間違っていることを起因にしているかもしれません。
以前の記事に、ID=D1の値が残り寿命をパーセンテージで表した数値だと書きましたが、この値はID=CDの" Maximum PE Count Specification " という値 とAverage Erase Countを用いて以下のように計算しているようです。
D1 = ( 1 -[ Average Erase Count ] / [ Maximum PE Count Specification ] )
x100*2
すなわち 、Maximum PE Count Specification が10,000 の場合 、Average Erase Countが100増えるごと にD1が1減り、100,000の場合はAverage Erase Countが1000増えるごと にD1が1減ります。
そして、なぜか前述のスレッドによせられた報告では、全てのMLC製品のMaximum PE Count Specification の値が100,000 ( Current=160 , Worst=134 , Raw 1Byte目=1)となっており、逆に、SLCを採用しているK5-64では、Maximum PE Count Specificationの値 が10,000 （Current=16 , Worst=39 , Raw 1Byte目=0 ) となっています 。
もし、書き換え耐性が100,000回と言われるSLCを採用した製品であれば、10,000回を越える書き換えはあまり問題になりません。もしかすると、VertexをはじめとするMLCのシリーズでは、SLCを前提としたウェアレベリングアルゴリズムが動作してしまっているのかもしれません。この場合、SSD全体の寿命にほど遠い段階で一部のセルが壊れ始めてしまうことが予想されます。
というわけで 、Vertex , UltraDrive ME , S592など 、 Indilinxコントローラを採用したSSDをお持ちの方は、CF( Maximum Erase Count ) とD0 ( Average Erase Count ) を調べてみてください 。
… と言っても、この問題に関してユーザ側ができることはほとんどありません。正直に言って、本エントリの内容は何かの勘違いであって欲しいです。

NEW YORK / BANGALORE ( Reuters ) – A U.S. judge on Sunday approved General Motors Corp 's bankruptcy sale in a move that will allow the company 's most profitable assets to exit bankruptcy protection under government ownership .
Judge Robert Gerber of the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan said the sale would " prevent the death of the patient on the operating table . "
Gerber issued a four - day stay of the order approving the sale , which should allow it to close as early as Thursday .
Such stays are typical and allow for possible appeals .
Under the deal , ' New GM ' will operate the best parts of the old company , including its Chevrolet and Cadillac brands , with a less expensive workforce , smaller dealer network , and much less debt .
The rest of the company will be liquidated .
The sale marks the second big victory for the Obama administration 's auto task force .
It helped broker the disposal of Chrysler LLC to a group led by Italy 's Fiat SpA last month .
GM , which filed for bankruptcy protection on June 1 , had argued that it would be forced to liquidate if the sale was not approved , and the U.S. government said it could walk away from funding the automaker if a deal was not approved by July 10 .
' BUSINESS DECISION '
" GM can not survive with its continuing losses ... and without the governmental funding that will expire in a matter of days , " Gerber wrote in the 95 - page opinion .
The judge rejected claims from a group of bondholders that GM could have restructured itself under a more traditional Chapter 11 reorganization plan , in which creditors would have been able to vote .
" As nobody can seriously dispute , the only alternative to an immediate sale is liquidation - a disastrous result for GM 's creditors , its employees , the suppliers who depend on GM for their own existence , and the communities in which GM operates , " Gerber wrote .
" In the event of a liquidation , creditors now trying to increase their incremental recoveries would get nothing . "
Gerber also shot down objections to GM 's sale from dealers whose contracts are being terminated , groups of consumer and asbestos claimants that argued they will now be unable to sue GM for their injuries , as well as a group that calls itself the " Unofficial Committee of Family & Dissident GM Bondholders . "
He rejected arguments that the U.S. government , which has loaned GM billions of dollars before and during the bankruptcy , had been overbearing in its negotiations to restructure the automaker .
" The U.S. Treasury , in making hard decisions about where to spend its money and make New GM as viable as possible , made business decisions that it was entitled to make , " Gerber wrote .
The ' old GM ' , which includes unpopular brands and unneeded factories and liabilities , will remain behind in bankruptcy court to be liquidated .
TREASURY FUNDING
The U.S. Treasury has agreed to provide $ 60 billion in financing to the new company , including a proposed $ 50 billion giving it a 60 percent stake in the company .
The UAW would gain a 17.5 percent stake , the Canadian government about 12 percent and GM bondholders about 10 percent of the new company .
At a three - day sale hearing that concluded July 2 , some small bondholders had objected to the deal , but no bidders presented an alternative , and the 100 - year - old automaker warned of " catastrophic " consequences to the auto industry if the sale was blocked .
An auto task force official said earlier this month that the government could conduct an initial public offering for the " New GM " as soon as 2010 .
The case is In re : General Motors Corp , U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York , No. 09-50026 .

Animata is an open source real - time animation software , designed to create animations , interactive background projections for concerts , theatre and dance performances .
The peculiarity of the software is that the animation - the movement of the puppets , the changes of the background - is generated in real - time , making continuous interaction possible .
This ability also permits that physical sensors , cameras or other environmental variables can be attached to the animation of characters , creating a cartoon reacting to its environment .
For example , it is quite simple to create a virtual puppet band reacting to live audio input , or set up a scene of drawn characters controlled by the movement of dancers .
In contrast with the traditional 3D animation programs , creating characters in Animata is quite simple and takes only a few minutes .
On the basis of the still images , which serve as the skeleton of the puppets , we produce a network of triangles , some parts of which we link with the bone structure .
The movement of the bones is based on a physical model , which allows the characters to be easily moved .
When Mary Anderson of Fort Bend County allegedly asked rapper Method Man for an autograph after a show last November at Houston 's House of Blues , she claims she got a different kind of signature : A wound in the stomach from a pellet gun .
Anderson is suing Method Man , more formally known as Clifford Smith , in Harris County District Court for allegedly shooting at her six times with a pellet gun .
According to the lawsuit , Anderson attended a rap concert where Method Man and Redman were performing .
Afterward , Anderson joined a group of fans outside , where Method Man was signing autographs out of the back window of a bus .
When Anderson handed Method Man her ticket stub for him to sign , Method Man suddenly pulled out a pellet gun and began firing , hitting Anderson in the torso , according to the lawsuit .
Anderson 's attorney , Daniel Horowitz , tells Hair Balls that Anderson suffered permanent scarring on her chest , stomach and breast area .
" You ca n't just go around the country shooting people like that , " says Horowitz , " and then leave town and not think anything 's going to happen . "
Anderson claims she had to seek medical treatment for the wounds and is suing for assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress .
Horowitz says Method Man has not yet been served .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
My dad would n't let me have a computer because he did n't think it was relevant .
I was in college before I actually got one .
I think if he knew then what he knows now , I would have had one much earlier .
But I 've always had an interest in how we improve people 's ecosystems -- whether it 's civics or education or economics .
When I was an undergrad at Stanford , I thought the way to do that was to be an academic .
Then I saw that was n't the right way , because you become a scholar and publish in an area where only , like , 50 people will read it .
Find ways to reach people .
How do you change lives for millions of people ?
At Oxford [ as a graduate student in philosophy ]
I decided software entrepreneurship was the way .
I came back to Silicon Valley and worked for Apple and then Fujitsu before starting Socialnet , an early social - networking site .
After a while I did n't agree with the direction it was going , so I talked to Peter [ Thiel , co-founder of PayPal ] , whom I knew from Stanford .
He said , " Come join us .
Help us at PayPal . "
Improve users ' lives .
What I realized before PayPal was sold was that there was going to be a confluence of two forces .
One was how the world of work is changing -- every individual is now somewhat entrepreneurial .
They 're getting the next gig themselves .
The other was the Internet , which could empower all these individuals to establish profiles online so that people can find them .
You'd be able to use your network to get access to people to better chart your path .
I started LinkedIn because changing people 's professional lives is a massive transformation .
In 2003 we got financing from Sequoia Capital , and we started to get more and more people into our service .
Everyone began to realize the value .
That 's when I was , like , " This could work . "
Secrets of my success
 It 's okay to be brief
When people ask me about work / life balance , I just laugh .
But I try to be time - efficient by scheduling meetings in appropriate increments -- 15 minutes or less sometimes .
I 've also tried to build a culture that understands writing brief e-mails is not emotional coldness .
 Be willing to change course
Entrepreneurs tend to believe , " I 've got my idea , I 'll go until I die . "
But I advise them to take seriously the questions about whether their [ business ] plan is irredeemably flawed and whether they need to change what they 're doing .
Be diligent about failing fast so that you do n't spend five years doing something that 's just going to fail .
 Do n't be a perfectionist
I frequently tell Internet entrepreneurs , " If you 're not somewhat embarrassed by your 1.0 product launch , then you 've released too late . "
There 's value in launching early , getting engaged with customers , and learning from them .
That can direct your progress .

Exams for which pupils are expected to believe that the Loch Ness monster disproves evolution have been deemed equivalent to international A - levels by a UK government agency .
The National Recognition Information Centre ( Naric ) in Cheltenham , which advises universities and employers on the rigour of lesser - known qualifications , has ruled that the International Certificate of Christian Education ( ICCE ) is comparable to courses such as international A - levels , the Times Education Supplement has found .
Teenagers studying for the certificate , which is taught in about 50 private Christian schools in the UK , spend half their time learning from evangelical US textbooks .
The curriculum is based on the Accelerated Christian Education ( ACE ) programme , which describes its ideology as " Christian fundamentalist " .
Jonny Scaramanga , who was a pupil at a school in Bath that used the textbooks , has complained to Naric that the books tell pupils that the Loch Ness monster " appears to be a plesiosaur " and helps to disprove evolution .
The textbooks also state that apartheid helped South Africa because segregated schools " made it possible for each group to maintain and pass on their culture and heritage to their children " .
One of the textbooks tells pupils : " Have you heard of the ' Loch Ness Monster ' in Scotland ?
' Nessie , ' for short has been recorded on sonar from a small submarine , described by eyewitnesses , and photographed by others .
Nessie appears to be a plesiosaur .
" Could a fish have developed into a dinosaur ?
As astonishing as it may seem , many evolutionists theorize that fish evolved into amphibians and amphibians into reptiles .
This gradual change from fish to reptiles has no scientific basis .
No transitional fossils have been or ever will be discovered because God created each type of fish , amphibian , and reptile as separate , unique animals .
Any similarities that exist among them are due to the fact that one Master Craftsmen fashioned them all . "
Naric , which is funded by the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , has said the ICCE is equivalent to the advanced certificate of Cambridge International exam board 's international A - levels .
Tim Buttress , Naric 's spokesman , told the TES its remit did not cover the curriculum 's content .
Git for Subversion users , Part 1
Getting started
Git gets demystified for Subversion version control system users
Content series :
This content is part # of # in the series :

This content is part of the series : Git for Subversion users , Part 1 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
For anyone unfamiliar with free and open source version control systems ( VCSs ) , Subversion has become the standard non-commercial VCS , replacing the old champ , Concurrent Versions System ( CVS ) .
CVS is still just fine for limited use , but Subversion 's allure is that it requires only a little bit of setup on a Web server and not much beyond that .
Subversion does have some issues , which I 'll discuss here , but for the most part , it just works .
So , why do we need another one ?
Git ( capital " G " ; git is the command - line tool ) is in many ways designed to be better than Subversion .
It is one of many distributed VCSs .
My own first experience with these was with Arch / tla , as well as Mercurial , Bazaar , darcs , and a few others .
For many reasons , which I 'll discuss as far as they are relevant , Git has become popular and is often considered together with Subversion as the two leading choices for a personal or corporate VCS .
There are two important reasons to be interested in Git if you are a Subversion user .
You are looking to move to Git because Subversion is limiting you in some way .
You are curious about Git and want to find out how it compares to Subversion .
Well , perhaps there 's a third reason :
Git is a relatively hot technology you want to include on your resume .
I hope that 's not your primary goal ; learning about Git is one of the most rewarding things a developer can do .
Even if you do n't use
Git now , the concepts and workflow embodied in this distributed VCS are certain to be crucial knowledge for most segments of the IT industry in the next 10 years as the industry undergoes massive changes in scope and geographical distribution .
Finally , though it might not be a compelling reason if you 're not a Linux kernel developer , the kernel and a number of other important projects are maintained using Git , so you 'll want to be familiar with it if you plan to contribute .
This article is intended for beginning - to - intermediate Subversion users .
It requires beginner - level knowledge of Subversion and some general knowledge of version control systems .
The information here is mainly for users of UNIX® - like ( Linux ® and Mac OS X ) systems , with a little bit thrown in for Windows ® users .
Part 2 of this series will discuss more advanced uses of Git : merging branches , generating diffs , and other common tasks .
Subversion and Git basics
Henceforth , I 'll abbreviate " Subversion " as " SVN " to save wear and tear on my U , B , E , R , S , I , and O keys .
git-svn
You may have heard of git - svn , a tool that lets you use Git against a Subversion repository .
Though useful in some situations , being halfway distributed and using a centralized VCS is not the same as switching to a distributed VCS .
So , what 's SVN good for ?
You might already know this , but a VCS is not about files ; it 's about changes .
SVN , running on a central server , adds changes to its repository of data and can give you a snapshot after every change .
That snapshot has a revision number ; the revision number is very important to SVN and the people who use it .
If your change goes in after mine , you 're guaranteed to have a higher revision number .
Git has a similar goal — tracking changes — but has no centralized server .
This difference is crucial .
Where SVN is centralized , Git is distributed ; therefore , Git has no way to provide an increasing revision number , because there is no " latest revision . "
It still has unique revision IDs ; they are just not as useful on their own as the SVN revision numbers .
With Git , the crucial action is no longer the commit ; it is the merge .
Anyone can clone a repository and commit to the clone .
The owner of the repository is given the choice of merging changes back .
Alternatively , developers can push changes back to the repository .
I 'll explore only the latter , authorized - push model .
Keeping a directory under SVN
Let 's start with a simple common example : tracking a directory 's contents with SVN .
You 'll need a SVN server and , obviously , a directory of files , as well as an account on that server with commit rights for at least one path .
Get started by adding and committing the directory :
Listing 1 . Setting up a directory under SVN
% svn co http://svnserver/... some path here .../ top % cd top % cp -r ~/ my_directory . % svn add my_directory % svn commit -m ' added directory '
What does this let you do ?
Now you can get the latest version of any file committed under this directory , delete files , rename them , create new files or directories , commit changes to existing files , and more :
Listing 2 . Basic file operations under SVN
# get latest % svn up # what 's the status ? % svn st # delete files % svn delete # rename files ( really a delete + add that keeps history ) % svn rename # make directory % svn mkdir # add file % svn add # commit changes ( everything above , plus any content changes ) % svn commit
I wo n't examine these commands in detail here , but do keep them in mind .
For help on any of these commands , just type svn help COMMAND , and Subversion will show you some basic help ; go to the manual for more .
Keeping a directory under Git
I 'll follow the same path as I did with the SVN example .
As before , I 'm assuming you already have a directory full of data .
For the remote server , I 'll use the free github.com service , but , of course , you can set up your own server if you like .
GitHub is an easy way to play with a remote Git repository .
As of this writing , for a free account you 're limited to 300 MB of data and your repository must be public .
I signed up as user " tzz " and created a public repository called " datatest " ; feel free to use it .
I gave my public SSH key ; you should generate one if you do n't have one already .
You may also want to try the Gitorious server or repo.or.cz .
You 'll find a long list of Git hosting services on the git.or .
cz Wiki ( see Related topics for a link ) .
One nice thing about GitHub is that it 's friendly .
It tells you exactly what commands are needed to set up Git and initialize the repository .
I 'll walk through those with you .
First , you need to install Git , which is different on every platform , and then initialize it .
The Git download page ( see Related topics ) lists a number of options depending on platform .
( On Mac OS X , I used the port install git - core command , but you need to set up MacPorts first .
There 's also a standalone MacOS X Git installer linked from the Git download page ; that will probably work better for most people . )
Once you have it installed , here are the commands I used for a basic setup ( pick your own user name and e-mail address , naturally ) :
Listing 3 . Basic Git setup
% git config -- global user.name " Ted Zlatanov " % git config -- global user.email " tzz@bu.edu "
Already you might see a difference from SVN ; there , your user identity was server - side and you were whomever the server said you were .
In Git , you can be The Wonderful Monkey Of Wittgenstein if you want ( I resisted the temptation ) .
Next , I set up the data files and initialize my repository with them .
( GitHub will also import from a public SVN repository , which can be helpful . )
Listing 4 . Directory setup and first commit
# grab some files % cp -rp ~/.gdbinit gdbinit % mkdir fortunes % cp -rp ~/.fortunes.db fortunes /data.txt # initialize % git init # " Initialized empty Git repository in / Users/tzz/datatest/.git / " # add the file and the directory % git add gdbinit fortunes % git commit - m ' initializing ' # [ master ( root - commit ) b238ddc ] initializing # 2 files changed , 2371 insertions (+ ) , 0 deletions (-) # create mode 100644 fortunes / data . txt # create mode 100644 gdbinit
In the output above , Git is telling us about file modes ; 100644 refers to the octal version of the permission bits on those files .
You do n't need to worry about that , but the 2371 insertions is puzzling .
It only changed two files , right ?
That number actually refers to the number of lines inserted .
We did n't delete any , of course .
How about pushing our new changes to the GitHub server ?
The docs tell us how to add a remote server called " origin " ( you can use any name ) .
I should mention here that if you want to learn more about any Git command , for example , git remote , you 'd type git remote -- help or git help remote .
This is typical for command - line tools , and SVN does something very similar .
Listing 5 . Push the changes to the remote
# remember the remote repository is called " datatest " ? % git remote add origin git@github.com :tzz/datatest.git # push the changes % git push origin master # Warning : Permanently added ' github.com,65.74.177.129 ' ( RSA ) to the list of known hosts .
# Counting objects : 5 , done .
# Delta compression using 2 threads .
# Compressing objects : 100 % ( 4/4 ) , done .
# Writing objects : 100 % ( 5/5 ) , 29.88 KiB , done .
# Total 5 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) # To git@github.com :tzz/datatest.git # * [ new branch ] master -> master
The warning is from OpenSSH because github.com was not a known host before .
Nothing to worry about .
Git messages are , shall we say , thorough .
Unlike SVN 's messages , which are easy to understand , Git is written for mentats , by mentats .
If you 're from Frank Herbert 's Dune universe and are trained as a human computer , you 've probably already written your own version of Git , just because you can .
For the rest of us , delta compression and the number of threads used by it are just not very relevant ( and they make our heads hurt ) .
The push was done over SSH , but you can use other protocols , such as HTTP , HTTPS , rsync , and file .
See git push -- help .
Here is the crucial , most important , basic difference between SVN and Git. SVN 's commit says " push this to the central server . "
Until you commit in SVN , your changes are ethereal .
With Git , your commit is local , and you have a local repository no matter what happens on the remote side .
You can back out a change , branch , commit to the branch , and so on without any interaction with the remote server .
Pushing with Git is effectively a synchronization of your repository 's state with the remote server .
All right , so finally let 's see the Git log of what just happened :
Listing 6 . The Git log
% git log # commit b238ddca99ee582e1a184658405e2a825f0815da # Author : Ted Zlatanov < tzz@lifelogs.com >
# Date : ... commit date here ... # # initializing
Only the commit is in the log ( note the long , random - looking commit ID as opposed to the SVN revision number ) .
There is no mention of the synchronization via git push .
Collaborating through Git
So far we 've been using Git as a SVN replacement .
Of course , to make it interesting , we have to get multiple users and changesets involved .
I 'll check out the repository to another machine ( running Ubuntu GNU / Linux in this case ; you 'll need to install git - core and not git ) :
Listing 7 . Setting up another Git identity and checking out the repository
% git config -- global user.name " The Other Ted " % git config -- global user.email " tzz@bu.edu " % git clone git@github.com :tzz/datatest.git # Initialized empty Git repository in /home/tzz/datatest/.git/ # Warning : Permanently added ' github.com,65.74.177.129 ' ( RSA ) to the list of known hosts .
#remote : Counting objects : 5 , done .
#remote : Compressing objects : 100 % ( 4/4 ) , done .
# Indexing 5 objects ... #remote : Total 5 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) # 100 % ( 5/5 ) done % ls datatest # fortunes gdbinit % ls - a datatest /. git # . .. branches config description HEAD hooks index info logs objects refs % ls - a datatest /.git/hooks # . .. applypatch - msg commit-msg post - commit post - receive post - update # pre-applypatch pre-commit pre-rebase update
Again , notice the OpenSSH warning indicating we have not done business with GitHub over SSH before from this machine .
The git clone command is like a SVN checkout , but instead of getting a synthesized version of the contents ( a snapshot as of a particular revision , or the latest revision ) , you are getting the whole repository .
I included the contents of the datatest /.git directory and the hooks subdirectory under it to show that you really do get everything .
Git keeps no secrets by default , unlike SVN , which keeps the repository private by default and only allows access to snapshots .
Incidentally , if you want to enforce some rules on your Git repository , whether on every commit or at other times , the hooks are the place .
They are shell scripts , much like the SVN hooks , and have the same " return zero for success , anything else for failure " standard UNIX convention .
I wo n't go into more detail on hooks here , but if your ambition is to use Git in a team , you should definitely read up on them .
All right , so " The Other Ted " is frisky and wants to add a new file in the master branch ( roughly equivalent to SVN's TRUNK ) and also make a new branch with some changes to the gdbinit file .
Listing 8 .
Adding a file and making a new branch
# get a file to add ... % cp ~/bin/encode.pl . % git add encode.pl % git commit - m ' adding encode.pl '
# Created commit 6750342 : adding encode.pl # 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 0 deletions (-) # create mode 100644 encode.pl % git log # commit 675034202629e5497ed10b319a9ba42fc72b33e9 # Author : The Other Ted < tzz@bu.edu > # Date : ... commit date here ... # # adding encode.pl # #commit b238ddca99ee582e1a184658405e2a825f0815da # Author : Ted Zlatanov < tzz@lifelogs.com >
# Date : ... commit date here ... # # initializing % git branch empty - gdbinit % git branch # empty - gdbinit #* master % git checkout empty - gdbinit # Switched to branch " empty - gdbinit " % git branch #* empty - gdbinit # master % git add gdbinit % git commit -m ' empty gdbinit '
# Created commit 5512d0a : empty gdbinit # 1 files changed , 0 insertions (+ ) , 1005 deletions (-) % git push #updating ' refs/heads/ master ' # from b238ddca99ee582e1a184658405e2a825f0815da # to 675034202629e5497ed10b319a9ba42fc72b33e9 # Generating pack ...
# Done counting 4 objects .
# Result has 3 objects .
# Deltifying 3 objects ... # 100 % ( 3/3 ) done # Writing 3 objects ... # 100 % ( 3/3 ) done # Total 3 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 )
That was a long example and I hope you did n't fall asleep ; if you did , I hope you dreamt of Git repositories synchronizing in an endless waltz of changesets .
( Oh , you 'll have those dreams , do n't worry . )
First , I added a file ( encode.pl , only one line ) and committed it .
After the commit , the remote repository at GitHub did not have any idea I had made changes .
I then made a new branch called empty - gdbinit and switched to it ( I could have done this with git checkout - b empty - gdbinit as well ) .
In that branch , I emptied the gdbinit file and committed that change .
Finally , I pushed to the remote server .
If I switch to the master branch , I wo n't see the empty gdbinit in the logs .
So , each branch has its own log , which makes sense .
Listing 9 .
Looking at logs between branches
# we are still in the empty - gdbinit branch % git log # commit 5512d0a4327416c499dcb5f72c3f4f6a257d209f # Author : The Other Ted < tzz@bu.edu > # Date : ... commit date here ... # # empty gdbinit # # commit 675034202629e5497ed10b319a9ba42fc72b33e9 # Author : The Other Ted < tzz@bu.edu > # Date : ... commit date here ... # # adding encode.pl # #commit b238ddca99ee582e1a184658405e2a825f0815da # Author : Ted Zlatanov < tzz@lifelogs.com >

When I did the push , Git said , " Hey , look at that , a new file called encode.pl " on GitHub 's servers .
GitHub 's
Web interface will now display encode.pl .
But there 's still only one branch on GitHub .
Why was the empty - gdbinit branch not synchronized ?
It 's because Git does n't assume you want to push branches and their changes by default .
For that , you need to push everything :
Listing 10 .
Pushing all
% git push - a #updating ' refs/heads/empty-gdbinit ' # from 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # to 5512d0a4327416c499dcb5f72c3f4f6a257d209f #updating 'refs/remotes/origin/HEAD '
# from 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # to b238ddca99ee582e1a184658405e2a825f0815da #updating ' refs/remotes/origin/master ' # from 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 # to b238ddca99ee582e1a184658405e2a825f0815 da # Generating pack ...

# Deltifying 3 objects ... # 100 % ( 3/3 ) done # Writing 3 objects ... # 100 % ( 3/3 ) done # Total 3 ( delta 1 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 )
Again , the mentat interface is here in full glory .
But we can figure things out , right ?
We may not be mentats , but at least we have the common sense to figure that 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is some kind of special initial tag .
We can also see from the logs in Listing 9 that tag 5512d0a4327416c499dcb5f72c3f4f6a257d209f is the last ( and only ) commit in the empty - gdbinit branch .
The rest might as well be in Aramaic for most users ; they just wo n't care .
GitHub will now show the new branch and the changes in it .
You can use git mv and git rm to manage files , renaming and removing them , respectively .
Conclusion
In this article , I explained basic Git concepts and used Git to keep a simple directory 's contents under version control , comparing Git with Subversion along the way .
I explained branching using a simple example .
In Part 2 , I will explore merging , generating diffs , and some of the other Git commands .
I strongly encourage you to read the very understandable Git manual or at least go through the tutorial .
It 's all accessible from the Git home page , so please spend some time exploring it .
( See the Related topics below for links . )
From the perspective of a SVN user , you do n't need much more .
On the other hand , Git is a very rich DVCS ; learning more about its features will almost certainly lead to using them to simplify and improve your VCS workflow .
Plus , you may even have a dream or two about Git repositories .

An enormous blind spot obscures the argument between George Monbiot and Paul Kingsnorth ( Is there any point in fighting to stave off industrial apocalypse ?
19 August ) .
Both argue for the need for a huge social change to tackle or survive climate change .
Monbiot talks of the need to fight for a sustainable future , while Kingsnorth decries our " all - consuming culture " and calls for new " founding myths " to create a new world from the ashes of the old .
The question arises : how do we achieve change ?
Who do we fight ?
But neither writer talks about the elite few who are willing to destroy the earth to preserve capitalism .
Kings–north calls for a " saner world " while Monbiot sees salvation in being " well informed " – but sanity and information are not enough .
As with any movement for social change , environmentalism must identify and face up to its enemy : the people destroying the earth in a relentless drive for profit .
The ongoing protests at the Vestas wind turbine factories demonstrate one thing – the fight for sustainability can , and must , be a fight pursued by workers and ordinary people against those who seek profit over sustainability .
In short , the struggle must be a class struggle .
Kingsnorth points out that " our " civilisation is based on the exploitation of natural resources .
However , " our " civilisation is also based on the exploitation of people , and unless we fight both of these as one battle , a grim future surely beckons .

• Paul Kingsnorth and George Monbiot miss the point .
If we are to make progress towards as good a world as possible , we need to learn how to do it .
This , in turn , requires that our institutions of learning are rationally devoted to that task .
But at present they are not .
Universities seek knowledge , but do not devote themselves to helping humanity learn how to create a better world .
Judged from this standpoint , they are a disaster .
As a matter of urgency , we need to bring about a revolution in our institutions of learning so that they come to help humanity tackle the immense global problems that lie before us in more intelligent , effective and humane ways than we are doing at present .

• Sometimes it 's hard to navigate around the issues of climate change because of the noise and the shouting .
But Paul Kingsnorth articulates the human dilemma with pinpoint accuracy .
In doing so he forces us to retreat from the state of denial that George Monbiot frequently chastises us for , and makes us face the reality of a " crumbling empire " that 's had its day .
We 've been here before .
Conventional democratic politics and economic structures have failed us at times of crisis .
They simply do n't work .
Attempts , so far , to tackle climate change have been too little , too late , and negotiations too protracted .
Action to deal with population growth and consumption , which is the underlying cause of all our environmental problems , has been non-existent because we 've barely begun the discussion .
Craven politicians continue to regard people as economic units contributing to gross domestic product , and because large numbers give them the power that fuels their ambitions , the challenge is not the rush to wind , wave or nuclear but to consider how we can manage the transition from a failing civilsation to a new geological era .

• Ditlev Engel , CEO of Vestas , recently blamed UK homeowners and the plight of Nimbyism for the recent closure of the wind turbine factory on the Isle of Wight ( Vestas expands wind turbine manufacturing in China and US as British demand collapses , 19 August ) .
The blame does , to an extent , rest with nimbys – the people who want all the benefits of the modern world with none of the perceived inconveniences .
However , the government is ultimately to blame for this mess .
It has been warned these last 10 years that the planning system for wind energy is not fit for purpose .
The current planning systems are the biggest threat to the government 's 2020 targets , our hopes of abating climate change and our hopes of creating new green jobs ( another government mantra ) .
The House of Lords made this known to the government last year when it took evidence from Ecotricity on current planning systems and included it in its report to ministers .
Wind energy is the only energy source that has its planning consent " granted " by district councils .
This is an absurd anomaly – especially given that on - shore wind energy will have to contribute the lion 's share of the government 's renewable energy targets .
Meanwhile , nuclear energy recently had its own planning process simplified .
It 's hard to square all this .
The outcome of the UK having no wind turbine factories is inevitable – if we do n't use wind turbines here we wo n't make them here .

• Paul Kingsnorth and George Monbiot are right in saying that humanity is heading towards a crisis , but they should remember that a crisis is the point where things can go either way – to disaster or success .
The future is always uncertain and humanity is hugely resourceful – the world may well be a better place a century from now .
I 'm not counselling complacency : Monbiot is surely right that we should fear the worst and be doing all we can to avert it .
All I am saying is that having done that we should remember that the world has always been a pretty desperate place and cheer ourselves up with the thought that the most unexpected things have a habit of turning up .

Dear Em
I started this letter and found that this fountain pen was very dry .
On looking to see if I could fill it , found that all the black ink was either all gone or packed .
It looks like real business now , for they are loading the trains now , but we ( the men ) wo n’t get started until tomorrow some time .
The boys can hardly beleive it .
They all slept , out in the cold last night but did n’t mind it a bit .
They will do any thing to get home , and nothing if this is a farce .
The poor Ninth havent got any orders as yet but probably will soon .
Another Georgia Reg. pulled in this morning and they all seem to be a fine sort .
Every night latly we can look across the river and see a lot of camp fires burning , around which the Mexican army is gathered .
I havent received any mail from any body latly and it is just as well for I know you folks up there dont know what minute now we will be saying good by to Texas .
I suppose we will freeze by the time we get off the train some where in Mass .
but we all have woolen under wear , new olive drab uniforms , sweeters , ( those that havent got so hard up that they sold them ) and over coats .
But even at that I suppose we will be an awful bunch of cold blooded men .
It looks as though it is going to be a race for us to get home in time to vote , which is no little discution here among the men .
Kinsman came home from the hospital yesterday , but I dont believe he would have been releaced if we wasnt going right home .
He alway was thin you know , well you can hardly see him now .
It is too bad but as you said once before in your letter , he was always a wise , tough kid .
This will probably be the last letter I will be able to write , but then , Ive been saying that for some time .
The Georgia fellows seem to take things very seriously but they will get over that very soon .
Three of them were stopped last night from killing a Mexican .
They are some wild when they get started .
The Regulars will take that out of them if they start any funny business with them .
Well that Sunday when you Lena , Bert and Tom was at Framingham I felt good and strong the same was the case when Pa came to see me off .
Now
Im coming back to you folks the same guy the only change being four months away ,
Sam
P.S. There is no doubt but what we will be on our way now while Pa is listening to you speel off this line of guff .
If not , why we are still waiting to go that ’s all .
Another slice of bread .

A South African bank has outfitted its ATMs with pepper spray to prevent criminals from bombing or tampering with the machines .
But the system still has some bugs :
One of the machines released its stinging payload on three maintenance workers last week .
Absa Bank , one of South Africa 's largest , installed the spray on 11 machines after someone bombed several of its ATMs last year , according to local news outlet Independent Online .
They were installed in a region where authorities say they retrieved 40 skimmers from card machines last year .
If a camera on the machine detects someone tampering with the card slot in an attempt to install a skimming device or explosives , a mechanism installed at the ATM kiosk releases a cloudspray .
The hope is that the spray will disorient the culprit long enough to allow authorities to arrive at the scene .
But during routine maintenance on one of the machines , three workers were maced instead and had to be treated .
The spray was installed on machines in the Western Cape , a popular tourist area .

A project building an open - source version of Microsoft 's .NET development framework is trying to attract iPhone developers building business applications .
The Mono Project is recruiting " adventurous " iPhone developers interested in trying Mono for the iPhone and its now feature - completed MonoTouch APIs .
MonoTouch consists of a C# API for building Cocoa applications , and is currently in beta .
The outreach comes as Microsoft itself began touting use of Visual Studio and content in its MSDN community to help iPhone developers port their applications to its planned Windows Mobile 6.5 .
Microsoft 's keen to stress the port is easier than you 'd might have expected .
MonoTouch also seems to provide a cross over for Apple programmers versed in the iPhone 's OS X and Cocoa framework but less familiar with .NET - the basis for Windows development .
Building applications for the iPhone is not a straightforward task , both from a technical and legal perspective .
Assuming your app clears an Apple approval process that could teach the Masons a thing or two about secrecy , the iPhone does n't allow JIT engines at the kernel level and developers are not allowed to use scripting engines or JIT technologies .
MonoTouch claims to have sidestepped the JIT and scripting issues by offering a static compiler that turns .
NET executables and libraries into native applications .
MonoTouch applications do n't ship with a JIT or interpreter and the framework uses only native code .
On the down side , there 's limited support for Microsoft 's LINQ that lets you build queries to data directly from C#.NET and Visual Basic .
NET .
Also , you can't generate dynamic code .
LINQ , at least , is planned for MonoTouch 2.0 along with a compiler for Microsoft 's Silverlight media player , support for more of Apple 's APIs and re-use of existing Objective - C apps .
Mono 's already seen uptake on the iPhone , with around 40 games available on Apple 's App Store .
These , though , have been built using Unity3D which is more of a gaming tool and works with OpenGL .
Miguel de Icaza , leader of the Mono Project , told The Reg : " MonoTouch has very little in the way of gaming , and instead is a pretty much direct mapping to Apple 's native APIs .
Unity does not really expose much of Apple 's specific features or GUI APIs . " ®

Remember Barack Obama during the campaign — full of hope , change , and promises to make a clean break from the disastrous policies of George Bush ?
6 months into his Presidency , not only has he failed to live up to the most basic of his promises , but he has embraced many of Bush ’s most asinine and destructive positions .
Days before his inauguration , Obama made it clear he would close Guantanamo Bay , begin the process of moving current detainees through US or international legal systems , and stop torture from being committed by Americans .
In fact , he blankly stated [ via MSNBC ] :
“ I was clear throughout this campaign and was clear throughout this transition that under my administration the United States does not torture , ” Obama said …
“ We will abide by the Geneva Conventions .
We will uphold our highest ideals . ”
And now ?
[ via Wall Street Journal ]
The Obama administration said Tuesday it could continue to imprison non-U.S. citizens indefinitely even if they have been acquitted of terrorism charges by a U.S. military commission …
Like the Bush administration , the Obama administration argues that the legal basis for indefinite detention of aliens it considers dangerous is separate from war - crimes prosecutions .
Officials say that the laws of war allow indefinite detention to prevent aliens from committing warlike acts in future , while prosecution by military commission aims to punish them for war crimes committed in the past .
Yes , you read that right folks !
Barack Obama ’s administration is using the same legal justification as George Bush ’s to detain ‘ suspected war criminals ’ , even if they are found innocent by a military tribunal or American court .
Oh , and remember how he was opposed to Bush ’s consolidation of powers in the executive branch and the NSA wiretapping program :
This is in late 2007 , but Obama ’s message is clear : Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program is illegal , against the principle and spirit of the Constitution , and completely unjustifiable , even with ‘ terrorist threats ’ .
Welp , 6 months into his administration , guess what !
Obama now wants to protect the warrantless wiretap program [ via the Electronic Frontier Foundation ] :
The Obama administration formally adopted the Bush administration ’s position that the courts cannot judge the legality of the National Security Agency ’s ( NSA ’s ) warrantless wiretapping program , filing a motion to dismiss Jewel v. NSA late Friday .
The Obama Justice Department claims in its motion that litigation over the wiretapping program would require the government to disclose privileged “ state secrets . ”
These are essentially the same arguments made by the Bush administration three years ago in Hepting v. AT&T , EFF ’s lawsuit against one of the telecom giants complicit in the NSA spying .
Oh , and not to mention that he is now encouraging failed banks and companies receiving government bailouts to hand out large bonuses to their executives , staffed his entire Treasury Department with Goldman Sachs alumni , has refused to prosecute Americans who committed torture , and held private meetings with coal executives and continued to push for mythical ‘ clean coal ’ .

In early 2008 , the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine ( OISM ) published their Petition Project , a list of names from people who all claimed to be scientists and who rejected the science behind the theory of anthropogenic ( human - caused ) global warming ( AGW ) .
This was an attempt to by the OISM to claim that there were far more scientists opposing AGW theory than there are supporting it .
This so - called petition took on special importance coming after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s Fourth Assessment Report , and specifically the Working Group 1 ( WG1 ) report on the science and attribution of climate change to human civilization .
The WG1 report was authored and reviewed by approximately 2000 scientists with varying expertise in climate and related fields , and so having a list of over 30,000 scientists that rejected the WG1 ’s conclusions was a powerful meme that AGW skeptics and deniers could use to cast doubt on the IPCC ’s conclusions and , indirectly , on the entire theory of climate disruption .
And in fact , this meme has become widespread in both legacy and new media today .
It is also false .
According to the Petition Project “ qualifications ” page , “ Signatories are approved for inclusion in the Petition Project list if they have obtained formal educational degrees at the level of Bachelor of Science or higher in appropriate scientific fields . ”
The fields that are considered “ appropriate ” by the OISM are as follows :
Atmosphere , Earth , and Environment fields : atmospheric science , climatology , meteorology , astronomy , astrophysics , earth science , geochemistry , geology , geophysics , geoscience , hydrology , environmental engineering , environmental science , forestry , oceanography
atmospheric science , climatology , meteorology , astronomy , astrophysics , earth science , geochemistry , geology , geophysics , geoscience , hydrology , environmental engineering , environmental science , forestry , oceanography Computers and Math : computer science , mathematics , statistics
computer science , mathematics , statistics Physics and Aerospace : physics , nuclear engineering , mechanical engineering , aerospace engineering
physics , nuclear engineering , mechanical engineering , aerospace engineering Chemistry : chemistry , chemical engineering
chemistry , chemical engineering Biochemistry , Biology , and Agriculture : biochemistry , biophysics , biology , ecology , entomology , zoology , animal science , agricultural science , agricultural engineering , plant science , food science
biochemistry , biophysics , biology , ecology , entomology , zoology , animal science , agricultural science , agricultural engineering , plant science , food science Medicine : medical science , medicine
medical science , medicine General Engineering and General Science : engineering , electrical engineering , metallurgy , general science
The OISM ’s qualifications for being a “ scientist ” are expansive , and as such there are a number of questions that have to be answered before we can take this list seriously .
What expertise does a nuclear engineer or a medical doctor or a food scientist or mechanical engineer have that makes them qualified to have an informed opinion on the cause (s ) of recent climate disruption ?
How many of these names are working climate scientists instead of science or math teachers or stay - at - home - mom ’s with engineering degrees ?
How many of these people has actually published a peer - reviewed paper on climate ?
How many people took a look at the card that served as a “ signature ” ( click on the image to see a larger version ) and realized that they could lie about having a science degree and their deception would never be discovered ?
At this point it ’s literally impossible to know because the names and degrees on the list cannot be verified by anyone outside the OISM .
We can only take the OISM ’s word that they ’re all real names , that all the degrees are correct , and so on .
This does not stand up to the most basic tests of scientific credibility .
Unfortunately , the OISM ’s list has had its credibility fabricated for it by individuals and groups as diverse as Steve Milloy of Fox News ( see this link for a S&R investigation into the background and tactics of Steve Milloy ) , L. Brent Bozell of conservative “ news ” site Newsbusters and founder of the conservative Media Research Center , Benita M. Dodd of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation , the libertarian / conservative site American Thinker ( a site that has regularly failed to fact - check their AGW posts ) , conservative commentator Deroy Murdock ( who works on Project 21 with the wife of one of Steve Milloy ’s long - time associates ) , RightSideNews , Dakota Voice , Dennis T. Avery of the Hudson Institute , Lawrence Solomon of the Financial Post , Michelle Malkin , and the Competitive Enterprise Institute , to name just a few of the better known .
As a result , the OISM ’s petition has been elevated to a level of credibility that is arguably undeserved .
While it ’s not possible to test the validity of OISM list directly , it is possible to test the conclusions that have been drawn from the OISM list .
Specifically , we can test what percentage the 30,000 “ scientists ” listed on the OISM petition represent when compared to the total number of scientists in the U.S .
And we can then compare that to the percentage represented by the 2000 IPCC AR4 WG1 - associated scientists as compared to the estimate number of U.S. climate - related scientists .
According to the OISM website , anyone with a Bachelor ’s , Master ’s , or Doctorate of Philosophy in a field related to physical sciences is qualified as a scientist .
In addition , the OISM sent the petition cards pictured above only to individuals within the U.S. Based on this information , we can us the OISM ’s own guidelines to determine how many scientists there are in the U.S. and what percentage of those scientists are represented by the OISM petition .
The U.S. Department of Education tracks the number of graduates from institutions of higher education every year , and has done so since either the 1950 - 51 or 1970 - 71 school years , depending on what specifically the Dept. of Ed. was interested in .
This data was last updated in the Digest of Education Statistics : 2008 .
We ’re specifically interested in the number of degrees that have been awarded in the various scientific disciplines as defined by the OISM in the list above .
This information is available in the following tables within the 2008 Digest : 296 , 298 , 302 , 304 , 310 , 311 , and 312 .
Table 1 below show how many graduates there were in the various categories defined by the Dept. of Ed. since the 1970 - 71 school year ( click on the image for a larger version ) .
The numbers have been corrected to account for the fact that PhD ’s will usually have MS degrees as well , and that both are preceded by BS degrees .
As you can see , Table 1 shows that there were over 10.6 million science graduates as defined by the OISM since the 1970 - 71 school year .
This is a conservative estimate as illustrated by teh 242,000 graduates in biological and biomedical sciences from 1950 - 51 through 1969 - 70 alone , never mind the 166,000 engineering graduates , and so on .
Many of these individuals are still alive today and would be considered scientists according to the OISM definition thereof .
The OISM website lists how many signatures they have for scientists in each of their categories .
Given the number of graduates and the number of signatures claimed by the OISM , we can calculate the percentage of OISM - defined scientists who signed as referenced to the total .
These results are shown in Table 2 below .
In other words , the OISM signatories represent a small fraction ( ~0.3 % ) of all science graduates , even when we use the OISM ’s own definition of a scientist .
However , as mentioned above , it ’s entirely reasonable to ask whether a veterinarian or forestry manager or electrical engineer should qualify as a scientist .
If we remove all the engineers , medical professionals , computer scientists , and mathematicians , then the 31,478 “ scientists ” turn into 13,245 actual scientists , as opposed to scientists according to the OISM ’s expansive definition .
Of course , not all of them are working in science , but since some medical professionals and statisticians do work in science , it ’s still a reasonable quick estimate .
However , it ’s not reasonable to expect that all of those actual scientists are working in climate sciences .
Certainly the 39 climatologists , but after that , it gets much murkier .
Most geologists do n’t work as climate scientists , although some certainly do .
Most meteorologists do weather forecasting , but understanding the weather is radically different than understanding climate .
So we ca n’t be sure beyond the 39 climatologists , although we can reasonably assume that the number is far less than the 13,245 actual scientists claimed by the OISM .
13,245 scientists is only 0.1 % of the scientists graduated in the U.S. since the 1970 - 71 school year .
We can , however , compare the number of atmospheric scientists , climagologists , ocean scientists , and meteorologists who signed this petition to the number of members of the various professional organizations .
For example , the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) has over 55,000 members , of which over 7,200 claim that atmospheric sciences is their primary field .
The OISM claims 152 atmospheric scientists .
Compared to the atmospheric scientist membership in the AGU , the OISM signatories are only 2.1 % , and this estimate is high given the fact that the AGU does not claim all atmospheric scientists as members .
The AGU hydrology group has over 6,000 members who call hydrology their primary field .
The OISM list has 22 names that claim to be hydrologists , or 0.4 % .
The AGU ocean sciences group claims approximately 6,800 members .
The OISM has 83 names , or 1.2 % .
And again , given that AGU membership is not required to be a practicing ocean scientists , this number is inflated .
The American Meteorological Society claims over 14,000 members and the OISM claims 341 meteorologists as petition signatories .
That ’s only 2.4 % .
It ’s clear that the OISM names do n’t represent a significant number of scientists when compared to either the total number of science graduates in the U.S. or to the number of practicing scientists who work in likely relevant fields .
But that ’s not all .
Over recent years , various organizations have set out to estimate just how widespread the supposed “ scientific consensus ” on AGW actually is .
Two recent efforts were conducted by the Statistical Assessment Service ( STATS ) at George Mason University and by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .
The STATS survey found that 84 % of climate scientists surveyed “ personally believe human - induced warming is occurring ” and that “ [ o ] nly 5 % believe that that human activity does not contribute to greenhouse warming . ”
The STATS survey involved a random sampling of “ 489 self - identified members of either the American Meteorological Society or the American Geophysical Union ” and it has a theoretical sampling error of +/- 4 % .
The Pew survey was taken in early 2009 and asked over 2000 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) their opinion on various scientific issues , including climate disruption .
84 % of AAAS respondents felt that “ warming is due to human activity ” compared to only 10 % who felt that “ warming is due to natural causes . ”
The AAAS has over 10 million members , and the results of the survey are statistically valid for the entire population with a theoretical sampling error of +/- 2.5 % .
84 % of 10 million scientist members of the AAAS is 8.4 million scientists who agree that climate disruption is human - caused .
84 % of the climate scientists ( conservatively just the members of the atmospheric science group of the AGU ) is , conservatively , 6,000 scientists who have direct and expert knowledge of climate disruption .
The 13,245 scientists and 152 possible climate scientists who signed the OISM petition represent a small minority of the totals .
The IPCC AR4 WG1 report was written and reviewed by approximately 2000 scientists .
If we assume that the 20,000 AGU members who claim to be atmospheric scientists , ocean scientists , or hydrologists represent the pool of potential experts in climate science in the U.S. , then approximately 10 % of all climate scientists were directly involved in creating the over 1000 page report .
That compares to less than 1 % of all OISM “ scientists ” who mailed a pre-printed postcard .
Ultimately ,
The OISM petition will continue to rear it ’s ugly head until its fabricated credibility has been thoroughly demolished .
Social conservatives and libertarians , each of which has their own ideological reasons to push the OISM petition , have been effective at keeping the “ 30,000 scientists reject warming chicken - littleism of IPCC ” meme circulating throughout conservative media outlets , even as climate disruption - focused media have worked at limiting the damage from the OISM petition .
But given the fact that the science supporting a dominantly anthropogenic cause for climate disruption is overwhelming , it ’s only a matter of time before the OISM petition wilts in the heat .
But their replacement in the 6 am to 9 am slot , Chris Page , said this morning it was wrong to say the pair had been suspended " indefinitely " .
" They have not been suspended ... the show has not finished , " Page said before reading a statement by Austereo general manager Jenny Parkes on air just after 6.30 am .
" Kyle Sandilands 's management has advised Austereo that he is unable to perform his duties on air at this time , " the statement read .
" Further , following a great deal of consideration and having consulted Jackie O and all stakeholders , Austereo has formed the view that it is in the interest of all parties for the [ program ] to go into recess until we have completed an across - the - networks review of the principles and protocols of our interaction with our audience . "
Austereo said the review began on Wednesday , the day on which the girl was strapped to a lie detector and asked on air about sex and truancy .
She revealed she had been raped when aged 12 .
When her mother asked in the broadcast whether she was sexually active , the girl replied : " I 've already told you the story about this ... and do n't look at me and smile , because it 's not funny . "
When the girl said she had been raped , Sandilands responded by saying : " Right , is that the only experience you 've had ? "
Sandilands and O'Neil Henderson later apologised on air , saying they had not been told the girl had been raped and denying suggestions the interview was a set - up .
On their website , they said they were horrified by the rape claim .
Sandilands later said on air : " We 're very sad for the girl and very disappointed and apologetic to anyone who took offence to it . "
The NSW Police and the state Department of Community Services are investigating the girl 's remarks .
A group of 15 high - profile psychologists , academics and child advocates wrote to Fairfax Media calling for the show to be axed , suggesting it had been the venue for child abuse and a gross violation of human rights .
Ms Parkes said O'Neil Henderson had been consulted before the network announced the decision to suspend the program .
" Austereo will not make any further comment until the review is completed , '' Ms Parkes said .
Attempts to contact Sandilands by telephone last night were unsuccessful .

California considers making marijuana legal , and people with brains duel with the usual cock knockers .
Here we have two doctors , and good old douchebag general barry mccaffrey himself .
One doctor is most likely a shill for big pharma ( suck my cock , you whore ) , and the other touts the benefits of using marijuana to treat a variety of ailments .
One question .
Why do all these doctors tend to tout the benefits of marinol , and cannibinol when there ’s a plant that grows out of the fucking ground which does the same thing ?
Barry McCaffrey does n’t even want to be connected with the war on drugs , but still touts the line of “ marijuana bad ” to please his puppet masters who are probably filling his pockets .

A representative for Mitsuhiro Ishida made a verbal protest Saturday against Gilbert Melendez , claiming the Strikeforce interim lightweight champion was “ greased ” during their rematch at “ Carano vs. Cyborg ” at the HP Pavilion in San Jose , Calif .
California State Athletic Commission Assistant Executive Officer Bill Douglas told Sherdog.com that the representative interrupted a meeting for officials held shortly after the event to make the proclamation , and was asked to leave the closed - door gathering .
Melendez , 27 , blasted past Ishida during their championship bout Saturday , scoring a third - round technical knockout after the Japanese fighter failed on numerous occasions to ground the champion .
Ishida absorbed ample punishment from the striker standing , and was dropped by a body knee in the third before Melendez coaxed out the stoppage on the canvas .
Douglas said his agency would not inform Melendez of the complaint unless it became official .
“ In order for it to be considered official , we have to have something in writing , ” said Douglas .
Douglas said Ishida ’s camp has five days to file an official protest , and has not heard from the group since Saturday .
Melendez seemed surprised by the accusations when reached by Sherdog.com Monday .
“ I did not grease in the fight , ” said Melendez .
“ The athletic commission was with me the whole time .
I did n’t bring any grease with me .
I did n’t think there was much grappling in the fight anyway .
” Melendez , 27 , lost a unanimous decision to Ishida in their first encounter at Yarennoka in December 2007 , but had little issue with the southpaw wrestler on Saturday .
“ It ’s kind of funny , but kind of weak , ” he said .
“ I beat him good and there ’s no way I greased .
” Greasing allegations dominated the headlines last February , after B.J. Penn accused Georges St. Pierre and his cornermen of misconduct between rounds during a championship bout at UFC 94 in Las Vegas .
After an investigation , the Nevada State Athletic Commission did not call a disciplinary hearing for the Canadian and his team .
” Ever since the Penn - St. Pierre fight , our inspectors have been duly trained to be very attentive to what ’s happening backstage and in the corner , ” said Douglas .
Military Lawyer Claims U.S. Paid Gitmo Prosecution Witnesses
Created : August 04 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00

( Zuma Press )
In a startling accusation , defense lawyers in the case of an adolescent arrested and brought to Guantanamo Bay six years ago claim the Justice Department may bring a criminal case against the young man based on testimony from witnesses paid by the U.S. government for their cooperation .
Mohammed Jawad was as young as 12 when he was arrested by Afghan police in 2002 and accused of throwing a grenade at U.S. soldiers .
Although he confessed to the crime after Afghan officials threatened to kill him and his family , his statements were later ruled inadmissible by two U.S. judges because they were coerced .
Now , although the Justice Department has conceded it ca n’t rely on those confessions and can no longer imprison Jawad based on the laws of war , it ’s said it may file new criminal charges against him based on previously unavailable eyewitness testimony to the crime .
Those witnesses , however , according to Jawad ’s U.S. military defense lawyer , were all paid in gifts or cash in exchange for their testimony .
U.S. Marine Corps Major Eric Montalvo , one of Jawad ’s military defense lawyers , said he ’s spoken to all of “ the government ’s star witnesses ” and “ they all have a couple of things in common . ”
First , “ they know how to describe the day of the incident anywhere from two to five different ways , placing themselves in different locations for each of these descriptions and witnessing or not witnessing different things , ” he said in a recent e-mail message .
Second , “ they have all received some sort of U.S. government compensation , from shoes and a trip to the United States to $ 400 for cooperation , which is a princely sum in Afghanistan . ”
Furthermore , Montalvo says , when he spoke with officials from the government of Afghanistan , which has been demanding Jawad ’s return home , they “ openly admit that the matter was not handled properly and they do n’t even know what happened because the Americans in their lust for bloodletting snatched Jawad away before the incident could be investigated . ”
Jawad ’s statements were ruled inadmissible by a military commission last year after a U.S. military judge at Guantanamo Bay agreed that Jawad had been tortured by Afghan police .
Statements made to U.S. officials just hours later , the judge also ruled , were still tainted by the Afghan authorities ’ torture .
U.S. authorities “ used techniques to maintain the shock and fearful state associated with the Accused ’s initial apprehension by the Afghan police , ” the judge ruled .
Both confessions were deemed inadmissible .
Jawad ’s ordeal did n’t end on the day of his arrest , however .
In addition to his torture by the Afghans , military records indicate that at the Bagram prison and later at Guantanamo , Jawad faced more abuse .
Jawad arrived at Bagram just days after two prisoners there were murdered during interrogations .
Jawad told interrogators he was hooded , strip - searched , shackled and shoved down stairs , slapped and screamed at .
Guards there later admitted to abusing prisoners in exactly those ways .
At Guantanamo , military documents reveal that Jawad was subjected to the sleep deprivation technique known as the “ frequent flyer ” program — he was moved from cell to cell 112 times in 14 days to keep him from sleeping .
He was also kicked , beaten , pepper - sprayed and at one point suffered a broken nose .
In December 2003 , Jawad tried to kill himself by banging his head repeatedly against one of his cell walls .
Even the former prosecutor in his military commission case has insisted that there ’s no legitimate basis for convicting Jawad .
Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld , a former military prosecutor , resigned from his post with the military commissions because he insisted there was no reliable evidence supporting the government ’s claims .
Vandeveld ’s 14 - page sworn statement , submitted to support Jawad ’s habeas corpus petition and detailing his efforts to investigate the case , is revealing .
“ I personally do not believe there is any lawful basis for continuing to detain Mr. Jawad , ” he wrote .
Vandeveld described the evidence as “ scattered throughout an incomprehensible labyrinth of databases , ” “ strewn throughout the prosecution offices ” in drawers , bookcases and disorderly piles on desks , and said that “ most physical evidence that had been collected had either disappeared or had been stored in locations that no one with any tenure at , or institutional knowledge of , the Commissions could identify with any degree of specificity or certainty . ”
Moreover , “ crucial physical evidence and other documents relevant to both the prosecution and the defense had been tossed into a locker located at Guantanamo and promptly forgotten . ”
Vandeveld was unable to locate the videotape of Jawad ’s interrogation by U.S. personnel , despite a service - wide search .
He also “ failed to locate two alleged eyewitnesses to the attack who had allegedly told a U.S. investigator that they had personally witnessed Jawad throw the grenade , ” he wrote .
“ All I had were two paragraph summaries of interviews conducted through an interpreter of these witnesses several months after the attack .
The information on the summaries identifying these two witnesses consisted solely of their names , both of which were common in Afghanistan .
The few statements that I did have were inconsistent in some respects with each other , but I convinced myself that the discrepancies were the natural and expected fading of witness recollections over time . ”
At the time , Vandeveld did not know that Jawad had been tortured or otherwise mistreated or coerced .
As his investigation continued , Vandeveled “ learned that the written statement characterized by the Afghan police officer as Jawad ’s personal confession could not possibly have been written by him . ”
That ’s because “ Jawad was functionally illiterate and could not read or write , ” and “ the statement was not even in his native language of Pashto ; the Afghan police officer who created the statement wrote it in his own native Dari . ”
The statements allegedly given to Afghan police and later given to U.S. authorities , said Vandeveld , “ suffered from material differences , causing me and other prosecutors to wonder whether either could be used to establish the truth .
It seemed increasingly likely that the statement attributed to Mr. Jawad in his original interrogation had simply been contrived by one of the Afghan policemen , which they then amateurishly sought to “ authenticate ” by having Jawad place his thumbprint on the document . ”
Eventually , Vandeveld learned that both confessions had been coerced , as a military judge subsequently ruled , and that Jawad had been systematically abused in Bagram and then at Guantanamo .
Ultimately , Vandeveled concluded that “ there is no reliable evidence of any voluntary involvement on Jawad ’s part with any terrorist groups . ”
The most credible evidence suggests “ that Mr. Jawad was lured to Afghanistan under false pretenses — the promise of well paid work clearing landmines promised to him by unscrupulous recruiters … ”
To the extent that Jawad was affiliated with a terrorist group at all , Vandeveld said , that association appears to have been brief and involuntary .
“ [ H ]e was certainly not involved with the organization long enough to have any actionable intelligence , or even unique or otherwise unknown information about the group , ” said Vendeveld , adding that Jawad ’s youth , lack of education and “ manifest gullibility ” marked him , at best , as “ a low level foot soldier . ”
According to military records and news reports , Vandeveld noted , at least three other Afghans have since been arrested and subsequently confessed to responsibility for the grenade attack .
It ’s not clear what evidence the Justice Department plans to use in a criminal prosecution because all of the evidence that the government claims was “ not previously available ” is classified .
However , a declassified summary of the evidence filed with the court , with most of the substantive information about Jawad blacked out , does reveal many of the sources of the government ’s evidence , which are not blacked out .
The bulk of it appears to come from testimony and summaries of testimony from 2003 until 2006 ; most of it appears to have been previously produced at military administrative review hearings .
Other information in the unclassified document consists of summaries of interrogations by U.S. forces drafted by the interrogators and produced at previous hearings .
Both the military commission and the federal district court have ruled that , because of the torture and coercion of Jawad , his statements in those interrogations are not admissible .
Nothing in the unclassified factual return , at least , refers to newly discovered evidence or testimony only recently made available .
In its submission to the court , Jawad ’s lawyers in his habeas case say that “ the Government has had possession of this evidence for several months , ” and that all of the evidence the government is now saying it wants to use “ was provided in discovery to military commission defense counsel in May . ”
The defense lawyers further insist that the material the government wants to produce consists of “ unsworn summaries of unsworn interviews ” — similar to what Vandeveld described — that would “ not be admissible evidence in a U.S. federal court . ”
American Civil Liberties Union attorney Jonathan Hafetz , who has been representing Jawad in his habeas corpus case , says that he also was told that the witnesses received compensation for their testimony .
“ Had Respondent actually produced one or more of these ‘ eyewitnesses ’ at a habeas hearing on the merits , Petitioner ’s counsel were fully prepared to refute , rebut and impeach him or them , ” the defense lawyers write in their brief .
“ It is unclear why the Government is even mentioning ‘ new ’ evidence and discussing potential criminal prosecution in the same document where they acknowledge they cannot prove even by a preponderance of the evidence that the Petitioner is detainable . ”
Indeed , one curious point about the claim that the government can prosecute Jawad under federal criminal law , after conceding it ca n’t make its case in his habeas corpus proceeding , is that the burden of proof on the government in a criminal case would be significantly higher than in a civil habeas corpus proceeding .
A criminal case must be proven “ beyond a reasonable doubt , ” whereas in a habeas corpus proceeding , the government need only show that “ the preponderance of the evidence ” supports its claims .
Asked about the claims that the government ’s witnesses had been paid for their testimony , Dean Boyd , spokesman for the Justice Department ’s National Security Division , wrote in an e-mail that “ Jawad has not been charged with any crime in federal court .
To begin speculating in public about possible evidence or witnesses in such a case is inappropriate and not an exercise the government will engage in . ”
He did not say that the government would not or cannot pay or otherwise compensate witnesses in these circumstances , however .
Jawad ’s defense lawyers , meanwhile , have not been reticent about their view of the evidence .
While explaining that he cannot describe the evidence because it ’s classified , Hafetz insisted that “ it is not new and it is not credible or reliable . ”
So far , the government has lost 28 out of 33 habeas corpus cases brought by Guantanamo detainees and heard by a federal court because the courts have found the evidence unreliable or otherwise insufficient to justify their continued detention .
The Justice Department is reportedly planning to bring criminal charges against “ dozens more ” Guantanamo prisoners .
Over the years , we 've heard a lot from people who 've unearthed hidden treasures in Google Books : a crafter who uncovered a forgotten knitting technique , a family historian who discovered her ancestor once traveled the country with a dancing , roller - skating bear .
The books they found were out of copyright and in the public domain , which meant they could read the full text and even download a PDF version of the book .

To get started , just find any public domain book on Google Books and click on the Download button in the toolbar .
I 'm excited to announce that starting today , Google Books will offer free downloads of these and more than one million more public domain books in an additional format , EPUB .
By adding support for EPUB downloads , we 're hoping to make these books more accessible by helping people around the world to find and read them in more places .
More people are turning to new reading devices to access digital books , and many such phones , netbooks , and e-ink readers have smaller screens that do n't readily render image - based PDF versions of the books we 've scanned .
EPUB is a lightweight text - based digital book format that allows the text to automatically conform ( or " reflow " ) to these smaller screens .
And because EPUB is a free , open standard supported by a growing ecosystem of digital reading devices , works you download from Google Books as EPUBs wo n't be tied to or locked into a particular device .
We'll
Of course , these public domain books were n't born in EPUB format -- or even in digital format at all .
Let 's say you download a free EPUB copy of Treasure Island .
You 're taking a final step in a long process that takes a physical copy of Robert Louis Stevenson 's book and transforms it into something you can download for your iPhone .
The process begins with a book that has been preserved by one of our library partners from around the world .
Google borrows the book from one of our library partners , much like you can from your local library .
Before returning the book in undamaged form , we take photographs of the pages .
Those images are then stitched together and processed in order to create a digital version of the classic book .
This includes the difficult task of performing Optical Character Recognition on the page image in order to extract a text layer we can transform into HTML , or other text - based file formats like EPUB ( if you 're interested , you can read more about this process here ) .
Digitizing books allows us to provide more access to great literature for a wider set of the world 's population .
Before physical books were invented , thoughts were constrained by both space and time .
It was difficult for humans to share their thoughts and feelings with a set of people too far from their physical location .
Printed books changed that by allowing authors to record their experiences in a medium that could be shipped around the world .
Similarly , the words written down could be preserved through time .
The result was an explosion in collaboration and creativity .
Via printed books , a 17th century physicist in Great Britain could build on the work of a 16th century Italian scholar .
Of course , it can be difficult and costly to reproduce and transport the information that older physical books contain .
Some can't afford these works .
Others who might be able to afford to purchase them can't unless they can find a physical copy available for sale or loan .
Some important books are so limited in quantity that one must fly around the world to find a copy .
Access to other works is only available to those who attend certain universities or belong to certain organizations .
Once we convert atoms from physical books into digital bits , we can begin to change some of that .
While atoms remain fairly expensive , digital bits are on a trend where they become ever cheaper to produce , transport , and store .
For example , providing every student in a school district with a paper copy of Shakespeare 's Hamlet might cost thousands of dollars .
Yet if those same students already have cell phones , laptops , or access to the Internet , then they can access a digital copy of Hamlet for just a fraction of the cost .
Often times , public domain texts in digital form are more affordable and accessible to the public than their physical parents .
Consumers could receive incentives of between £ 2,000 and £ 5,000 to buy an electric car from 2011 , the Government announced today .
Transport Secretary Geoff
Hoon said the initiative — part of the Government ’s low - carbon transport plan — would mean an electric car was “ a real option for motorists ” .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He announced the five - year initiative with Business Secretary Lord Mandelson .
The Department for Transport is beginning discussions with the motor industry and financiers to determine how best to deliver this assistance .
To be eligible cars would need to meet modern safety standards and have a range and top speed sufficient to give mass market appeal .
Mr Hoon said today : " Cutting road transport CO2 emissions is a key element to tackling climate change .
Less than 0.1 per cent of the UK ’s 26 million cars are electric , so there is a huge untapped potential to reduce emissions .
" The scale of incentives we ’re announcing today will mean that an electric car is a real option for motorists as well as helping to make the UK a world leader in low - carbon transport . "
Lord Mandelson said : " Britain has taken a world lead in setting ambitious targets for carbon reduction .
Low - carbon vehicles will play a key role in cutting emissions .
" Government must act now to ensure that the business benefits of this ambition are realised here in the UK .
We want the British motor industry to be a leader in the low - carbon future , and Government must direct and support this , through what I call new industrial activism . "
The five - year plan involves a £ 250 m scheme to deliver a green motoring transformation and involves promoting the infrastructure and support technology and encouragement of manufacture in the UK that will place low - carbon transport at the centre of the Government ’s vision for the UK economy .
The two ministers were planning to drive a new Mini E electric vehicle in Dunfermline in Scotland to demonstrate the technology of low - carbon motoring .
At present the cost of electric cars is high , with one high - performance vehicle , the Tesla Roadster , having a starting price of more than £ 87,000 .
At the moment there is also little infrastructure in place to support the recharging that such cars need .
Last week London Mayor Boris Johnson announced a plan to introduce thousands of charging points across the capital .

I just chatted with Raymond Denny , the 64 - year - old La Center , Wash . , man who received the RNC ’s “ 2009 Future of American Health Survey , ” which alleged that President Obama ’s health reform plans might discriminate against Republicans .
Here ’s the survey question :
“ I ’ve been getting these things for years , ” said Denny , who opened the letter with his wife Louise , “ getting them from the Republicans , getting them from the Democratic Party , usually with the wrong name on it .
This thing says I ’m a sustaining member .
They word these things to solicit the answer they wanted .
This one here we looked at and said , ‘ Wow , that ’s way beyond the pale of what should be done . ’”
Denny confirmed that he ’s a “ lifelong independent ” who became a Democrat last year to vote for Obama .
“ I ’m a fiscal and constitutional conservative , ” he said , although he has n’t made up his mind on the health care debate yet .
“ I do n’t know why I got this .
Maybe something in my demographic or something convinced them that I was a lifelong Republican . ”

Why are we asking this now ?
The former shadow home secretary David Davis used the legal protections of parliamentary privilege to accuse British security services of " outsourcing torture " .
Mr Davis cited Rangzieb Ahmed , from Rochdale , an al - Qa'ida leader who was jailed for life in the UK for directing terror .
The Conservative MP claims the security services allowed Ahmed to go to Pakistan so they could alert the authorities who , he claims , arrested and tortured him .
Mr Davis said he had " a whole load of corroborative evidence " to support his claim regarding Ahmed .
What exactly was the alleged role of the British security services ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Davis said that although British police and the security services had enough surveillance material to charge Ahmed , they still allowed him to go to Pakistan .
Once there , British intelligence suggested to the Pakistani authorities he should be arrested .
A list of questions to be put to Ahmed was drawn up by the security services and Manchester police , said Mr Davis .
Ahmed has said he was whipped with tyre rubber , beaten with staves and had three fingernails pulled out .
Is Rangzieb Ahmed the only alleged victim ?
No .
Government security sources have told newspapers that as many as 15 British suspects may have been rendered and tortured in Pakistan , Afghanistan , Bangladesh and north Africa .
The most prominent allegations have been made by a British resident , Binyam Mohamed , who was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 .
Mr Mohamed , who has never been charged with a terrorism offence , was questioned after being seized at Karachi airport in April 2002 travelling on a false passport .
He was sent to an interrogation centre where , he says , he was hung up for a week by a leather strap around his wrists .
Among his interrogators were officials from America 's CIA .
He was later visited by two British intelligence officers , one called John .
The torture stopped when they came , Mohamed said .
He said John told him : " I 'll see what we can do with the Americans . "
He did n't see John again .
Are there others ?
Jamil Rahman , a British civil servant , claims Britain was complicit in assault , unlawful arrest , false imprisonment and breaches of human rights legislation over his alleged ill - treatment while detained in Bangladesh .
Mr Rahman , who has never been charged with a terrorism offence , says that he was the victim of repeated beatings over a period of more than two years at the hands of Bangladeshi intelligence officers , and he claims that a pair of MI5 officers were blatantly involved in his ordeal .
Has Britain been involved in rendition ?
It depends how one defines rendition .
If it is standing by while allowing allies to unlawfully fly British terror suspects around the world the UK may well be guilty .
Mr Mohamed was flown to Morocco after being held incommunicado in Pakistan , where he was interrogated by an MI5 officer .
From Morocco , he was rendered to Kabul 's notorious CIA prison where he says he was held in darkness for weeks on end .
MI5 telegrams to the CIA show security service officers fed the US with information on Mr Mohamed when he was allegedly being tortured in Morocco .
MI5 has said it did not know where he was or in what conditions because the CIA refused to say .
Is there more evidence ?
Yes .
There is further evidence that Britain has allowed its territory in Diego Garcia to be used by the Americans to illegally transfer other suspects to detention camps around the world .
The British Foreign Secretary David Miliband had to make an embarrassing admission to Parliament after the US informed the Government that they were mistaken when they had previously said that no suspects were flown to the Indian Ocean island .
Why did the British security services allow the Americans to interview UK citizens ?
After 9/11 Britain got sucked into the the war on terror led by US security services , which sanctioned the use of torture in certain circumstances .
In the immediate aftermath of the event , Tony Blair stated that Britain stood " shoulder to shoulder " with the US administration and between 2002 and 2004 there was an intimate sharing of intelligence information between the CIA and their British counterparts .
As their relationship closened , so British citizens ended up under the control of US authorities .
In a court case involving Mr Mohamed , the ruling of two judges , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones , in 2008 was : " The relationship of the United Kingdom Government to the United States authorities in connection with [ Mr Mohamed ] was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing . "
Are the police investigating ?
They are .
Scotland Yard has been asked to look at the allegations made by Mr Mohamed to see whether MI5 officers are guilty of complicity in torture .
The Attorney General , Lady Scotland , said in a written statement that she had given the allegations of possible criminal wrongdoing " very serious consideration " and felt there were sufficient grounds to launch a criminal investigation .
But she stopped short of conceding a full judicial inquiry , which many critics have demanded .
Have British agents been directly involved ?
Yes .
Shaker Aamer , a British resident who is still being held in Guantanamo Bay , claims that an MI5 or an MI6 officer was present while he was being tortured and abused by US agents in Afghanistan in 2002 .
Mr Aamer , 42 , is a Saudi citizen who has a British wife and five British children living in south London .
A claim letter sent to government lawyers alleges : " UK intelligence services officers were present whilst Mr Aamer was beaten .
They provided information and encouragement to his US torturers .
They made no attempt to stop his ill - treatment or any enquiries into his well - being . "
What is Britain 's position on torture ?

MI5 never officially comment .
However , the position of the UK Government is that it condemns torture , in line with the United Nations Convention Against Torture , which we signed up for in the 1980s .
Officially , the last torture warrant issued in England was in 1641 .
More recently the Prime Minister has announced a review into MI5 operations .
What will happen next ?
The Liberal Democrats and the human rights charity Reprieve , who represent Mr Mohamed , are already demanding a full judicial enquiry into the role of Britain 's security and intelligence services .
Ed Davey , the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman said : " These are incredibly serious allegations of complicity in barbaric acts of torture and breaches of international law .
There must be complete faith in the way the investigation is carried out if the public 's trust , and Britain 's standing in the world , is ever to be restored . "
How high does the scandal go ?
It is impossible to say but it seems unlikely that Britain officers and agents were acting without recourse to authorities high in government .
Of particular interest is what the former foreign secretary Jack Straw knew of the involvement of security and intelligence services activity between 2002 and 2004 .
It seems almost inconceivable that when alarm bells started sounding about the US treatment of detainees in the war on terror , senior British politicians were not kept in the loop .
Does Britain outsource torture ?
Yes ...
* There are more than one or two isolated cases of Britain 's alleged complicity in torture and rendition
* Britain was very close to the US at the start of the war on terror and turned a blind eye to CIA excesses
* MI5 agents admit they sent questions to their CIA counterparts to help them question suspects
No ...
* No case has proved that any UK suspect was tortured by a third - party state on the instructions of British agents
* The security and intelligence services do n't believe that torture delivers truthful information
* At worst UK agents are guilty of not asking questions of foreign agencies
Will the Lions start Stafford in Week 1 ?
Even though training camp is still over a month away , the talk in Detroit right now is whether or not the Lions should start rookie quarterback Matthew Stafford in Week 1 of the regular season .
Before we debate this topic , let ’s get something out of the way first because I know there ’s a commenter out there who just ca n’t wait to throw out this boring , overused statement :
It ’s way too early to know whether or not Stafford should start Week 1 considering it ’s only June and we have n’t seen him take one snap against live action ( either in practice or preseason ) .
But I ’m going to throw the topic out there anyway because it takes the sting out of knowing that the NFL season is still light years away .
So save all of your , “ It ’s way too early to tell , ” comments and tuck them under your pillow to be used at another time .
There will be two names that some Lions fans will throw out there when making the argument that Stafford should start as a rookie : Matt Ryan and Joe Flacco .
If Ryan and Flacco could respectively lead the Falcons and Ravens to the playoffs , why could n’t Stafford do the same with the Lie-Downs ?
The difference is that Ryan and Flacco had help .
The Falcons hit a home run with free agent running back Michael Turner , who carried the ball 376 times and helped take the burden off Ryan by opening up lanes in the passing game .
Ryan also benefited from having a solid receiver corps ( led by Roddy White ) , as well as an offensive line that overachieved and stayed healthy .
Do n’t forget that Ryan was also considered one of the most NFL - ready quarterbacks to come out of college in the past couple years .
Flacco benefited from having a good but not great O - line , an outstanding running game and a defense that helped create scoring opportunities every game .
Like Ryan , Flacco benefited from having a coaching staff that was patient with him and did n’t put too much on him too soon .
The Falcons and Ravens dumbed down the playbook as much as possible so that they did n’t throw a lot at them all at once .
Getting back to Stafford , there ’s no question that running back Kevin Smith has the talent to succeed , but nobody is going to mistake the Lions ’ running game for that of the Falcons or Ravens .
Plus , Detroit ’s offensive line is brutal and while Atlanta ’s defense was nothing to write home about last year , it was certainly better than what the Lions are going to trot onto the field this season .
That said , it ’s not like the Lions would n’t be giving Stafford any help .
Calvin Johnson is quickly emerging as one of the top playmakers in the game and the team managed to snag the best receiving tight end in the draft this year in Brandon Pettigrew .
And if Detroit feels that Stafford is mentally capable of dealing with the massive ups and downs that come with being a NFL quarterback , then there are benefits ( gaining experience being the biggest ) to starting a signal caller as a rookie .
But the bottom line is that the Lions are n’t going to win next year and while new GM Martin Mayhew is trying his best , the roster is still largely devoid of talent .
The smarter move for Detroit would be to allow Daunte Culpepper to take the majority of the snaps this season while Stafford learns on the sidelines and Mayhew gets another offseason to stock the roster with more talent .
The Lions do n’t need another Joey Harrington on their hands , nor do they need to rush Stafford onto the field in hopes of generating false hope amongst the fan base .
The new Ferrari 458 Italia has been finally up on the road as a supercar version of the previous Modena .

Duvel Green beer review , Duvel Light
Duvel Green : A nice alternative to Big Brother
Beer Reviews / Food & Drink Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
I do n't usually get caught up in any hype surrounding new beer releases .
They tend to be overblown and anticlimactic at best .
If ' the next great beer ' comes from a macro - brewery , you can almost be sure it 's just more of the same tasteless swill with a different label .
If it comes from a micro , often as not , it 's some ' experiment ' that probably should have been left in the lab .
But , what if it comes from the brewers of some of the best beer on the planet ?
A brewer that has never disappointed me ?
The maker of the golden elixir that , if I had to choose , would be the one beer I would contentedly drink till the end of my days ?
Well , when Duvel told me there was a new beer on the way , I got excited .
Then waited .
And waited .
The wait was made worse when I started hearing news from NYC and Philly that it had arrived .
I remained excited even when the first reports from those places were a bit less than enthusiastic – I know how that lot can be .
Every month that went by , the new local launch date was pushed back .
When that day finally arrived , I rushed straight out to the pub to get mine .
I have n't done that sort of thing since Springsteen was good .
That long ago .
First , Duvel Green has been called many things , so I should start by explaining what it is not .
It is not just a draft version of regular Duvel .
And it is not , technically , Duvel Lite .
The Green begins the process the same way but misses the second , in - the - bottle fermentation that the original Duvel receives .
This might not change everything , but the changes are substantial and readily apparent .
Green is still a Belgian pale ale with the same golden color .
The head is still large , white and fluffy , but is nowhere near the volcanic cloud of foam that sits atop a Duvel .
The smell is less complex , but more earthy and fresh .
There are still some spice and hop notes in the aroma , but grass , grain and soil pile on top .
The alcohol is almost 2 % lower , clocking in about 6.8 % .
The taste is simpler and lighter than the Big Brother .
That earthiness , nearly non-existent before , is a major presence in the Green .
The malt still adds a welcome dab of sweetness , and there is still a smattering of spice and a drop of lemon , but it lacks the mature complexity of a proper Duvel .
The parts may be there , but they have n't grown into a whole yet .
It is thinner , lighter and a notch crisper , so that Duvel Lite moniker it sometimes gets is n't far wrong .
But , Green is definitely not a light beer .
I think the original goes well enough with most food , but the Green may even be little better in that regard .
Especially with some milder seafood and the like , which Duvel may march a little too heavy over .
I was pleased , if not exactly thrilled , when I finally tasted Duvel Green .
There was no way it was going to live up to my expectations , but it 's still a solid beer .
The good news is that in any bar that you find Green on tap , you 'll still find the Big Brother version in the bottle .
The lower alcohol content will make the drafts a little safer , and they may be a little easier to drink .
Personally , I prefer my Duvel to be fully ripe and ready for picking , but the Green is nice to have around for an alternative .

£ 6 m drive to cut teen pregnancies sees them DOUBLE
No regrets : Lucy Lanelly had four abortions by the age of 16
A multi-million pound initiative to reduce teenage pregnancies more than doubled the number of girls conceiving .
The Government - backed scheme tried to persuade teenage girls not to get pregnant by handing out condoms and teaching them about sex .
But research funded by the Department of Health shows that young women who attended the programme , at a cost of £ 2,500 each , were ' significantly ' more likely to become pregnant than those on other youth programmes who were not given contraception and sex advice .
A total of 16 per cent of those on the Young People 's Development Programme conceived compared with just 6 per cent in other programmes .
Experts said the scheme failed because it introduced girls ' at risk ' of becoming pregnant to promiscuous girls they might not otherwise have met .
Because of peer pressure , the more timid teenagers were more likely to have sex and become pregnant .
The £ 5.9 million YPDP programme was also designed to slash cannabis use and drunkenness among teenagers , but made no difference whatsoever .
Last night ministers pledged to drop the scheme after admitting it had failed .
Around 40,000 teenage girls become pregnant every year in the UK , the highest level in western Europe .
The failed YPDP , launched in 2004 , was based on a similar scheme in New York claimed to have significantly reduced teenage pregnancies .
However , attempts to replicate the work elsewhere in the U.S. did not lead to a fall in teenage pregnancies , casting doubt on the project as a whole .
In England , 2,371 teenagers took part in the programme over three years .
They were nominated by social workers , teachers or NHS staff who thought they were at risk of school exclusion , drug abuse and pregnancy .
The study , published online by the British Medical Journal , was carried out by Meg Wiggins , from the Institute of Education at the University of London and Chris Bonell , from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
They were commissioned by the Department of Health to evaluate the programme independently .
They concluded that 'at best , the programme had no impact - and at worst it had a negative impact ' .
A Department of Health spokesman said : ' This pilot was based on a successful American programme .
It did not appear to reduce teenage pregnancy so we will not be taking it any further . '
Case study - Lucy Lanelly
By the time she reached the age of consent , Lucy Lanelly had become pregnant four times .
And on each occasion the teenager from Toll Bar , South Yorkshire , had an abortion .
Now 19 , she became pregnant at 12 after a single encounter with a 15 - year - old boy .
She was then given a three - month contraceptive jab but failed to get another one .
The following year Lucy became pregnant by a 19 - year - old man at a party .
Her third pregnancy was by a 15 - year - old boy who said he was infertile .
The last pregnancy was by her boyfriend Jack , 20 , when a condom failed .
Lucy said : ' I do n't regret having the terminations because I was too young to have a baby , but I do regret having sex when I was n't mature enough to deal with it . '
It appears as if Windows 7 will not need to reach its designated release date to make a big splash in Europe .
According to several sources , Microsoft 's European online store crashed within hours of offering discounted pre-order copies of the new operating system .
The sale officially encompassed the major markets in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , France and Germany , where both Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional editions were being sold at very reasonable discount prices .
Win7 : More than Half - Off the List Price
Windows 7E
Home Premium is now selling for 49.99 GBP ( Great Britain Pound ) in the UK , a 67 % discount from the list price of 149.99 GBP .
On the other hand , Windows 7E Professional is now selling for 99.99 GBP , a 55 % discount from the list price of 219.99 GBP .
While the outage continued to rage on , users were treated to the following message informing them of the heavy traffic on the site : " Due to the eagerly anticipated Windows 7 pre-order offer , we 're experiencing a higher level of demand on our website than usual .
This means you can't access the site right now and we 're sorry about that . "
( Source : computerworld.com )
Number 1 Best Seller at Amazon
As expected after a message like that , Amazon.com 's French and German stores reported sell - outs for both special - priced editions at the end of the day .
Instead of turning away the droves of excess paying customers , when the sell - out was announced , the German store went back to taking pre-orders of the Windows 7E Home Premium for a fee closer to the original list price .
The successful discount campaign earned Windows 7E Home Premium and Professional the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on Amazon 's French and German software bestseller lists .
More Units Sold : 8 Hours versus 17 Weeks
In the UK , the BBC ( British Broadcasting Corporation ) reported that Amazon 's store sold more copies of Windows 7 in the first eight hours of the sale than it did in the 17 - week run of a similar pre-order offer in 2006 for Windows Vista .
Microsoft announced in an earlier statement that the discounts will be good through August 9 ( if you can still manage to find a copy ) or until supplies last .

Microsoft would also like to remind those that ordered one of the two special - priced editions that they will not be receiving their physical copies until ( or after ) October 22 , the day the operating system is set to be released to the public .

On the whole , the idea that your body can’t process soy protein or canola oil is n’t something I know enough about to agree or disagree with .
Whether those foods he chose are health foods or not is EASY .
He ’s right , all of those foods are things that are best to avoid .
Drink water from the tap .
Eat plain yogurt and add your own fruit to make it tasty .
Make your own smoothie with real milk and fruit .
Pack a snack bag full of grains and dried fruit rather than depend on weight loss bars .
Real food ALWAYS trumps manufactured food for health .
The Twitterati are only too happy to take their private moments public .
But Silicon Valley 's technical wizards are whispering to one another over lunch that the the federal intelligence apparatus wants more , and is taking it .
( Update : Twitter denies )
Whoever is seeding the restaurant gossip is being fairly specific .
A source tells us that a loose - lipped Twitter staffer recently dished at a lunch that the company has allowed a federal agency to set up a tap to monitor a " firehose " of its data , including private details on users , presumably including private " direct messages , " IP addresses and account information .
The Feds — the NSA would seem the most logical agency — then analyze the data to mine for information they deem of interest .
Twitter , it is said , is one of only a handful of internet companies large enough for the Feds to bother setting up such monitoring .
We called and emailed Twitter 's PR department and the company 's director of operations , and have not yet heard back .
( Update : See below . )
But it 's hard to imagine the microblogging company would be happy about such an arrangement .
The San Francisco company 's top two executives , Evan Williams and Biz Stone , live in SF and Berkeley , respectively , and show every sign of having absorbed the Bay Area 's left - field , anti-establishment culture .
Of course , the men are also capitalists with a startup to get rich off .
But federal monitoring looks no better from that vantage : Twitter has trouble enough running its servers without worrying about maintaining some kind of firehose tap ; the company 's techno - elite and Hollywood users , meanwhile , would surely lash back hard at cooperation with the NSA , a risky proposition for a young company that has yet to turn a profit .
Whether the Valley lunch chatter is accurate or not , Twitter is bound to interact more and more with law enforcement as the volume of direct messages goes up and as public Twitter streams are woven deeper into people 's sometimes tumultuous lives .
The takeaway for users is even more straightforward :
If the NSA or your local police department might get the wrong idea about you message , do n't put it anywhere on Twitter .
The only truly direct message goes from one person 's mouth to another 's ear .
And even that can end up on the internet .
( Speaking of which :
If you 've heard anything about this , we 'd love to hear from you . )
UPDATE : Twitter co-founder Biz Stone writes :
There is absolutely no element of truth to this allegation whatsoever .

Author : stephanc # Views : 29647 Printer Friendly ...
Abstract Microsoft Windows is vulnerable to remote code execution in GDI32.dll ( Graphical Device Interface ) .
This vulnerability was assigned Microsoft security bulletin MS06 - 001 Vulnerability in Graphics Rendering Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution ( 912919 ) .
An exploit containing this vulnerability was found in the wild by Websense Security Labs on 12/27/2005 .
This vulnerability was exploited in the wild as early as 12/15/2005 to install various malicious programs .
In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability , an attacker is only required to lure the victim to an infected website .
The number of websites currently hosting malicious code has steadily increased since the exploit was made public .
In this article , Stephan Chenette walks through the disassembly of GDI32.dll , providing a detailed analysis of the code flow leading to the vulnerability .
Readers are expected to be familiar with x86 assembly instructions to follow this document .
Summary
Windows Meta Files ( WMF ) files contain GDI commands / functions in the form of meta records .
The malicious code is executed by using a special meta record called a " SetAbortProc " escape metafile record .
This record instructs GDI32.dll to execute arbitrary user - supplied code .
This vulnerability is unique in that it is not a standard security vulnerability , such as a buffer or integer overflow .
This vulnerability is triggered because the WMF file can contain error handling code directly located in a special escape meta record that GDI32.dll will execute .
Exploit code was publicly published for this vulnerability on 12/28/2005 .
A third - party patch was provided 12/31/2005 and Microsoft addressed this vulnerability with the release of MS06-001 on 01/05/2006 .
A number of public exploit generators have been released that allow malicious WMF files to be created with little programming knowledge .
An explanation of the disassembled code is found below .
Technical Details
GDI32.dll ( 5.1.2600.2770 ) was disassembled on Windows XP SP2 using Interactive Disassembler ( IDA ) v4.9 .
The execution path begins with a call to gdi32 _PlayMetaFile , which will then call CommonEnumMetaFile to enumerate all meta records in the WMF file .
CommonEnumMetaFile then calls gdi32 _PlayMetaFileRecord on each meta record to retrieve the meta record information .
Each record contains a record size , a function code , and a variable number of function parameters .
gdi32_PlayMetaFileRecord sets the higher 8 bits of every function code to zero for each meta record ( i.e. 0x626 becomes 0x26 ) .
If the new function code is 0x26 , PlayIntoAMetafile will be called .
gdi32_PlayMetaFileRecord then checks the escape code , the first function parameter .
gdi32_Escape will be called if the escape code is anything other than 0x0 F ( for example : 0x09 ) .
If the escape code is 0x09 , gdi32_SetAbortProc will be called to retrieve the GDI entry from the GDISharedHandleTable and set pUserInfo ->0x14 for that GDI entry to the address of the abort function , which is also supplied as a parameter .
Upon enumeration of the next record , CommonEnumMetaFile will check to see if pUserInfo ->0x14 was set from the analysis of the last meta record .
If an address was set at this offset , that address will be called and executed .
This address points to arbitrary user - supplied code within the WMF file .

The extradition of the Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon seems almost certain now that the high court has dismissed two claims for judicial review .
The only person who can save him is the home secretary , Alan Johnson , and on current form it seems unlikely that he will prevent McKinnon being taken to the states to face a penalty of up to 60 years in jail .
The issues here do not turn on McKinnon 's guilt ; he admits that he broke American law by hacking the computers belonging to the US army , US navy , US air force , department of defence and Nasa and leaving messages in their databases .
Rather they concern his mental condition and the unacceptable inequity in the extradition arrangements between the US and Britain .
The 2003 extradition treaty , made at the height of the " war on terror " to facilitate the rapid conveyance of terrorists to US courts , means that suspects in America are 20 % less likely to be extradited to Britain than Britons are to America .
The law is a product of its time and of Tony Blair 's hopeless infatuation with George Bush .
The checks and balances built into the system to protect British defendants were swept aside with the government 's usual contemptible lack of regard for individual rights , justice and proportionality .
Since the act became law in 2003 , just one terrorist has been extradited while over 55 British defendants have been forced to submit to the often crude and vindictive criminal justice system of the United States .
Sixty years for a rather hopeless individual who believes in UFOs is obviously absurd , and British law should have the ability to ensure that a citizen is not exposed to harsher treatment in America , then Americans accused of the same crime would face here .
Labour 's failure to support that principle in a vote for the review of the treaty – just 10 Labour MPs voted for it – was responsible for Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay 's announcement that he had decided to stand down at the next election .
It is difficult not to share his disdain for the governing party : not only is it responsible for this shoddy law , it will take no action to correct a glaring injustice .
" It 's not only his extradition , which is unfair , but this treaty has been implemented by the government without proper discussion in parliament , " MacKinlay said .
" Many of my colleagues expressed sympathy with Mr McKinnon , but they allowed themselves to be dominated by the party whips .
This is one of the deficiencies of parliament . "
Over 100 MPs of all parties have campaigned against the treaty and McKinnon 's extradition , and the Daily Mail has waded in with a very effective campaign , yet the government remains heedless of the desire to see fairness and equality returned to our legal relationship with the US .
It is ludicrous that American prosecutors have only to supply details of a charge to a British magistrates court to trigger extradition , while British lawyers have to provide evidence in a court to support a similar request .
MPs told the government six years ago that it " could not have done a better job of failing to represent the interests of British citizens " .
At the time Liberal Democrat MP David Heath said , " We expect the British government to protect and preserve the interests of British citizens , just as we would expect the American government to do the same for their citizens . "
That argument may appeal to President Obama .
Today 40 MPs have sent him a letter pointing out the unfairness of the arrangements and highlighting McKinnon 's Asperger 's syndrome .
This law is a relic of the Bush - Blair madness .
Surely it is time for Gordon Brown and Alan Johnson to forgo the need for this rather humiliating appeal and step in to help McKinnon .

DETROIT �( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Chevrolet Volt , GM 's electric car that 's expected to go on sale in late 2010 , is projected to get an estimated 230 miles per gallon , the automaker announced Tuesday .
That exceptionally high government mileage rating could give the Volt a major boost .
For the first time , car buyers will easily be able to compare electric cars with ordinary gas - powered cars .
" Having a car that gets triple - digit fuel economy can and will be a game changer for us , " said GM CEO Fritz Henderson .
Determining fuel economy for an electric car is a tricky matter .
While General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) has been working with the Environmental Protection Agency for years on the issue , the agency says it has not tested a Chevy Volt and therefore cannot confirm the fuel economy values claimed by GM .
50 mpg ? or 5,000 ?
Basically , you will be able to drive the Volt for about 40 miles using the lithium - ion batteries .
For those driving less than that , gas mileage is essentially unlimited .
It is only after 40 miles that the Volt will start using gas .
" Most Volt drivers will operate on a daily basis without having to use a single drop of gas , " said Henderson , saying that three out of four drivers travel 40 miles or less a day .
Fuel economy for hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius is displayed in the same way as it is for any other gasoline - powered vehicle .
It gets 46 mpg , for example , versus 19 mpg for a V - 6 Ford Mustang .
That standard works because all the energy used by the Prius ultimately comes from burning gasoline .
The Prius just uses that energy more efficiently than other cars do .
The Chevrolet Volt , on other hand , runs on electricity that comes from two sources -- a battery as well as a gasoline engine .
When gasoline is providing the power , the Volt might get as much as 50 mpg .
But that mpg figure would not take into account that the car has already gone 40 miles with no gas at all .
So let 's say the car is driven 50 miles in a day .
For the first 40 miles , no gas is used and during the last 10 miles , 0.2 gallons are used .
That 's the equivalent of 250 miles per gallon .
But , if the driver continues on to 80 miles , total fuel economy would drop to about 100 mpg .
And if the driver goes 300 miles , the fuel economy would be just 62.5 mpg .
The Volt will need to be plugged in at night to recharge .
The company said it estimates it will need 8 kilowatt hours for the recharge necessary to travel 40 miles .
That should cost a total of about 40 cents at off - peak electricity rates in Detroit , Henderson said .
National figures from the Department of Energy suggest most consumers would pay more than that , probably around 88 cents per recharge .
Even at those modest recharging costs , and limited use of gasoline , it will be difficult for the Volt to save money for their owners , according to auto sales service Edmunds.com .
" Even if the Volt 's fuel savings could possibly be as dramatic as today 's numbers suggest , the expected purchase price will be much higher than that of existing hybrids , and it will take years to pay off its price premium , " notes Edmunds.com senior analyst Jessica Caldwell .
Making -- and selling -- the Volt
The fuel efficiency rating is based on the EPA 's proposed methodology which GM used in its
Volt tests and applies to city driving only .
Henderson said GM is confident that when Volt 's combined city / highway mileage average is calculated , it will be over 100 mpg .
But GM is obviously focused on the 230 mpg estimate as part of its early marketing campaign for the vehicle .
It unveiled a logo with the number 230 , with the zero looking like a cross between a smiley face and electrical plug .
Edmunds officials said they have doubts about the assumptions used to achieve the lofty fuel economy estimate .
" For most people , it is not realistic to expect that kind of mileage in real world driving , " said Michelle Krebs , a senior analyst .
But Krebs said the Volt is likely to get achieve significantly better fuel economy than current offerings , such as the Toyota Prius that gets an estimated 50 mpg .
GM started pre-production of the car in June is making about 10 a month .
" Volt is becoming very real , very fast , " Henderson said .
Henderson conceded the cost of building a Volt will be expensive , about $ 40,000 per vehicle .
But he said the vehicle will qualify for a $ 7,500 tax credit , which will reduce the vehicle cost by that amount for consumers .
He also stressed that GM has not set the pricing for the Volt , and conceded the company may have to subsidize the vehicle .
The goal : Make enough sales to move the Volt from " first generation " to lower - cost future designs .
" The cost of the vehicle in the first generation is high , " he said .
GM has not given sales targets for the first year , other than to say it will sell only thousands in the first year , and tens of thousands after that .

10 Photographs That Changed the World
Photography can take us places , we ’ve never been before , perhaps never dreamed of .
There are some photographs that will make you stop and think .
These 10 photographs stopped the world and people hold their breaths for a few seconds to take it all in .
The Photograph That Raised the Photojournalistic Stakes :
“ Omaha Beach , Normandy , France ” Robert Capa , 1944
“ If your pictures are n’t good enough , ” war photographer Robert Capa used to say , “ you are n’t close enough . ”
Words to die by , yes , but the man knew of what he spoke .
After all , his most memorable shots were taken on the morning of D - Day , June 6 , 1944 , when he landed alongside the first waves of infantry at Omaha Beach .
Caught under heavy fire , Capa dove for what little cover he could find , then shot all the film in his camera , and got out – just barely .
He escaped with his life , but not much else .
Of the four rolls of film Capa took of the horrific D - Day battle , all but 11 exposures were ruined by an overeager lab assistant , who melted the film in his rush to develop it .
( He was trying to meet the deadline for the next issue of Life magazine . )
In an ironic twist , however , that same mistake gave the few surviving exposures their famously surreal look ( ” slightly out of focus , ” Life incorrectly explained upon printing them ) .
More than 50 years later , director Steven Spielberg would go to great lengths to reproduce the look of that “ error ” for his harrowing D - Day landing sequence in “ Saving Private Ryan , ” even stripping the coating from his camera lenses to echo Capa ’s notorious shots .
The Photograph That Gave a Face to the Great Depression
“ Migrant Mother ” Dorothea Lange , 1936
As era-defining photographs go , “ Migrant Mother ” pretty much takes the cake .
For many , Florence Owens Thompson is the face of the Great Depression , thanks to legendary educated and apprenticed photojournalist Dorothea Lange .
Lange captured the image while visiting a dusty California pea-pickers ’ camp in February 1936 , and in doing so , captured the resilience of a proud nation facing desperate times .
Unbelievably , Thompson ’s story is as compelling as her portrait .
Just 32 years old when Lange approached her ( ” as if drawn by a magnet , ” Lange said ) .
Thompson was a mother of seven who ’d lost her husband to tuberculosis .
Stranded at a migratory labor farm in Nipomo , Calif .
her family sustained themselves on birds killed by her kids and vegetables taken from a nearby field – as meager a living as any earned by the other 2,500 workers there .
The photo ’s impact was staggering .
Reproduced in newspapers everywhere , Thompson ’s haunted face triggered an immediate public outcry , quickly prompting politicos from the federal Resettlement Administration to send food and supplies .
Sadly , however , Thompson and her family had already moved on , receiving nary a wedge of government cheese for their high - profile misery .
In fact , no one knew the identity of the photographed woman until Thompson revealed herself years later in a 1976 newspaper article .
The Photograph That Brought the Battlefield Home
“ Federal Dead on the Field of Battle of First Day , Gettysburg , Pennsylvania ” Mathew Brady , 1863
As one of the world ’s first war photographers , Mathew Brady did n’t start
out having as action - packed a career as you might think .
A successful daguerreotypist and a distinguished gentleman , Brady was known for his portraits of notable people such as Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee .
In other words , he was hardly a photojournalist in the trenches .
In fact , Brady had everything to lose by making a career move – his money , his business , and quite possibly his life .
Nevertheless , he decided to risk it all and follow the Union Army into battle with his camera , saying , “ A spirit in my feet said , ‘ Go ! ’ ”
And go he did – at least until he got a good look at the pointy end of a Confederate bayonet .
After narrowly escaping capture at the first Battle of Bull Run , Brady ’s chatty feet quieted down a bit , and he began sending assistants in his place .
In the span of only a few years , Brady and his team shot more than 7,000 photographs – an astounding number when you consider that developing a single plate required a horse - drawn - wagon - full of cumbersome equipment and noxious chemicals .
Not exactly what you ’d call “ point - and - shoot . ”
Tethered as he was to his equine - powered darkroom and with film speeds being much slower then , Brady produced war photos that are understandably light on the action and heavy on the aftermath .
Still , they mark the first time Americans were so immediately confronted with the grim realities of the battlefield .
The Photograph That Ended a War But Ruined a Life
“ Murder of a Vietcong by Saigon Police Chief ” Eddie Adams , 1968
“ Still photographs are the most powerful weapon in the world , ” AP photojournalist Eddie Adams once wrote .
A fitting quote for Adams , because his 1968 photograph of an officer shooting a handcuffed prisoner in the head at point - blank range not only earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1969 , but also went a long way toward souring Americans ’ attitudes about the Vietnam War .
For all the image ’s political impact , though , the situation was n’t as black - and - white as it ’s rendered .
What Adams ’ photograph does n’t reveal is that the man being shot was the captain of a Vietcong “ revenge squad ” that had executed dozens of unarmed civilians earlier the same day .
Regardless , it instantly became an icon of the war ’s savagery and made the official pulling the trigger – General Nguyen Ngoc Loan – its iconic villain .
Sadly , the photograph ’s legacy would haunt Loan for the rest of his life .
Following the war , he was reviled where ever he went .
After an Australian VA hospital refused to treat him , he was transferred to the United States , where he was met with a massive ( though unsuccessful ) campaign to deport him .
He eventually settled in Virginia and opened a restaurant but was forced to close it down as soon as his past caught up with him .
Vandals scrawled “ we know who you are ” on his walls , and business dried up .
Adams felt so bad for Loan that he apologized for having taken the photo at all , admitting , “ The general killed the Vietcong ; I killed the general with my camera . ”
The Photograph That Is n’t as Romantic as You Might Think
“ V- J Day , Times Square , 1945 ″ , a.k.a .
“ The Kiss ” Alfred Eisenstaedt , 1945
On August 14 , 1945 , the news of Japan ’s surrender was announced in the United States , signaling the end of World War II .
Riotous celebrations erupted in the streets , but perhaps none were more relieved than those in uniform .
Although many of them had recently returned from victory in
Europe , they faced the prospect of having to ship out yet again , this time to the bloody Pacific .
Among the overjoyed masses gathered in Times Square that day was one of the most talented photojournalists of the 20th century , a German immigrant named Alfred Eisenstaedt .
While snapping pictures of the celebration , he spotted a sailor “ running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight . ”
He later explained that , “ whether she was a grandmother , stout , thin , old , did n’t make any difference . ”
Of course , a photo of the sailor planting a wet one on a senior citizen would n’t have made the cover of Life , but when he locked lips with an attractive nurse , the image was circulated in newspapers across the country .
Needless to say , “ V - J Day ” did n’t capture a highly anticipated embrace by long - lost lovers , but it also was n’t staged , as many critics have claimed .
In any case , the image remains an enduring symbol of America ’s exuberance at the end of a long struggle .
The Photograph That Destroyed an Industry
“ Hindenburg ” Murray Becker , 1937
Forget the Titanic , the Lusitania , and the comparatively unphotogenic accident at Chernobyl .
Thanks to the power of images , the explosion of the Hindenburg on May 6 , 1937 , claims the dubious honor of being the quintessential disaster of the 20th century .
In the grand scheme of things , however , the Hindenburg was n’t all that disastrous .
Of the 97 people aboard , a surprising 62 survived .
( in fact , it was n’t even the worst Zeppelin crash of the 20th century .
Just four years earlier , the U.S.S. Akron had crashed into the Atlantic killing more than twice as many people . )
But when calculating the epic status of a catastrophe , terrifying photographs and quotable quotes ( ” Oh , the humanity ! ” ) far outweigh body counts .
Assembled as part of a massive PR campaign by the Hindenburg ’s parent company in Germany , no fewer than 22 photographers , reporters , and newsreel cameramen were on the scene in Lakehurst , N.J. when the airship went down .
Worldwide publicity of the well - documented disaster shattered the public ’s faith in Zeppelins , which were , at the time , considered the safest mode of air travel available .
During the 1920s and 1930s , Zeppelins had operated regular flights , totting civilians back and forth between Germany and the Americas .
But all of that stopped in 1937 .
The incident effectively killed the use of dirigibles as a commercially viable mode of passenger transport , ending the golden age of the airship not with a whimper , but with a horrific bang that was photographed and then syndicated around the globe .
The Photograph That Saved the Planet
“ The Tetons – Snake River ” Ansel Adams , 1942
Some claim photography can be divided into two eras : Before Adams and After Adams .
In Times B.A. , for instance , photography was n’t widely considered an art form .
Rather , photographers attempted to make their pictures more “ artistic ” ( i.e. , more like paintings ) by subjecting their exposures to all sorts of extreme manipulations , from coating their lenses with petroleum jelly to scratching the surfaces of their negatives with needles .
Then came Ansel Adams , helping shutterbugs everywhere get over their collective inferiority complex .
Brashly declaring photography to be “ a blazing poetry of the real , ” Adams eschewed manipulations , claiming they were simply derivative of other art forms .
Instead , he preached the value of “ pure photography . ”
In an era when handheld point - and - shoot cameras were quickly becoming the norm , Adams and other landscape photographers clung to their bulky , old - fashioned large - format cameras .
Ultimately , Adams ’ pictures turned photography into fine art .
What ’s more , they shaped the way Americans thought of their nation ’s wilderness and , with that , how to preserve it .
Adams ’ passion for the land was n’t limited to vistas he framed through the lens .
In 1936 , he accompanied his photos to Washington to lobby for the preservation of the Kings Canyon area in California .
Sure enough , he was successful , and it was declared a national park .
The Photograph That Kept Che Alive
“ The Corpse of Che Guevara ” Freddy Alborta , 1967
Sociopathic thug ?
Socialist luminary ?
Or as existentialist Jean - Paul Sartre called him , “ the most complete human being of our age ” ?
Whatever you believe , there ’s no denying that Ernesto “ Che ” Guevara has become the patron saint of revolutionaries .
Undeniably , he is a man of mythical status – a reputation that persists less because of how he lived than because of how he died .
Unenthused by his efforts to incite revolution among the poor and oppressed in Bolivia , the nation ’s army ( trained and equipped by the U.S. military and the CIA ) captured and executed Guevara in 1967 .
But before dumping his body in a secret grave , they gathered around for a strategic photo op .
They wanted to prove to the world that Che was dead , in hopes that his political movement would die with him .
in fact , anticipating charges that the photo had been faked , Che ’s thoughtful captors amputated his hands and preserved them in formaldehyde .
But by killing the man , Bolivian officials unwittingly birthed his legend .
The photo , which circulated around the world , bore a striking resemblance to Renaissance paintings of Christ taken down from the cross .
Even as
Che ’s killers preened and gloated above him ( the officer on the right seems to be inadvertently pointing to a wound on Guevara ’s body near where Christ ’s final wound was inflicted ) ,
Che ’s eerily peaceful face was described as showing forgiveness .
The photo ’s allegorical significance certainly was n’t lost on the revolutionary protesters of the era .
They quickly adopted “ Che lives ! ” as a slogan and rallying cry .
Thanks to this photograph , “ the passion of the Che ” ensured that he would live on forever as a martyr for the socialist cause .
The Photograph that Allowed Geniuses to Have a Sense of Humor
“ Einstein with his Tongue Out ” Arthur Sasse , 1951
You may appreciate this memorable portrait as much as the next fellow , but it ’s still fair to wonder : “ Did it really change history ? ”
Rest assured , we think it did .
While Einstein certainly changed history with his contributions to nuclear physics and quantum mechanics , this photo changed the way history looked at Einstein .
By humanizing a man known chiefly for his brilliance , this image is the reason Einstein ’s name has become synonymous not only with “ genius , ” but also with “ wacky genius . ”
So why the history - making tongue ?
It seems Professor Einstein , hoping to enjoy his 72nd birthday in peace , was stuck on the Princeton campus enduring incessant hounding by the press .
Upon being prodded to smile for the camera for what seemed like the millionth time , he gave photographer Arthur Sasse a good look at his uvula instead .
This being no ordinary tongue , the resulting photo became an instant classic , thus ensuring that the distinguished Nobel Prize - winner would be remembered as much for his personality as for his brain .
The Photograph That Made the Surreal Real
“ Dalí Atomicus ” Philippe Halsman , 1948
Philippe Halsman is quite possibly the only photographer to have made a career out of taking portraits of people jumping .
But he claimed the act of leaping revealed his subjects ’ true selves , and looking at his most famous jump , “ Dalí Atomicus , ” it ’s pretty hard to disagree .
The photograph is Halsman ’s homage both to the new atomic age ( prompted by physicist ’ then - recent announcement that all matter hangs in a constant state of suspension ) and to Dalí ’s surrealist masterpiece “ Leda Atomica ” ( seen on the right , behind the cats , and unfinished at the time ) .
It took six hours , 28 jumps , and a roomful of assistants throwing angry cats and buckets of water into the air to get the perfect exposure .
But before settling on the “ Atomicus ” we know today , Halsman rejected a number of other concepts for the shot .
One was the idea of throwing milk instead of water , but that was abandoned for fear that viewers , fresh from the privations of World War II , would condemn it as a waste of milk .
Another involved exploding a cat in order to capture it “ in suspension , ” though that arguably would have been a waste of cats .
Halsman ’s methods were as unique as they were effective .
His celebrity “ jump ” portraits appeared on at least seven Life magazine covers and helped usher in a new – and radically more adventurous – era of portrait photography .
It may become a criminal offence to infringe on " historical memory " about WWII
By James Rodgers
BBC News
What is worrying Russia ?
Why is the country convinced that it is the victim of a campaign to make it look bad ?
President Dmitry Medvedev recently announced the setting up of a commission to counter the falsification of history .
He said this was becoming increasingly " severe , evil , and aggressive " .
Dmitry Medvedev believes there is an anti-Russian bias in the Western media " This is absolute poppycock , " says Robert Service , professor of Russian History at Oxford University .
" History is all about argument .
There is no absolute historical truth about anything big in history . "
Mr Service dismisses the Russian leader 's suggestion that his country is facing some kind of academic aggression .
Instead , he sees a desire to dominate , worthy of the most repressive totalitarian regimes of fiction .
" President Medvedev , following in the path of his predecessor President [ Vladimir ] Putin , wants to control history , " he says .
" And he wants to control history as a means of controlling the present .
This is the classic George Orwell scenario . "
' Hysterical reaction ' Many Russians , though , agree with their president .
Natalia Narochnitskaya , a former deputy in the Russian parliament and now a member of the new Historical Truth Commission , says that she is surprised by what she terms the " almost hysterical reaction " in the West .
" In the Western media especially , there is a certain prejudice against Russia and Russian history , " she says .
" They always feel that Russia since , you know , Ivan the Terrible , is a certain country which is off the European civilisation . "
In August there will be such a yelling about the Molotov - Ribbentrop pact , saying that that was the step that led to the Second World War
Natalia Narochnitskaya , member of the Historical Truth Commission
Ask a few more questions , though , and these two apparently separate views begin to converge .
At least , they agree on what the key issue is - World War II .
And here lies the clue as to the real reason for the establishment of the new commission .
This is what appears to anger today 's Russian historical establishment : accounts of Red Army crimes on the march to Berlin ; assertions by the Baltic countries and others in Eastern Europe that Soviet forces came as occupiers as much as liberators ; any suggestion that Stalin 's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were anything but complete opposites and bitter enemies .
Here , perhaps , there is a clue as to the timing of the commission 's founding .
Next month sees the 70th anniversary of the non-aggression pact between the USSR and Hitler 's Germany , something Ms Narochnitskaya expects the West to make a lot of noise about .
" In August there will be such a yelling about the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact , saying that that was the step that led to the Second World War , and that Germany and the Soviet Union were two equal , disgusting , totalitarian monsters . "
Nationalist sentiment
Why does this matter today ?
Do these arguments have any great importance beyond the walls of universities ?
In Russia , the answer is yes .
So many people are speaking about strong , Orthodox Russia , military power ...
The commission is partly a response to this atmosphere
Tamara Eidelman
Moscow history teacher
The country sees its victory over Hitler 's forces as the greatest moment of the 20th Century .
The war is sometimes discussed in the news media as if it were a recent event , not increasingly distant history .
Any attempt to tarnish the glory of that triumph is seen as a deliberate attempt to make Russia look bad .
Russia 's past haunts its present .
Recognising that , the authorities want to rule the version of the past which dominates today .
Tamara Eidelman , who teaches history at a Moscow High School , feels surrounded by nationalist sentiment .
" So many people are speaking about strong , Orthodox Russia , military power , " she says .
The authorities want to rule the version of the past which dominates today " It is something that is very strong in historical tradition and in popular opinion .
This commission is partly a response to this atmosphere . "
The creation of this commission seems to go to the heart of what troubles modern Russia .
The chaos which followed the collapse of communism left many Russians deeply distrustful of politics and officialdom .
President Medvedev has complained of the corruption and " legal nihilism " which plague his country .
Russia 's leaders today know that they need this shining , sacred , memory of victory to give their people something to believe in .
In the near future , it may even be backed up in law .
The Russian parliament is on its summer break at the moment , but legislation is being considered - legislation that would make it a criminal offence to " infringe on historical memory in relation to events which took place in the Second World War " .

Summary
Limited distribution report on pandemic vaccines was prepared for the WHO in early 2009 , shortly before the emergence of swine flu .
It details tough problems that most of the world 's governments face in acquiring adequate supplies of pandemic flu vaccines , as well as the problems caused by the patent claims of huge corporations .
Possibly because of the frank presentation and potential controversy , the WHO designated the paper " Limited Distribution " , meaning it has only been available to select government officials in paper form .
This scanned version makes the paper available electronically and to the general public for the first time .
This is an intergovernmental organization document with no " primary country " of origin .
India has been selected as the WHO Regional Office that published the paper is based there .

As a result of concerns raised over the sharing of influenza viruses and the lack of affordable vaccines and medicines , the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness ( PIP ) Intergovernmental Meeting ( IGM ) is discussing the possible establishment of a new system for sharing of potentially pandemic influenza viruses , a well as sharing of the benefits resulting from research s utilizing them .
Among the possible benefits being discussed is expanded transfer of vaccine - related technology to developing countries , and a sustainable financing mechanism for developing country pandemic preparedness .
WHO Member States hope that this financing and technology transfer would help close the gap between pandemic vaccine supply and demand .
But what specific technological approaches are best suited for developing countries ?
Influenza vaccine technologies need to be categorized and assessed for their costlbenefit implications and respective tradeoffs and risks .
Not all technologies are freely available or equally easy to use , so this codbenefit assessment needs to be made in the light of the constraints imposed by intellectual property claims as well as " hard " technology and know - how requirements .
Other important considerations , including export controls and regulation of biotechnology , remain underexplored , but may influence decisions by developing countries with respect to a possible PIP IGM benefit sharing system .
This paper discusses these issues in five sections .
Section I provides a short background .
Section II describes briefly the main technologies that are currently available or that are under development , as well as their comparative advantages and potential challenges1 .
Section
Ill discusses a number of cross-cutting issues of practical significance ( adjuvants , conditions related to seed strains , public perception of some of the technologies , and export controls ) that lie outside the production - related questions , but that nevertheless need to be addressed .
Section IV considers various options .
Finally , Section V contains some concluding remarks . '
A table summarizing key features of the various technologies is attached as Annex 1 .
� A discussion paper Background Ensuring adequate availability of pandemic influenza vaccines is not an easy task in any country of the world , and no single solution will be universally appropriate .
Limited global production capacity for human influenza vaccines is the result of limited demand for seasonal influenza vaccines and technical challenges to influenza vaccine production .
Adding to the difficulty is a recent sharp increase in patents and patent applications related to influenza vaccines , which may impede access to vaccine production technologies .
Pandemic preparedness efforts cannot be considered in isolation from other public health concerns and must be weighed in the context of programmes to address other priorities , complementing them when possible .
For example , the infrastructure to produce some types of influenza vaccine is useful for making other kinds of vaccines , yet paradoxically , the flu vaccine technologies that are most adaptable may be the most expensive and technologically - challengingto utilize , as well as the most impacted by intellectual property claims .
Some have proposed to expand seasonal influenza vaccination in order to expand pandemic production capacity .
This strategy is a key part of the WHO Global Action Plan ( GAP ) , whose overarching goal is to increase pandemic influenza vaccine supply by stimulating demand for seasonal influenza vaccines .
Greater seasonal demand , it is reasoned , will stimulate the private sector and others to construct additional influenza vaccine production capacity that can then be used in a pandemic .
But in many countries , and especially developing countries , there is low demand for seasonal flu vaccines and limited prospects of expanding it , particularly among citizens in lower economic strata with competing health - care priorities .
The cost of implementing the GAP , even with optimistic economic and antigen assumptions , is estimated to rise to US $ 3.5 billion to US $ 5 billion annually by 2012 , with an emphasis on spending in developed countries to stimulate demand there , and the questionable assumption that excess pandemic vaccine will quickly be used to vaccinate those in other countries .

Page 2 � Observat ions on Vaccine Production technologies and Factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Develooine Countries
It is unwise not to squarely recognize the limitations on seasonal influenza vaccine demand and the great challenges facing the GAP .
Even in developed countries where demand and income are higher , and despite hefty economic stimuli , manufacturers currently are hesitant to expand production capacity .
This is in large part due to limited seasonal vaccine demand .
For instance , a large European manufacturer recently backed out of an agreement to build an influenza vaccine facility in the United States because it said that a US $ 298 million government subsidy was in~ufficient . ~
Others have proposed emergency conversion of animal vaccine plants if a pandemic strikes , particularly of poultry vaccine facilities with egg - based production systems that probably can be adapted to produce human influenza vaccine .
With global human influenza vaccine production capacity at least 70 % short of providing vaccination for the global population within six months of a pandemicI4 this suggestion makes obvious sense .
Where such capacity exists , this could expand pandemic vaccine supply , but there are significant technical and safety hurdles .
Another strategy that has been proposed is to concentrate vaccine antigen production in a small number of developed countries , on the theory that making vaccine antigen is best done in a few expert facilities and that , if these facilities are collectively made large enough , their surplus production can be exported to developing countries in the event of a pandemic .
Yet this strategy , encouraged by the WHO GAP , leaves developing countries in a state of dependency and at the end of the queue to receive vaccine .
All of the above factors , together with mounting pressure on health budgets as a result of the global economic downturn , make ensuring availability of influenza vaccines particularly difficult for most developing countries .
Several studies have recently discussed options for expanding prepandemic and pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity .
A number of these reports are listed in the annex to this report .
While these are valuable and discuss some technical aspects of influenza vaccines in greater detail , there are key issues related to pandemic vaccination strategies that remain under - contextualized for policy - makers .
This paper seeks to fill that gap .

Page 3 � A discussion oaoer
This paper assumes that developing countries will largely not be satisfied with reliance on pandemic vaccines and / or bulk antigen exported from Europe , North America , or Japan , particularly because such supplies currently cannot be made available in a timely fashion .
Therefore is difficult to argue that such reliance is an adequate pandemic vaccine supply plan .
Rather , here it is presumed that developing countries will continue to seek the development of national or regional ' vaccine production capacity through technology transfer and sharing of benefits of influenza research .
2 . Overview of influenza vaccine production technologies
There are a variety of technologies that are used or have been proposed for production of human influenza vaccines .
Often , significant parts of the production process are similar .
This is especially true in the later stages of manufacture , such as packaging .
The technologies may be categorized in several ways .
Below , they have been divided into four basic technological approaches .
Classic influenza vaccine produced in eggs
With few exceptions , currently available seasonal and prepandemic influenza vaccines are manufactured through egg - based production methods .
The system is cumbersome and inefficient in comparison to the theoretical possibilities of newer cell - based production ( see below ) , leading some to characterize egg - based production as antiquated .
Such comparisons , however , are invariably made against technologies that have yet to be fully commercially deployed and proven .
Moreover , although it may not be new , this decades - old technology is relatively cheap , very well proven , and largely unencumbered by intellectual property claims .
Egg - based production is employed throughout the world for animal and human vaccines .
Apart from influenza , however , the only human vaccines for which the egg - based system is utilized are yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccine .
This means that apart from making flu vaccine , egg - based production lines have limited broader utility for human public health . '
Egg - based lines arc important for animal heakh , however , as discussed below .
Page 4 � Observations on Vaccine Production Technologies and Factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Developing Countries Egg - based production requires a supply of fertile chicken eggs produced under relatively stringent conditions ( in comparison to eggs produced for food consumption ) .
This is to ensure that they do not carry pathogens that might taint the vaccine .
The eggs are infected with a vaccine strain and the fluid harvested from them yields vaccine after separation and further production steps .
The reluctance of H5 viruses to grow to high titer in eggs ( because the virus strains are too efficient at killing chicken embryos ) is a problem that has bedeviled H5 vaccine development .
While this remains a significant technical challenge , the problems with growing H5 viruses in eggs are being overcome , mainly by attenuating the hemagglutinin ( HA ) gene of the vaccine strain , typically through reverse genetics ( see below ) .
It may be noted that some of these techniques are proprietary however .
Major requirements of the egg - based production system include the process of " candling " the eggs ( inspection under bright light ) ; equipment to inoculate the eggs with virus ; incubators in which to keep the eggs while the virus is reproducing ; and equipment to harvest , separate , and purify the vaccine virus after incubation .
Some of the technology required to produce the vaccine strain is specialized ; however , none of it is reported to be particularly expensive , complicated or difficult to operate .
In the newest facilities the entire process is automated , while in others some steps in production ( for example , candling and harvesting ) are conducted by human technicians .
Later steps of egg - based vaccine production , including formulation and packaging , may be similar or identical to the process used with other technologies .
Live attenuated influenza vaccine Live attenuated influenza vaccine , abbreviated " LAIV " , is an influenza vaccine production technology in limited commercial use in the Russian Federation and in the United States .
LAIV offers the possibility of producing significantly more vaccine than classic egg - based production using same production line ; however there are significant additional scientific and intellectual property hurdles that may reduce LAIVis attraction for developing countries .
Page 5 � A discussion oaner
The production process for LAIV vaccines is similar to that of classic egg - based vaccines , with some notable exceptions .
LAIVs are administered live .
This means that when the vaccine strain - containing fluid is harvested from eggs , it is not exposed to a detergent .
Thus , if adventitious pathogens are present in the eggs , these may survive the formulation process and eventually infect human vaccine recipients .
Therefore , eggs used in LAIV production may require even higher production standards than those used to produce classic killed vaccine .
This increased danger of contamination means biosafety practices in production need to be more stringent than those used for classic killed vaccine .
While there are a number of well - characterized backbone strains6 available for classic vaccines , the " cold- adapted " ' backbones used in LAIVs are proprietary , such as the " Ann Arbor " strain used in the United States and the " Leningrad " strain used in the Russian Federation .
LAIVs thus require a proprietary backbone strain6 and cannot be produced using the vaccine seeds strains currently distributed by WHO global influenza surveillance network ( which do not have " cold- adapted " backbones ) .
Harvesting is simpler for LAIVs ( no detergent wash is needed ) , but the final product is more delicate because the live vaccine must be kept viable " alive " ) until it is used .
This means LAIVs require cold storage .
The fact that LAIVs are not killed potentially offers a major advantage over classic vaccine , but at a cost .
LAIVs reproduce in the body of immunized persons ; thus , they effectively act as their own adjuvants , which means they should require a lower dose of antigen than killed vaccine .
This means the same production line may yield considerably more LAIV than classic killed vaccine , although estimates of the increased yield vary widely . '
Influenza vaccines typically are comprised of a ( n ) HA gene (s ) taken from a viral isolate that is inserted into another , laboratory - adaptedstrain by reassortment or recombinant ( reverse genetics ) means .
While the immunogenic HA gene is the most important part of the vaccine , the labadapted strain into which it is placed has typically been selected for useful characteristics for lab and industrial use ( high growth rate , tolerance for lab conditions and temperature ranges , etc ) .
This labadapted strain is called the " backbone " strain .
' " Cold adapted " influenza strains are laboratory - adapted types that are suitable for use in live vaccines , which must be kept cold until use in order to maintain the vaccine 's viability .
'
Discussions to license the Russian " Leningrad " LAIV strains for H5 vaccine production .ire taking place , however , no detailed information concerning the terms and restrictions of any possible license is available , and no final agreement has been reported to have been reached .
'
The WHO CAP estimate is 4.5 times , whereas others have estimated a yield as high as 10 limes that of ' the c:lassic trivalent killed vaccine process .
Page 6 � Observations on Vaccine Production Technologies and Factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in iheloping Countries
One price of this antigen efficiency is that LAIVs are administered as an intranasal aerosol ( i.e. sprayed into the nose ) , rather than being injected .
They thus require a special closer instead of standard syringes .
Sufficient supplies of this doser are required in order to use LAlVs .
Another limitation of LAIVs is that they are unsuitable for prepandemic vaccines because of the possibility that the live prepandemic vaccine strain could mutate or recombine with circulating strains , potentially causing or contributing to a new epidemic or even pandemic flu strain .
While this concern is not applicable to seasonal vaccines ( because of the antigens used ) , it does seriously limit the ability to test LAIV procedures and formulations prior to an actual pandemic .
Of note , in the future it may become practical for LAIVs to be produced in cell culture ( see below ) , although at present they are produced in eggs .
Influenza vaccines from cell culture Influenza vaccines produced by cell culture are currently under development in several places but so far are not produced commercially on a large scale .
In the cell culture process , animal or other cells are infected with a vaccine virus , which is then harvested and formulated into vaccine .
The process takes place in vessels called bioreactors ( or fermenters ) , in basic design not dissimilar from those used in brewing .
Cell culture typically starts by growing cells in a nutrient - rich fluid in small containers , scaling up to larger ones as the cells reproduce .
When the desired cell density and scale is reached ( hundreds or thousands of litres for commercial production ) , the cells are infected with vaccine strain virus .
After the virus reproduces , the cells are harvested and virus processed into vaccine .
In some cell culture systems , gently agitated cells grow freely in a sort of " soup " mixed with nutrients and ( eventually ) with vaccine virus .
In other cell culture systems , the cells grow affixed to a substrate such as tiny gold - coated beads .
They are then released by agitation .
--
Page 7 � A discussion oamr
For large - scale commercial production , the process requires large bioreactors , from hundreds to thousands of litres in size .
Production of cell culture vaccines also requires equipment t o build and maintain a " cell bank " to provide a new supply of fresh identical cells after batches of virus - infected cells are harvested .
Cell culture systems are likely to be more flexible than egg - based systems for production of other human vaccines , potentially increasing a facility 's utility .
For H5 influenza viruses in particular , there are claims of cell culture systems that grow the virus to a higher titer than is possible in eggs .
Although cell culture vaccines are a major focus of research and development ( R&D ) , as yet they remain in limited commercial use .
Scientific limitations for their use in flu vaccines include the inability to be certain ahead of time that a particular cell line will be appropriate to grow the pandemic strain , and the need for substantial bioreactor capacity , of which there is little to no global surplus .
Although investment may be recouped through a multi-use facility , cell culture has considerably higher facility construction costs at an industrial scale .
In addition to potential patent claims over the influenza genes ( which also impact egg - based vaccines ) and backbones used in vaccine strains , there are additional intellectual property issues related to cell culture influenza vaccines .
The cell lines that are used are themselves often patented , and the information necessary for their use and for regulatory approval is proprietary .
Table 1 Examples of proprietary cells lines used in cell culture vaccine production : Avian embryonic stem cells Vivalis ( France ) Licensed to Novartis , GlaxoSmithKline , and others Vero cells per se are not cells ( Vero ) proprietary , but Baxter 's process of using them is .
To date , few cell culture - produced vaccines have been approved for human use , and they are likely to prompt more intense regulatory scrutiny than egg - produced vaccines .
Cell culture vaccines require approval for the vaccine as well as characterization and safety demonstration of the cells used .
Page 8 � Olwervations on Vaccine Production technologies and factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Uwelooinc Count rics Second generation biotech vaccines
If cell culture vaccines , because of their sophisticated biological manufacturing process , may be considered the first generation of biotechnological flu vaccines , then a basket of different technologies currently under development could constitute the second .
While supporters of these technologies believe they may be useful for pandemic influenza vaccines , several of them are at early stages of development and none are proven and ready for commercial use .
Therefore , although it is difficult to generalize about these new technologies , they are unlikely to be selected in the short term for pandemic vaccine production in developed or developing countries .
These technologies depend on the WHO global influenza surveillance network ( GISN ) for antigens and WHO selections of the best antigens for use in vaccines , but do not utilize WHO candidate seed strain .
Taking a longer a view , however , it is possible that some of these technologies , for example virus - like particles ( VLPs ) , may become viable for large - scale use .
The fact that they are new and mainly privately developed , however , means that in general they are heavily covered by intellectual property claims and may require very new kinds of know - how .
For most countries it is too early to tell , however , if national patents will be issued , so the extent of intellectual property impediments for any particular developing country remains unclear .
Briefly , second - generation biotech vaccines include , among other approaches : > production of recombinant HA protein in other , easily grown , organisms ( e.g. transgenic bacteria ) ; > " naked " and plasmid DNA vaccines in which " codon ~ p t i m i z e d ' " flu genes are used directly as vaccine , and ~ >- genetically engineered systems to co-express HA , NA , M2 genes from flu , manufacturing a " virus like particle " ( VLP ) that is purified from culture and used as vaccine .
lo " Codon opiiniized " genes have nucleic acids that have been altered - typically changed from RNA to DNA - so 1h.11 ihe gcnr can be he~terexpressed in a biotechnological application ( e.g. . v,iccinc ' ) .
I Page 9 � A discussion paper Summary of the basic technological approaches to influenza vaccine production 1 . Egg - based " classic " influenza vaccine : Vaccine virus is injected into fertilized eggs .
The eggs are placed in incubators and the virus reproduces in the eggs .
Fluid is then harvested from the eggs and washed with detergent
The resulting killed virus material is separated and used for vaccine formulation .
This type of vaccine is one kind of inactivated ( i.e. killed ) influenza vaccine , or " 11V " .
2 . Live attenuated influenza vaccine ( " LAIV " ) : Vaccine virus is grown in eggs ( or in the future , potentially in cell culture ) in a process similar to classic flu vaccine .
The live virus uses a special type of genetic backbone ( currently of limited availability since they are proprietary ) .
Harvesting and formulation is simpler than with killed vaccines .
The final product is more delicate and requires a cold chain , but the process potentially is considerably more efficient , producing more flu shots with the same number of eggs .
3 . Cell culture influenza vaccines : Mammalian , avian , or other cells are cultured in growth media .
This culture is scaled up to the desired density of cells in large bioreactors ( fermented up to thousands of litres in capacity .
The culture is infected with vaccine strain , which multiplies in the cells , producing large quantities of vaccine virus .
Harvesting , purification and packagingare essentially the same as with egg- based vaccines .
This is another type of IIV , produced by a different method .
4 . " Second generation " biotechnologicalvaccines :
Many techniques are under study , including : producing recombinant HA protein in other , easily grown , organisms ( e.g. transgenic bacteria ) ; " naked * and plasmid DNAvaccines in which " codon optimized " genes are used as vaccine ; and genetically engineered systems to co-expressflu genes , making a virus - like particle ( VLP ) that is used a vaccine .
s Candidate seed strains and antigens
The W H O system develops and distributes candidate H5 vaccine seed strains .
he& seed strain ; are suitable for producing vaccine in eggs and incorporate antigens that have been selected by WHO .
In the event of a pandemic , the W H O system may develop and make available LAIV - suitable seed strains ; however , W H O does not presently have rights to the proprietary LAIV backbones .
Although at a technical level , current W H O candidate seed strains can be used to produce H5 vaccine , there are legal restrictions imposed on them in a required Material Transfer Agreement ( MTA ) .ll
This is because l1 For example , the Material Transfer Agreement for the WHO candidate seed strain NIBRG - 23 , made from an HSN1 strain isolated in Turkey , can be viewed here :
h~p://www.11ibsc.ac.uk~flu_site/Docs/spotlighl/H5N1MTA-NIBRG-23.doc
Page 10 � Observations on Vaccine Production Technologies and Factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influeni'a Vaccine Choices in Developing Countries they are created using proprietary reverse genetics technology .
( See also the discussion on conditions imposed on commercial use of reverse genetics in section Ill below . )
The advantage that the WHO seed strains theoretically offer is that the strain is a known quantity that may be quickly used , reducing the amount of work and time needed for new strains to go into production .
Vaccine makers and other companies , however , may choose not to use WHO candidate seed strains for any of several reasons .
These may include a desire to avoid the intellectual property restrictions imposed by the WHO MTA , or they may wish to use a technology type for which the WHO strain is not suitable ( e.g. LAIVs ) , or they may wish to make other alterations particular to their production system ( for example , to introduce a mutation intended to make the virus grow to higher titer ) .
If a vaccine maker does not use the WHO candidate vaccine seed strain in actual production , however , it is still highly likely to use the antigens selected by the WHO system C SImost immunogenic .
In this case , the maker would obtain the HA ( andlor NA ) gene (s ) from the WHO system or synthesize them from sequence data .
The maker then incorporates the WHO - selected antigenk ) into its own vaccine strain .
Thus , particularly in the future , of arguably even greater importance than the WHO candidate vaccine seed strain are the genes that the WHO system determines to be most suitable for use in vaccines , because these will be used by manufacturers whether or not the manufacturer utilizes the WHO candidate seed strain .
3 . Issues and challenges
The question of adjuvants Adjuvants are substances that are added to a vaccine in order to enhance its immunological effect .
Most adjuvants act on the human immune system and are not linked to a particular vaccine strain or even a particular disease .
Thus a particular adjuvant may be used not only for influenza vaccine ; but also in vaccines against other diseases .
Adjuvants can both reduce the amount of antigen needed per vaccine dose ( potentially of great importance in a pandemic ) and increase the " take " of vaccines - lhat is , the rate of successful vaccination .
Page 1 7 �A discussion paper
Many adjuvants that may be used in influenza vaccines today are inorganic chemicals .
These are sometimes aluminum - related compounds , such as aluminum hydroxide ( or gibbsite , ( Al ( OH ) J ) , which is more familiar in medicine for its use as an oral antacid .
One adjuvant that has long been used , alum , is patent - free and easily obtained , but it is not generally considered promising for H5 vaccines . , Major influenza vaccine manufacturers are increasingly using newer adjuvants of a type called oil - in - water emulsions .
Companies claim these offer substantial improvements over other adjuvants .
The proprietary oil - in- water adjuvants used by Novartis and Gla~oSmithKline '~ based on are squalene , an organic compound produced in small quantities by many animals and some plants , and are subject to patents and trade secrets .
A large number of biotechnological adjuvants , such as short pieces of DNA that are active in the body and are designed to make vaccines more immunogenic through specific gene or protein - level effects on the immune system , are undergoing research .
These , however , remain experimental .13
Not all vaccines contain an adjuvant .
LAIVs do not need to be adjuvanted because they are alive and reproduce in the upper respiratory tract .
One H5 vaccine , produced in cell culture by Baxter International , is a killed virus vaccine that is unadjuvanted .
14
One problem with assessing the potential use of adjuvants for pandemic vaccine production in developing countries is that they are often highly proprietary .
For instance , detailed information on production of vaccines with oil - in - water emulsion adjuvants is limited , as the adjuvants are often patented and their use is covered by trade secrets .
Table 2 provides an overview of a number of adjuvants .
Sanofi's '¥ proprietary formulation is reportedly similar , but its exact composition does not appear to have been made public .
"
Because these adjuvants are varied in nature and generally in earlier development stages , this paper focuses on adjuvants in current use or advanced development l4 The Baxter vaccine has an unusual composition and production method .
It uses unaltered H5N1 virus isolates that have not been placed on a labadapted backbone or had genetic alterations to reduce pathogenicity .
Because the live vaccine virus is virulent for birds and , potentially , humans and other animals , it must be grown under very careful biosafety procedures in P - 3 ( BSL - 3 ) containment .
This method of production requires a cell culture system , with the added challenge of stringent BSL - 3 practices and facilities .

date .
Based on their reported composition , adjuvants such a MF59 do not s appear to utilize unusual or expensive ingredients ; however , it cannot be assumed that effectively incorporating them into vaccines is as straightforward as their reported chemical composition because details of their use are proprietary .
In some countries , vaccination has been associated with social controversies due to perceived risks .
Some vaccine critics have claimed that certain adjuvants are unsafe , including aluminum hydroxide ( alleged to be Page 13 � A discussion caper linked to Alzheimer disease ) and MF59 ( which has received scrutiny for its use in a controversial US anthrax vaccine ) .
While the scientific merit of these criticisms is debated - the compounds have passed regulatory review in many countries - where concern exists it would be inappropriate to ignore the potential disruption to vaccination campaigns due to widespread worry over adjuvant safety .
It is clear that in the event of a pandemic , the presently limited global vaccine virus production capacity means that the supply of pandemic vaccine antigen ( in any form ) will be far outstripped by demand , especially in the early stages .
With the exception of unadjuvanted LAIVs , in the dominant planning scenario , widespread use of the most effective adjuvants is highly desirable because it will enable more people to be vaccinated with the limited amount of antigen available , especially at earlier stages of the pandemic .
Failure to use the most effective adjuvants would " waste " antigen because each suboptimally adjuvanted dose would " rob " antigen from the global supply .
Conditions imposed on commercial use of reverse genetics Reverse genetics is a relatively new proprietary technology that is being applied to the development of influenza vaccines as well as other products .
At present the technology is used in the creation of WHO GISN H5 vaccine seed strains , although it is not strictly technically obligatory to use it when making pandemic vaccine strains .
Because of the advantages it offers , however , the technology will likely be increasingly used in future vaccine strains .
Primarily developed by American and British universities , and covered by a large number of patents , reverse genetics intellectual property has been accumulated by Medimmune , a US - based subsidiary of the United Kingdom 's Astra Zeneca , a large flu vaccine maker .
Meclimmune has thus far allowed use of its reverse genetics intellectual property in pandemic vaccine R&D , however , it has indicated that it will not permit commercial use of the technology without a license .
Material transfer agreements for WHO candidate seed strains of H5 vaccines thus include protections for Medimmune 's intellectual property and thereby impose restrictions on those that receive seed strains ( through contract law ) , even in countries where Medimmune 's patents have not been issued .
Reverse genetics technology involves creation of loops of DNA called plasmids whose key parts encode for influenza genes .
When the plasmids Page 14 � Observations on Vaccine Production Technologies and Factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Developing Countries are introduced into cells , the DNA is transcribed into RNA and influenza virus is produced .
The technology enables scientists to " edit " the influenza viral genes by making alterations to the DNA plasmid , for example , deleting bases from the HA gene to make the virus avirulent .
In addition to allowing manipulation of individual genes , reverse genetics allows scientists to relatively easily mix and match genes from different influenza strains , particularly when inserting new genes onto ' backbone " strains for which plasmid systems are already constructed .
This is useful for research purposes and for creation of vaccine strains , because it can be more straightforward and reliable than the traditional reassortment method , whereby cells are coinfected with different strains and the resulting hybrid viruses identified and selected by scientists .
Reverse genetics is potentially a very useful technology for egg - based , cell culture , and other types of flu vaccines .
It is , however , controlled by Medimmune and because it is used in current WHO candidate seed strains , recipients of those strains are already obligated to negotiate with Medimmune should they choose to commercially produce vaccine from those strains .
This point has perhaps not received the attention it warrants .
Biotechnology and public perception
An important policy and health consideration underappreciated to date is the potential for problems with social and regulatory acceptance of recombinant pandemic influenza vaccines - that is , those that are the product of biotechnology .
Some countries may have additional regulatory requirements for such vaccines .
This may influence the decisions that governments take in vaccine supplies .
Decisions may be complicated by the fact that influenza vaccines make use of biotechnologies that might or might not be popularly and legally understood as " genetic engineering " .
It is logical that in the event of a severe pandemic the vast majority of people would opt for vaccination even if concerned about the safety of a recombinant vaccine , for the simple reason that fear of severe illness or death from the disease is greater than concern about the vaccine .
It is also true , however , that genetically engineered products used in humans remain controversial in many parts of the world and some citizens may be reluctant to be vaccinated , particularly in scenarios such as a slow - spreading pandemic or widespread use of a recombinant ( pre ) pandemic vaccine .
Page 7 5 � A discussion paper
Although not strictly tied to biotechnology , recent cases of problems in polio vaccination campaigns and the rejection of childhood vaccination among some religious communities are evidence of the importance of safety perceptions and belief .
In the case of pandemic influenza vaccines , the degree to which the vaccine could be termed " genetically engineered " varies by the technology used .
Perceptions may be further influenced by other factors , such as use of animal products in cell culture , and whether the vaccine is live or killed , with killed vaccines presumably engendering less resistance .
A brief breakdown of some pertinent influenza vaccine technologies and how they might be consideredis given in Table 3 .

Page 16 � Observations on Vaccine Production Technologies and factors Pofentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Revelopinc Countries Export controls Export controls are imposed by national laws .
They are designed to regulate and sometimes prevent the transfer of technologies ( hat may be used to create nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons as well as certain other items , such as missile - related technology .
They are discussed in particular here because they have generally not been discussed with respect to pandemic vaccine production to date .
Export controls are necessary to consider because research on highly pathogenic influenza viruses and production of vaccines require facilities , know - how and equipment that could be abused in biological weapons programmes .
As a result , some of the same technologies that can be used to protect public health by producing vaccines can be difficult to acquire because they may fall under export control laws .
Biological export control laws are controversial and have been a matter of intense debate at the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention .
The countries that impose the most rigorous export controls ( mainly developed countries ) argue that they are necessary for national security and anti-proliferation reasons .
On the other hand , the countries that are most often denied technology ( mainly developing countries ) counter that export controls are arbitrary and unfair , and that they are often motivated by political or economic considerations not related to weapons proliferation .
Export controls are not governed by any international agreement .
Some countries that have biological ( and chemical ) export control systems attempt to coordinate them through the Australia Croup , a collection of countries whose stated aim is " to minimise the risk of assisting chemical and biological weapon ( CBW ) proliferation " .
The majority of the members of the Australia Croup are OECD Member States .
The Croup calls itself an " informal arrangement " that " meets annually to discuss ways of increasing the effectiveness of participating countries ' national export licensing measures to prevent would - be proliferators from obtaining materials for CBW programme^ " . ^^ '"
See hltp://www.ai~straliagroup.net .
Page 7 7 � A discussion paper
For influenza vaccines , export control laws may limit the transfer of a wide variety of research and vaccine production - related technology , and even shipments of vaccines themselves .
16 Export controls are applied to equipment , organisms , and ideas .
The different types of items that can fall under export controls , include : > Physical items used in research and vaccine production such as bioreactors ( fermenters ) , lyophilizers ( freeze dryers ) , separation and packaging ( filling ) equipment . >
Know - how such a blueprints , design and engineering services s for high - containment laboratories and biological production facilities , as well as certain kinds of scientific procedures and knowledge .
>
Biological materials - for example , highly virulent disease strains or , in some cases , vaccines .
Export controls apply in different degrees to different countries and technologies .
Items considered by export - controlling countries to be of highest risk1 ' may be more difficult to export than items that are considered lower risk ( for example , vaccines ) .
Generally , when an export license for a controlled item ( or technology ) is sought , the item is classified for its intrinsic risk and then cross - referenced against a list of countries that themselves have been categorized according to the degree of weapons proliferation threat they are alleged to impose .
An additional pertinent consideration may be the entity in the importing country that seeks access to the technology .
For example , a well - known international pharmaceutical company may be less likely to be denied an export controlled item than a government research institute in the same country , if the exporting county is suspicious of the aims of the importing country 's government research programme .
Finally , when export licenses are issued , typically they are contingent upon the recipient of the controlled items agreeing to no further transfers of " '
A particularly severe export conlrol has recently been highlighted in news articles pointing out that export controls in the United States would apply to H5N1 vaccine exports to several countries .

For example , a large , high - quality fermentcr , which might be used to produce biological weapons agents instead of vaccine .

While as practical matter this type of re-export restriction is difficult to enforce , entities that transfer export - controlled technologies place at great risk their future ability to obtain export - controlled techn~logies . '~
While the Non-Aligned Movement and others have been critical of the Australia Group 's biological export control system , '' there are no signs that export controls are being relaxed even with the prospect of an influenza pandemic .
Countries must therefore take into consideration the issue of export controls when making pandemic preparedness decisions .
Many developing countries are subject to Australia Group 's export control restrictions , which could impede their access to influenza vaccine production technology .
The impact of export control regimes will vary by country and technology .
While export controls will not be a major issue for all countries , particular technologies , such as cell culture systems , may be more prone to export control problems than others .
Countries that wish to develop a domestic production capacity that utilizes imported technologies will need to address these issues .
4 . Options Timing and technology choices
It is difficult to reconcile the severity of fears of an imminent pandemic with the slow pace of expansion of global influenza vaccination and vaccine production capacity .
Years of meetings and rhetoric have passed since the H5 pandemic scare began , yet most countries in the world - including many wealthy countries - have thus far not ensured pandemic vaccine supplies for their own populations .
18 Countries that impose export controls maintain lists of commercial , governmental and other entities that have received ( or sought to receive ) export - controlled items for transfer to others without the approval of the original exporting country .
l9 See , for example , the statement of Cuba ( on behalf of NAM ) and other statements at the 2007 Meeting of States Parties of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention , URL : http://www.opbw.org/newprocess/msp2007/msp2007_s>a~emcn~.htm
� A discussion oamr
If the pandemic threat is so dire , why is the practical response so muted ?
Limited resources are certainly a factor ; but clearly , not everyone shares the same views with respect to the imminence and likely severity of an outbreak .
Those who warn that a pandemic may envelop the world within months from its onset , and there are many experts that do , suggest a health emergency that arguably would require strong government action such as nationalization of pertinent production facilities and invoking of TRIPS flexibilities to allow for greater availability of affordable treatments .
A pandemic could circle the globe so quickly that initiating such steps after the appearance of a pandemic strain might be pointless .
Despite the dire predictions , steps like compulsory licensing of antivirals have yet to be taken , suggesting that governments may be dubious of the claims made by some scientists of the imminence of a severe H5 human pandemic .
Is this foolish , or an efficient use of overstretched resources ?
It will only become clearer in retrospect Nobody argues against improved pandemic preparedness now and in the future , for everyone seems to accept that a new pandemic will occur , sooner or later .
Yet , at the same time , it is clearly not possible today to abandon other public health efforts because the argument that a highly lethal pandemic strain is nearly upon us may turn out to be correct
For those seeking to get ready for a pandemic now , proven technology - mainly egg - based production of classic flu vaccine - offers degrees of certainty that emerging biotechnologies cannot .
Methods to grow H5 viruses in eggs are improving , and egg - based production is already available and does not require any potentially expensive and unreliable " bleeding edge " technology .
And in theory , the same production facility can also be used for production of pandemic LAIVs .
Although egg - based production is sometimes maligned as " antique " , it is telling that major vaccine makers investing in biotechnology remain heavily reliant on egg - based systems for their own flu vaccine production .
The major problem , of course , is what - if anything - to do with the production capacity when it is not required for ( pre ) pandemic vaccines , in view of the fact that there is limited other use for egg - based facilities and , for many developing countries , seasonal flu vaccination is a losing economic proposition .
Maintaining an unused production base is expensive .
WHO estimates that maintaining an idle capacity to produce 200 million seasonal vaccine doses would cost US $ 100 million per year .
Page 20 � Observations on Vaccine Production Technologies and factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Developing Countries Viewed in a longer timeframe , technology selection may become more complicated .
The flexibilities and potential efficiencies of cell culture are attractive because they may offer a faster pandemic response and , especially , a facility with potentially broader public health uses - if the technology is available and markets exist for the other types of human vaccines that may be produced in cell culture .
However , the relatively unproven status and considerably greater cost of hardware for cell culture technologies ( estimated at ten or more times the cost of egg - based facilities ) , both in terms of equipment and intellectual property , at present make them a daunting proposition for most developing countries .
Fill / finish projects and importation of bulk antigen Indonesian and Mexican vaccine manufacturers , with W H O support , are developing filllfinish capacity for local vaccine sales .
In the filllfinish approach , developing country manufacturers import bulk vaccine antigen produced by an overseas company and use it in a locally branded , finished product .
In the current WHO - supported projects , the antigen manufacturers are Biken ( to Indonesia ) and Sanofi - Aventis ( to Mexico ) .
The imported bulk antigen , suitable for a classic killed vaccine , is processed in - country into a finished product .
The national manufacturer creates filling and packaging facilities , and some associated technology transfer takes place .
Importation of bulk antigen and fillinglfinishing in developing countries favours the argument , advanced by some , that it is rational for global influenza antigen production to be concentrated in a few locations with well - developed capacity and expertise .
Local manufacturers importing bulk antigen remain dependent , however , on product supplied from abroad , which is unlikely to be available in the event of a pandemic ( particularly in its early stages ) , so long as global production capacity remains well below that which is necessary .
Page 21 � A discussion oaoer
The option of animal vaccine plant conversion Current global capacity for human influenza vaccine production falls well short of that needed for pandemic response , even with optimistic assumptions about demandlyield of pandemic antigen .
Often unmentioned is the substantial additional manufacturing base that uses egg - based production systems to make animal vaccines .
These facilities could lessen the gap between pandemic vaccine supply and demand .
They use a very similar production process as that used for human influenza vaccines .
Estimates of the global size of the egg - based animal vaccine industry , however , vary wildly .
On the high end , according to one source20 the annual global egg - based animal influenza vaccine capacity , as of 2006 , was approximately 41 billion avian doses ( at 100 doses per egg ) , or about 410 million eggs .
In terms of human vaccines , this implies a capacity of approximately 410 million doses of human trivalent seasonal vaccine .
Using this capacity estimate , output of a monovalent pandemic LAIV could be between 1.8 billion ( WHO conversion factor ) and up to 4 billion or more vaccinations per year ( other conversion fa~tor ) , ~ ' depending on antigen assumptions .
In either case , this would allow vaccination of a substantial proportion of the world 's population .
But WHO CAP consultants , also citing industry sources , come up with very different numbers for the potential contribution of animal vaccine facilities .
They report that the animal vaccine industry can handle only about 78 million eggs annually .
This implies an annual pandemic LAIV output of approximately 340 to 750 million human vaccine courses per year , a much lower but still substantial figure .
It is thus difficult to be precise about ( pre ) pandemic capacity of animal vaccine facilities because of conflicting and limited data and the 2fl Hcldens , J G M.

Page 22 � Observations on Vaccine Production Jechnohgies and Factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Developing Countries variety of assumptions that could be made about antigen production and vaccine type .
But even a low - end estimate would represent a large addition to human production capacity .
Notably , a large proportion of global animal vaccine production capacity is located in Asia , and additional capacity exists in Latin America .
Converting an animal influenza vaccine facility to human vaccine production is not , however , as simple as switching vaccine seed strains .
There can be significant hurdles , the severity of which will vary with the specific equipment and process used at each manufacturing plant .
Major issues to be addressed in such a conversion are regulatory certification of the manufacturing process to human vaccine standards , ensuring appropriate biosafety practices , adequate egg supply , improved virus purification processes , and adoption of adjuvants approved for human use .
Regulatory hurdles will be country - specific .
In some places , animal vaccine plants are already held to manufacturing standards near or equal to those for human vaccines ; however , this is not always the case .
A related issue is biosafety practices which , in some animal vaccine plants , would need improvement - both in operating procedures and , potentially , to equipment .
Conversion of animal facilities to human vaccine production may also strain egg supplies , especially in countries or regions where H5 vaccination of poultry currently occurs , because eggs laid by hens vaccinated against H5 can not be used to produce vaccine .
Human flu vaccines produced in eggs go through an extensive filtration process to remove egg proteins and other contaminants that can cause an adverse reaction .
Animal vaccines are generally not subjected to the same level of filtration , and improvement of filtration in converted animal vaccine plants would be necessary .
The adjuvants used in animal vaccines are not typically approved for use in humans , and animal vaccine plants would have to switch to appropriate adjuvants , unless they are producing a human pandemic LAIV ( which is unadjuvanted ) .
Page 23 � A discussion oaoer Human vaccine producers and pharmaceutical companies own a significant proportion of global animal vaccine production capacity .
For example , Merial , the world 's largest animal vaccine maker , is a joint venture of Sanofi Aventis and Merck .
Ft. Dodge , another large animal vaccine company , is a division of Wyeth .
Intervet , a third large animal vaccine maker , is owned by Schering Plough .
Other drug companies , such as Pfizer and Novartis , also have animcil vaccine businesses .
Thus , human and animal vaccine makers should not be thought of as wholly separate industries .
5 . Concluding discussion
Which technologies should developing countries seek multilaterally to improve pandemic preparedness ?
The answer , of course , depends on many factors .
Reliance on a s m d number of developed country sources for pandemic vaccine and / or antigen is unlikely to remain an acceptable solution for most developing countries , particularly in view of the fact that the developed country industry is not currently in a position to offer sufficient quantities of antigen in a timely manner after the appearance of a pandemic strain .
Practically , the present situation of dependency , which is effectively unaltered by the WHO Pandemic Action Plan , means that the vast majority of developing countries will only receive significant quantities of vaccine after the needs of developed countries are met , which will likely be many months after the onset of a pandemic - months during which pandemic mortality may be severe .
As a result of the inequity , in the event of a pandemic , developing countries will suffer a disproportionate burden of serious disease and death , a problem that could be ameliorated by increased and equitably distributed global vaccine supplies , particularly in the developing world .
These vaccine supply problems may be further exacerbated by non-health factors , in the form of export controls that may inhibit the ability of some countries to prepare for a pandemic because some kinds of technology transfer are unavailable to them .
Developing country leaders are likely to face question from their citizens if they remain vulnerable while the citizens of wealthy countries are vaccinated ; this situation could become especially tense if a pandemic is severe enough to cause serious socioeconomic disruption .
Page 24 � Observations on Vaccine Production Technologies and factors Potentially Influencing Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Choices in Developing Countries Vaccination for the population at the earliest point possible following the onset of a pandemic is n't the entirety of pandemic preparedness ; but it is a high priority .
But at present , there is little consensus among experts about how best to achieve that .
It is also clear that no single technological approach will be appropriate for all countries or regions and that greater funding and improved access to proprietary technologies will be necessary for developing countries to improve protection of their citizens from pandemic flu .
Regional cooperation in production and technology to take advantage of economies of scale will likely be far more fruitful than trying to go it alone for most countries .
Several options for financing and technology transfer have been mentioned in the context of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Intergovernmental Meeting ( IGM ) .
These include increasing vaccine production in developing countries , possibly supported by royalty - free licensing of vaccine production technology .
Contributions to a global fund , and contributions of vaccines to a WHO stockpile by entities that use pandemic preparedness biological materials in research and development of vaccines and other biomedical items have also been proposed .
While a WHO stockpile may be useful to help stamp out or slow down the emergence of a pandemic influenza strain , it is not designed - nor will it serve - to ensure any country 's vaccine supply .
A WHO vaccine stockpile is also mandated by WHO Member States outside the WHO PIP IGM discussions , and is thus not a central objective of the benefit - sharing discussion .
Because increasing national or regional vaccine production capacity in developing countries requires flexibility in technological approaches , no single technology transfer and cooperative arrangement is likely to be effective .
There is strong evidence that proprietary and emerging technologies , such as reverse genetics , adjuvants , and in the future cell culture , could serve to greatly increase the efficiency of preparedness efforts .
Specific technology selections , however , must be made in the regional and national contexts .
In principle , developing countries may seek to formalize a system of equitable reciprocity wherein those developed country companies and other entities that utilize Global Influenza Surveillance Network ( GISN ) Page 25 � A discussion oaoer materials to develop vaccines commit to transfer their vaccine technologies so that they may be used by developing countries .
Therefore , in the PIP ICM negotiations , developing countries have explored the possibility of creating a mechanism for transfer of influenza vaccine technology , through mandatory royalty - free licensing and other low or no-cost means , including for both formal patents and related know - how and trade secrets .
The technologies prioritized by any such pandemic preparedness technology transfer program should be those that are used by industry to manufacture products that include WHO GISN materials ( e.g. H5 vaccines ) or are developed utilizing WHO GISN materials .
Reducing proprietary barriers to the technology needed to produce pandemic vaccines would represent a significant step forward ; however , making technology available does not guarantee that it will be effectively used .
Ways to optimize the use of technologies include , for example , the creation of a financing mechanism by which the real - world transfer of these technologies can be effected ( for instance , to pay for the necessary equipment and training to utilize them ) .
A pandemic preparedness cooperation fund could also be established , with contributions from manufacturers that utilize WHO GISN materials in commercial products ( to be defined in a WHO material transfer agreement ) , and possibly contributions from governments .
A cooperation fund could also help enable the use of nonproprietary technologies , such as egg - based production lines and fill / finish capacity , which will be important elements of any national or regional effort to increase vaccine production capacity .
Pandemic preparedness is a problem of daunting complexity , and solutions will only come with time and contributions from many quarters .
The PIP IGM is an important process but not one that by itself can solve all problems .
Developing countries may wish to focus on important specific benefits that will enhance their preparedness .
With the timing of a pandemic uncertain , but the time needed to construct and validate vaccine facilities typically measured in years , it is urgent that progress be made now to expand developing country vaccine production capacity .
Developing countries will have to work together to identify the best technologies for their circumstances .
The PIP ICM 's decisions may help to make key technologies affordably available to developing countries , and through a cooperation fund , provide means through which to effect their transfer and use .

In a huge blow to the opponents of healthcare reform , Wal - Mart has come out in support of a mandate that employers provide affordable healthcare to their employees .
Wal - Mart is the nation ’s largest employer , and its uninsured employees are one of the biggest drains on the healthcare system .
Wal - Mart ’s position creates a giant crack in the coalition against healthcare reform .
Wal - Mart along with the SEIU , and the liberal Center for American Progress sent a letter to President Obama expressing support for the employer mandate , “ As the nation ’s largest private employer , the nation ’s largest union of health care workers with over one million members , and a think tank that has been a leader on health care policy , we have worked closely in support of health care reform since 2006 , when we came together to help break the stalemate that had defined the health care debate for too long .
Now , to move the debate forward once again , we are coming together to advance what we believe are important proposals that should be included in the current efforts to reform our nation ’s health care system . ”
For Wal - Mart this issue is about reducing healthcare costs , “ We are for shared responsibility .
Not every business can make the same contribution , but everyone must make some contribution .
We are for an employer mandate which is fair and broad in its coverage , but any alternative to an employer mandate should not create barriers to hiring entry level employees .
We look forward to working with the Administration and Congress to develop a requirement that is both sensible and equitable .
Support for a mandate also requires the strongest possible commitment to rein in health care costs .
Guaranteeing cost containment is essential . ”
Advertisements
Wal - Mart sees the writing on the wall here .
The retail giant can either accept the mandate , which would allow them to offer their own healthcare plan to all employees , or they can oppose Obama ’s plan , and hope that the Democrats do n’t pass stricter rules and mandates .
Uninsured Wal - Mart employees cost state taxpayers millions of dollars each year .
If Wal - Mart does agree to offer affordable insurance to their own employees , it would help ease some of the fears that employers would drop their coverage and shift their employees to the public option .
For Wal - Mart , this is a chance to get some positive publicity after years of battering for their treatment of employees .
Wal - Mart ’s support of the employer mandate is the biggest signal yet that real healthcare reform is coming .
( H/T : Think Progress )
Recently by Gary North : Mass Layoffs : The Continuing Devastation
Bernanke video :
He stutters ; he stammers ; he is in visible panic mode over Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the Federal Reserve .
Watch it .
You ’ll love it !
Then send it to your friends .
Usually , when Ben Bernanke is interviewed , he has the demeanor of a college professor in the presence of freshman students .
Of course , as a full professor , he did not have to teach freshmen .
That is for untenured assistant professors to do .
Stammering and stuttering are therefore a real departure for him .
There is a reason for this .
For the first time since 1914 , there is a public debate in Congress over the Federal Reserve ’s power .
Never before has a majority of the House of Representatives called for what should always have existed : Congressional scrutiny over the FED ’s money .
Bernanke says that Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the Federal Reserve is a bill to audit Federal Reserve policy .
Yet the bill says nothing about auditing policy .
So , what is he talking about ?
Bernanke says that Congress can have access to an audit at any time .
Sure it can — an audit vetted and sanitized by the FED , where no one knows which banks got what bailout money .
This is an audit in the way a CIA audit is an audit .
The main differences are these : ( 1 ) the CIA legally operates only outside the borders of the United States ; ( 2 ) the CIA can assassinate any uncooperative Congressman who insists on a full audit .
The FED does not have the second power , but it is not limited by the first restriction .
What has Bernanke panicked is this : the Federal Reserve has bailed out the biggest banks and has let almost 100 little ones die .
This is crony capitalism at its most notorious .
The threat is that Congress will discover what should be obvious : the biggest banks last October almost went bankrupt .
Bernanke and Paulson admitted this to Congressional leaders .
This is how they got the leaders to authorize the Treasury bailout .
This is why the FED swapped marketable Treasury debt for unmarketable toxic debt at face value with the biggest banks .
Which banks ?
The FED refuses to say .
This is the heart of the matter .
This is what has Bernanke in a panic .
If Congress compels a full audit — a real audit , not a FED - controlled audit — individual members of Congress will discover that the American financial system is a house of cards .
A few of them will release the results of the audit to the public .
This will include Website publishers , who will go over the audit , line by line .
The mainstream media will face being scooped by newsletter writers , so they will try to publish first .
The public will find out which banks are not safe .
This is what has Bernanke in panic mode .
The public will pull deposits out of the biggest , least safe banks and open new accounts at banks that look safer .
That will bust some very big banks .
There is no way that the FDIC could cover the losses of even one of these giant banks .
It is down to $ 12 billion in assets , mostly T - bills .
It would have to come to Congress for the line of credit that Congress has extended : $ 500 billion .
The banking cartel would face a breakdown .
Why ?
Because the public would finally learn which big banks got how much money , how much Treasury debt for toxic assets , and on what terms .
KEEPING DEPOSITORS IN THE DARK
Bernanke says this bill is all about criticizing Federal Reserve policy .
Not really .
It is all about exposing policy to the public , and letting them decide where to deposit their money .
This thought of depositors finding out which banks are at risk is what the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 to prevent .
The banking cartel must prevent bank runs from spreading .
If the public had explicit information on what the FED did and why , the public would be in a position to pull their money out of illiquid , economically insolvent large banks .
Bernanke feigns a fear of Congress setting policy .
What he is afraid of is depositors setting policy .
He does not want depositors to see which banks are at risk .
The bankers live in fear of their depositors .
Depositors can bust a bank in a matter of days .
All they need to do is write a check or send a bank wire transfer from their present bank to a different bank .
If too many depositors pull money out of Bank A to send to Banks B , C , or D , Bank A goes under .
The FDIC has to have a Friday afternoon emergency session where it absorbs the bad assets of Bank A and opens bidding for the good assets .
The big banks love this when they are not the targets of the bank run .
They can buy up millions of dollars of good assets , while palming off the bad assets to the FDIC .
If the FDIC ca n’t cover the losses , then Congress picks up the tab .
A sweet deal for the surviving banks !
But what if the surviving banks are being held together with accounting gimmicks .
Example : the FED “ lends ” Treasury bills ( marketable ) at face value to big banks that are sitting on a hundred billion dollars in unmarketable assets : bad real estate loans .
The receiving banks list the Treasury bills as their capital .
The government auditors are then instructed to evaluate the solvency of the banks in terms of the quality of their loans — in this case , T - bills .
No problem !
But these assets are borrowed from the FED .
In theory , the FED can force the banks to swap back at face value .
At that point , the banks are technically bankrupt .
These assets have no liquid market .
The solvency of the American banking system rests on smoke and mirrors .
Bernanke knows this .
Congress is ignorant .
Congress thinks things are probably OK .
But a majority of House members want to be safe .
They do n’t want the folks back home to believe that they are asleep at the wheel , which Congress has been since 1914 with respect to the Federal Reserve .
So , a majority of House members co-sponsored Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the FED .
Barney Frank understands the threat .
He has bottled the bill up in committee .
This way , members who support the bill can tell the folks back home that it ’s not their fault .
If they are asked about this , they can say , one by one , “ I am really sorry .
I did my best , but the bill is bottled up in committee .
There is nothing I can do . ”
Of course there is something they can do .
They can vote to bring the bill to the floor for a vote .
There , they will be exposed to the folks back home .
Did they vote “ yes ” to audit the FED ?
By co-sponsoring the bill , they can tell the folks back home , “ I ’m with you on this . ”
By letting Frank bottle it up in committee , they can plead powerlessness .
Nice .
It ’s all smoke and mirrors .
It ’s all about not letting depositors find out how their banks are doing .
BERNANKE IS CONTEMPTUOUS OF CONGRESS
Bernanke said this on - camera : “ The public does not want Congress to set monetary policy . ”
If that really is the case , then it is odd what the United States Constitution says about this .
Consider Article 1 .
Section 1 .
All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives .
Then Article 8 spells out the powers of Congress .
These include :
To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ;
To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States .
That surely appears as though Congress does have lawful power over money .
That in turn seems as though the public can ask Congress to fulfill its duties .
That seems as though Congress has the legal right to audit or set policy for the private agency — the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — that executes the monetary policy of the government agency , the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
The way that the public kept both Congress and the commercial banks under control was through the silver standard , up until about 1815 , and then by the international gold coin standard until late 1913 , when the Senate rushed through the Federal Reserve Act when most members had gone home for the Christmas recess .
President Wilson signed the bill into law that evening : a very fast track .
When Dr. Bernanke showed contempt for Congress in the name of the American people , he forgot to mention an alternative to both the Federal Reserve and Congress : the gold coin standard .
That system lodged the power of the veto in the hands of the public .
That was why commercial bankers , central bankers , and politicians joined forces to ridicule both the gold standard and the earlier silver standard .
A precious metal coin standard — coins payable at a government - fixed price on demand for paper money — gives the public too much authority over monetary policy .
This gives them too much authority over government tax policy : no inflation tax .
The Federal Reserve Act transferred legally sovereign power over money from Congress to the Board of Governors of the FED .
The Board of Governors labored under the restraint of the gold coin standard domestically until Roosevelt unilaterally abolished it in 1933 .
Then Nixon unilaterally abolished the last remaining traces of the international gold standard in 1971 .
That left the Federal Reserve System with nearly uncontested power over money , with only the infamous and much - denigrated “ bond vigilantes ” possessing an independent veto over FED policy .
Bernanke is adamant : any attempt by Congress to monitor the activities of the FED is an assault on Federal Reserve sovereignty .
The Constitution lodges such sovereignty in Congress , but Congress delegated this sovereignty to the not - yet operational Federal Reserve in late 1913 .
Ron Paul ’s bill is the first bill ever to gain widespread support in the House to transfer the right to audit the FED to Congress .
This is the first time since 1914 that any Congressman has persuaded a majority of his colleagues to assert the legal sovereignty that the Constitution delegates to Congress with respect to money .
This is why Bernanke is in panic mode .
This is the first chink in the FED ’s armor since 1914 .
This bill is a nightmare for the FED .
Yet the FED ’s staffers are going to get paid their above - market salaries and keep their fully vested pensions , with or without an audit by Congress .
PANIC IN THE BOARDROOMS
The real panic is in the boardrooms of the largest banks .
This bill will allow Congress to see the specifics of the sweetheart arrangement that big banks have had with the FED .
Congress will get the statistical facts , and newsletter writers will interpret them for subscribers — rich subscribers .
The big bankers know that their banks would be insolvent without Federal Reserve bailouts , Treasury Department bailouts , and smoke - and - mirrors accounting .
They know that any light thrown on the system ’s smoke - and - mirrors accounting will reveal the insolvency of the biggest banks .
The directors of these banks do not want the public to be able to get access to these facts by means of a full - scale audit of the Federal Reserve System .
The paper trail , meaning the digital money trail , leads to their banks .
This terrifies them .
It should .
The big bank bankers are now in full defensive mode .
They see the threat .
They dare not go public with warnings about letting the public gain access to full information about the bailouts since last September .
This would appear to be self - serving , which it would unquestionably be .
So , they let Bernanke be their spokesman , as if Bernanke and the Board of Governors were not enforcers of the fractional reserve banking cartel .
This puts Bernanke on the spot .
He dares not tell his interviewers that the United States Constitution lodges in Congress legal sovereignty over the money of the United Stares .
He does not want to remind the public of this Constitutional fact .
So , he denigrates Congress as incompetent to set monetary policy .
He is therefore contemptuous of the Constitution , but he dares not let this slip out .
That would not be prudent .
If Ron Paul ’s bill is kept bottled up , this will be grist for the mill of a growing number of Americans who have only recently learned about the existence of the Federal Reserve System .
From the beginning , the Federal Reserve was designed to be a mystery to the public .
This strategy succeeded for over 90 years .
But Ron Paul ’s Presidential campaign at long last began to gain attention for the FED .
The campaign took place in 2008 .
That was the year of the crash and the desperation bailouts .
This was bad timing for the FED .
This bad timing led this year to widespread member support in the House of Representatives for an audit of the FED .
Worse yet , the bill was sponsored by Ron Paul — the FED ’s greatest Congressional opponent in this generation .
This is very bad news for the banking cartel .
It took place on Bernanke ’s watch .
He is in panic mode .
CONCLUSION
The Federal Reserve has lost a lot of its legitimacy .
It has also lost a lot of its secrecy .
By opposing the audit , Bernanke is positioning himself as an anti-democratic representative of the Wall Street banks .
Of course , this is what every FED chairman has been .
But this is the first time since 1914 that any FED chairman ( or his equivalent ) has had to adopt this positioning in full public view .
This is bad news for the Federal Reserve .
When the economy gets worse , as it will , the FED will receive its share of the blame , which is considerable .
Bernanke is the primary visible agent of the FED .
He will no longer get a free ride .
The critics are at long last getting a hearing by the informed public — the people with lots of money deposited in large banks .
This is why he has been going on television to present his case .
No other FED chairman in history has been forced to do this .
This is a sign of the degree of panic in the boardrooms .
The more often Bernanke goes on TV , the more people will think : “ Methinks he doth protest too much . ”
This is a very good thing .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
One of the things they teach in Successful Investing 101 is to cut your losses short and let your winnings run .
But when it comes to the Troubled Assets Relief Program , the government is stuck doing the opposite .
Its gains are being cut short , because its most profitable investments are being closed out , yet its losses will continue running .
The big gains come from stock - purchase warrants that Congress insisted the Treasury get as part of the $ 244 billion of TARP loans it made to 662 banks and bank holding companies .
Warrants , which give holders the right ( but not the obligation ) to purchase stock at a fixed price for a fixed period , are designed to offer taxpayers a chance to make some serious money if the stock prices of the bailed - out banks rise .
To induce relatively sound banks to borrow , the Bush Treasury Department adopted very liberal rules on the warrants , giving early TARP repayers the right to force the government to sell them back rather than continue holding them .
The price is determined by negotiation , auction , or complicated appraisal proceedings .
The government 's two biggest scores -- 26 % a year from American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) and 23 % from Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) -- came from Amex and Goldman having redeemed their warrants for $ 340 million and $ 1.1 billion , respectively .
Profits on the warrants , which were outstanding for only a brief period , accounted for 21 % and 18 % , respectively , of those returns .
The rest came from the 5 % annual borrowing charge for most TARP borrowers .
So far , 34 of the banks that got TARP money have paid it back , according to SNL Financial , a Charlottesville - based research firm whose statistics I 'm using throughout this piece , with about half the institutions paying a total of $ 1.7 billion ( including Amex and Goldman ) to redeem their warrants .
That 's the good news .
The bad news is that we 've now seen most of the good news , because the remaining TARP borrowers -- 628 that owe the government $ 174 billion -- are considerably weaker as a group than the ones that have repaid .
It 's what economists call " adverse selection . "
The strongest borrowers -- the ones whose warrants are likely to produce serious profits for the Treasury -- are bailing out of TARP as rapidly as possible to avoid pay restrictions and other rules that the Obama administration adopted after inheriting TARP from the Bush administration .
These stronger firms would also like to capture as much of their stocks ' potential upside as possible , so they 're trying to buy back the warrants based on today 's share price rather on what they assume will be a higher price in the future .
Even though only strong banks were supposed to be deemed TARP - worthy , there are plenty of weaklings in the pool .
The biggest : Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , where the government has converted $ 45 billion of its TARP investment into regular preferred and common stock to try to strengthen the bank .
The odds of us taxpayers getting back our $ 45 billion -- plus the 5 % to 8 % Citi was supposed to pay on its borrowings -- are remote .
Then there 's the $ 54 billion in TARP money tied up in GMAC ( GJM ) and American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
Not exactly prime credits .
Finally , there 's my favorite : 17 borrowers that SNL Financial says have failed to pay the dividends due on their total of $ 500 million of TARP borrowings .
I 'm sure we can kiss a good part of that money goodbye .
The government still has some warrant gains to collect -- 16 firms , including JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , have repaid their TARP borrowings but the government still has n't sold the warrants -- but I doubt we 'll see percentage returns anything like what we got on Amex and Goldman .
Even if the government gets the $ 1.1 billion value that the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel places on the JPMorgan Chase warrants , we'd have a far lower return than on Amex and Goldman .
That 's because these firms bought their warrants for 10 % and 11 % , respectively , of their TARP loans , while $ 1.1 billion is only about 4 % of JPMorgan 's $ 25 billion TARP borrowing .
So let 's be happy with what we 've gotten for our warrants , taxpayers .
But let 's not kid ourselves .
TARP was designed to bail out the financial system , not to make money .
If we break even , we 'll be doing well .

Attention Investor ,
I just received a phone call about an hour ago that changed my perspective on some little - known market news on gold stocks .
That ’s why I ’m writing you …I want you to be the first to know that gold stocks are outperforming stocks in other sectors … and let you know why they are headed up .
The call was from Dr. Willem Fuchter .
He ’s the renowned mining consultant who ’s currently the CEO of Constitution Mining Corp . ( CMIN.OB ) .
He told me about a promising new development plan for their massive Gold Sands project … and it ’s groundbreaking news that I thought you needed to know about before it hits the press .
Initial estimates from the already large discovery suggested that the property potentially held upwards of50 million ounces of gold … worth an amazing $ 46 billion .
But the most recent tests now indicate that there could be even more .
In fact , Constitution Mining could be looking at 100 million ounces of gold … which would make this the largest gold strike in modern history .
This is an impressive bit of news for investors !
It could potentially turn a $ 10,000 investment into $ 431,000 .
As you may know , I am a former executive in various departments , including foreign exchange and derivative settlement markets , with the legendary Switzerland - based investment giant Credit Suisse .
For more than 30 years , I ’ve been privy to the closely guarded fortune - building and asset - protection secrets in the highest levels of Swiss investment banking .
These strategies have helped the world ’s wealthiest people grow even wealthier .
And that ’s why when Dr. Fuchter called me , I wanted to immediately notify you about our conversation , because …
I think Constitution Mining Corp. ( CMIN.OB ) could skyrocket !
Dr. Fuchter revealed that the company received permits to proceed with the Gold Sands drill program , indicating the exceptional economic potential of the company …
Potential that could turn $ 10,000 into a 6 - figure fortune within 12 to 24 months .
Read that again : A potential 6 - figure fortune within 12 to 24 months
Analysts now estimate that , because of a breakthrough technology , Constitution Mining may actually be able to pull a mind - boggling 100 million ounces of gold — worth $ 92 billion — from the deposit .
In other words , this is n’t potentially just one of the largest gold deposits ever discovered in South America — it could be one of the largest in the world !
Thanks to high - tech mining dredgers , Constitution Mining can now extract billions of dollars worth of gold for just $ 185 per ounce .
And when gold is selling for around $ 900 that makes mining this site very profitable indeed !
Once in place , these dredgers should allow Constitution Mining to extract an astonishing 2.26 million ounces of gold worth $ 1.616 billion from the Marañón River in just 6 months .
And right now , this company ’s market cap is a mere $ 50 million .
Just imagine what ’s going to happen to its stock once word gets out .
Even if Constitution Mining is only able to mine half as much gold as I expect , its share price could still soar in a matter of months .
Just how high ?
Well …
Thanks to billions and billions in bailout money that have been pumped into the economy … plus Obama ’s $ 1.845 trillion deficit…and his $ 3.5 trillion budget … we ’re heading for double - digit inflation .
And you know what that means :
Investors are going to be flocking to gold and gold stocks , and both could move to record highs in the next 12 to 24 months .
It ’s even more serious than the inflation we suffered under the Carter administration … and the profits could be even greater than what smart investors made in the 1980 gold spike .
No wonder Merrill Lynch is predicting that gold will jump another 50 % to $ 1,500 in the next 12 to 15 months .
Citigroup is predicting $ 2,000 gold and USB is forecasting $ 2,500 .
But the word from my sources in Zurich is that gold could rise to an incredible $ 3,000 … and that ’s why the world ’s investment elite are buying it hand over fist right now .
When this amazing spike happens , “ Dr. Fuchter ” and “ Constitution Mining ” are two names you ’re going to be glad you heard about today .
So your next question is probably about how much money , exactly , you could make in profits .
I ’m telling you this …
I see Constitution Mining ’s epic gold discovery as having great potential to helping you make back everything you may have lost in the past 17 months .
I ’ve seen it happen before with Seabridge Gold ( AMEX : SA ) , which my inner circle recommended and invested in at $ 0.50 a share … only to see it soar to $ 39.50 over the next 4 years .
That was enough to turn every $ 10,000 invested into $ 790,000 !
And now Constitution Mining ’s promising gold strike has the potential to double your wealth in a matter of months .
Let me tell you about the 3 most likely scenarios and how much money we ’re talking about …
Scenario # 1 could turn $ 10,000 into $ 269,400
Results from 500 holes drilled at the Constitution Mining site indicate a discovery that could be in the range of 100 million ounces .
But even if it turns out to be just 1.4 million ounces — or 1.4 % of the projected total — you could still make more than 25 times your money .
With gold selling at $ 900 an ounce , a 1.4 million - ounce discovery could generate $ 1.26 billion in revenue .
Subtract the cost of extracting the gold — $ 185 per ounce , or about $ 259 million — and Constitution Mining would still be left with an amazing $ 1.001 billion .
Divide that by the 75 million outstanding shares and the share price could equal $ 13.47 per share !
That ’s a 2,594 % return … enough to potentially turn your $ 10,000 investment into $ 269,400 !
Best of all , we could see this kind of price explosion within 12 months .
You may be thinking that sounds impossible , I know .
But recall , early investors in Kinross Gold , before its 1984 Fort Knox discovery , made 20 times their money as the stock soared 2,075 % once the discovery became public knowledge .
And that was n’t even the most profitable of the big gold strikes .
After Barrick
Gold discovered its famous 15 - million - ounce mine in 1987 … early - bird investors made an unbelievable 12,440 % on their money , turning $ 10,000 into $ 1,254,000 .
Now it could be your turn .
Take a look at Scenario # 2 , and a surprise revelation
that could turn $ 10,000 into $ 431,000 …
The exploratory drilling on the site went down 32 meters , and the gold grades got richer every step of the way .
But in this case , the drills never reached the bedrock that underlies all gold sands deposits — and nobody knew for sure just how far the gold sands could go .
Well all that ’s changed .
You see , during my extensive research , I met a contractor named Hugo Romero who had done some relocation contract work for Petrex S.A. , a Peruvian oil company , back in the early 2000s .
Mr. Romero was part of a crew whose job it was to bury a pipeline running through a portion of the Gold Sands district that crosses under the Marañón River .
The pipe was laid at a depth of 54 meters — almost twice as deep as the drill sites — and it was still in the Gold Sands , with no bedrock in sight .
This revelation makes it highly likely that Constitution Mining will be able to pull gold from much deeper than previously thought .
And it gives me the confidence I need to consider it likely that the find will expand to at least 2.26 million ounces worth a whopping $ 2,034,000,000 .
Subtract the $ 418,100,000 cost of extracting the gold … and that leaves Constitution Mining with a potential profit of $ 1.616 billion worth of gold !
Divide that $ 1.616 billion by 75 million shares and you could be looking at $ 21.55 per share — an astonishing gain of 4,210 % !
That ’s good enough to turn $ 10,000 into a potentially eye - popping $ 431,000 !
And again , it could happen in a matter of months .
When the time comes that the share price hits $ 13 or $ 14 , I recommend pulling some of your profits off the table — but it also makes good sense to leave a portion of your money in play whenever the odds of success are so high .
But let ’s look at my worst - case scenario for a moment .
You ’ll be glad to know it ’s still enough to make more than 10 times your money !
Because Scenario # 3 could still turn $ 10,000 into $ 133,466 !
So for this worst - case projection , let ’s assume for a moment that I ’m wrong about the size of Constitution Mining ’s discovery , and that it ’s actually less than 1 % of the 100 million ounces that are projected .
That would be 700,000 ounces of gold in all .
And with gold selling for $ 900 an ounce , a 700,000 - ounce discovery will generate $ 630 million in revenue .
Subtract the $ 185 per-ounce cost of extraction ( $ 129.5 million ) and Constitution Mining could get $ 550 million .
Divide that $ 550 million by 75 million shares outstanding , and Constitution Mining ’s share price could climb to $ 6.67 per share … for a potential gain of $ 1,234 % !
And that ’s how your $ 10,000 could turn into an astonishing $ 133,466 .
Then , if gold goes to $ 2,000 … that will more than double my estimates … and the amount of profits you could take away .
My calculations assume a gold price of $ 900 an ounce .
For example , with $ 2,000 gold in Scenario # 2 , the share price could skyrocket to $ 54.69 — which could potentially turn your $ 10,000 into $ 1,093,800 .
That means you could become a millionaire practically overnight .
Are you beginning to see why I consider Constitution Mining to be my # 1 gold stock for 2009 – 2010 … and why I ’ve recommended it to our wealthiest clients across the globe ?
Now it ’s your turn .
To profit with Constitution Mining , you need to get in now
Over the next few weeks , I ’ll be sharing the results of my research with my extensive network of Swiss investment bankers who are all hungry for a great gold stock .
And they will be getting their own clients into this stock .
Because these investment bankers are looking for real value backed up with real numbers .
And once word gets out that big money is moving into Constitution Mining , the stock price will start to move .
Now , let me tell you that when I first got wind of Constitution Mining , my natural skepticism kicked in .
Why ?
Because my philosophy from years in Swiss banking is “ Never trust , but verify . ”
I ’ve heard plenty of hot air from emerging companies before , and I was n’t about to be seduced by a sales pitch .
But then I took a closer look at the information … and that ’s why I form independent teams and only recommend stocks periodically because of the extensive research I do .
We ’re looking for the grand slam and that makes everyone involved feel like standing up and clapping .
Even better , my team , made up of independent geologists , including Dr. Vicente Méndez , made several trips to the mining site itself to check things out firsthand .
We ’ve done our homework .
I have a stack of paper on my desk right now that ’s 2 feet tall — and it ’s all the research I ’ve done on Constitution Mining …
Notes on the dozens of conversations I ’ve had with mining engineers , geologists and even a one - on - one interview with Peru ’s ambassador to Switzerland , Elizabeth Astete Rodriguez ( excerpts of which appear in the pages of my Swiss Confidential newsletter that I ’ll tell you more about in a moment ) .
In addition , I have the results of the 500 exploration holes that were drilled on the site … and a report from Sojuzkarta , the independent consulting firm based in Russia that audited and confirmed these results …
Plus , I have legal documents confirming that Constitution Mining has ownership of the site and the required permits to move forward with their development project …
You need to know about all of this .
That ’s why I ’ve posted more free information and in - depth analysis on my website .

NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Ridley Scott is going back to the futurism .
Leonardo DiCaprio sits courtside during Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Orlando Magic in Los Angeles , June 7 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mike Blake
The “ Blade Runner ” director is joining forces with Leonardo DiCaprio to take on one of the most highly regarded dystopian works of literature , Aldous Huxley ’s “ Brave New World . ”
Both are producing the Universal project , which DiCaprio would tentatively star in and Scott direct .
The studio has brought on “ Apocalypto ” scribe Farhad Safinia to write the script ; he ’s expected to be working shortly .
Scott has mentioned casually in interviews that he ’s interested in the 1931 novel , whose film rights are owned by DiCaprio ’s Appian Way production company , prompting a flurry of rumors on sci-fi and other blogs over the past year .
But the studio details as well as DiCaprio ’s personal involvement always have been murky .
Now , with a writer on board and production executives meeting frequently during the past six months , the project has more momentum , though several people familiar with it emphasize that it remains at the development stage .
Much of the timing going forward will depend on the script .
Scott is not committed to direct anything beyond “ Robin Hood , ” which is in post - production .
DiCaprio is shooting the Christopher Nolan adventure tale “ Inception , ” but does not have a movie lined up after that .
“ Brave ” has had several go - rounds on television , including a Leonard Nimoy - Peter Gallagher picture on NBC in 1998 .
But Huxley ’s idea - rich novel has n’t had a shot on the big screen .
Huxley sets his book in a seemingly perfect 26th century world that has achieved harmony by tightly controlling birth , which takes place mainly in laboratories , and outlawing family .
The world is populated by a series of five castes , each with its own defined roles .
Characters who figure in are Bernard , a lower - caste member , and Lenina , the woman with whom he is infatuated .
DiCaprio would likely play Bernard , who is persecuted when the leaders of the society find his behavior antisocial .
Dystopian stories have sometimes proved difficult to film .
George Orwell ’s “ 1984 ” has had several theatrical turns , including Michael Anderson ’s Columbia version in 1956 and the somewhat better regarded John Hurt vehicle 25 years ago .
Scott is considered one of the few who can pull it off .
The director took the Philip K. Dick novel “ Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ” and turned it into the 1982 futurist pic “ Blade Runner . ”
While the movie divided critics and did n’t enjoy a great theatrical run , it has had a long life on video and become a cult classic .
Scott directed DiCaprio in last year ’s Middle East thriller “ Body of Lies , ” and the two are also producing dark thriller “ The Low Dweller ” at indie filmmaker Relativity .

Internet search engine Google has seen better - than - expected quarterly results even as revenue growth slowed following the economic downturn .
The firm saw net income reach $ 1.48 bn ( £ 900 m ) in the three months to 30 June , compared to $ 1.25 bn a year before .
Revenue rose 3 % for the period at $ 5.52bn and just over half - 53 % - came from outside the US .
Analysts reacted broadly positively to the results , noting that the firm had performed well in containing costs .
The firm was upbeat about the results " especially given the continued macro- economic downturn " .
Chief executive Eric Schmidt said : " These results highlight the enduring strength of our business model and our responsible efforts to manage expenses . "
Google earned $ 5.36 a share , excluding certain items , better than the $ 5.08 per share forecast by analysts .
Sameet Sinha , an analyst with JMP Securities said : " The numbers are good .
Revenue was in line with expectations , and strong operating efficiencies were brought about by the new chief executive . "
" It definitely shows that Google is a best - of - breed company for online advertising , and it's a must buy . "
But Ross Sandler , an analyst at RBC Capital , described the results as mixed .
" Overall , the focus is on what 's going to happen in the second half . "
Shares in the firm Google gained 1 % to $ 442.60 on but later dropped 2.4 % in after - hours trade .
Paid clicks - which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and the sites of AdSense partners - were 15 % higher year - on - year , but 2 % less than in the first quarter .

The company submitted the application to Apple 's iTunes App Store for its approval in July .
The application will be free , but will require the user to have a premium Spotify subscription , which costs £ 10 .
The Swedish music streaming service is looked on as a rival to Apple 's iTunes store because of its comprehensive , free library of millions of songs .
Apple currently dominates the digital music market , which led many to speculate that the app may not be approved .
However , many in the music also industry regard Spotfiy as an alternative , and a credible business model for an industry which has had difficulty adapting to the online world .
" We 're not surprised but we 're thrilled , " founder Daniel Ek told BBC News .
" We had a great dialogue with Apple from day one . "
' Scaling up '
The application is designed to search for new music and will allow users to temporarily store playlists on their phone for use when there is no connection .
It will also allow users to stream playlists .
The premium service , which currently costs £ 9.99 a month , allows users to run Spotify on their computers without adverts .
Mr Ek told BBC
News that he was confident the app would bring a big surge in premium subscribers .
" We 're scaling up the systems because response has been tremendous even before the app is available , " he said .
The service , which launched last year , now has more than two million users in the UK , and more than six million across Europe .
It has not yet launched in the United States but says it intends to do so by the end of the year .
The company has already demonstrated an application for mobile phones running Google 's Android software , though that has not been made available to the public .

It is hard enough to set goals and achieve them on your own .
But in times faced with criticism the feat can sometimes seem impossible .
It is not so much that criticism is a bad thing .
In fact , it can even be seen as a necessary thing for anyone on a path towards personal development .
The problem with most criticism however is those on the receiving end have a hard time discerning the good and valuable criticism with those that end up being counterproductive .
What ends up happening is that instead of using criticism to empower us and make us push ourselves forward , we end up folding under pressure or even ignoring our own strength and expertise .
In this article I hope to give a quick outline on how to discern the good criticism from the bad criticism , and how we can use this criticism to improve our life goals and ourselves .
GENERAL GUIDELINE FOR DISCERNING GOOD -BAD CRITICISM
Nowadays especially , everyone is a critic .
This could be due to the ever - growing information age we now live in .
The internet , TV and movies have lead everyone to believe they know a lot more than they really do about the real world .
In one sense , our generation does know much , much more than past generations , and we may be surprised where good criticism can sometimes come from .
But in many other ways we have largely become misinformed , and bad ideas can begin to spread like wild fire .
This ( mis ) information frenzy has left many of us helpless and discombobulated when it comes to picking out the good from the bad , right from the wrong , and truth from the lies .
One of the first things you need to do in the face of criticism is to evaluate the source of it .
Important questions to ask include :
1 . Does this person know me ?
2 . Does this person understand my intentions ?
3 . To what extent does this person have experience with what I am trying to do ?
These types of questions are crucial because they put the criticism into context .
Depending on the answers , some follow - up questions may also be in order .
If the answer to ( 1 ) is “ YES ” , then consider :
A . Is this the type of person who just wants to make me feel happy and pleased or are they actually concerned about me improving my product ?
Your grandparents , for example , may be more likely to fit into the former .
This would mean they are prone to give compliments to practically anything you share with them contrary to the actual quality of what you produced or accomplished .
With this knowing , you will find most of their criticism unhelpful .
If the answer to ( 2 ) is “ NO ” , then consider :
B. Did I not make my intentions clear ?
If someone does n’t seem to understand what you were intending to accomplish then this can mean one of two things .
First , they may just be unfamiliar with what you are doing ( such as criticism from someone about your art even though they have no prior knowledge of art history or that particular style ) .
The second thing to consider is that you did not present your intentions clearly .
The critic may just be unaware of what it was you were trying to accomplish simply because you did not present yourself well .
This is important to keep in mind .
If you find people are continuously misunderstanding your intentions than you may need to reevaluate your approach .
Depending on the answer to ( 3 ) , you must consider how well an “ outsider ” ( someone who has no experience with what you are doing ) can offer criticism to your product .
Just because someone does n’t have experience does n’t mean they cannot give good advice .
At times , I find the best and most brutally honest advice comes from young children , all despite their lack of experience and limited worldview .
After considering the source of the criticism you now have a somewhat good idea on how much weight their words will have .
From here we can focus on the words and criticism itself .
Here are some general indicators of poor criticism :
1. Name - calling and ridiculing
2 . Poor spelling and grammar
3. Irrelevant advice and tangents
4. Sense of hostility or aggression
5 . Curt sentences with no further explanation
On the other hand , indicators of productive criticism can include :
1 . At least one or two compliments on what you are already doing right
2. Good spelling and grammar
3. Clear and elaborate explanations on what to do better
4. Providing helpful examples
5 . A willingness to answer further questions and concerns
HOW TO TAKE CRITICISM
All of the above are general guidelines on how to discern good and bad advice , which can be an incredibly important skill , but what is sometimes even more important is how you take the advice and what you do with it .
Even some of the worst advice can be turned into gold with the right perspective and attitude .
The most important things one can do is to depersonalize the criticism .
This can sometimes be difficult , especially when the criticism itself involves name - calling and ridiculing .
By depersonalizing the criticism , you are detaching your “ core self , ” and instead focusing on the individual behaviors and strategies that need improvement .
Always remember that it is not YOU that is the problem , just your actions that need adjusting .
In Positive Psychology , University of Pennsylvania researcher Martin Seligman came up with the term “ Learned Optimism ” to describe the habit of attributing one ’s failures to causes that are variable ( not permanent ) and specific ( limited to a specific action or set of circumstances ) .
By doing this we are less likely to form limiting beliefs such as : “ I just wo n’t ever be good at this ! ”
By depersonalizing the criticism , we can begin to evaluate its worth from a more objective standpoint .
You can be a better listener , because you are not so concerned with protecting your ego .
Make sure you intently listen to all criticism that you receive , and try to pick out which is helpful and which is garbage .
If there is some advice you do n’t understand then be sure to ask questions .
Good , helpful critics should be more than happy to further explain themselves to benefit your understanding .
If they do n’t respond back to you then it is up to you to interpret the advice to the best of your ability and see if there is anything of value .
Do n’t worry if there is n’t – you may find a lot of criticism just deserves being shoved under the rug .
Do n’t get too hooked up on advice that you do n’t understand .
It may either be over your head , depending on your current skill level , or simply badly constructed advice .

THAT BOILING SENSATION
Every now and then you are going to come across a critic who really gets under your skin and makes your blood boil .
I have had numerous experiences with this and each time it has become a great opportunity for personal growth .
Sometimes you can become so pissed off that if the critic is right there in front of you , you will get a quick urge to just pounce on them and strangle them to death .
It is a really strong feeling and whenever it arises it is a good indicator that there is something to learn .
My first thoughts after encountering such a critic are almost always along the lines of : “ This person is out of their mind to think something like this .
Either that or they are a complete and utter idiot ! ”
I am talking about the critics that really get you fuming – smoke pouring out the ears and all .
What does this sensation mean ?
Yes , perhaps , the critic really is a complete ass or tool .
But whenever I find myself so worked up about something someone has said , I immediately reflect inwards to see what it is exactly that is bothering me to such a degree .
You may find that you need to do a better job at depersonalizing the criticism .
Your reaction is only proving that you took the advice deep in your heart and thus you feel strongly affected by it .
Another possibility is that the critic struck a chord with you on a belief , attitude , or strategy that you had prematurely taken for granted .
By hearing advice that is so in contrast with how you typically view the world , you are bound to get stressed out and upset .
These moments where you find yourself at the will of your anger ( and other strong emotions ) are moments that should be contemplated in solitude or even meditation .
Take a deep breathe , keep your cool , thank the critic for their advice , and then evaluate its value when you have the time by yourself .
Sometimes upon reflection you will find that a large portion of the blame should be placed onto the critic .
They either did n’t understand you or even felt threatened by you .
But because you got so upset by this critique , it is important to also reflect on yourself and your own foundation of attitudes and beliefs .
At the very least , you will find that your view is not the only way to see things and , if you take the advice as a professional , you can use this experience to strengthen yourself in ways that are n’t possible through normal and more friendly - oriented critics .
Remember , even the most successful people on the planet have their fair share of critic rivals .
The difference between the successful and the unsuccessful is that the former knows how to turn every experience into an opportunity to learn and improve .
No matter how likeable and skilled you are , you will never get rid of all your haters .
This is okay as they are only there to strengthen your character .

Nokia is about to launch its own money transfer system , Nokia Money , providing the convenience of banking services to the developing world as well as cashless transfers for everyone else .
Nokia
Money will launch next year , with more details to emerge at the Nokia World next week , but the service is based on that already deployed by Obopay - in whom Nokia has $ 70 m invested - with " uniquely developed mobile elements " that will apparently make the service even more compelling .
The premise is to bring banking services to the billions who currently do n't have a bank account - Nokia reckons only 1.6 billion have bank accounts , while current estimates of mobile phone penetration stand around four billion .
In India the Obopay service operates in conjunction with a bank , allowing users to pay bills , check balances and request funds with simple text messages .
That makes the service cross-network , and available on any handset , though a local application can obviously improve the experience .
Emerging markets will be developed first , which means building a network of Nokia Money agents who can convert hard cash into electronic credit .
But Nokia 's aspirations do n't stop there , as the Finns think we'd all like to use our phones to pay for things :
" For urban consumers ... we are enabling services such as payment of utility bills , purchase of train and movie tickets , top-ups , all through their mobile phones , " says the Nokia release .
Nokia is n't the first company to look at payments via SMS - your correspondent managed to pay for a meal by text back in 2002 , just - but with Nokia 's brand behind it , and a focus on economies where traditional banks are hard to come by , it could be the one that makes it . ®
Artificial intelligence researchers often idealize Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics as the signpost for robot - human interaction .
But some robotics experts say that the concept could use a practical makeover to recognize the current limitations of robots .
Self - aware robots that inhabit Asimov 's stories and others such as " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " and " Battlestar Galactica " remain in the distant future .
Today 's robots still lack any sort of real autonomy to make their own decisions or adapt intelligently to new environments .
But danger can arise when humans push robots beyond their current limits of decision - making , experts warn .
That can lead to mistakes and even tragedies involving robots on factory floors and in military operations , when humans forget that all legal and ethical responsibility still rests on the shoulders of homosapiens .
" The fascination with robots has led some people to try retreating from responsibility for difficult decisions , with potentially bad consequences , " said David Woods , a systems engineer at Ohio State University .
Woods and a fellow researcher proposed revising the Three Laws to emphasize human responsibility over robots .
They also suggested that Earth - bound robot handlers could take a hint from NASA when it comes to robot - human interaction .
Updating Asimov
Asimov's three laws of robotics are set in a future when robots can think and act for themselves .
The first law prohibits robots from injuring humans or allowing humans to come to harm due to inaction , while the second law requires robots to obey human orders except those which conflict with the first law .
A third law requires robots to protect their own existence , except when doing so conflicts with the first two laws .
South Korea has used those " laws " as a guide for its Robot Ethics Charter , but Woods and his colleagues thought they lacked some vital points .
Woods worked with Robin Murphy , a rescue robotics expert at Texas A&M University , to create three laws that recognize humans as the intelligent , responsible adults in the robot - human relationship .
Their first law says that humans may not deploy robots without a work system that meets the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics .
A second revised law requires robots to respond to humans as appropriate for their roles , and assumes that robots are designed to respond to certain orders from a limited number of humans .
The third revised law proposes that robots have enough autonomy to protect their own existence , as long as such protection does not conflict with the first two laws and allows for smooth transfer of control between human and robot .
That means a Mars rover should automatically know not to drive off a cliff , unless human operators specifically tell it to do so .
Woods and Murphy see such revisions as necessary when robotics manufacturers do not recognize the human responsibility for robots .
Murphy said that such attitudes come from a computer software culture , where liability carries less consequence than creating a machine which ends up injuring humans or damaging property .
" What happens is that we 're seeing roboticists who have never done any manufacturing or work in the physical world , and do n't realize that they 're responsible , " Murphy told SPACE.com .
" At the end of the day , if you make something it 's your problem . "
She contrasted that attitude with NASA 's " culture of safety " and methodical approach that carefully tests robotic probes and rovers , recognizes the limits of robots , and tries to ensure that human operators can quickly jump into the driver 's seat when necessary .
NASA 's way
Both Woods and Murphy said they felt very comfortable with NASA 's approach to robot - human interactions , whether it involves the robotic arms on the International Space Station or the Cassini probe making its ongoing tour of the Saturn system .
" They understand how valued a resource these robots are , " Woods explained .
" They know there will be surprises in space exploration . "
Murphy pointed out that NASA 's approach to robots comes from the AI tradition where people do n't make assumptions about having perfect control over everything .
Instead , the space agency has used AI systems that can perform well within normal operating patterns , and can still lean on human assistance for more uncertain situations .
This approach has worked well for NASA in many cases .
For instance , scientists have done skillful troubleshooting with the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity , when the robots encounter unpredictable issues with the Martian terrain and climate .
By contrast , some researchers without an AI background assume that they can program robots that have a complete model or view of the world , and can behave accordingly for any given situation .
This coincides with the temptation to assume that giving robots more autonomy means that they can handle most or all situations on their own .
Murphy cautioned that such a " closed world " approach only works with certain situations that present limited options for an AI .
No matter how much programming goes into robots , the real open world represents a trap - filled pit of unexpected scenarios .
Transfer of control
NASA would undoubtedly still like to see robots that can take on more responsibility , especially during missions when probes travel beyond the moon or Mars .
Researchers have already begun developing next - generation robots that could someday make more of the basic decisions for exploring worlds such as Europa or Titan .
But for now , NASA has recognized that robots still need human supervision — a concept that some robot manufacturers and operators on Earth have more trouble grasping .
Unexpected situations such as robot malfunction or environmental surprises can quickly require humans to regain control of the robot , lest it fail to respond in the right way .
" Right now , what we see over and over again is transfer of control being an issue , " Murphy noted .
She observed how human operators can quickly run into trouble when maneuvering robots and drones around Texas A& M 's " Disaster City , " a training simulation area for rescuers .
Part of the problem also arises when people do not know the capabilities of their robots .
NASA has some luxury in having a team of scientists watch its robotic explorers , rather than single human operators .
But mission controllers also maintain high awareness of the limits of their robotic explorers , and understand how to smoothly take over control .
" They understand that when they have a safe or low - risk envelope , they can delegate more autonomy to the robot , " Woods said .
" When unusual things happen , they restrict the envelope of autonomy . "
Woods compared the situation to parents setting up a safe perimeter within which kids can wander and explore .
That analogy may continue to serve both NASA and other would - be robot handlers .
" People are making this leap of faith that robot autonomy will grow and solve our problems , " Woods added .
" But there 's not a lot of evidence that autonomy by itself will make these hard , high - risk decisions go away . "
A child 's brain has to work overtime in a noisy classroom to do its typical but very important job of distinguishing sounds whose subtle differences are key to success with language and reading .
But that simply is too much to ask of the nervous system of a subset of poor readers whose hearing is fine , but whose brains have trouble differentiating the " ba , " " da " and " ga " sounds in a noisy environment , according to a new Northwestern University study .
" The 'b , ' 'd ' and ' g ' consonants have rapidly changing acoustic information that the nervous system has to resolve to eventually match up sounds with letters on the page , " said Nina Kraus , Hugh Knowles Professor of Communication Sciences and Neurobiology and director of Northwestern 's Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory , where the work was performed .
In other words , the brain 's unconscious faulty interpretation of sounds makes a big difference in how words ultimately will be read .
" What your ear hears and what your brain interprets are not the same thing , " Kraus stressed .
The Northwestern study is the first to demonstrate an unambiguous relationship between reading ability and neural encoding of speech sounds that previous work has shown present phonological challenges for poor readers .
The research offers an unparalleled look at how noise affects the nervous system 's transcription of three little sounds that mean so much to literacy .
The online version of the study will be published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) ( http://www.pnas.org/papbyrecent.shtml) soon and is embargoed until 5 p.m. EDT Monday July 13 .
The new Northwestern study as well as much of the research that comes out of the Kraus lab focuses on what is happening in the brainstem , an evolutionarily ancient part of the brain that scientists in the not too distant past believed simply relayed sensory information from the ear to the cortex .
As such , much of the earlier research relating brain transcription errors to poor reading has focused on the cortex -- associated with high - level functions and cognitive processing .
Focusing earlier in the sensory system , the study demonstrates that the technology developed during the last decade in the Kraus lab now offers a neural metric that is sensitive enough to pick up how the nervous system represents differences in acoustic sounds in individual subjects , rather than , as in cortical - response studies , in groups of people .
Importantly , this metric reflects the negative influence of background noise on sound encoding in the brain .
" There are numerous reasons for reading problems or for difficulty hearing speech in noisy situations , and we now have a metric that is practically applicable for measuring sound transcription deficits in individual children , " said Kraus , the senior author of the study .
" Auditory training and reducing background noise in classrooms , our research suggests , may provide significant benefit to poor readers . "
For the study , electrodes were attached to the scalps of children with good and poor speech - in - noise perception skills .
Sounds were delivered through earphones to measure the nervous system 's ability to distinguish between " ba , " " da " and " ga . "
In another part of the study , sentences were presented in increasingly noisy environments , and children were asked to repeat what they heard .
" In essence , the kids were called upon to do what they would do in a classroom , which is to try to understand what the kid next to them is saying while there is a cacophony of sounds , a rustling of papers , a scraping of chairs , " Kraus said .
In a typical neural system there is a clear distinction in how " ba , " " da " and " ga " are represented .
The information is more accurately transcribed in good readers and children who are good at extracting speech presented in background noise .
" So if a poor reader is having difficulty making sound - to - meaning associations with the ' ba , ' ' da ' and ' ga ' speech sounds , it will show up in the objective measure we used in our study , " Kraus said .
Reflecting the interaction of cognitive and sensory processes , the brainstem response is not voluntary .
" The brainstem response is just what the brain does based on our auditory experience throughout our lives , but especially during development , " Kraus said .
" The way the brain responds to sound will reflect what language you speak , whether you 've had musical experience and how you have used sounds . "
The Auditory Neuroscience Lab has been a frontrunner in research that has helped establish the relationship between sound encoding in the brainstem , and how this process is affected by an individual 's experience throughout the lifespan .
In related research with significant implications , recent studies from the Kraus lab show that the process of hearing speech in noise is enhanced in musicians .
" The very transcription processes that are deficient in poor readers are enhanced in people with musical experience , " Kraus said .
" It makes sense for training programs for poor readers to involve music as well as speech sounds . "

It seems like too much futile work in the heat of August  work bound to lead only to phony conclusions  to decipher how the sanguivorous have become the meat and drink of popular culture at the end of the first decade of the 21st century .
Though here we are in the summer of 2009 with the rage for “ Twilight ” continuing , the vampire movie “ Thirst ” claiming this year ’s jury prize at Cannes , the supernatural series “ Being Human ” on BBC America , and others arriving on CW and AMC .
HBO ’s “ True Blood ” has been credited with revivifying the channel ’s fortunes .
The Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris , which inspired the series , currently occupy seven of the top 20 spots on The New York Times ’s paperback mass - market fiction best - seller list .
The show , a mishmash of Flannery O’Connor aspirations and Anne Rice pop blood hunger , threatens to surpass “ Sex and the City ” as the most - watched series in HBO ’s history after “ The Sopranos . ”

But “ True Blood ” is nothing like its mob-world forebear or anything else on HBO .
Where “ The Sopranos ” had restraint and vast ambition , “ True Blood ” has excess and gall .
During the current season , its second ( the penultimate episode will be shown on Sunday ) , it has become an allegory for nearly every strain of tension in American life , despite a premise that suggested a more contained agenda .
When “ True Blood ” appeared , it was easy to assume it was a metaphor for late - stage capitalism gone haywire , not simply because it began with an insolent store clerk reading Naomi Klein ’s “ Shock Doctrine ” but also because the show seemed predicated on an interest in the retail addict ’s belief that we ’re made of what we buy .
The most heartening employment report since last summer suggested on Friday that a recovery was under way  and perhaps gathering steam  despite the reluctance of the nation ’s businesses to resume hiring or even stop shedding jobs .
Employers eliminated 247,000 jobs in July , a huge number by the standards of an ordinary recession , but the smallest monthly loss since last August , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported .
And the unemployment rate , rising for months , actually ticked down , to 9.4 percent from 9.5 percent in June , mainly because so many people dropped out of the hunt for work , ceasing to list themselves as unemployed .
“ Employers are no longer in a panic , ” said Ian C. Shepherdson , chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics .
“ The pressure they felt to get rid of workers in a hurry is diminishing .
What we do n’t see yet is enough momentum in the economy to convince companies to hire again . ”
Obama administration officials credited the stimulus package , enacted in February , for the continuing improvement , from a peak of 741,000 jobs lost in January .
Some said the July loss would have been closer to 500,000 without the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
The president , appearing briefly in the White House Rose Garden , said his administration had “ rescued our economy from catastrophe . ”
If you ever took Marketing 101 , chances are you 've heard the tale of how the Chevy Nova could n't sell in South America .
The Nova 's sales supposedly tanked because the Spanish phrase " no va " literally translates as " no go . "
The Chevy story is just an urban legend , but truth is often stranger than fiction .

8 The TrekStor i.Beat.blaxx Continue Reading Below Advertisement
In August 2007 , the German electronics manufacturer TrekStor tried to capitalize on the Apple iPod phenomenon with their own MP3 player .
But what to name it ?
They knew they had to get the " i " in front of whatever word they decided on , to bring the iPod to mind .
How about " beat " to signify all of the phat beats the customers will play on it ?
And it 's black .
Thus , i.Beat.blaxx .
TrekStor 's press release claimed that the device " precisely reflects the desires of the young , trend - conscious target group we are aiming for . "
And by that target group , they apparently meant the Klan .
The ensuing shitstorm caught TrekStor by surprise .
The company 's president tried to smooth things over in a letter explaining that the word " beat " is " not meant as a verb , but refers to the beats of the music you are listening to . "
And to be fair , the guy had to wonder what the same protesters thought they would find in the pages of Black Beat magazine .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Knowing that this explanation would placate absolutely no one ( barring that small contingent of confused , hip - hop - loving Klansmen ) ... ...
TrekStor immediately rechristened the gadget the " TrekStor blaxx , " a name which we presume would 've replaced " Geordi La Forge " had Dolemite starred in Star Trek : The Next Generation .
" La Forge , muthafucka ! "

David Moyes has confirmed that Joleon Lescott has been dropped from the Everton squad to face Sigma Olomouc in the Europa League tomorrow .
" Joleon 's attitude has not been right these past days ; he has disappointed me and he has disappointed his team - mates .
He is not in the right frame of mind , " said Moyes .
The defender has been consistently linked with a move to Manchester City and recently handed in a transfer request , which was rejected by Moyes .
The manager refused to comment when asked if Lescott had been training alone before Everton face the Czech side at Goodison Park .
The club have turned down bids of £ 15 m and £ 18 m in recent weeks from Manchester City for the 27 - year - old and Moyes is thought be seeking a £ 30 m transfer fee for the player , though he remains reluctant to sell him at all .
" People can read what they like into this .
But I have said all along I do n't want to sell him .
But it is a bit like Cristiano Ronaldo leaving Manchester United , there is always a price , " said Moyes .
" At this moment no club has made us an offer for the player that we want to accept .
I hope this will all be sorted out , after the [ transfer ] deadline , " he added .
The Everton manager has also criticised the handling of the saga , accusing City 's manager , Mark Hughes , of attempting to destabilise the Merseyside club with their " disgusting " pursuit of the player .

When a powerful earthquake flattened Sichuan province a year ago , community organizer Zhang Guoyuan seized the moment .
Within days , he was running an aid center and warehouse , coordinating 700 volunteers and taking in $ 1.6 million in donated food , medicines , supplies and cash .
Then the police told him to stop .
The catastrophic earthquake last May 12 set off an unprecedented surge of volunteerism in China .
But the government , always wary of groups beyond its control , has since sought to restrain it - with considerable success .
" From the government 's point of view , they 're worried .
They 're afraid we 'll do something , " said Zhang , a fast - talking 29 - year - old who dresses more like the ex-minor official he is than a grassroots campaigner .
" Really all we 're trying to do is make society better . "
The Chinese leadership has long restricted private activist groups , known as non-governmental organizations , or NGOs .
After watching popular movements oust autocratic governments in Ukraine , Georgia and elsewhere earlier this decade , the government redoubled efforts to prevent such groups from becoming a social force that could challenge its authority .
Activists had hoped the quake would change that , opening up more space for private efforts to flourish .
Instead , the magnitude - 7.9 quake unnerved the government .
It killed large numbers of students among the 90,000 dead and missing , sparking national outrage about badly built schools and raising the prospect of protests .
Now , a year after the disaster , hard - to - navigate rules and official suspicion have left groups underfunded and reliant on the government for survival .
The wave of volunteerism has largely dissipated .
" It 's still an authoritarian political system , " said Shawn Shieh , a politics professor at Marist College in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , who is living in Beijing and writing a book on social activism .
" The government is not going to cede much ground . "
The worst natural disaster in a generation , the quake roiled a society grown comfortable with steadily increasing prosperity .
Many , especially younger , Chinese long caught up with making money and used to leaving social problems to the government saw it as a defining moment - their chance to give back .
They poured into the Belgium - sized earthquake zone by the tens of thousands and sent an estimated $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion in donations .
Some piled their cars with instant noodles and bottled water , driving cross-country to deliver relief and dig for survivors in the rubble .
" When the earthquake came , it was an opportunity , " Zhang said .
" I thought , ' China 's NGOs ought to take real action . '
I knew doing so was risky . "
Donors shoveled money and supplies at Zhang 's NGO Disaster Relief Joint Office , formed by 40 activists a day after the quake .
Soon they were running a network of hundreds of volunteers and dozens of trucks .
But the group ran afoul of tightened restrictions on accepting donations and dissolved .
Zhang shrugged off the setback , forming a smaller group that builds community centers for displaced families living in camps of aluminum - sided huts .
Others left or were forced out .
Local officials ran about two dozen volunteers out of the destroyed town of Beichuan , accusing them of stirring up protests by families whose children died in the disaster .
Perhaps 10,000 volunteers still work in the area , probably a tenth or less than last summer , said Gao Wazi , a retired official who runs a liaison office for volunteer groups .
" The government is still pretty strict in managing the disaster area .
We civil groups have limited resources , our level of organization is n't high , the disaster area is large , and information is n't easy to get , " said Gao .
His three - person Sichuan 512 Civil Relief Assistance Services Center operates from two third - floor offices on a $ 14,000 grant that 's supposed to last a year .
" We have n't been able to get funding for an SUV we really need , " Gao said .
Activists are eking out some gains in the quake 's aftermath , Shieh said .
Beijing is allowing the state - backed Chinese Red Cross Foundation to provide a few , better - established groups with funding for the first time .
Overall , however , Beijing has monopolized the reconstruction , allowing the government to claim credit and ensuring that the quake was not the game - changing event activists hoped for .
A key control mechanism is the NGO registration requirements .
Groups must find government sponsors , which weeds out any straying into politically sensitive fields .
Without registration , groups are prohibited from receiving donations .
With donations flooding in , Beijing further tightened rules for quake - related donations , naming only five state - backed groups eligible to receive them .
The net effect of all these rules , activists said , is to reinforce government control .
Because activist groups tend to be small , donors find they need to work through state agencies to run effective programs , said Xu Yongguang , the executive director of the private Narada Foundation and a member of the government 's top consultative body .
" This is how civil donations go round to the government , strengthening the government 's control of resources and contravening the donors ' original intentions , " he groused at a seminar in Beijing in November .
U.S. - trained architect Liu Xiaodu and a dozen colleagues and friends hoped to raise money to design and build appealing , cost - effective schools to replace those toppled by the quake .
They got backing from a wealthy real estate developer and the Lions Club in the southeastern city of Shenzhen .
But authorities refused to register them as an NGO , Liu said .
Unable to receive donations , their funding was routed through an official charity , which passed it on to local governments , giving them a say in the process .
Liu and his colleagues are designing three new schools on the northern fringes of the quake zone .
But they cannot tap the funding to acquire tools and expertise to build up their organization .
" In the future , as an NGO , we could specialize in building schools in poor areas " if the government gives us permission , said Liu , as he watched workers in red hard hats dig 6 - foot - deep holes on a hillside for support columns for the Weizigou village primary school .
" We 've developed expectations and it would be a shame to see them wasted . "
The unlevel playing field trips up even experienced operators such as Zhang , a government insider whose previous work as a community organizer won him official awards as one of " China 's 100 outstanding volunteers . "
After university , Zhang joined the Communist Youth League , which sent him to Panzhihua , a booming steel town deep in the Sichuan hills , in 2004 .
Zhang found his calling , organizing groups that ran education campaigns on women 's rights and labor issues .
His first group , the Panzhihua East District Volunteers Association , attracted funding from the Australian and Canadian governments .
Zhang became a fixture at foreign - funded activist conferences .
His early association with the Youth League taught him a valuable lesson , he said : " Always cooperate with the government . "
In the fast - moving days after the quake , however , Zhang said he misjudged the situation .
Police and Youth League officials from Panzhihua came to investigate how $ 250,000 in donations ended up in his bank account , violating government orders that donations be turned over to state - approved charities .
An audit later cleared Zhang , finding all funds accounted for .
The experience embittered him about government .
But using his official contacts , he registered a new group , the NGO Disaster Preparedness Center , which relies largely on foreign donations .
Zhang carefully tries to bridge the gap between officials and activist groups .
One day , Zhang is lobbying a leading official in Dujiangyan to let him open a community center .
The next , he is toasting the deputy director of Luoshui town at the opening of a hangar - like center at a resettlement camp for 800 families .
Nine small groups , many of them set up by university students , provide services at the center , among them eye exams and activities for children and the elderly .
" It 's a tactic .
You must go in step with the government .
Otherwise there 's trouble .
You 'll have the police , state security , the anti-corruption bureau investigating you , " said Zhang .
To the refugees living in neatly lined huts , the effort pales next to the government's .
" We do n't have to pay for anything - water , electricity .
The government is taking care of everything , " said Zhou Mingnong , a lanky restaurant cook with a family of four .
Zhang does not expect the government to even up the imbalance of power soon .
" Look at the history of our ruling party .
In the past , they relied on urban organizations , labor organizations , youth organizations to create a great force and come to power , " said Zhang .
" They 're not about to let NGOs really join up and get too big .
They 're looking to stabilize their ability to rule . "

Editors know that counterintuitive headlines sell magazines .
They also know that making wildly exaggerated claims can damage their credibility .
Writing a headline is often a balancing act between these two factors .
So when you see a magazine like Forbes say that ExxonMobil is “ Green Company of the Year , ” as it did this month , what it ’s really saying is that it ’s hurting .
With advertising pages way down this year , the magazine feels the need to sell off its long - term credibility with some readers for the short - term gain of boosting page views .
That , at least , is my take on what Forbes was thinking .
Because there ’s simply no way that any serious reporter would wrap Exxon in a shroud of green .
Here ’s Forbes reporter Christopher Helman ’s argument in a nutshell :
By next year , Exxon will become the world ’s top non-governmental producer of natural gas .
Natural gas can replace coal in power plants , resulting in a 40 to 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions .
This would be the most cost - effective way to start addressing global warming .
Therefore , Exxon is “ Green Company of the Year . ”
Helman is not wrong , until he gets to the last part .
His leap in reasoning is like saying that a military dictator is “ Humanitarian of the Year ” because he built 10 new hospitals , but failing to consider that he conducted a genocide .
If that sounds a bit harsh , then consider the truly abysmal nature of Exxon ’s broader environmental record :
1. Exxon has a long history of funding climate change deniers .
And despite a 2008 pledge to discontinue contributions to groups “ whose position on climate change could divert attention ” from the need for clean energy , the company went right on funding them .
2. Exxon is a leading opponent of the Waxman - Markey climate bill , the very legislation that would begin to price dirty coal out of the market .
In May , the Exxon - funded Heritage Foundation released a wildly exaggerated study claiming that an emissions cap will kill millions of jobs and send gas to $ 4 a gallon ( The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found middle - class households would pay only $ 175 a year more in 2020 because of the legislation ) .
And on August 18th , 3,500 energy workers rallied against the climate bill in a Houston demonstration organized by –you guessed it –Exxon and other energy companies , a leaked memo from the American Petroleum Institute reveals .
3. The Exxon Valdez oil spill .
See dictionary entry for “ environmental genocide . ”
4. Exxon is an aggressive player in Canada ’s tar sands , the world ’s top producer of ultra - dirty oil .
5 . The natural gas pumped by Exxon still contributes to climate change .
Indeed , natural gas is currently responsible for about 20 percent of US carbon emissions .
Curtis Brainard points out in his own takedown of the Forbes piece in the Columbia Journalism Review :
A recent study by Carnegie Mellon projected that replacing all coal burning with natural gas would significantly reduce greenhouse - gas emissions , but not enough to meet scientifically recommended targets for mitigating climate change .
Moreover , it ’s fairly ridiculous to suggest , as Helman does in the beginning of his piece , that natural gas will replace all coal burning any time in the near future .
Brainard goes on to point out that natural gas is a “ bridge fuel , ” tiding us over until we ’re able to ramp up lower carbon alternatives .
The race to create those alternatives and dominate an emerging global market in clean tech will be the biggest business story of the next decade–a story that Forbes seems to have forgotten .
Of course , the Forbes ‘ approach clearly is n’t about putting forth a coherent argument or roadmap to the future .
Adding another layer of weirdness , there ’s an accompanying editorial that argues that “ environmentalism is a religion , not a science ” and “ the very thesis that environmental carbon is bad is a matter of faith , not science . ”
Really ?
So then why is Forbes hawking a 2,000 - word feature on how Exxon is so great at cutting environmental carbon ?
Probably for the same reason that Exxon is pumping natural gas : Because there ’s money in it .
Landscape design
The landscape design is an extension of your living area and an essential part of the overall design of your home .
From your front entry to your backyard pool , creating a year - round retreat is one of our favorite aspects of the final design .
The purpose of a successful landscape design is to integrate the architecture with the natural surroundings , creating a unity between your home and nature .

During last week ’s discussion of whether couples choose to learn the sex of their baby before he or she is born , a number of you said you wanted to keep the secret as long as possible , because the moment people hear “ boy ” or “ girl ” they begin to make assumptions about a child .
One couple in Sweden decided to take that logic a few steps further , and are refusing to tell anyone whether their toddler is a boy or a girl .
The child — called Pop in Swedish papers to protect his or her identity — is now two - and - a - half - years - old , and only a handful of close relatives ( those who have changed the child ’s diaper ) know the sex .
Pop ’s parents , who are both 24 , say they made this decision in the hope of freeing their child from the artificial construct of gender .
“ We want Pop to grow up more freely and avoid being forced into a specific gender mould from the outset , ” Pop ’s mother told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet last spring .
“ It ’s cruel to bring a child into the world with a blue or pink stamp on their forehead . ”
Pop wears dresses , and also “ male ” styled pants , and Pop ’s hairstyle changes often , from traditionally feminine to traditionally masculine ( and , one would imagine , to some untraditional styles now and then . )
The online Swedish newspaper , The Local , quotes Anna Nordenström , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet , who wo n’t even hazard a guess as to the long - term effect such an upbringing could have on a child :
“ It will affect the child , but it ’s hard to say if it will hurt the child , ” says Nordenström , who studies hormonal influences on gender development .
“ I do n’t know what they are trying to achieve .
It ’s going to make the child different , make them very special . ”
She says if Pop is still “ genderless ’ ” by the time he or she starts school , Pop will certainly receive a lot of attention from classmates .
“ We do n’t know exactly what determines sexual identity , but it ’s not only sexual upbringing , ” says Nordenström .
“ Gender - typical behaviour , sexual preferences and sexual identity usually go together .
There are hormonal and other influences that we do n’t know that will determine the gender of the child . ”
Pop will soon welcome a brother , or a sister .
Pop ’s parents will not reveal the sex of that child , either , except , perhaps , to Pop .
An Unofficial Q&A about the Discontinuation of the XHTML2 WG
So the W3C finally announced that the XHTML2 WG will be taken off life support at the end of 2009 .
I ’m annoyed that Zeldman used the F - laden TLA “ WTF ” instead of “ AFT ” in title of his post about the announcement .
Moreover , many of the comments on Zeldman ’s post indicate that there are people who are badly misinformed about the matters surrounding this announcement .
To help remedy that , here ’s some quick Q&A for getting informed .
First off , is there anything to disclose ?
I ’ve been working on HTML5 — the main competition of XHTML2 — for a long time .
I get paid for it .
I wrote this Q&A on my own time and it was n’t vetted by anyone prior to publication .
( And yes , this question is copied from Steve O’Grady . )
What was announced ?
The W3C management has decided to allow the charter of the XHTML2 Working Group to expire at the end of 2009 and not to renew it .
What ’s XHTML ?
There are two meanings to XHTML : technical and marketing .
The technical kind ( XHTML served using the application / xhtml+xml MIME type ) is a formulation of HTML as an XML vocabulary .
The marketing kind ( XHTML served using the text / html MIME type ) is processed just like HTML by browsers but the authors attempt to observe slightly different syntax rules in order to make it seem that they are doing something newer and shinier compared to HTML .
( Note added 2009 - 07 - 07 : I apologize to authors who are using XHTML and got offended .
The “ in order to ” part of the previous sentence was meant as a jibe at gurus who used XHTML as a marketing platform but gave pseudo - technical reasons e.g. about parsing and mobile clients — not at people who listened to them . )
What ’s XHTML2 ?
XHTML2 was a new language similar to XHTML but incompatible with it .
It was n’t an XML formulation of any HTML spec .
Was XHTML2 being implemented ?
Not in any of the top 5 browsers .
There was an experimental implementation of an old draft years ago in a research browser .
What was the XHTML2 WG working on ?
The XHTML2 WG was working on several things :
The XHTML2 language
Editorial revisions to previously published XHTML 1.0 , XHTML 1.1 , XHTML Basic , XHTML Print and XHTML Modularization specifications
XSD schemas for XHTML 1.1 , XHTML Basic and XHTML Print
RDFa
A specification for an attribute called role
XML Events ( though it seems the WG has n’t actively worked on it recently )
XFrames ( though it seems the WG has n’t actively worked on it recently )
Did the W3C kill XHTML2 ?
No , XHTML2 was already dead for all practical purposes due to its failure to be backwards compatible and its failure to deliver compelling new features .
The W3C just announced they will take it off life support .
What happens to XHTML 1.x specs ?
If the XHTML2 WG completes its editorial revisions by the end of the year , it ’s possible that they publish editorial revisions as new Editions of the previous Recommendations .
What happens to RDFa ?
RDFa ( in XHTML but not in HTML ! ) is a W3C Recommendation and , as such , does n’t need any terminating action per the W3C Process .
It ’s unclear if another WG will develop further RDFa specs .
What happens to the role attribute ?
Most likely an ARIA - only CURIEless incarnation of the role attribute will find its way into HTML 5 as the ARIA specs mature .
What happens to the other XHTML2 WG deliverables ?
According to the FAQ published by the W3C , the XML events spec will likely end up in the Forms Working Group ( the group working on XForms ) , Access modules will likely end up in the HTML WG and the remaining deliverables will end up as Working Group Notes .
Personally , I doubt that the Access module will be supported by consensus at the HTML WG .
What ’s the HTML WG ?
The HTML WG is another W3C working group that is working on HTML 5 together with the WHATWG .
What ’s the WHATWG ?
The WHATWG is a group that individuals from Apple , Mozilla and Opera founded outside the W3C in order to evolve HTML when the W3C told them that work was n’t welcome within the W3C .
Later , the W3C changed its mind , renamed the previous HTML WG into XHTML2 WG and formed a new HTML WG .
If the remaining deliverables of the XHTML2 WG are going to be published as Notes , does it mean the W3C endorses them after all ?
No .
The W3C Process does n’t allow a document to be simply abandoned once it has been published as a First Public Working Draft .
The documents have to end up as either Recommendations or Notes .
Groups that are still within charter can stall their abandoned deliverables indefinitely , but the upcoming expiration of the XHTML2 WG charter will force the adherence to the W3C Process on this point .
Is the W3C dropping work on XHTML ?
No .
The HTML WG is defining XHTML5 which is an XML serialization for HTML5 .
I ’ve published Web pages using XHTML 1.0 or XHTML 1.1 .
Do I need to rewrite them now ?
No .
They will continue to function as before .
What ’s the upgrade path from XHTML 1.x ?
For the technical kind of XHTML 1.x — that is , XHTML served as application / xhtml+xml — the upgrade path is to XHTML5 .
For the marketing kind of XHTML 1.x — that is , XHTML served as text / html — the upgrade path is to HTML5 .
Moreover , “ HTML5 ” replaces “ XHTML ” ( and “ Ajax ” ! ) as the coolest marketing buzzword .
What ’s HTML5 ?
HTML5 is a new level of the Web ’s most significant markup language .
New features provide better support for Web applications , for video and audio and for expressing document structure .
This language is defined in a specification called HTML 5 .
“ HTML5 ” is also used as a marketing buzzword for all the new cool features in the browser platform — even for features that have never been in the HTML 5 spec or that have been spun off it .
Video ?
Was n’t video removed from HTML5 recently ?
No .
That ’s a bogus rumor .
( What was removed was some placeholder text about codecs . )
Is HTML5 being implemented ?
Yes .
Firefox , Opera , Safari , Chrome and IE implement bits and pieces of HTML5 — even more so in nightly builds than in releases .
The future is already here .
It just is n’t evenly distributed yet .
If I upgrade from XHTML - served - as- text / html to HTML5 , do I need to revise all my empty tags ?
No. HTML5 permits both the XHTML - style syntax ( < br / > ) and the HTML 4 - style syntax ( < br > ) for void elements ( elements that never take any content ) .
Is XHTML5 more semantic than HTML5 ?
No .
Can I serve XHTML5 as text / html ?
You can ’t .
HTML5 and XHTML5 are defined in terms of MIME type , so text / html is n’t XHTML5 by definition .
Can a document be both HTML5 and XHTML5 if I serve it as text / html to IE and as application / xhtml+xml to other browsers ?
It is possible to construct documents that are valid HTML5 when labeled as text / html and valid XHTML5 when labeled as application / xhtml+xml .
Doing so is much harder than it first appears and is most often useless , so you ’d probably spend your time better by not trying .
Can HTML5 be validated ?
Yes .
With an HTML5 validator .
Which one should I use : HTML5 or XHTML5 ?
In most cases , the answer is HTML5 .
XHTML5 does n’t work in IE .
( Just like technical XHTML has never worked in IE .
Only the marketing kind of XHTML has worked in IE . )
What if I want to include SVG or MathML inline ?
You will be able to use SVG and MathML inline in text / html once browsers upgrade their parsers .
You can test this today by downloading a nightly build of Firefox , going to about : config and flipping the preference html5.enable to true .
( Demo page . )
However , for the time being , to use inline SVG or MathML with released versions of Firefox , Opera , Safari or Chrome you need to use application / xhtml+xml instead .
What ’s the doctype for HTML5 documents ?
Simply : <! DOCTYPE html >
What ’s the doctype for XHTML5 documents ?
application / xhtml+xml documents do n’t need a doctype .
XHTML5 can use any doctype ( or none ) , because any other requirement would reach onto the XML layer and violate the clean layering of XHTML5 and XML .
For simplicity , I suggest you use no doctype for XHTML5 .
( Yes , the XHTML 1.0 specification violates clean layering . )
If I can use any doctype for XHTML5 , how can browsers tell XHTML 1.0 and XHTML5 apart ?
They ca n’t and they do n’t need to .
By design , a user agent that implements XHTML5 will process inputs authored as XHTML 1.0 appropriately .
I ’m using XML tools to consume content .
What do I do with HTML5 ?
When your application receives content labeled as application / xhtml+xml , instantiate an XML parser .
When your application receives content labeled as text / html , instantiate an HTML5 parser .
There are now off - the - shelf HTML5 parsers ( such as the Validator . nu HTML Parser ) that expose an XML API so your application sees an infoset that looks just like the infoset from an XML parser parsing the equivalent XHTML5 document .
I ’m using XML tools to generate content .
What should I do ?
If you do n’t care about IE , you can use an XML serializer and serialize to XHTML5 ( application / xhtml+xml ) .
However , if you do care about IE , you can use an HTML5 serializer and serialize from an XML pipeline to text / html .
In this case , you must avoid constructs that are n’t supported in text / html ( e.g. div as a child of p ) .
But XSLT and XPath do n’t work with HTML !
Incorrect .
As mentioned above , HTML5 parsers expose an infoset equivalent to an XML parser parsing XHTML5 .
The Validator .nu HTML Parser comes with a sample application for using the JDK XSLT engine with HTML5 inputs .
Do semantics round - trip in an HTML5 to XHTML5 to HTML5 conversion ?
Yes , provided that the first HTML5 input is valid and you do n’t ascribe semantics to characters that are n’t allowed in XML ( such as form feed or U+FFFF ) .
Note that RDFa is n’t valid in either HTML5 or XHTML5 as currently drafted .
What about XHTML5 to HTML5 to XHTML5 ?
Not if namespace - based extensibility is used .
However , in the common case , the conversion chain does round trip if the input is valid XHTML5 + SVG 1.1 + MathML 2.0 ( this excludes RDFa ) , does n’t use namespaces from outside those specs ( It ’s debatable if the previous condition already covers this . ) , xml : space on HTML elements is not considered to affect semantics and relative URLs are rewritten so that xml : base attributes can be removed without breaking links .
( Answer clarified / corrected 2009 - 07-07 . )
What ’s the namespace for HTML5 ?
HTML elements are in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace .
You do n’t need to declare this namespace in text / html .
An HTML5 parser puts HTML elements in the namespace automatically .
So does HTML5 support namespaces ?
There ’s no syntax for declaring namespaces in text / html .
Syntax that looks like a namespace declaration has no effect .
However , the HTML5 parsing algorithm automatically assigns stuff to namespaces appropriately .
Does XHTML5 support namespaces ?
Yes .
XHTML5 is layered on top of XML plus Namespaces .
Are the semantics of HTML5 extensible ?
Yes .
With microdata .
Is it true that HTML5 has fewer accessibility features than XHTML 1.x ?
No. HTML5 has a larger number of accessibility features , but it is n’t obvious that they are accessibility features , because by design they have n’t been designed solely for accessibility but provide opportunities for enhanced accessibility as a side effect of something else .
Will Zeldman now just do s/XHTML / HTML5 / in all his books and republish ?
No .
He says that conjecture is “ Wrong as prohibition ” .

Electron picture of a chondrule , part of a meteorite 4.5 billion years old
Scientists have found a new way to time events in the early Solar System .
Writing in the journal Science , they describe how aluminium radioisotopes can now offer precise timing of events 4.5 billion years ago .
The study shows that the rate of decay of isotopes can now be relied upon to give accurate measures of time for that period .
It is hoped that this will give new insights into how the Solar System formed in its first five million years .
The scientists showed how aluminium radioisotopes were uniformly distributed in the region where the Solar System was formed .
As the isotopes decayed steadily across the early Solar System , this allows their use as a type of clock for that period .
One of the scientists , Johan Villeneuve , told BBC News : " we can now use the isotopes to measure the age of different chondrules , parts of meteorites , and understand far more about the early part of our Solar System " .
The findings could also shed light on the origins of the planets .
Philip Bland , from Imperial College London , described the research as " a really nice study " .
" With their high precision measurements , they are able to date formation times for chondrules very precisely , " he said .
" And what is interesting is that they 've shown that these building blocks for asteroids , and possibly for planets as well , formed over an extended period of two to three million years . "
Posted by John , December 29th , 2008 - under Palestine .
Israel is a terrorist state .
It was founded on the genocide of the Palestinian people , dividing their land into two States .
The Zionists then drove hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the artificially created state .
The present attacks on Gaza represent but another chapter in the 60 years of genocide against Palestinians .
Genocide ?
The facts and figures in the paragraphs below come from Israel : the Hijack State by John Rose from Britain ’s Socialist Workers ’ Party .
They seem to me to justify the argument that Israel was founded on genocidal terror against Palestinians .
At Deir Yassin , the Irgun murdered between 200 and 300 men , women and children .
It is recognised now as a historical reality , a reality that was used in other towns and villages to drive Palestinians out .
According to Benny Morris , an Israeli historian , an Israeli intelligence report of June 1948 says that on the eve of the UN partition Plan Resolution of 29 November 1947 , there were 219 Arab villages and four Arab , or partly Arab , towns in the areas earmarked for Jewish statehood .
The total Arab population then was 342000 .
By 1 June , 180 of these villages and towns had been evacuated with 239,000 fleeing the Jewish state areas .
Another 152000 Arabs fled areas earmarked for the Palestinian state .
Why ?
The intelligence branch says the major cause was hostile [ JP – i.e. Haganah / Isaraeli Defence Force ] operations .
In other words the Israelis drove out somewhere close to 400,000 Palestinians from their homes as part of their objective to expand their borders and create an exclusive Jewish state .
In the present criminal actions , the Israeli state is targeting not just military installations but a University , police stations , Government buildings , civil defence organisations and some mosques .
The Palestinians say that after the fourth day of air strikes there are 370 dead .
The UN estimates about 70 of those are women and children .
There are acording to the Palestinians 1600 wounded .
The Israeli blockade of Gaza has destroyed or severely weakened the Palestinian hospital system so we can expect some of the injured to die soon .
This action is a crime against humanity .
How are students , police , government employees and civil defence personnel legitimate targets ?
And Israel knows that bombing anywhere in Gaza , because of the population density , will kill innocents .
This action is deliberately aimed at cowering the Palestinian people and Hamas , their legitimate and democratic representative .
All it will do is reinforce the cycle of violence and see the futility of Palestinian rockets and suicide bombers re-emerge and grow in number .
Yet the West remains silent in the face of these Israeli crimes .
Israel is America ’s watchdog in the region and its actions help US imperialism by creating mayhem and confusion among the Arab masses , enabling the US to control the region , in particular oil and its flows .
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard has condemned Hamas and supported Israel .
Such is the logic of Australian imperialism which ties itself to a big power ( now the US ) to enable it to pursue its own interests in our immediate region and as an insurance policy for the future .
These criminal attacks show the real nature of Israel – an illegitimate state born of and continuing to use terror as its main weapon against the Palestinians .
For over sixty years the Palestinians ’ crime has been to be Palestinian and to live in Palestine .
This is not about stopping rockets .
Hamas stupidly thought that lobbing missiles into open spaces in Israel would see the blockade lifted .
But Israel is going to an election in February .
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu from the extremist Likud party is ahead in the polls .
He supports the attacks .
Tzivi Lipni is Foreign Minister and will be Kadima ’s candidate for PM .
Ehud Barak heads Labour and is the Defence Minister .
So Livni and Barak have been driving the Government to launch this criminal attack on Gaza to boost their election chances in February .
All three have said toppling Hamas , the democratically elected governing party , is a priority .
Of course , if the terror attacks on Gaza and the forthcoming possible invasion do n’t work , the election is Netanyahu’s .
Even if they do “ succeed ” in killing more Palestinians and toppling Hamas , Netanyahu can argue that the other two followed his lead and acted too late anyway .
300 dead and more on the way – all for electoral advantage .
Such is the moral bankruptcy of Zionism , the racist ideology that excludes or wants to exclude all but Jews from Israel .
Some want to create Greater Israel without any Palestinians , ie driving them out again .
The Arab masses are angry .
If that anger could be turned as well against their dictatorships and a US puppet like Mubarak fell , that would be a step forward for Palestine .
As I have argued previously the solution cannot be two states .
That formalises and legitimises further the genocide .
The solution must be one state for two peoples .
No solution will come from Obama or the Europeans or the UN .
US imperialism dominates the region and Barack will therefore support his attack dog .
The UN is a puppet of the imperialist powers .
The Security Council is the classic example , beholden to major imperialist powers .
In any event when convenient ( eg Iraq ) the US acts unilaterally .
The Arab masses hold the key .
Revolutions across the region can liberate Palestine .
The mass of Arabs overthrowing the criminal dictatorships which rule them will unleash the incredible power of Arab workers and peasants and force Israel to stop its terrorist activities .
It might make the US see its policy of support for Israel as a failure since the masses now control the region , not the Americans and Israel .
Until that happens however the logic of imperialism and racism will see the Israeli terror and genocide continue .
The FDIC Is Broke .
Now What ?

Was India 's third prime minister , Lal Bahadur Shastri , murdered ?
Officially , the diminutive leader died of a heart attack in a dacha in Tashkent , hours after he signed a peace agreement with the Pakistani president , Ayub Khan , on 11 January 1966 , some four months after the end of the second war between the two neighbours .
But if you believe surviving members of Mr Shastri 's family and an enthusiastic Delhi - based journalist , Mr Shastri was possibly poisoned .
What has added grist to the conspiracy mill is the Indian government 's refusal to declassify a document it has in its possession pertaining to Mr Shastri 's death .
In response to a right to information request by the enterprising Anuj Dhar , a journalist and a self - proclaimed " declassification enthusiast " , the prime minister 's office said that making public that document could " harm foreign relations , cause disruption in the country and cause breach of parliamentary privileges " .
Totally non-controversial in his life , Mr Shastri has become controversial in death .
I did a little digging around and found that most of the better - known accounts of Mr Shastri 's death have raised no doubts - death by heart failure .
In his magisterial India After Gandhi , historian Ramachandra Guha writes Mr Shastri " died in his sleep of a heart attack " .
In her biography of Indira Gandhi , Katherine Frank writes that after he " went to bed in the early hours of the 11th January , Mr Shastri had a fatal heart attack " .
The most vivid account is in my dog eared copy of the long out - of - print book India , The Critical Years by veteran Indian journalist Kuldip Nayar .
He was part of the prime minister 's travelling press corps to Tashkent .
Mr Nayar writes that the Indian prime minister was already a heart patient , having suffered two attacks .
He had had a hectic day , holding talks with the Russian premier , Alexey Kosygin - the Russians having brokered the pact - and his officials and had had very little sleep .
" That evening , " writes Mr Nayar , " I met by chance his personal physican Dr RN Chugh , who accompanied him .
I asked him how Shastri was standing the strain .
He looked up to the sky and said : ' Everything is in the hands of God ' . "
Mr Nayar does not elaborate .
Mr Nayar then proceeds to describe the fateful night in Agatha Christie - like detail .
Since he was to travel in the prime minister 's airplane early next morning to Kabul en route to Delhi , he retired to bed early an hour before midnight .
" I must have been dozing when someone knocked at my door and said : ' Your prime minister is dying . '
A Russian lady was waking up all the journalists , " writes Mr Nayar .
A group of journalists then sped to Mr Shastri 's dacha from the hotel .
On arriving , Mr Nayar found a grief - stricken Mr Kosygin standing on the verandah .
" He could not speak and only lifted his hands to indicate Shastri was no more . "
When Mr Nayar went in , he found Dr Chugh being questioned by a group of Soviet doctors through an interpreter .
In the next room Mr Shastri lay still on his bed .
The journalists emptied the flower vases in the room and spread them on the prime minister 's body .
Mr Nayar also noticed an overturned thermos flask on a dressing table some 10 feet away from Mr Shastri 's bed and wondered whether the prime minister had struggled to get to open it to get water .
" His slippers were neatly placed near the bed ; it meant that he walked barefoot up to the dressing table in the carpeted room , " Mr Nayar writes .
Mr Nayar then pieces together the events leading up to Mr Shastri 's death - of how the prime minister reached the dacha around 10 pm after a reception , chatted with his personal staff and asked his cook Ram Nath to bring him food " which was prepared in the dacha by the Russians " .
It gets more interesting from here .
" In the kitchen there was a Soviet cook helped by two ladies - both from the Russian intelligence department - and they tasted everything , including water , before it was served to Mr Shastri , " Mr Nayar writes .
Remember this was at the height of the Cold War and India - Pakistan hostilities and the security paranoia was extreme .
As Mr Shastri tucked into a frugal spinach and potato curry meal , he received a call from a personal assistant in Delhi and sought the reaction to the Tashkent agreement back home .
Then he spoke to his family in Delhi .
He asked his eldest daughter , Kusum , about how she had found the peace pact .
" She replied , 'we have not liked it ' , " writes Mr Nayar .
" He asked ' what about her mother ? '
She too had not liked the declaration , was the reply given . "
A crestfallen Mr Shastri , according to Mr Nayar , then remarked : " If my own family has not liked it , what will the outsiders say ? "
Mr Nayar writes that the prime minister 's wife did not come on the line to talk despite many requests - a contention that is disputed by many of his surviving family members .
This upset Mr Shastri .
" He began pacing up and down the room ...
For one who had had two heart attacks earlier , the telephone conversation and the walking must have been a strain , " he writes .
Then his staff gave him milk and some water in the flask .
Around 1.30 am , his personal assistant Sahai , according to Mr Nayar , saw Mr Shastri at his door , asking with difficulty , " Where is the doctor ? "
The staff woke up Dr Chugh , while the prime minister 's staff , assisted by Indian security men , helped Mr Shastri walk back to his room .
" If it was a heart attack - myocardiac infarction , and obstruction of blood supply to the heart muscles , as the Soviet doctors said later - this walk , " writes Mr Nayar , " must have been fatal . "
Mr Nayar writes - presumably from an eyewitness account by the personal assistant - that Mr Shastri began coughing " rockingly " , touched his chest and became unconscious .
Dr Chugh arrived soon after , felt the prime minister 's pulse , gave an injection into the heart , tried mouth - to - mouth resuscitation , but to no avail .
More doctors arrived .
They found Mr Shastri dead .
The time of the death was 1.32 am .
Talk about foul play began as soon as the body arrived in Delhi .
Mr Nayar says the prime minister 's wife asked him why Mr Shastri 's body had turned blue .
He told her that when " bodies are embalmed " they turn blue .
Mrs Shastri was not convinced .
She asked about " certain cuts " on Mr Shastri 's body .
Mr Nayar told her he had n't seen any .
" Apparently , she and others in the family suspected foul play , " Mr Nayar writes .
They still do .
I went to meet Sidharth Nath Singh , the prime minister 's grandson and a senior member of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party , recently to hear the family side of the story .
He told me that Mr Nayar 's account of the telephone conversation that Mr Shastri had with his family members that night was inaccurate , and that he HAD spoken to his wife .
Mr Singh , who was two years old when his grandfather died , says that one person was detained on " suspicion of poisoning Mr Shastri " , but was released .
Mr Nayar 's book has no mention of this .
" Knowing the truth is important for our family .
The truth has never been out , " Mr Singh told me .
Then he talked about the cold war politics of the day , and who would have gained from poisoning Mr Shastri who had served as prime minister for only 19 months : a foreign power , political rivals .
Some of it sounds remotely credible ; other bits outlandish .
But Mr Singh and the nation deserve to know why the government is holding the paper about Mr Shastri 's death back .
How will it imperil our foreign relations ?
With whom ?
India has a notoriously stodgy reputation as far as declassifying historical documents is concered ; the state almost encourages a statist historiography .
The truth should be out and the controversy should be buried , once for and all .

A few years ago , researchers at the National Institute of Health and Nutrition in Japan put rats through a series of swim tests with surprising results .
They had one group of rodents paddle in a small pool for six hours , this long workout broken into two sessions of three hours each .
A second group of rats were made to stroke furiously through short , intense bouts of swimming , while carrying ballast to increase their workload .
After 20 seconds , the weighted rats were scooped out of the water and allowed to rest for 10 seconds , before being placed back in the pool for another 20 seconds of exertion .
The scientists had the rats repeat these brief , strenuous swims 14 times , for a total of about four - and - a - half minutes of swimming .
Afterward , the researchers tested each rat ’s muscle fibers and found that , as expected , the rats that had gone for the six - hour swim showed preliminary molecular changes that would increase endurance .
But the second rodent group , which exercised for less than five minutes also showed the same molecular changes .
The potency of interval training is nothing new .
Many athletes have been straining through interval sessions once or twice a week along with their regular workout for years .
But what researchers have been looking at recently is whether humans , like that second group of rats , can increase endurance with only a few minutes of strenuous exercise , instead of hours ?
Could it be that most of us are spending more time than we need to trying to get fit ?
The answer , a growing number of these sports scientists believe , may be yes .
“ There was a time when the scientific literature suggested that the only way to achieve endurance was through endurance - type activities , ” such as long runs or bike rides or , perhaps , six - hour swims , says Martin Gibala , PhD , chairman of the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University in Ontario , Canada .
But ongoing research from Gibala ’s lab is turning that idea on its head .
In one of the group ’s recent studies , Gibala and his colleagues had a group of college students , who were healthy but not athletes , ride a stationary bike at a sustainable pace for between 90 and 120 minutes .
Another set of students grunted through a series of short , strenuous intervals : 20 to 30 seconds of cycling at the highest intensity the riders could stand .
After resting for four minutes , the students pedaled hard again for another 20 to 30 seconds , repeating the cycle four to six times ( depending on how much each person could stand ) , “ for a total of two to three minutes of very intense exercise per training session , ” Gibala says .
Each of the two groups exercised three times a week .
After two weeks , both groups showed almost identical increases in their endurance ( as measured in a stationary bicycle time trial ) , even though the one group had exercised for six to nine minutes per week , and the other about five hours .
Additionally , molecular changes that signal increased fitness were evident equally in both groups .
“ The number and size of the mitochondria within the muscles ” of the students had increased significantly , Gibala says , a change that , before this work , had been associated almost exclusively with prolonged endurance training .
Since mitochondria enable muscle cells to use oxygen to create energy , “ changes in the volume of the mitochondria can have a big impact on endurance performance . ”
In other words , six minutes or so a week of hard exercise ( plus the time spent warming up , cooling down , and resting between the bouts of intense work ) had proven to be as good as multiple hours of working out for achieving fitness .
The short , intense workouts aided in weight loss , too , although Gibala had n’t been studying that effect .
“ The rate of energy expenditure remains higher longer into recovery ” after brief , high - intensity exercise than after longer , easier workouts , Gibala says .
Other researchers have found that similar , intense , brief sessions of exercise improve cardiac health , even among people with heart disease .
There ’s a catch , though .
Those six minutes , if they ’re to be effective , must hurt .
“ We describe it as an ‘ all - out ’ effort , ” Gibala says .
You ’ll be straying “ well out of your comfort zone . ”
That level of discomfort makes some activities better - suited to intense training than others .
“ We have n’t studied runners , ” Gibala says .
The pounding involved in repeated sprinting could lead to injuries , depending on a runner ’s experience and stride mechanics .
But cycling and swimming work well .
“ I ’m a terrible swimmer , ” Gibala says , “ so every session for me is intense , just because my technique is so awful . ”
Meanwhile , his lab is studying whether people could telescope their workouts into even less time .
Could a single , two - to three - minute bout of intense exercise confer the same endurance and health benefits as those six minutes of multiple intervals ?
Gibala is hopeful .
“ I ’m 41 , with two young children , ” he says .
“ I do n’t have time to go out and exercise for hours . ”
The results should be available this fall .

Brandon Marshall admitted after practice on Wednesday that he is n’t close to knowing the Broncos playbook , which changed following the hiring of new head coach Josh McDaniels .
From the Colorado Springs Gazette :
After basically disengaging himself from practice by standing with the defensive players on the sideline and not taking any normal repetitions during 11 - on - 11 drills ( he said it is because he is “ not close ” to learning the playbook ) , Broncos receiver Brandon Marshall reiterated he is not happy with the team .
He was asked if there were irreconcilable differences with the team .
“ Unfortunately , sometimes it gets to that point , ” Marshall said .
“ There are trust issues on both sides .
It ’s understandable .
We ’ve got to try our best to move forward . ”
He said he was starting to work past his issues with the team , but he was upset on Friday when he said a public - relations staffer told Broncos players not to act too happy for Marshall after he was found not guilty of a misdemeanor battery charge in Atlanta .
“ I think the biggest thing was , it was really disappointing hearing that some of my teammates on one of the best days of … for the past three years , of my life , some of my teammates were coached to say ‘ Do n’t say you ’re happy for Brandon , ' ” Marshall said .

This is just way too exciting !
WordPress which is THE CMS of choice for blogge rs did has such a big security hole !
Someone has found a way to reset the admin password without any confirmation and this can have serious consequences .
The hack is still open and can even be applied to the latest WordPress release 2.8.3
This is how it works :
The normal password reset page asks you to enter the username or email address and if that ’s correct then a link is send to the email address associated with that account to reset your password but note that the password itself is not changed and you can just ignore the email and carry on .
But hackers have found a way in which they simply bypass that check and the password is reset by passing a special value in the key parameter of the reset page URL .
This is all you have todo :
https://www.domainname.com/wp-login.php?action=rp&key[]=
Replace domainname with any domain name of a blog hosted on WordPress and see it for yourself !
Do n’t waste time trying this on ProgrammerFish.com " >
ProgrammerFish because I have already secured it .
If you also want to know the fix then better search it yourself or wait for my update and until that time let me test this on some more blogs .
Here is a list of blogs that I have tried this hack on .
Sorry guys .
You can always restore your passwords though .
1 ) Our very own ProgrammerFish.com " > ProgrammerFish .
Cannot be exploited now though
2 ) TechToggle – I really like this blog though
3 ) TutPlus – Yeah yeah yeah !
4 ) Tutorial9
5 ) WordPress Founder ’s Personal Blog ! ma.tt [ Am not sure whether its reset or not but I think it is ]
6 ) Noupe
7 ) PKPolitics
There are a couple others I tried this on and none of them was protected !
Note : I have just tried this as a proof - of - concept and nothing more then that .
You will get an email with your new password and can always reset it yourself again .
And sorry guys , OpenSource is not the best thing on earth !

Zeta is the name of a virtual platform , or architecture .
There are specifications ( see the handbook ) , and a basic , not - yet - optimised emulator ( cpu , ram , clock , mainboard ) .
The architecture is simple , barely having the minimum needed to run linux with MMU .
The purpose is to play with the toolchain and the linux kernel , to learn more about those core technologies .
Binutils and gcc are already ported at 80 % .
( No static lib nor PIC code yet , userland compilation untested . )
Using those tools ( as " cross- compilers " ) , the real work can now begin : porting linux to Zeta .
This is still work in progress .
This kernel is called ZetaLinux .
Zeta is designed and written by Thomas Capricelli
Zeta 0.7 was released in late november 2009 .
This release is based on :
Version of external tools used :
binutils 2.20 gcc 4.4.0 linux kernel 2.6.32-rc8
The whole toolchain was tested on i386 and amd64 host platforms .
Very quick start ¶
You can download the kernel ( vmlinux - zeta - 0.x.raw ) and the main tarball ( zeta-0.x.tar.bz2 ) from the file tab , compile the emulator from the ' emulator ' directory by doing :
orzel@berlioz zeta % make ramdisk .romfs orzel@berlioz zeta % cd emulator orzel@berlioz zeta/emulator % make
And then start the kernel :
orzel@berlioz zeta/emulator % ./ load_kernel < path to your vmlinux - zeta-0.x.raw >
I 'll let you find out from the quickstart how to use the gui emulator to do the same .
Get the code ¶
Zeta -binutils is a port of binutils to Zeta
Zeta -gcc is a port of gcc to Zeta
Zeta -linux is a port of the linux kernel to Zeta
Zeta is the main repository , with specification , documentation , test cases and the emulator .
There are four components :
The last releases are available from the file tab at the top of this page .
If you feel like using the bleeding edge development , you can also fetch the very latest code from our source control .
I use mercurial ( homepage ) for this , and highly recommend it .
The repositories are available from http://sources.freehackers.org
We will describe here a kind of '' ' Zeta Demonstration ' ' ' .
The aim is for you to have a zeta kernel booting on your computer starting from nothing .
This is the quickstart for Zeta 0.7 , it will probably not apply " as - is " to other versions .
Zeta source code for the four components ( see at the beginning of this page ) .
250 Mb of free space on you hard disk .
/ opt /zeta writable by your user account .
What you need :
( You can edit the top of zeta.binutils / Makefile and zeta.gcc / Makefile if you want to use something else than / opt / zeta )
From the Zeta repository , check your environment :
orzel@berlioz zeta % make check
Host tools checked : genromfs : genromfs 0.5.2 gmake : GNU Make 3.81 Binutils : GNU ld ( GNU Binutils ) 2.20 GCC : gcc ( Gentoo 4.4.2 p1.0 ) 4.4.2 ( Everything seems ok )
Install the binutils from your checkout of zeta.binutils
orzel@berlioz zeta.binutils % make install
That should end with something like
... gmake [ 4 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.binutils/build/libiberty/testsuite ' gmake [ 3 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.binutils/build/libiberty ' gmake [ 2 ] : Nothing to be done for `install - target '. gmake [ 2 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.binutils / build ' gmake [ 1 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.binutils/build ' orzel@berlioz zeta.binutils %
Install gcc from your checkout of zeta.gcc
orzel@berlioz zeta.gcc % make install
That should end with something like
... gmake [ 4 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.gcc/build/zeta-unknown-linux/libgcc' gmake [ 3 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.gcc/build/zeta-unknown-linux/libgcc' gmake [ 2 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.gcc/build ' gmake [ 1 ] : Leaving directory `/home / orzel/hg/zeta.gcc/build ' orzel@berlioz zeta.gcc%
The next step is to check your toolchain .
You do so by following the description on global tests .
We can now cross compile the zeta kernel , from your checkout of zeta.linux :
orzel@berlioz zeta.linux % make oldconfig # just in case orzel@berlioz zeta.linux % make clean # just in case orzel@berlioz zeta.linux % make (... ) AS .tmp_kallsyms2.o LD vmlinux SYSMAP System.map SYSMAP .tmp_System.map
/opt/zeta/bin/zeta-unknown-linux-objcopy
- O binary -R .note -R .comment -R .stab -R .stabstr - S vmlinux vmlinux.raw orzel@berioz zeta.linux %
Now we compile the emulator , from the main ' zeta ' repository / checkout .
You need to give the path to the ' vmlinux.raw ' file in your zeta.linux checkout , which , on my computer is ~/hg/zeta.linux/vmlinux.raw :
orzel@berlioz zeta % cd emulator orzel@berlioz zeta/emulator % make orzel@berlioz zeta/emulator % ./load_kernel ~/hg/zeta.linux/vmlinux.raw Zeta Emulator ( C ) Copyright 2000 - 2009 Thomas Capricelli / \ | *** | Loading kernel = /home / orzel/hg/zeta.linux/vmlinux.raw | * | at 0x0 , size = 1206002 = 0x1266f2 | * | Loading ramdisk = ../ramdisk.romfs | * | at 0x200000 , size = 0 = 0x0 | *** | Execution begins at 0x0 \ / Loading Symbols : ../ linux / System.map ...
If you have Qt - 4 installed , you can use the Graphical user interface :
orzel@berlioz zeta/emulator > cd gui orzel@berlioz zeta/emulator / gui > qmake # be sure it is qmake from qt4 orzel@berlioz zeta/ emulator / gui > make orzel@berlioz zeta/emulator / gui > ./zeg ~/hg/zeta.linux &

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors and its dealers are aiming for a test program with eBay Inc in California that would allow customers to bid on new vehicles or buy them at a predetermined price online , the automaker said on Friday .
EBay said it has been in discussions with GM , which emerged from bankruptcy on Friday as a much smaller automaker , to identify ways to help dealers market vehicles but no plans had been finalized at this time .
“ We are excited about a potential new adventure that supports GM ’s dealers by expanding on how they already reach consumers through new approaches , ” eBay said in a statement .
GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said earlier on Friday that the automaker was working on ways to “ revolutionize ” the way that people buy vehicles on line including a partnership with eBay in California .
“ We ’ll be testing this and other ideas with our dealers over the next few weeks and hope to expand and build upon them in the coming months , ” Henderson said in a statement .
The West Coast , which has been dominated by import brands over the past several years , has been the weakest regional market for the U.S. auto industry overall in recent months under the crushing impact from the economic downturn .
“ Experiments are experiments ...
You do n’t roll them out until you figure out if they work , ” Henderson told reporters .
“ We are excited about it , but I would n’t commit to rolling it out more broadly until we find out if it ’s successful . ”
EBay shares rose 21 cents , or 1.3 percent , to close at $ 16.30 Friday on the Nasdaq .
Great Job !
Thank you so much for a job well done ,
You guys are the best !
Keep up the great work

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Red - light cameras are making their return to Virginia .
Do n’t believe the propaganda that this has anything to do with safety - it ’s all about money .
In two weeks , a for - profit company will begin mailing traffic tickets to the owners of vehicles passing through three Alexandria intersections .
The private company , American Traffic Solutions , Inc. , operates the traffic cameras , makes the initial decision who is guilty , mails the tickets , collects the fines and then gives the city a cut of the windfall .
This is n’t the first time Alexandria has tried to cash in on photo enforcement .
Between 1998 and 2005 , Alexandria ’s cameras snapped more than 50,000 citations .
Did this multimillion - dollar program improve safety over the course of those seven years ?
Not according to data compiled by the Virginia Transportation Research Council ( VTRC ) , a joint venture between the Virginia Department of Transportation ( VDOT ) and the University of Virginia .
Before cameras were installed , the accident rate at the Alexandria study location was 535 for every million vehicles entering the intersection .
After traffic cameras were activated , the accident rate jumped to 765 .
This 43 percent increase can be attributed primarily to rear - end collisions that happened as drivers , faced with short yellow lights , slammed on the brakes to avoid receiving a ticket in the mail .
Although spin doctors for red - light cameras will try to pass off the bromide that rear - end collisions are preferable to T - bone accidents , the VTRC study showed that the number of accidents serious enough to cause injuries increased 18 percent at red-light - camera intersections throughout Virginia .
Unfortunately , Alexandria has failed to learn from the past and is still depending on all - too short yellow - light timing to make the most of its reinvigorated program .
Two of the city ’s cameras are stationed on South Patrick Street - one at Gibbon Street and the other at Franklin Street - which is on the busy Route 1 corridor just before drivers begin to merge onto the Beltway .
Drivers get 4.0 seconds of yellow time to cross Gibbon Street before the camera begins snapping , but on the very next block , at Franklin Street , drivers get a half - second less of yellow .
That may not sound like much of a difference , but “ 85 percent of all citations occurred within 1.30 seconds of the signal changing to red ” at Gibbon Street , according to a 2005 VTRC report .
Take away another half - second , and Alexandria is betting the number of violations will skyrocket .
In fact , VTRC specifically condemned what Alexandria is trying to do .
“ The practice of issuing citations to motorists by adjusting yellow light times to be inconsistent with the surrounding traffic lights should be avoided , ” it warned in 2005 .
If Alexandria truly cared about safety , it would increase inadequate yellow - light times .
An extra 1.3 seconds at Gibbon Street would eliminate 85 percent of violations .
Time and time again , increasing the yellow duration has proved to be the most effective means of reducing violations and increasing safety .
But doing so puts profit at risk .
Fortunately , there is some good news for motorists who might receive a ticket in the mail after toodling through Old Town .
As The Washington Times reported four years ago , state law says a private company may not simply drop a ticket in a mailbox and expect it to be considered valid service .
Unless a driver receives a hand - delivered copy , the citation can be thrown away without consequence .
Depriving Alexandria and its revenue - collecting partner of cash is the surest way to ensure this unsafe program disappears for good .

Jason Dyer ’s teasing post got me thinking .
About how Python could be used to give some insight into the meta - cognitive aspects of whole number multiplication .
Natch .
When children solve a multiplication problem by correspondence , the objects in the multiplier set are mapped over for each object in the multiplicand set ( hmm , or is it the other way around ? ) .
A typical procedure for multiplying 4 cakes by a price of £ 2 per cake might be to point to a cake with the left hand and then count up the 2 pounds using the right hand , then move the left hand to the next cake and repeat the count with the right hand , with the oral count continuing up ; this is repeated until the left hand has exhausted all cakes .
We can model this in Python with the following program :
def mul( multiplicand , multiplier ) : count = 0 for i in range ( multiplicand ) : for j in range ( multiplier ) : count += 1 return count
Whereas children using repeated addition do something more like this :
def mul( multiplicand , multiplier ) : count = 0 for i in range ( multiplier ) : count = add ( count , multiplicand ) return count
In this case , add is a subroutine .
You could define one easily enough in Python or else you could go « from operator import add » .
Clearly the second program is more efficient than the first , both as a Python program and as a manual procedure performed by children ; it ’s more the latter that I ’m interested in , I ’m using Python to describe the procedures .
However , the second procedure requires that add is already adopted as an internal procedure .
Of particular note is that , apart from count , the second procedure uses only one state variable , i ; the first procedure uses two .
At the stage where multiplication is introduced , many children will not yet be performing addition accurately without counting .
Effectively add is not yet available to them as an internal procedure .
This is likely to be a problem because this type of learner is unlikely to be able to accurately add the multiplicand to the count without getting confused about where in the multiplication procedure they were .
As an example of what might go wrong , imagine that a learner starts by using the left hand to maintain the i variable in the second procedure ( above ) ; this hand will count from 1 to multiplier ( hmm , there ’s a small sleight of hand going on here , the Python counts from 0 to n- 1 whereas most learners will prefer count from 1 to n ) .
The count will be maintained orally ( in other words by speaking out the successive multiples of the multiplicand ) .
Begin by raising one finger of the left hand and uttering the multiplicand ( the initial count ) .
Now we need to add the multiplicand to the oral count .
Maybe the learner can do that without using their fingers , maybe they can’t ; in any case depending on the parameters chosen , at some point some learners may need to use their hands to perform the addition .
So then the procedure for addition kicks in as the learner adds the multiplicand to the current count .
Many learners will have personal procedure for addition that requires both hands .
The addition may be performed accurately , but the i state variable will be lost .
We lose track of where we were in the multiply procedure .
If the learner can accurately add the multiplicand to the count mentally , then they stand a much better chance of performing the second procedure .
This is what I mean by having add available as an internal procedure .
The first procedure can be thought of as a way of simultaneously arranging to perform the multiplication and the additions required by the multiplication without having any state variables overlap .
Thereby minimising the chance that confusion will result .
Most learners will be capable of keeping track of the required state variables to perform the multiplication , but if left to their own devices may choose methods where the state variables overlap ( in other words , they run out of hands ) .
Thus , they can benefit by being guided towards a procedure which they can manage .
Another way to think about this is that at the sort of age where children begin to learn to multiply , their procedure for addition is leaky .
It is not fully abstracted ; performing addition may require the use of hands ( for state variables ) , making the addition leak over any other use of the same hands to maintain state .
It seems to me that only when a learner can perform a typical count + multiplicand addition accurately in their head are they ready to perform multiplication as repeated addition .
Oh yeah , the original research on the whole “ multiplication is / ai n’t repeated addition ” debate .
It sucks .
They test children at times t0 and t1 with a randomly chosen math related intervention in between .
It seems to me that a more carefully designed study should have also included a non math - related intervention such as giving the subjects fish - oil pills or teaching them to conga .
After all , if I was being tested on one day and then told that I was going to sit a similar test tomorrow , I would bone up on the material before the second test , regardless of what I was being taught .
Would n’t you ?
They make no attempt to account for this effect .
Appendix for Python hackers
The first definition of mul that I give is of course completely worthless as a practical implementation in Python .
However , note the following : « 10 * 10L » is 100L but « mul ( 10,10L ) » is 100 ; in other words mul returns an int if it possibly can .

It has been said that no one in the United States has benefited more animals than Temple Grandin .
It is ironic that most of these animals are those destined for slaughter in meat - packing plants , although it must be granted that these animals , perhaps above all , deserve consideration and humane treatment .
We salute her for taking up this battle in the trenches .
Grandin ’s designs and methods have alleviated the worst stresses and pains as cattle , sheep , and pigs are moved from transports , into pens , through chutes , and into slaughter areas .
Her methods create a calm , orderly environment where animals do not balk or panic , resulting in fewer injuries to the cattle and fewer injured workers , less noise , less coercion , less brutality .
More than half of the cattle slaughtered in the United States are processed in operations adopting her designs and methods ; her clients include those supplying fast - food giants on an industrial scale .
Thinking in Pictures
Temple Grandin has achieved this despite the fact that she is autistic , as it was her autism that created her unique talent .
Born in 1947 , she did not use speech to communicate until she was nearly five years old .
Through the determination of her mother , she went to a normal school though at the time such children were often placed in mental institutions .
Autism was thought to be a psychological problem , not a biological or neurologic disorder , causing the child to focus inward and to ignore or reject outside stimuli .
It was thought that there was no bridging the gap between the autistic child and the world .
After a barrage of therapy and with great difficulty , Grandin managed to graduate from high school .
She had spent time on a ranch and had become fascinated with animal behavior after long sessions of watching the cowmen work with the herds .
She earned a B.A. at Franklin Pierce College in New Hampshire , an M.S. in Animal Science at Arizona State University , and a Ph.D in Animal Science from the University of Illinois .
Today she teaches courses on livestock behavior and facility design at Colorado State University and consults with the livestock industry on facility design , livestock handling , and animal welfare .
In addition , she writes widely about autism and her life experiences and efforts to live a functional , purposeful life .
Grandin believes that she experiences the world similarly with animals , thinking in pictures rather than with words .
Since she identifies fear as the primary emotion of an autistic person , she readily senses triggers to panic or rage in animals .
She can intuit a cow ’s - eye view of a cattle pen and see what ’s alarming about it .
She can imagine a fear - free facility for lining up pigs for vaccinations or examination .
She sees , hears , and feels details of an environment that we have learned to tune out , details that can be full of menace to animals .
The Minds of Men and Animals
What truly distinguishes Grandin is her ability to describe how her mind works and how she sees a parallel in animal behavior .
Following her breakthrough autobiograhical account of growing up austistic , Emergence : Labelled Autistic ( 1996 ) , Grandin reached a wide audience with Thinking In Pictures : and Other Reports from My Life with Autism ( 1995 ) and Animals in Translation : Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior .
Both are full of fascinating accounts of practical applications of the perceptions of animal behaviorists .
Her latest book , Animals Make Us Human ( 2009 ) , analyzes situations based on a system devised by Washington State neuroscientist Jaak Panskepp .
In Affective Neuroscience ( 1998 ) he categorizes the core emotions affecting all animals — seeking , or the “ impluse to search , investigate , and make sense of the environment ” ; fear ; rage as a response to frustration or restraint ; panic from the terror felt at separation from safety ; lust and reproductive urges ; care , the manifestation of maternal feelings and caretaking ; and play .
Grandin applies these concepts to alleviating such varied problems as the stereotyped behaviors of zoo animals and the desensitizing of horses made intractable and dangerous by fear .
Pigs , mountain lions , antelopes , cats , dogs , chickens , cattle — all can be understood through acknowledging their core emotions .
Today it is widely accepted that animals experience emotions , and this itself represents a significant shift in scholarly precedent .
It is also heartening that Grandin is able to cite many instances where researchers are learning to observe animals with complete objectivity and question long - held theories of animals ’ motivation .
An example is simple observation of precisely how animals move in response to being approached by a person .
The application of behaviorists ’ insights seem in every case like simple common sense breaking through .
Even more impressive and moving is the bottomless well of compassion that underlies Grandin ’s concern for the needs of animals and her faith that understanding can rid their world of unnecessary suffering , both mental and physical .

A Career as a Teacher
Despite his lack of formal schooling , Mr. McCourt won admission to New York University , where he earned a degree in English education in 1957 .
A year later he began teaching at McKee Vocational High School on Staten Island , an eye - opening experience that he recalled , in often hilarious detail , in his third volume of memoirs , “ Teacher Man . ”
In his first week , an unruly student threw a homemade sandwich on the floor , an act that astonished Mr. McCourt not so much for its brazenness as for the waste of good food .
After appraising the sandwich with a connoisseur ’s eye , he picked it up and ate it .
Mr. McCourt developed an idiosyncratic teaching style that found a somewhat more receptive audience at the elite Stuyvesant High School , where he taught creative writing after earning a master ’s degree in English from Brooklyn College in 1967 .
He had students sing Irish songs to break down their resistance to poetry .
After discovering a sheaf of written excuses from past years , he recognized an unexplored literary genre and asked students to write , say , an excuse letter from Adam or Eve to God , explaining why he or she should not be punished for eating the apple .
He even had students test themselves .
“ When they wrote their own tests , they asked questions they wanted answers to and then they answered them , ” Mr. McCourt told the journal Instructor .
“ It was grand . ”
Testing Literary Waters
On the side , Mr. McCourt made fitful stabs at writing .
He contributed articles on Ireland to The Village Voice .
He kept notebooks .
But at the Lion ’s Head in Greenwich Village , where he became friends with Pete Hamill and Jimmy Breslin , he felt like an interloper , he said .
They were writers .
He was just a teacher .
“ I had no idea he had the ambition , much less the ability to carry it off in such spectacular fashion , ” Mr. Hamill , who first met Mr. McCourt at the Lion ’s Head in the 1960s , said in a telephone interview .
In 1977 , Mr. McCourt and his brother Malachy , who was acting and bartending in New York , cobbled together a series of autobiographical sketches into a two - man play , “ A Couple of Blaguards , ” which opened off Off Broadway at the Billymunk Theater on East 45th Street .
They performed a revised version at the Village Gate in 1984 and again at the Billymunk in 1986 and took their show to several other cities .

Creativity is commonly thought of as a personality trait that resides within the individual .
We count on creative people to produce the songs , movies , and books we love ; to invent the new gadgets that can change our lives ; and to discover the new scientific theories and philosophies that can change the way we view the world .
Over the past several years , however , social psychologists have discovered that creativity is not only a characteristic of the individual , but may also change depending on the situation and context .
The question , of course , is what those situations are : what makes us more creative at times and less creative at others ?
One answer is psychological distance .
According to the construal level theory ( CLT ) of psychological distance , anything that we do not experience as occurring now , here , and to ourselves falls into the “ psychologically distant ” category .
It ’s also possible to induce a state of “ psychological distance ” simply by changing the way we think about a particular problem , such as attempting to take another person 's perspective , or by thinking of the question as if it were unreal and unlikely .
In this new paper , by Lile Jia and colleagues at Indiana University at Bloomington , scientists have demonstrated that increasing psychological distance so that a problem feels farther away can actually increase creativity .
Why does psychological distance increase creativity ?
According to CLT , psychological distance affects the way we mentally represent things , so that distant things are represented in a relatively abstract way while psychologically near things seem more concrete .
Consider , for instance , a corn plant .
A concrete representation would refer to the shape , color , taste , and smell of the plant , and connect the item to its most common use – a food product .
An abstract representation , on the other hand , might refer to the corn plant as a source of energy or as a fast growing plant .
These more abstract thoughts might lead us to contemplate other , less common uses for corn , such as a source for ethanol , or to use the plant to create mazes for children .
What this example demonstrates is how abstract thinking makes it easier for people to form surprising connections between seemingly unrelated concepts , such as fast growing plants ( corn ) and fuel for cars ( ethanol ) .
In this most recent set of studies , Jia and colleagues examined the effect of spatial distance on creativity .
Participants in the first study performed a creative generation task , in which they were asked to list as many different modes of transportation as possible .
This task was introduced as having been developed either by Indiana University students studying in Greece ( distant condition ) or by Indiana University students studying in Indiana ( near condition ) .
As predicted , participants in the distant condition generated more numerous and original modes of transportation than participants in the near condition .
Similar results were obtained in the second study , in which performance on three insight problems was gauged .
Here ’s a sample problem :
A prisoner was attempting to escape from a tower .
He found a rope in his cell that was half as long enough to permit him to reach the ground safely .
He divided the rope in half , tied the two parts together , and escaped .
How could he have done this ?
This is known as an insight problem since the solution – the prisoner unraveled the rope lengthwise and tied the remaining strands together – typically arrives in a flash of insight , or what ’s commonly referred to as an Aha moment .
For the insight problems , participants were told that the questions were developed either by a research institute located in California , " around 2,000 miles away " ( distant condition ) , or in Indiana , " 2 miles away , " ( near condition ) .
In a third , control group no information regarding location was mentioned .
As expected , participants in the distant condition solved more problems than participants in the proximal condition and in the control condition .
Because the problems seemed farther away , they were easier to solve .
This pair of studies suggests that even minimal cues of psychological distance can make us more creative .
Although the geographical origin of the various tasks was completely irrelevant – it should n’t have mattered where the questions came from – simply telling subjects that they came from somewhere far away led to more creative thoughts .
These results build on previous studies which demonstrated that distancing in time – projecting an event into the remote future - and assuming an event to be less likely ( that is , distancing on the probability dimension ) can also enhance creativity .
In a series of experiments that examined how temporal distance affects performance on various insight and creativity tasks , participants were first asked to imagine their lives a year later ( distant future ) or the next day ( near future ) , and then to imagine working on a task on that day in the future .
Participants who imagined a distant future day solved more insight problems than participants who imagined a near future day .
They also performed better on visual insight tasks , which required detecting coherent images in " noisy " visual input , as well as on creative generation tasks ( e.g. , listing ways to improve the look of a room ) .
Similar evidence has been found for probability .
Participants were more successful at solving sample items from a visual insight task when they believed they were unlikely , as opposed to likely , to encounter the full task .
This research has important practical implications .
It suggests that there are several simple steps we can all take to increase creativity , such as traveling to faraway places ( or even just thinking about such places ) , thinking about the distant future , communicating with people who are dissimilar to us , and considering unlikely alternatives to reality .
Perhaps the modern environment , with its increased access to people , sights , music , and food from faraway places , helps us become more creative not only by exposing us to a variety of styles and ideas , but also by allowing us to think more abstractly .
So the next time you ’re stuck on a problem that seems impossible do n’t give up .
Instead , try to gain a little psychological distance , and pretend the problem came from somewhere very far away .

Dolphins sing ' Batman ' theme Discovery News
Batman theme song .
The findings , outlined in two studies , are the first time that nonhuman mammals have demonstrated they can recognise rhythms and reproduce them vocally .
" Humans are sensitive to rhythms embedded in sequences of sounds , but we typically consider this skill to be part of processing for language and music , cognitive domains that we consider to be uniquely human , " says Professor Heidi Harley , lead author of both studies .
" Clearly , aspects of those domains are available to other species . "
The studies will be presented at the joint meeting of the
Learning to sing
Harley , who is associate professor of social sciences at the
The researchers first had an adult male bottlenose dolphin position itself in front of an underwater sound projector , called a hydrophone , that produced six different 14 kiloherz , 4 second rhythms .
The dolphin was rewarded for performing a certain behaviour to each rhythm .
For example , when rhythm 1 played , it waved its pectoral fin and when rhythm 2 played , it tossed a ball .
The various rhythms were played at different frequencies and tempos to ensure the dolphin was recognising rhythms instead of just frequencies or sound durations .
Another adult male was trained to produce similar rhythms using a pneumatic switch , essentially a small , air - filled ball connected to a computer that then generated sounds whenever the dolphin pressed the switch .
" The dolphin was reinforced for producing a specific rhythm to a specific object , " says Harley .
" For example , when we presented him with a Batman doll , he received a fish for producing a specific rhythm , in this case , a short sound and then a long one . "
" If you recall the original Batman TV series musical intro you 'll probably remember the way they sang ' Bat - maaaaaaaan ' , " she adds .
The dolphin spontaneously vocalised to the rhythms , so the researchers started to reward the male with fish whenever it matched its ' singing ' to the rhythms .
By the end of the studies , the scientists could show an object , such as the Batman doll , which represented a certain rhythm - vocalisation combo to the dolphin , and it would create the correct sounds both vocally and using the switch .
Batmaaaaaaan
Gordon Bauer , associate professor of psychology at the New College of Florida who did not work on the studies , says , " This is the first report , to my knowledge , of a nonhuman mammal 's ability to discriminate rhythmic patterns . "
But Bauer doubts that dolphins realise they are producing what people consider ' music ' .
" I think music is a human construct , " he says .
" I doubt that it has pertinence to animals , although the elements of music , such as pitch , time , timbre , rhythm , etc , may be incorporated into animal communication . "
Harley agrees , and hopes the everyday vocalisations of dolphins will be analysed in terms of their rhythmic content .
In the near future , she and her team are planning to test the dolphins on their ability to recognise recordings of their own rhythms by having them associate their own sound creations with identifying objects similar to the Batman doll .
Scientists have taught dolphins to combine both rhythm and vocalisations to produce music , resulting in an extremely high - pitched , short version of thetheme song .
The findings , outlined in two studies , are the first time that nonhuman mammals have demonstrated they can recognise rhythms and reproduce them vocally .
" Humans are sensitive to rhythms embedded in sequences of sounds , but we typically consider this skill to be part of processing for language and music , cognitive domains that we consider to be uniquely human , " says Professor Heidi Harley , lead author of both studies .
