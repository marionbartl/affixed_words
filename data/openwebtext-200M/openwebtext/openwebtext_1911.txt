Albert , without fail , has exceeded all of his production objectives for the past five years .
He is a top performer who produces high - quality results .
Colleagues like him .
Clients adore him .
But Albert never works more than 20 hours per week .
That ’s less than one - half the amount of time his colleague ’s work .
Albert receives a compensation package equal or better than his colleagues .
He has a single requirement for his manager and his organization , " Do n’t waste my time . "
You now control the organization .
Would you continue to employ Albert under the same arrangement ?
This is n’t a trick question :
Albert produces in less than 20 hours as much or more than his colleagues do in 40 to 60 hours .
I would continue this arrangement in a heartbeat .
But when I shared these facts with two development managers I respect and asked them whether they would continue the same employment arrangement , they both said , " No . "
Whoa …
I was surprised by the development managers ’ responses .
I probed them about their answer .
The vagueness of " production objectives " seemed to be a problem .
They abhorred the idea of full time pay for what they considered half time work .
They also were concerned about the demand that Albert ’s time not be wasted .
I decided to ask a a different group of managers — sales managers — about hiring Albert to be a salesman , a job whose results can be described quantitatively .
I shared these facts with 1 second - level sales manager and 2 first - level managers :
If your hire Albert as a salesman , you are guaranteed that he will generate at least 105 % of his quota but never more than 110 % each reporting period ; his colleagues will like him ; his clients will adore him ; but he will never work more than 20 hours per week and he demands that his time not be wasted .
I asked each of them " Would you hire Albert ? "
I thought this was a no brainer question for a sales manager , but " No , " was the verdict I heard from each of them .
Whoa …
I asked them , " What ’s preventing you from hiring Albert ? "
A manager sneered as he said , " The notion of him only working 20 hours per week is insulting and his demand that his time not be wasted is absurd .
He is being paid to do what he is told .
And think of what he could produce if he worked a regular ( 40 - 60 ) hours .
If I ca n’t motivate him to work hard , I do n’t want him "
The creases in my forehead became more pronounced as I said , " But is n’t the guarantee of him producing 105 % of his quota worth something to you ? "
" Does n’t matter .
I might be able to hire someone who would work more hours and make 200 % of his quota , " countered a sales manager .
Whoa …
I did n’t expect this response .
Perhaps I did n’t structure the inquiry well or I asked the wrong groups .
Both groups seemed to fixate on the number of hours worked and did n’t like Albert demanding that his time not be wasted .
Unlike me , neither group was impressed about the guarantee of results .
I like the notion of paying for results that are certain .
And Albert ’s time management is superb so I ’ll support his demand that his time not be wasted .
All other things being equal if Albert , or someone else , can consistently produce the desired results in one - half the amount of time as their colleagues , I am more than willing to pay him at least as much as their colleagues .
How about you ?
Natascha Kampusch says her new - found freedom is hard
In an interview with Austrian television , she said she could not yet face going out alone four months after escaping from her captor .
She also said she found being in large groups of people overwhelming .
She was forced to live in a cell beneath a house garage from 1998 until she escaped in August .
Her captor killed himself hours after her escape .
" I can't go out in public alone .
That would be too risky , " she said .
Sometimes it is really obtrusive for me .
I do n't like loud voices
Natascha Kampusch
Asked if people recognised her in the street , she said : " Yes .
Most of the time it is harmless .
But now and then I get a brief fright if someone calls out ' hello ' , if me or the person I am with is recognised and it is a stranger . "
She said she found situations involving large numbers of people difficult .
" Sometimes it is really obtrusive for me .
I do n't like loud voices , " she said .
" People have different body odours , they smoke , they wear perfume , they wear flashy , disturbing clothes , they have unpleasant eating habits , they are rude , unfriendly , undisciplined and so on , but that does n't matter at all .
" I was always a social person and from the outset [ of life ] had no problems with social contact , " she added .
Family toll
She also said she suffered from claustrophobia .
" The first weeks in this prison were incredibly hard , because I freaked out in this little chamber .
It was terrible .
But with time , I got used to it by imagining something wide and open .
" You just have to learn to adapt and make optimal use of this little room . "
Of Wolfgang Priklopil , her abductor , she said he had no " empathy " for her : " I always told him he was incredibly ignorant because he ignored me . "
Ms Kampusch , who is now 18 , is living on her own in a rented apartment with access to counselling , Austrian media say .
The ordeal of her imprisonment and her subsequent freedom has taken its toll on her family , she said .
" Everyone believes that we [ meaning her and her family ] have to be super happy now , but really , it 's taking a toll on the whole family .
They do n't have to worry about where I am anymore , but now there 's new problems arising . "
Bid for freedom
Ms Kampusch , who was 10 when she was abducted in March 1998 , escaped when her captor was busy making a phone call on 23 August .
The communications technician had held Ms Kampusch in a small , windowless basement beneath his garage in the commuter town of Strasshof , 25 km ( 15 miles ) outside Vienna for eight and a half years .
He committed suicide by jumping under a train after Ms Kampusch escaped .
He was secretly buried at a cemetery south of Vienna on 8 September .
Rediscovering Intelligent Design
Here is a likely poorly - specified question for biologists , prompted by wanting to buy Alan Weisman ’s The World Without Us and then reading a story about genetically modified mice .
Weisman ’s book asks how the world would change and what of us would survive if humans were all wiped out overnight or just disappeared by something ( a virus , the Rapture ) .
The premise is unlikely ( something that kills people — all people — but leaves the rest of the world standing ) but intriguing .
So I wondered , what if , long , long after our disappearance , some other species arose on earth at least as intelligent as us and eventually started doing evolutionary and molecular biology .
Let ’s say they have a working theory of evolution much like our own .
Now say for the sake of argument that a bunch of transgenic organisms produced by humans have survived and prospered in the interim .
So our future biologists find things like a bacteria that produces insulin , or a plant that secretes insecticide , or rice that is high in beta carotene , or more exotic stuff as needed . [ 1 ]
I ’m wondering , would such organisms even present themselves as empirical anomalies ?
( That is , how much would you have to know about genomes and evolution for them to seem odd ? )
And if they did seem odd , how would they be explained ?
That is , would the evidence of their intelligent design by a previous , now - extinct species be clear ?
You can see that I ’m just irony - mongering here .
Would some Arthropod - staffed functional - equivalent of the Discovery Institute point its claw at some of these organisms , saying they were anomalies that could only be explained by the intervention of a divine intelligence ?
Would Charles Crustacean find a story that could account for their evolution by natural selection ?
I ’m particularly interested in whether the artificial provenance of transgenic organisms would be clear on internal evidence alone .
I do n’t know anything about this stuff , so probably the answer is “ Yes ” for reasons obvious to experts .
But if it were n’t …
From the sound of Weisman ’s book , though , internal evidence would n’t be all that was available .
Our putative Arthropod successors would likely be able to conjecuture as follows :
“ The lost civilization who did this is probably the same one responsible for leaving those giant goddamn piles of steel - belted rubber rings and miscellaneous plastic items piled around the place . ”
To which someone would no doubt reply , “ Come off it , no organism that spent its time making rubber tubes and piling them up in giant mountains would have ever been smart enough to figure out genetic engineering . ”
[ 1 ]
It occurs to me that rice requires a lot of cultivation to prosper , but there are n’t any humans to take care of it .
Hence , “ insert example as needed . ”
Air pollution in major cities may be more damaging to health than the radiation exposure suffered by survivors of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster , according to a report published today .
The study suggests high levels of urban air pollution cut short life expectancy more than the radiation exposure of emergency workers who were sent into the 19 - mile exclusion zone around the site straight after the accident .
Two explosions at the Chernobyl reactor killed three people immediately and more than 30 died from acute radiation poisoning , but the radioactive plume released from the reactor spread over most of Europe and is estimated to have caused up to 16,000 deaths .
The latest study follows a report last month from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution which said air pollution was responsible for 24,000 premature deaths in Britain every year .
Sir John Lawton , chairman of the commission , said the government had consistently failed to tackle rising levels of chemicals in the atmosphere in cities .
Other findings this year showed that women living in areas of high air pollution were at greater risk of heart disease and death , while children living within 500 m of motorways suffered more permanent lung damage and lower life expectancy , probably because of their greater exposure to pollutants in vehicle fumes .
Jim Smith , a scientist at the government 's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Dorchester , assessed the health risks faced by emergency workers at Chernobyl directly after the explosion and those who unofficially set up home in the exclusion zone afterwards .
He compared them with the more familiar risks of air pollution , obesity , and passive and active smoking .
He concluded that the Chernobyl group received doses of radiation equivalent to more than 12,000 chest x-rays and likely to cause one extra death in a hundred by increasing the risk of cancer .
The health risks associated with air pollution and passive smoking appear more severe .
Pollution in central London increases mortality due to heart and lung disease by 2.8 % compared with Inverness , Britain 's least polluted city , while living with a smoker increases mortality by 1.7 % , the study found .
In the journal BMC Public Health , Dr Smith writes : " Populations still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around Chernobyl may actually have a lower health risk from radiation than they would have if they were exposed to air pollution in a large city , such as nearby Kiev . "
Dr Smith also calculated long - term mortality rates among survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and compared them with obesity and active smoking .
" The immediate effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs led to approximately 210,000 deaths in the two cities .
However , radiation exposures experienced by the most exposed group of survivors led to an average loss of life expectancy significantly lower than that caused by severe obesity or active smoking , " the report states .
Dr Smith said the aim of the report was to put health risks from radiation in context with more familiar threats .
" We can all face such risks just going about our ordinary daily lives , " he said .
" One of my reasons for comparing everyday risks with those of radiation contamination was the way in which contaminated Chernobyl refugees felt rejected by society .
Our understandable fear of radiation needs to be placed in the context of other risks we encounter in our daily lives if we are to properly understand , and respond to , the potential impacts of any future radiation incidents . "
Sex makes people healthy , cheerful , strong , beautiful and sleepy
It is much easier for a woman to learn how to love herself , if she has a man , who desires and worships her
It is generally believed that human beings have sex either for pleasure or reproduction .
However , the number of people driven with these motivations has been reducing steadily during the recent years .
The majority of humans use sex as the most pleasant and available remedy for a whole bouquet of problems .
It is an open secret that a person gets into a cheerful mood during an act of love .
In addition to purely psychological satisfaction , the human body produces endorphin – the hormone in charge of elevated spirits and positive perception of the environment .
Researchers say that such inspiration comes from the activity of certain brain centers , which change the hormonal status of the body .
Good quality sex produces a spiritually elevating effect on the chemical level , which does not require any additional efforts .
Prior to the culminating moment of an act of love , orgasm , the brain emits a dose of oxytocin – the hormone of the posterior lobe of pituitary .
Oxytocin results in the production of sedative endorphins – natural analogues of morphine .
Sex spurs the production of estrogen with women – the substance , which eases premenstrual pains .
Therefore , sex is the best painkiller .
One may say that a bed is the best equipment for physical exercises that man has ever designed .
The pulse rate of a sexually excited individual increases from 70 to 150 beats per minute , which is comparable to muscle efforts of a weight - lifter .
Only one sexual intercourse burns off the same amount of calories that a person loses running on a treadmill for 15 minutes .
Needless to say that the first option is much more pleasant than the second one .
Thirty minutes of sex kill about 200 calories .
In other words , daily sex can take away 500 grams of your weight in a week .
Sex is a very good impetus for the strengthening of the immune system .
It has been tentatively proved that those people , who have sex on a regular basis , are much more protected against various viral diseases than those , who prefer abstinence : healthy sex saturates blood with antibodies .
Therefore , sexually active men and women suffer from widespread infectious diseases such a flu and cold less frequently .
As for sexually transmitted diseases , the answer is obvious : a condom makes perfect .
It may seem unreal , but it is a fact : regular sex enlarges women 's breasts .
Sexual excitement intensifies the bloodstream , which may add 25 percent to a woman 's breast size .
Furthermore , women can raise their IQ with every orgasm that they experience .
American scientists , who continuingly study sexual possibilities of homo sapiens , discovered that the moment of orgasm gives a very powerful incentive to a large number of chemical reactions and physical procedures in the body .
The speed of blood circulation reaches its maximum , whereas the oxygen - enriched blood reaches all internal organs , including brain , very quickly .
Hypothalamus – the center for control of the hormonal system – also governs the work of learning and memorizing centers .
It goes without saying that an act of love ends with the ultimate relaxation and sleep , especially if it occurs after a hard day at work .
The raising level of oxytocin produces a strong tranquillizing effect .
Sex can therefore be considered as a perfect natural soporific medication .
Sex trains almost all groups of muscles , especially muscles of pelvis , buttocks , stomach and arms , which is an important factor for women .
Regular love acts improve the bearing and exert a favorable influence on the musculoskeletal system .
In addition , sex results in the production of collagen – the substance , which adds smoothness and glow to women 's skin .
Progesterone , another hormonal product of sex , helps a person fight acne .
American scientists concluded as a result of their research that couples , who love each other at least three times a week , look two or three years younger than their coevals , who either abstain from sex or hardly ever enjoy it .
Any long - legged beauty girl annoys you , especially if she looks younger and prettier .
A photograph of a beautiful model wearing fancy designer clothes ruins your entire day .
Only passionate sex can save you from this infirmity .
When a man tells his woman that she is the most beautiful lady on Earth , a woman usually stops thinking about several centimeters of fat on her waist or the fading elasticity of her skin .
Psychologists say that it is much easier for a woman to learn how to love herself , if she has a man , who desires and worships her .

Palestinians detained by Israeli security forces are routinely tortured and ill - treated , according to a new report published by Israeli human rights groups yesterday .
The ill - treatment , which includes beatings , sensory deprivation , back - bending , back - stretching and other forms of physical abuse , contravenes international law and Israeli law , the report says .
The Centre for the Defence of the Individual and B'Tselem , an Israeli human rights group , compiled the report after interviewing 73 Palestinians who had been arrested in 2005 and 2006 .
The report found that almost 50 % of detainees who were arrested in raids or at random were beaten by the army or police before they were handed over to the Shin Bet security agency for interrogation .
The prisoners were interrogated for an average of 35 days and spent most of their time in tiny cells in solitary confinement .
They were interrogated from five to 10 hours a day .
More than half did not see a lawyer or representative of the Red Cross for the whole period of interrogation .
The report found that prisoners were effectively starved by being offered food designed to appear rotten or unappetising .
Their only exercise was the walk from the cell to the interrogation room during which they were shackled , handcuffed and blindfolded .
In some cases more extreme treatment was used .
One in five detainees were deprived of sleep for up to three days and a quarter were beaten by their interrogators .
Out of more than 500 complaints against Shin Bet since 2001 , not a single one has been upheld .
Israel 's justice ministry said Shin Bet interrogations were carried out in accordance with the law , although it declined to comment on the " interrogation techniques " detailed in the report .
In 1999 , the supreme court banned the torture of suspects but left several loopholes which allowed it to continue .

Mimicking the agile gecko , with its uncanny ability to run up walls and across ceilings , has long been a goal of materials scientists .
Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of Akron have taken one sticky step in the right direction , creating synthetic “ gecko tape ” with four times the sticking power of the real thing .
In a paper published in the June 18 – 22 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers describe a process for making polymer surfaces covered with carbon nanotube hairs .
The nanotubes imitate the thousands of microscopic hairs on a gecko’s footpad , which form weak bonds with whatever surface the creature touches , allowing it to “ unstick ” itself simply by shifting its foot .
For the first time , the team has developed a prototype flexible patch that can stick and unstick repeatedly with properties better than the natural gecko foot .
They fashioned their material into an adhesive tape that can be used on a wide variety of surfaces , including Teflon .
Pulickel Ajayan , the Henry Burlage Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Rensselaer , and Lijie Ci , a postdoctoral research associate in Ajayan ’s lab , created the material in collaboration with Ali Dhinojwala , professor of polymer science at the University of Akron , and University of Akron graduate students Liehui Ge and Sunny Sethi .
“ Several people have tried to use carbon nanotube films and other fibrous structures as high - adhesive surfaces and to mimic gecko feet , but with limited success when it comes to realistic demonstrations of the stickiness and reversibility that one sees in gecko feet , ” Ajayan said .
“ We have shown that the patchy structures from micropatterned nanotubes are essential for this unique engineering feat to work .
The nanotubes also need to be the right kind , with the right dimensions and compliance . ”
“ Geckos inspired us to develop a synthetic gecko tape unlike any you ’ll find in a hardware store , ” Dhinojwala says .
“ Synthetic gecko tape uses ‘ van der Waals interactions ’ — the same interactions that hold liquids and solids together — to stick to a variety of surfaces without using sticky glues . ”
The material could have a number of applications , including feet for wall - climbing robots ; a dry , reversible adhesive in electronic devices ; and outer space , where most adhesives do n’t work because of the vacuum .

Lulu.com - a way to publish books ( and they like Gnu licenses ! )
Posted 9 Mar 2006 at 21:54 UTC by lkcl
Lulu.com is a web - based publishing house .
I 'm making people aware of this because if you are prepared to do a little bit of work yourself , you could make your own documentation available - as a book .
Or take some GPL or Creative Commons licensed documentation - and sell it .
Also , there is a very interesting paragraph which the dickheads of the MPAA and the RIAA could REALLY do with reading .
http://www.lulu.com/help/index.php?fID=33#logo
I was intrigued in particular by this section :
Do n't worry about losing sales after setting a license .
Even though people can make copies of your work and give them away , those copies are n't likely to be of the same quality as a Lulu book .
If people really like your work , chances are good that they 'll buy their own copies .
Keep in mind , too , that nearly any file can be duplicated .
It 's almost impossible to prevent that from happening .
Doing so usually places a big burden on the customer who purchased your book as a download .
What you may want to consider is that getting your book out there and seen is more important than protecting it so fewer people can read it .
And so it begins - even this simple self - publishing print house " gets it " .
Anyone want to publish printed versions of already - available Free Software Documentation ? :)
Reprinting documentation , posted 10 Mar 2006 at 02:06 UTC by omarius » ( Journeyer )
Heck , that 's not really a new idea .
Once I got snowed into joining the " Computer Book Club " or some such Columbia House / Book - of - the - Month Club - like nonsense .
One of the " free " books I received was a hardback entitled " The Perl 5 Programmer 's Reference . "
Within which one may find the Perl man pages , spat onto dead tree .
I 'd have felt worse if I 'd paid ( more directly ) for it , but sheesh ! :)
no , this is not _free_ this is not " get books here , for free " , irritate the crap out of you by then demanding money and claiming you have a 2 year contract to buy books at full price ( or else ) job .
YOU , that is YOU , must UPLOAD a PDF plus its cover pages ( as pngs ) .
they then PRINT the pdf as a book , and make it available for ordering via their web site .
you also specify what you want to receive in royalties ( and they add 20 % plus the cost of the printing , and that is the published buying price on their web site ) if you really want to , you can also ask for " global distribution " in which case they will give you an ISBN number , and contact various places like amazon.com and make your book available via there as well .
lulu.com is a web - based print house , not a book - toting fool - people - into - paying - money - for - books - that - are - advertised - as - being - free whore - house .
if you _realy_ want to , you can also make it " private " , as in " only i can buy this book " , and you specify the royalties as " zero cost " .
then , you can order the book " at cost " , and presumably can then go and sell it for profit , at trade shows , or conferences etc. things that you , as a free software developer , could consider doing as a book : * any GPL 'd documentation * any creative commons documentation * the contents of the gnu.org philosophy site as long as you do n't charge a royalty , and you make sure you preserve the copyright notices ( duh ) .
* the debian manuals and FAQs the list is _endless _!!
and before you say " awwww , but we gooot the stuff on the screeeeen whyyy do we neeed to priiiiint it " well the reason is that sadly , screens are long - term unreadable , due to flicker , lighting , and also due to the fact that people have forgotten why margins are supposed to be about 1.5 inches wide ( to reduce tiredness in our eyes ) which people who wrote old manuscripts understood very well .
so .
want copies of some documentation in an easy - to - read format ?
just go DO IT !!!! :)

RALEIGH , NC - October 18 , 2005 - Red Hat ( NASDAQ : RHAT ) , the world 's leading provider of open source to the enterprise , announced today that Bob Young , co-founder and former executive of Red Hat , has decided to resign from the Red Hat Board of Directors .
Young , who founded the company in 1993 , served as an executive at Red Hat until 1999 .
Since then he has been a member of Red Hat 's Board of Directors .
Young plans to focus on the growth of Lulu.com , an online independent publishing marketplace started in 2002 .
" In a funny way , my resignation is perhaps the finest compliment I can pay to everyone associated with Red Hat today , I have complete confidence in the future of the company , " said Young .

It 's taken me a long - time to get around to it , but I 'm going to offer a dead - tree edition of Living with Schizoaffective Disorder through Lulu .
At fifty pages when printed in US Letter hardcopy form , it 's hard to read off the web .
I understand that the PDF that OpenOffice exports works for their printers ; not every PDF - making program will .
If you publish with Lulu , be very careful to observe their advice on preparing your PDFs .
If I use their six by nine inch format and have a modest margin , my article should make a hundred page book .
I have a couple other essays that I plan to include as well , so it 's likely to come to a hundred - fifty .
I 'll post an announcement in my diary when my book is ready ( it wo n't be for some time yet ) or else you can watch my Lulu page .

I have a feeling that I mentioned this somewhere in my journal .
I used Lulu.com to print copies of the SalStat manual ( http://books.lulu.com/content/35559) - can't wait until someone actually buys a copy !
Found it : see the entry for 28th September 2004 : I found Lulu to be quite good fun but the prices are a killer .
The cost of postage seems to be higher than necessary even for bulk orders , and books are only available in a few sizes .
CafePress has more sizes available and it's much the same self - publishing thing .
There might be some gumpf in my journal about formatting a document created in Lyx suitable for pdf creation for Lulu .
They need to have embedded fonts ( found it : see 9th October 2004 ) .

Reddit Flaws
Reddit offers a wonderful experience in some aspects , but it has many ruining , broken , flaws .
You Can't Submit An Article Again
If someone submits a perfectly good article but fills the headline with spelling errors and non descriptive garbage , that person essentially ruins that page 's chances of ever doing well on reddit as the article cannot be resubmitted unless it is deleted by the original poster .
I could ruin a good blog like life hacker by being the first to submit all of their posts with the headline " Teh monkey eats HAM " with a new easily generated account .
There is Incentive To Vote People Down
Many people spam their ad - stuffed blogs .
They literally profit if they get their stories voted up , so they call a few friends , vote themselves up , and vote everyone else in the NEW section down .
As a default Reddit orders post in the NEW section by how much their score is rising .
Other spammers see their post is already 0 or - 1 and they vote down all on the list .
I 've seen every post on the new section having a score of 0 before .
There is No Penalty for Voting Down
Maybe if you had a certain amount of times you could vote individuals down in a day based on karma , things would n't be so bad .
As it stands right now , people can vote down every post on the NEW list , and as an added bonus , piss someone off and they can vote down everything you 've ever submitted by clicking on your profile .
People Can Anonymously Punish You
Pissing someone off is n't exactly difficult either , just writing a comment on a politically , or controversially charged submission and the anonymous punishment trolls will come to get you .
Maybe they were badly voted down anonymously and chose a target for revenge .
Say I did n't like their page and wrote them a comment saying so .
They ended up with - 4 down .
Who do they blame ?
Not themselves .
They will quietly " punish " the commenter .
Problematic Statistics
Say 30 % of people will vote your article down , and 70 % will vote your article up if 1000 people voted in a true random survey .
It 's a well known statistical phenomenon that people are much more likely to vote if they have a very negative than a very positive opinion .
Lets say the conversion of truly random surveying to Reddit opt - in surveying is just 10 % , so your article went to 40 % down and 60 % up .
Now we factor in all the blog spammers .
Your article is essentially competing with theirs and they 'll vote you down for reasons as small as thinking their domain is so much better than yours .
They have incentive to not like you .
Your statistics are down to 60 % down and 40 % vote up .
Only 2 or 3 people vote on the average single new article on Reddit .
If you 're lucky enough to get 2 votes up either by telling friends or having the luck of the 40 % , you get much more exposure time for your article and more votes .
If you 're unlucky and get one of the 60 % that will vote you down , your submitted page wo n't get much more exposure than those 2 or 3 people that voted for you .
2 or 3 anonymous people decided the fate of your article , and they decided it sucks , so that is final verdict on Reddit .
Submit again ?
Then you 're a spamming asshole .
Those who noticed your article , but did n't bother voting or reading , noticed it twice .
" You 're a spammer and now I can go through your entire submit list downvoting . "
Netscape Top 10 Is Almost
The same as Reddit Top 10
I do n't know why , or which makes the top 10 first , but almost everyday they 're very very similar .

People Embed Videos on Their Site and Take Credit
Check out the spammers from Throw Away Your TV .
ALL their videos are just embed videos from youtube , google video or vsocial .
They like to use vsocial because they can mask the video embed as if they were hosting it .
There 's a ton of people that spam reddit just taking high rated videos and embedding it in their blogs .
I may have a video blog , but I do n't spam each page I make on reddit .
Reddit Leans Left
I am a democrat and I enjoy after all these years of saying Bush is an idiot , that finally the majority of people are figuring it out .
Now that the majority hate bush though , that does n't mean we should " filter out " all other opinion by down voting them .
China has gotten a lot of criticism for wanting google and wikipedia to filter out many of the viewpoints it does not agree with .
Reddit may filter stories as a natural occurance of majority view , but the more it continues to filter out views , the more polarized it becomes over time to one viewpoint as the opposition gets frustrated and stops using the site .
Atheists Rule
I do n't have any particular religion .
I really do n't care if there is or is n't a God .
Reddit has featured over and over dispelling articles on how Atheists are n't the demonized people the evil Ann Coulter , George HW Bush and all Christian standardized institutions portray them as .
That 's fine , but they also " filter out " articles pro-religion , and pro-abortion .
By eliminating all controvercial subjects , subcultures and demographics from the site believers get frustrated .
Everyone around them believes like they do ( sometimes all their lives ) , so having a group completely dispell their lifestyle as nonsense only feeds their paranoia fed to them in church of having that evil " Godless " society that wants to strip them of all religion and family values by controlling the media .
Again , this is a natural occurance of the majority view on reddit that causes people to down vote these type of articles , but it still " appears to THEM " as if one party controls what gets popular , and the " Liberal Media " Fox News propaganists offer as an explanation , actually exists .
Howto : Resubmit the Same Article of Video
You can submit the exact same article as many times as you want , even if someone else submitted it by adding a query string to the site .
This is not to spam the same site over and over , but rather to submit sites that were ruined by bad spelling or being very badly described in the headline .
An example of a query string , lets say on google.com , would be google.com/search?q=foo&start=10. " ?q=foo&start=20 " is the actual query string .
" q= " stands for " the query is " foo , which is what I searched for .
start=20 means that I want the second page of search results ( 20 instead of 2 because each page has 10 sites ) .
The good thing is , we can makeup our own query string variables , for example adding " &gas=smelly " to the end of the at google query .
It does n't do anything at all , but it lets people submit the exact same page to reddit .
Example
Original submission may have been
http://www.jimmyr.com/index.php .
Accepted submissions for the exact same page :
http : //www.jimmyr.com/index.php?monkey
//www.jimmyr.com/index.php?monkey
http: //www.jimmyr.com/index.php?i=asdf
//www.jimmyr.com/index.php?i=asdf
http : //www.jimmyr.com/index.php#fart
Submitting The Exact Same Videos to Reddit
Reddit ignores all query string variables after the " docid= " variable on google video , and the v= variable on youtube .
To submit the video again you have to place your custom variable before the v= or the docid=
Examples
Submitted before :
Resubmitted as :
madeupquery=lol&
Submitted before :
Resubmitted As :
cool=1&
video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8363518450495191949video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8363518450495191949youtube.com/watch?v=bn1-M5Ze0p8youtube.com/watch?v=bn1-M5Ze0p8
This method works with any other video site as well .
Reddit should allow people to resubmit videos because they let idiots submit the same videos in their ad stuffed blogs .
Digg Vs Reddit
Digg is not perfect , but at the same time there should n't be all that much voting ratios on good material .
Equal opportunity ?
Hardly .
For example my article " Complete List of Google Video Categories " got 2700 + diggs .
How many did it get on Reddit ?
A wonderful - 3 score .
I did get lucky with my Free Education Online Article which did better than Digg but even then 15 % voted my article down .
Karma Does n't Matter
People like having the feeling of having _something_ , anything as a representation of the work they 've put in .
Whether it's high scores on pacman or high scores on Reddit , no one likes being _downgraded_ for doing their best to submit interesting content .
It 's an assinine concept that frustrates the reddit community .
The down vote may be an incentive to post better stuff , but the amount of quality posts being down voted is quite a lot .
Writers Vs. Readers
There are a whole lot more writers out there than there are people reading the articles .
There is far more incentive for bloggers to use reddit than the average readers .
Readers may read only the top 10 of the day and move on to their next favorite site rather than wading through less popular posts .
People persuing their individual goals is the ideal economy , according to Milton Friedman .
In Reddit , the " merchants " or bloggers have the incentive to post their site and have all the other sites do badly , while the " consumers " or readers , have no incentive to vote unless it 's amazingly good , or conflicts / agrees with their moral / political idealogies .
The ratio of bloggers to readers voting on NEW story is heavily scewed towards bloggers .
Supporters of the reddit system may say : " This is how a democracy works , people can vote on what they like and do n't like .
It 's good we can kill unpopular views . " .
Reddit kills controvercial views , which are of far more value than unpopular views .
The comparison to democracy is incorrect because democracy allows all ideas , whether it 's Mormons or even Nazis , we respect people 's believes as long as they do n't harm physically others .
Stumbleupon uses the same vote up and vote down system , except the computers coordinate the content rather than completely eliminate controversial views .
This makes the system much more usable , friendly , and most importantly , targetted .
Newgrounds Method
The highly Successful site newgrounds allows people to vote content 0 through 5 .
The vote decides if the content will survive as it has to be at least rated 1.5 or higher with at least 100 to 200 votes per post .
Also , when you click on a submission , it makes you wait a certain amount of time before being able to rate the submission as to make the people actually view the submission .
The newgrounds method is not applicable to reddit , because as mentioned earlier the bloggers vs actual readers ratio is far too skewed in favor of the bloggers .
The influx of posts would be backlogged for months if reddit required even 50 unique people to rate each post .
There is not enough readers .
I 'm being redundant , but it 's such an important point .
Without a good chunk of people rating a large majority of quality articles are discredited by a small minority .
Similarly , a small minority can game a large majority with quiet anonimity and a catchy headline .
Unlike digg , reddit does n't show who voted for what unless the users allow .

Dear Cecil : I 'm a 9 to 5 fixed income kinda guy who cares about his family , nation , and world .
I overheard some of my levelheaded millionaire bosses talking about how the Federal Reserve is a private institution owned by individual banks .
Is n't our bank our bank ?
Please tell me this is not happening to my country .
Rob Khan , Chicago
Cecil replies :
Cecil replies :
You ’re not going to like this , Rob , but here are the facts .
Fact number one : the Federal Reserve System ( hereinafter the Fed ) , although created by Congress , is answerable not to the public but to itself .
The system is nominally controlled by member banks , i.e. , all national banks plus some state banks , but real power rests with the board of governors in Washington .
Fact number two : the Fed ’s chairman ( currently Alan Greenspan ) and board of governors are appointed for long terms by the president but ca n’t be removed by him and do n’t report to him or anybody else .
Fact number three : it was done that way for your own good .
Ha , you say .
If this were really a democracy , the Fed would be a public agency just like the post office .
Hmm , maybe you begin to see what the Fed ’s inventors were up to .
( Cecil realizes that strictly speaking the postal service itself is no longer a public agency .
Do n’t distract me . )
One may make the argument that we need the Fed because we ’re a democracy
Truth is , the Fed was purposely insulated from the petty concerns of the public , including , to be blunt , whether they can afford to eat .
" It ’s made complex so nobody will understand it , " one insider told me .
The Fed ’s chief aim is the stability of the banking system and the dollar and , by extension , the U.S. economy .
Were it otherwise , politicians would be tempted to manipulate federal monetary policy for their own gain .
For example , an incumbent president might lower interest rates in an election year to boost the economy temporarily and improve his chances of re-election , even if it meant higher inflation down the road .
But that ’s the least of it .
Cecil on occasion hears from some genius who thinks he ’s come up with the solution to the national debt : print enough money to pay the whole thing off !
This idea is , of course , completely nuts .
If you double the amount of money in circulation without increasing the amount of underlying wealth , all you ’ve done is make your currency worth half as much .
Nonetheless governments all over the world ( including the U.S. in pre-Fed days ) have pulled stunts like this repeatedly , setting off runaway inflation and wrecking their economies .
The Fed ’s ingenious system of monetary controls means it can’t happen here , at least not as easily .
In short , you should be grateful .
But of course you ’re not , because the whole thing reeks of elitism .
All I can suggest is that if you do n’t like it , you visit Russia or Argentina or any number of other Fedless countries whose money was rendered worthless by hyperinflation .
Granted these are extreme cases , but they illustrate what ’s at stake .
I do n’t mean to exaggerate the Fed ’s independence .
Alan Greenspan is called upon to testify before Congress periodically , and the system he heads would not long survive if it led the nation over a cliff .
Nor is the Fed unique .
A more or less autonomous central bank is a feature of virtually all capitalist economies .
There ’s a lot about such banks , just like there ’s a lot about capitalism , that offends the sensitive soul .
But they do have a compensating advantage , namely that most of the time they work .

FUGNIDO , Ethiopia — At 10 p.m. in a sweltering refugee camp here in western Ethiopia , a group of foreigners was making its way past thatch - roofed huts when a tall , rail - thin man approached a silver - haired American and took hold of his hands .
The man , a Sudanese refugee , announced that his wife had just given birth , and the boy would be honored with the visitor ’s name .
After several awkward translation attempts of “ Mark Bent , ” it was settled .
“ Mar , ” he said , will grow up hearing stories of his namesake , the man who handed out flashlights powered by the sun .
Since August 2005 , when visits to an Eritrean village prompted him to research global access to artificial light , Mr. Bent , 49 , a former foreign service officer and Houston oilman , has spent $ 250,000 to develop and manufacture a solar - powered flashlight .
His invention gives up to seven hours of light on a daily solar recharge and can last nearly three years between replacements of three AA batteries costing 80 cents .
The overcrowded municipal slums in Aynavaram , India , on the north side of Chennai form one of the nicer kidneyvakkams in the city .
View Slideshow CHENNAI , India – Aadil Hospital in Lahore , Pakistan is one of the top medical facilities in the region , rated on par with any hospital in the West , according to the International Organization for Standardization .
Kidney - transplant candidates stuck on a 10 - year waiting list in the United States might happily pay a consultant $ 35,000 or more to book an operation here .
Or , they could arrange it themselves for less than half that price .
These days , Aadil openly advertises two packages for transplant patients at steep discounts to the brokered rate : $ 14,000 for the first transplant , $ 16,000 for people who need a second organ after the first has failed .
Surgeons , Slums and Money : Organ Trafficking in India Black - Market Scandal Shakes India 's Ban on Organ Sales
Inside ' Kidneyville ' : Rani's Story
Why a Kidney ( Street Value : $ 3,000 ) Sells for $ 85,000
The Case for Mandatory Organ Donation

" You do not have to worry about the donor .
We shall provide a live donor arranged through a humanitarian organization , which has hundreds , " said Abdul Waheed Sheikh , CEO of Aadil Hospital in an e-mail interview with Wired News .
Scarcity has long been a key driver of the global kidney market , but in regions like India , Brazil , Pakistan and China , sellers are dealing with signs of a surplus .
Operations that once set back patients tens of thousands of dollars on the black market can now be had for a fraction of the cost in some places .
The price of a kidney transplant at one of the best hospitals in the Philippines , where organ sales are legal , was recently just $ 6,316 , according to a 2005 report by the Philippine Information Agency .
That compares to prices as high as $ 85,000 charged by professional organ hunters who place Western patients with donors from the slums of Manila .
Yet , legalization has seemingly not worked to alleviate the supply shortage for the patient .
Legal confusion , fear and an information gap have created a classic arbitrage scenario for connected vendors , and the vast profits available to the middlemen have entrenched market inequities and dented reform efforts , experts say .
Falling prices have hit the lowest end of the chain hardest .
In South Asia , sellers work through organ brokers who on average pay only a few thousand dollars for a healthy kidney , assuming they pay at all .
And that 's despite booming demand .
The World Health Organization in 2002 pegged the global number of people suffering from diabetes at 171 million .
By 2030 the number will climb to more than 366 million .
" Each country and each region therein has completely different situations than the next one , " explained a Los Angeles - based organ finder doing business online at the website liver4you.org , who asked to be identified only as Mitch .
" Since most overseas transplants are doctor - controlled , like ( from ) private medical practice in the United States , there is a wide range in prices ...
The donors are in such huge supply where it 's legal , like the Philippines , so they have to accept the average of $ 3,000 ( for selling their kidneys ) . "
Savings are rarely passed on to the buyer .
Once the organs move from the streets into the medical supply chain , their value inflates quickly .
Mitch said he typically charges between $ 35,000 and $ 85,000 for kidney transplants .
Depending on where those operations take place , Mitch could clear $ 25,000 or more per transaction .
" When Iran legalized live donations , they bought the argument that the short supply of kidneys was really only a marketing problem , " said Nancy Scheper - Hughes whose nonprofit Organs Watch monitors organ trade around the world .
" But by making the government responsible for managing the black - market kidney trade , the so - called transplant coordinators were turned into brokers and kidney hunters – or more accurately into thugs who troll the streets and homeless shelters for people to donate on the cheap . "
In Chennai , K. Karppiah is widely considered one of the most active players in the kidney trade , having been fingered by dozens of organ donors from the slums north of the city .
He declined requests to be interviewed for this story .
When a reporter visited his house , a man outside was laying asphalt .
" Everyone knows Karppiah , " he said .
" On this street , all the houses are his . "

Tisti , ki čakajo spremembo z neba , naj si kupijo dober stol
Zadnje čase opažam prevladujoč trend v našem družbenem prostoru .
» Saj bodo drugi , jaz moram samo počakati , da sprememba pride do mojega doma , « si misli večina ljudi , ki ima možnost politične participacije v naši državi .
Kategorija : Kolumna | Datum objave : Monday , 14 .
05 . 2007 | Avtor : Domen Savič
Čakajoč na spremembe od zgoraj spominja na Beckettovo dramo .
Tudi tam glavna akterja čakata na spremembo .
Od zgoraj .
» Nič se ne godi , nihče ne pride , nihče ne odide , strašno je ! « vzklikne eden od glavnih protagonistov v tej drami in ne bi si mogel izmisliti bolj primernega slogana za današnji čas .
Pa je stvar zelo preprosta .
Najprej si morate priznati , da niste bog .
Vem , to je težko .
Še bolj zato , ker vsi ostali mislijo isto .
Da so bogovi oni .
Še Grki so imeli na Olimpu manj gneče !
Vseeno je prvi korak nujen in obvezen .
Brez ljudi namreč ne morete spremeniti družbe .
In bogovi niso ljudje .
Priznanju naj sledi zavedanje , da se tudi vi lahko česa naučite .
Ne bodite naduti , kot so bili Škoti , ko so prejšnji teden ugotovili , da so glasovalni lističi prezapleteni in jih veliko ljudi ni znalo pravilno izpolniti .
Izobraževanje je nujno !
In končno se je potrebno vprašati , kaj me moti ?
Kje vidim težave ?
Zakaj se ne vključim v reševanje ?
Veliko ljudi namreč tarna nad počasnostjo postopkov , hkrati pa se ne zavedajo svoje vloge v reševanju težav .
Ste videli neurejeno odlagališče odpadkov ?
Poslikajte in pošljite pristojni službi !
Vas moti način vodenja vaše občine ?
Pritožite se !
Več ljudi več vidi .
Predvsem pa se dobivajte s prijatelji in namesto tračev prežvekujte ideje .
Bodite konstruktivni .
Splet vam ponuja neskončne možnosti .
Blogi , forumi , dopisni seznami…vse vam je na voljo brezplačno .
Uporaba je enostavna .
Učinek pa je lahko ogromen .
Vendar tega ne boste izvedeli , če ne boste sodelovali .
Vprašajte tiste , ki to že počnejo .
Pridružite se jim !
Veseli bodo vaše pomoči , ker se zavedajo moči ljudstva .
Največjo težavo trenutno vidim pri očaranju ljudi s tehnologijo .
Bodisi , da jo ljudje sovražijo ali pa fanatično obožujejo , nihče pa ne gleda onkraj samih orodij .
Blogi se enačijo z osebnimi zapisi , forumi so kraj za žalitve in zmerjanja , elektronsko pošto pa ljudje zelo redko uporabijo za politično participacijo .
Moji kritiki mi pojasnjujejo , da “ bodo ljudje že sami zase ugotavljali , kako in kaj je prav . ”
Da “ nimam pravice vsiljevati svojega mnenja drugim in pričakovati , da bodo vsi ravnali tako , kot trdim sam . ”
Kritike lepo kažejo nerazumevanje , ki zaradi prevladujočega duha individualizma vlada v naši družbi .
Nihče se noče pogovarjati .
Vsi hočejo samo izražati svoja mnenja .
Enosmerno in brez odziva .
Dialoga ni predvsem zato , ker ga ljudje nočejo in v manjši meri zato , ker ga vladajoča garnitura onemogoča .
Dokler dialog ne bo obstajal , ne bo pomagalo nič drugega .
Tisoč različnih modelov , milijon različnih možnosti , pa se stvar ne bo nikamor premaknila .
Začeti je potrebno od spodaj in pri posamezniku .
Evforija ne vodi nikamor in s takim “ načinom dela ” , kot ga imamo sedaj , ne bomo prišli daleč .
Zagotovo pa ne v svetlo prihodnost , kjer bo lahko vsak posameznik generator sprememb in kjer se bo dejansko slišal vsak glas .
V največji simfoniji na svetu .
Za konec pa si odgovorite na spodnja tri vprašanja :
After the creative business cards showcase received over a million page views , I decided to post part two .
These cards are also out - of - the - box ideas that most clients would love to have , but would never have the balls to actually use .
Hopefully you will enjoy the ideas presented here as much as I did and will get inspired to create your own cool designs .
I would like to thank everyone who sent me their coolest designs !
Let ’s start with a cutting edge design .
Literally .
And if you managed to cut too deep use this rubber band to stop arterial bleeding .
Which brings me to this bloody cool design .
You can play with this forever .
When you ’re done playing , look at this concept where the card is in a small plastic bag to protect it from getting wet .
Naturally this is done for a swimming instructor .
Cheap and great .
You can make use of other inexpensive household objects as well to grab the attention and make sure you wo n’t fit into the standard business card holder .
Like this clothes pin “ card ” .
Ideally you would need to be relevant to the subject of your profession with your idea .
Like this condom pack that is used by a divorce lawyer as his visiting card as well as distributed in bars as a direct marketing piece .
Or this hair grip holder for a hair and make - up artist .
And if you really want to be remembered , give a whoopee cushion .
It ’s certainly great fun on one hand , or I should rather say one cheek .
Personally , I would n’t want my persona to be associated with loud farts .
How about these silly glasses ?
While it will make my 2 year old laugh for sure , good luck with them on the board meeting .
You can stop cracking jokes and still remain playful by designing a card that germinates and demonstrates your abilities to create a great park in no time , as it is done for this landscaper architect .
Another card that demonstrates a profession is the card of Kevin Mitnick , the famous hacker , which is essentially a lock picking tool set .
He always said that the easiest way to get hold of a password is to ask the blond secretary for it in an authoritative tone , so I have no idea why he needs to break in anywhere .
Another metallic card .
This one is in the shape of a mini designer working hard at his desk .
One more mini person at your service any time you wish to pull him out of your pocket .
Let ’s look at more cards that refer to professions .
Here is a card that resembles a Larry King microphone for a DJ .
Another done for an architect that features a ruler .
Do n’t expect a Hundertwasser style building from this guy !
This card demonstrates what the National Encyclopedia does .
Explains what things are .
Great idea for a simple product .
Demonstrate what hinges do directly with your card .
Yes , it ’s been done too many times , but it still works .
A card for a restaurant with a bite .
I wonder if I should put ketchup or mustard on my card before eating it .
I think I ’ll put both .
A card for a gift shop with a ribbon and a bow of course .
How sweet !
This sandpaper based card is made for a finishing school in India .
What the hell do they teach at a finishing school ?
I wonder what came first .
The client or the idea ?
Talking about special paper , here is a card made of really shiny paper .
Nothing modest about this one .
Miss Hilton would love it .
More folding shiny goodness for a puppeteer .
If you ca n’t think of an idea , you can still use a special material for your card and it will still make you stand out from the crowd .
Like this one made of fine corrugated cardboard .
This card also uses special material , but in this case it ’s totally relevant .
It ’s printed on rough textile that is similar to the material of the bags coffee comes in .
Traditionally cards are designed by graphic designers or art directors and copywriters are not part of the process .
But you really should involve your writer next time .
Check out this funny set of visiting cards .
Another great copy based concept here .
This simple copy based business card reminds me of my dad , who always said it pays to be honest .
So , if you ca n’t afford a talented copywriter , just be yourself and be brutally honest .
I wonder what this guy ’s personal card says .
I love you (r tits ) ?
Talk about being broke .
Do n’t print a card at all , just buy a pack of playing cards and write your contact info on it .
You can also recycle train or parking tickets .
Giving away ATM slips or used sanitary products are not recommended .
If you like the idea of tickets and have the budget to get it printed you can simply copy the design .
Or fake a pack of chewing gums .
It will be most popular with the Singapore customs officers .
And while away send miniature postcard - like business cards to prospective clients .
If you feel royal send cards that look like letters stamped with wax .
While you ’re at it , why do n’t you introduce the whole company at once .
Give your client a whole portfolio of cards .
Or you can make the client come back for the next piece of your corporate puzzle .
If you ’d rather stay away from such a frankenface , simply create a series of cards with different designs on their backs and give a new one to your partner for every new assignment .
Works great with clients with obsessive compulsive disorder .
Your partner may not have OCD , but have you tested him for color blindness ?
You may try to do just that with this card that reveals the cardholder ’s face reproduced with an inkjet printer sporting a stunning 1dpi resolution .
Be careful , a card says a lot about their owner .
This clever folding matryoshka doll card for example suggests multiple personality disorder .
To cure these conditions , how about offering a pack of pills ?
Going back to fun foldings , here is a card that can be turned into a sundial .
It ’s been created for an antique watch collector .
Another interesting folding will be liked by modelers .
Fold a toy car and keep it on your desk .
Please do n’t overdo these folds .
Daniel who ?
Mr Castor what ?
This one simply confuses the hell out of me .
Great way to intimidate your client into never calling you again .
This one is stripy .

As Americans anguish over how to extricate this country from Iraq without a disaster greater than what we now have , and without our friends suffering the fate of our friends in Cambodia and Vietnam , they had best brace themselves .
This escalator is going up .
George Bush and his generals are laying out the case for a new war .
And there has been no resistance offered either by a vacationing Congress or the major presidential candidates .
On CNN ’s Late Edition Sunday , Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno , No. 2 commander in Iraq , said , “ It is clear to me that [ the Iranians ] have been stepping up their support ” for enemy fighters in Iraq .
“ They do it from providing weapons , ammunition , specifically mortars and explosively formed projectiles .
They are conducting training within Iran of Iraqi extremists to come back here and fight the United States . ”
Maj . Gen. Rick Lynch said his troops were following 50 members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , who have been crossing the border and training fighters in Iraq .
The State Department is about to declare the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization .
Earlier in August , President Bush directly charged Tehran with aiding Iraqi insurgents who are killing U.S. soldiers :
“ I asked Ambassador Crocker to meet with Iranians inside Iraq to send the message that there will be consequences for people transporting , delivering EFPs , highly sophisticated IEDs , that kill American troops . ”
The EFPs are roadside bombs that penetrate Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Abrams tanks .
They have taken the lives of scores of U.S. soldiers .
Whether Bush has made the decision to attack the al - Quds training camps inside Iran , he has painted himself into a corner .
If he does not strike the camps , he will be mocked by the War Party as a weak commander in chief , too timid to use U.S. power to protect soldiers he sent into battle or to punish those killing them .
Thus , Bush must either announce that his diplomacy has worked , and attacks out of Iran have diminished or been halted , or he will have to explain why the Top Gun of the carrier Lincoln was too wimpish to do his duty by the soldiers he sent to fight .
Who is pushing for attacks on Iran ?
Israel and its lobby .
Vice President Cheney .
Sen. Joe Lieberman , who has been calling for air strikes on al - Quds camps for months .
And a War Party facing lasting disgrace for having lied the country into an unnecessary war , and for having assured the American people it would be a “ cakewalk . ”
The arguments for war on Iran are both strategic and political .
Israel is terrified Iran will end its nuclear monopoly in the Middle East and wants an all - out U.S. war on Iran to prevent it .
The War Party fears Iran may acquire a nuclear weapon , which would inhibit U.S. freedom of action in the Gulf and convince the Arab states that the United States is yesterday and they must appease Iran or go nuclear themselves .
As for Bush and Cheney , if they go home without hitting Iran ’s nuclear sites , and Iran acquires a nuclear weapon , the Bush Doctrine will have been defied by the Ayatollah as well as Kim Jong - Il , and their legacy will be a no - win war in Iraq .
The War Party is thus seeking an excuse to launch air strikes on Iran , as that would trigger Iranian counterstrikes on our forces .
Then they will have their long - sought casus belli for U.S. strikes on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
First , the al - Quds camps , then Natanz , Isfahan , and Bushehr .
Initially , Americans might cheer the bombing of Iran , and Congress would head for the tall grass .
But as U.S. strikes would be an act of war , rallying the Iranians behind the failing regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and igniting a long war the end of which we cannot see and the troops for which we do not have , there are powerful arguments against a new war .
Iran and the United States would both pay a hellish price , and Iran at least seems to recognize it .
Both the Iraqi and Afghan governments say Iran is behaving as a good neighbor .
There is evidence Tehran ’s nuclear program is faltering , or being curbed .
Iran is said to be making concessions to UN inspectors .
Iran has released an American seized in response to our seizure of five Iranian “ diplomats ” in Iraq .
Iran ’s ambassador to the United Nations , in a letter to the Washington Post , denies Iran is aiding the Iraqi insurgency and calls on the U.S. government to “ proffer evidence ” and “ provide the list of Iranian agents who it alleges are operating in Iraq . ”
If there is a rush to war here , it is not on the part of Iran .
As Bush is preparing for war on Iran , if he has not already decided on war , where is Congress , which alone has the constitutional power to authorize a war ?
Or has it given Bush and Cheney another blank check ?

Thanks for visiting !
For much of my adult life I 've been shackled by fear .
I 've been afraid to try new things , afraid to meet new people , afraid of doing anything that might lead to failure .
This fear confined me to a narrow comfort zone .
Recently , however , I made a single small change that has helped me to overcome my fear , and allowed me to get more out of life .
Last fall somebody at Ask Metafilter posted a question looking for books about self - confidence .
One person recommended Impro by Keith Johnstone .
Intrigued , I borrowed it from the public library .
It blew my mind .
Though it 's a book about stage - acting , several of the techniques it describes are applicable to everyday life .
I was particularly struck by the need for improvisational actors to accept whatever is offered to them on stage .
In order for a scene to flow , an actor must take whatever situation arises and just go with it .
( Watch old episodes of Whose Line is It Anyway to see this principle in action . )
Johnstone writes :
Once you learn to accept offers , then accidents can no longer interrupt the action . [ … ]
This attitude makes for something really amazing in the theater .
The actor who will accept anything that happens seems supernatural ; it 's the most marvelous thing about improvisation : you are suddenly in contact with people who are unbounded , whose imagination seems to function without limit . [ … ]
These ‘ offer - block - accept ' games have a use quite apart from actor training .
People with dull lives often think that their lives are dull by chance .
In reality everyone chooses more or less what kind of events will happen to them by their conscious patterns of blocking and yielding .
That passage had a profound effect on me .
I thought about it for days .
“ What if I did this in real life ? ” I wondered .
“ Is there a way I could adapt this to help me overcome my fear ? ” I began to note the things that I blocked and accepted .
To my surprise , I blocked things constantly — I made excuses not to do things because I was afraid of what might happen if I accepted .
I made a resolution .
I decided that instead of saying “ no ” to things because I was afraid of them , I would “ just say yes ” .
That became my working motto : “ Just say yes ” .
Any time anyone asked me to do something , I agreed to do it ( as long as it was n't illegal and did n't violate my own personal code of conduct ) .
In the past six months , I 've put this philosophy into practice in scores of little ways .
But the power of “ yes ” has made larger changes to my life , too , has exposed me to things I never would have done before .
Soon after I started saying “ yes ” , a GRS reader offered to provide free wellness coaching .
My gut reaction was to say “ no ” .
But I caught my negative thinking .
“ Just say yes , ” I said to myself .
So I did .
Working with Lauren , my wellness coach , has been an amazingly positive experience .
Ramit at I Will Teach You to Be Rich asked me to contribute to his eBook .
I had all kinds of reasons for saying “ no ” — none of them good — but I forced myself to say “ yes ” .
As a result , this site gained new readers , and I got to correspond with Ramit about how to produce a PDF book .
Last winter , Sally shared a guest article about eating vegetarian on the cheap .
A few weeks later she wrote that she and her husband would be in town , and asked if Kris and I would like to have dinner .
In the past I would have said “ no ” out of fear of meeting a stranger .
I said yes , and I 'm glad I did .
One of my friends works as a career counselor at a nearby university .
Recently he asked me to present a talk to graduating seniors about the basics of personal finance .
Normally I would refuse out of hand , but only because I am afraid .
I said yes .
Though the presentation fell through , the copious notes I made will serve as the basis for many future articles .
A close friend asked me to go see a band I 'd never even heard of .
On a Thursday .
At midnight .
This was totally outside my comfort zone , but I said yes .
The experience was fantastic .
We had a great conversation , and then I got to discover The Black Angels and their wall of sound .
I do n't know anything about table tennis , but when my former soccer coach stopped by to recruit me for a local club , I agreed to join .
It 's been fun learning the sport , and getting re-acquainted with his family .
( I was once good friends with his son . )
These things will seem minor to the extroverts here .
But for me , these were big steps .
These experiences were new , and I would n't have had them if I had n't forced myself to just say yes .
Most of my experiences from my “ just say yes ” campaign have been positive , but not all of them .
I 've had some failures , too .
Surprisingly , I 've learned more from the bad experiences than I have from the good .
In February , for example , a Seattle radio station asked me to do a telephone interview about retirement savings .
“ I 'm not a retirement expert , ” I told the woman who contacted me , but then I realized I was making excuses .
I was blocking because I was scared .
“ But I 'll do it , ” I said .
Ultimately my radio appearance was a disaster .
I got stage - fright and became tongue - tied .
But you know what ?
I do n't care .
I failed , but at least I tried .
After the interview , I e-mailed the woman to apologize and to ask for advice .
She was sympathetic , and gave me some great pointers .
Next time somebody asks for a radio interview , I 'll do better .
For too long , fear of failure held me back .
Failure itself did n't hold me back — the fear of it did .
When I actually try something and fail , I generally get right back up and do it again , but better the second time .
I pursue it until I succeed .
But often I convince myself that I can't do something because I 'm going to fail at it , so I do n't even bother to try .
Since I 've learned the power of yes , I 've begun to act as if I 'm not afraid .
Whenever I feel fear creep upon me , I act as if I 'm somebody else .
I act as if I 'm somebody stronger and braver .
Motivational speaker Brian Tracy says :
If you want to develop courage , then simply act courageously when it 's called for .
If you do something over and over again , you develop a habit .
Some people develop the habit of courage .
Some people develop the habit of non-courage .
Tracy recommends that any time you encounter the fear of failure , you simply tell yourself , “ I can do it . ”
Say it again and again and then do it .
What 's more , he says , tell others that they can do the things they 're frightened of .
How many times have you seen somebody excited about a new project become totally deflated when others tell them why it wo n't work .
Do n't be like that .
Tell the person , “ You can do it . ”
Be supportive .
Tracy is famous for asking the question :
What would you dare to dream if you knew you would n't fail ?
This is a powerful concept .
What could you do if you stopped telling yourself “ no ” and simply tapped into the power of yes ?
Aside from learning the power of yes , there are other ways to fight fear and develop a more courageous attitude .
Start small .
Many people are afraid to make phone calls , or to approach a clerk in a store .
Begin by practicing these little habits .
A clerk in a book store answers hundreds of questions a month .
There 's no reason to be frightened of asking yours .

Try one new thing each week .
It does n't have to be big .
Learn a new skill , have lunch with an acquaintance , do something for a friend .
Once every week , say “ yes ” where you might have said “ no ” before .
It does n't have to be big .

Exercise mindfulness .
When fear creeps into your head , name it for what it is , and let it pass by .
I know this sounds new age and hokey , but it works .
When somebody asks you to do something and your gut reaction is “ no ” , pause to examine that “ no ” and ask yourself , “ Am I saying this simply out of fear ?
What would happen if I said yes ? ”

We all have dreams , but most of us make excuses for not pursuing them .
Often these excuses are n't overt .

Mireya Acierto
Amber Hawk Swanson met Amber Doll on January 25 and the two were married the next day in matching rented gowns at the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .
Swanson noted a few gawkers as she wheeled her bride through the casino and into the chapel , “ but people who are in Vegas are already ready to sort of have something wild come at them , ” she says .
“ I only got one real look of disgust . ”
Swanson , a video and performance artist , had ordered her bride online : Amber Doll , a lifelike sex doll , was specially made to look just like her .
Their wedding video and other footage documenting their relationship will screen for the public this week .
Swanson , who ’s 26 , earned two BFAs at Iowa State University and an MFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago .
She studied printmaking , drawing , and painting , but never video .
The doll project grew out of a response to a job she had before grad school designing for Stride Rite .
Disturbed by the elongated figures of fashion sketches , Swanson wanted to caption them with the words of real women and began videotaping her sorority sisters to generate quotes .
She ended each interview with the same question : “ How do you define feminism ? ”

Intrigued by their responses , Swanson began talking to more women and by 2005 she herself was in front of the camera .
“ Feminism ? ” consists of ten shorts in which she quotes from interview transcripts while participating in her own objectification .
One short , Not a Feminist Way of Thinking : Daddy ’s Little Girl , re­creates a scene from Lolita ; in it Swanson ’s real - life father paints her toenails .
Two others ,
That ’s Deep and That ’s Deep Again , show Swanson being penetrated from behind — in one video by a man , in the other by a woman — while repeating “ That ’s deep , ” one woman ’s answer to her final question .
“ I was interested in the cultural phenomenon of young women rejecting feminism , ” Swanson says .
“ In some ways I took on the character of a young woman doing so — either rejecting feminism or being naive about it . ”

“ Feminism ? ” toured colleges and film festivals and is now part of the collection at the Museum of Contemporary Photography .
Reaction was understandably intense .
“ I put myself in my own mock porns .
I was not only sexualized but I was also hyperfeminized , ” Swanson says .
“ People conflated the persona of the work with me .
There was so much attention , positive and negative .
I was excited to get attention but also overwhelmed by it . ”
That ’s when Swanson began researching Realdolls — whose scale , molded features , silicone skin , and adjustable joints make them eerily realistic — as a tool for exploring the boundary between the real and the fantasy .
“ I was looking for a receptacle for the onslaught of attention and negative feedback — a stand - in for myself , ” Swanson explains .
“ It was just the right amount of crazy to order a $ 12,000 doll . ”

Amber Hawk Swanson / Colin Lyons
It took some convincing to get the San Diego - based company to go along with her vision .
Customers can dictate everything from the style and color of their Realdoll ’s hair to his or her shoe size , but making a doll in a particular person ’s image is considerably more costly .
Last July 4 , after several weeks of negotiation , Swanson put $ 6,000 down on a doll that would be four inches shorter than her , with a waist six inches smaller , but have a face identical to her own .
( A full body replica would ’ve doubled the cost . )
She set the date for her 3 - D facial scan — executed by Burbank - based Cyber F/X , which caters to Hollywood — to coincide with her birthday so she and Amber Doll would share the same one .
In the months before the doll ’s arrival , Swanson prepared her home , buying the doll gifts of jewelry and clothing that often matched her own .
“ I increasingly began thinking about her as my ideal woman and eventual wife , ” she says .
“ I would lie in bed and rub my hand on the sheets where I knew she ’d be lying soon . ”
Swanson began to recognize herself in the people who detailed their relationships with their sex dolls online .
“ I identify with the other owners in a real genuine way , ” she says .
“ Whether it ’s dating related — not being able to have romantic relationships or whatever — or that desire for companionship as well as to enact violent fantasy . ”
She had her wrist tattooed with the word “ Bully ” and had Realdoll paint the word “ Prey ” in the same font on the doll ’s wrist .
In January she got word that her doll was nearly finished .
“ The total time from the beginning of my discussions with them to eventually picking her up to be mine was nine months , ” Swanson says .
“ Which of course cracks me up , thinking about her as my twin , my wife , and a baby of sorts . ”
She flew out to the Realdoll warehouse in California to film the final four days of production and then packed Amber Doll in a car and drove her to Vegas , shooting the entire way .
Footage from the warehouse and the wedding ceremony are included in the video To Have , To Hold , To Violate : The Making of Amber Doll , which screens Saturday at “ Diamonds at Dusk , ” an outdoor showing of films by local queer artists .
Since the wedding Swanson has put Amber Doll to use in a project exploring the interplay between fantasy and reality in sexual relationships .
The finished work , which is still untitled , will contrast stills of intimate “ partnership ” scenes with video reenactments of rape scenes from movies such as Irreversible and The Accused .
Unlike “ Feminism ? ” which spoofed sexualized depictions of women in popular culture , Swanson ’s latest videos are meant to mimic them as closely as possible — with one main departure .
In the rape scene reenactments , both Swanson and Amber Doll will be dressed as the victim in the film .
She gets most of her costumes from Forever 21 and H&M , including dresses similar to the one worn by Monica Bellucci in Irreversible .
“ These places had the majority of the ‘ asking for it ’ outfits I was looking for , ” she explains .
She aims to wrap up the project by May , when she ’ll have a solo show at Locust Projects in Miami .
After that , it seems like she might need a break from Amber Doll .
“ In so many ways she ’s a huge hassle , ” Swanson says .
“ I already spend so much time taking care of my own body , and it takes triple that to care for the doll . ”
Taking the doll , which weighs 135 pounds , off her wheeled metal stand is a trick in itself .
“ It ’s beyond a hassle , ” says Swanson .
“ It ’s so difficult just to lift her off .
Or to even put her face back on ; it velcros on and falls off all the time . ”
And since Amber Doll ’s skin is made of silicone rubber , “ everything sticks to it .
I use tape and rubbing alcohol to clean it .
It just gets so dirty . ”
The honeymoon , however , is not entirely over .
Later this month Swanson and Amber Doll will host a joint birthday party and belated wedding reception for friends .
A tent will be set up and there ’ll be wedding cake .
Swanson is still toying with ideas for what to do with Amber Doll once the project is finished .
“ I ’ve thought a lot about it , ” she says .
“ It does seem like there needs to be an end to the body .
I had a dream where I shot her in the face and it ricocheted and killed me .
August 8 , 2007 , 11:58 pm
This is really big news , and a fabulous example of why two - way scientific discourse is still valuable , in the same week that both Newsweek and Al Gore tried to make the case that climate skeptics were counter - productive and evil .
Climate scientist Michael Mann ( famous for the hockey stick chart ) once made the statement that the 1990's were the
warmest decade in a millennia and that " there is a 95 to 99 % certainty
that 1998 was the hottest year in the last one thousand years . "
( By
the way , Mann now denies he ever made this claim , though you can watch him say
these exact words in the CBC documentary Global
Warming : Doomsday Called Off ) .
Well , it turns out , according to the NASA GISS database , that 1998 was not even the hottest year of the last century .
This is because many temperatures from recent decades that appeared to show substantial warming have been revised downwards .
Here is how that happened ( if you want to skip the story , make sure to look at the numbers at the bottom ) .
One of the most cited and used historical surface temperature databases is that of NASA / Goddard 's GISS .
This is not some weird skeptics site .
It is considered one of the premier world temperature data bases , and it is maintained by anthropogenic global warming true believers .
It has consistently shown more warming than any other data base , and is thus a favorite source for folks like Al Gore .
These GISS readings in the US rely mainly on the US Historical Climate Network ( USHCN ) which is a network of about 1000 weather stations taking temperatures , a number of which have been in place for over 100 years .
Frequent readers will know that I have been a participant in an effort led by Anthony Watts at SurfaceStations.org to photo - document these temperature stations as an aid to scientists in evaluating the measurement quality of each station .
The effort has been eye - opening , as it has uncovered many very poor instrument sitings that would bias temperature measurements upwards , as I found in Tucson and Watts has documented numerous times on his blog .
One photo on Watt 's blog got people talking - a station in MN with a huge jump in temperature about the same time some air conditioning units were installed nearby .
Others disagreed , and argued that such a jump could not be from the air conditioners , since a lot of the jump happened with winter temperatures when the AC was dormant .
Steve McIntyre , the Canadian statistician who helped to expose massive holes in Michael Mann 's hockey stick methodology , looked into it .
After some poking around , he began to suspect that the GISS data base had a year 2000 bug in one of their data adjustments .
One of the interesting aspects of these temperature data bases is that they do not just use the raw temperature measurements from each station .
Both the NOAA ( which maintains the USHCN stations ) and the GISS apply many layers of adjustments , which I discussed here .
One of the purposes of Watt 's project is to help educate climate scientists that many of the adjustments they make to the data back in the office does not necessarily represent the true condition of the temperature stations .
In particular , GISS adjustments imply instrument sitings are in more natural settings than they were in say 1905 , an outrageous assumption on its face that is totally in conflict to the condition of the stations in Watt 's data base .
Basically , surface temperature measurements have a low signal to noise ratio , and climate scientists have been overly casual about how they try to tease out the signal .
Anyway , McIntyre suspected that one of these adjustments had a bug , and had had this bug for years .
Unfortunately , it was hard to prove .
Why ?
Well , that highlights one of the great travesties of climate science .
Government scientists using taxpayer money to develop the GISS temperature data base at taxpayer expense refuse to publicly release their temperature adjustment algorithms or software ( In much the same way Michael Mann refused to release the details for scrutiny of his methodology behind the hockey stick ) .
Using the data , though , McIntyre made a compelling case that the GISS data base had systematic discontinuities that bore all the hallmarks of a software bug .
Today , the GISS admitted that McIntyre was correct , and has started to republish its data with the bug fixed .
And the numbers are changing a lot .
Before today , GISS would have said 1998 was the hottest year on record ( Mann , remember , said with up to 99 % certainty it was the hottest year in 1000 years ) and that 2006 was the second hottest .
Well , no more .
Here are the new rankings for the 10 hottest years in the US , starting with # 1 :
1934 , 1998 , 1921 , 2006 , 1931 , 1999 , 1953 , 1990 , 1938 , 1939
Three of the top 10 are in the last decade .
Four of the top ten are in the 1930's , before either the IPCC or the GISS really think man had any discernible impact on temperatures .
Here is the chart for all the years in the data base :
There are a number of things we need to remember :
This is not the end but the beginning of the total reexamination that needs to occur of the USHCN and GISS data bases .
The poor correction for site location and urbanization are still huge issues that bias recent numbers upwards .
The GISS also has issues with how it aggregates multiple stations , apparently averaging known good stations with bad stations a process that by no means eliminates biases .
As a first step , we must demand that NOAA and GISS release their methodology and computer algorithms to the general public for detailed scrutiny by other scientists .
.
The poor correction for site location and urbanization are still huge issues that bias recent numbers upwards .
The GISS also has issues with how it aggregates multiple stations , apparently averaging known good stations with bad stations a process that by no means eliminates biases .
As a first step , .
The GISS today makes it clear that these adjustments only affect US data and do not change any of their conclusions about worldwide data .
But consider this :
For all of its faults , the US has the most robust historical climate network in the world .
If we have these problems , what would we find in the data from , say , China ?
And the US and parts of Europe are the only major parts of the world that actually have 100 years of data at rural locations .
No one was measuring temperature reliably in rural China or Paraguay or the Congo in 1900 .
That means much of the world is relying on urban temperature measurement points that have substantial biases from urban heat .
All of these necessary revisions to surface temperatures will likely not make warming trends go away completely .
What it may do is bring the warming down to match the much lower satellite measured warming numbers we have , and will make current warming look more like past natural warming trends ( e.g. early in this century ) rather than a catastrophe created by man .
In my global warming book , I argue that future man-made warming probably will exist , but will be more like a half to one degree over the coming decades than the media - hyped numbers that are ten times higher .
So how is this possible ?
How can the global warming numbers used in critical policy decisions and scientific models be so wrong with so basic of an error ?
And how can this error have gone undetected for the better part of a decade ?
The answer to the latter question is because the global warming and climate community resist scrutiny .
This weeks Newsweek article and statements by Al Gore are basically aimed at suppressing any scientific criticism or challenge to global warming research .
That is why NASA can keep its temperature algorithms secret , with no outside complaint , something that would cause howls of protest in any other area of scientific inquiry .
As to the first question , I will leave the explanation to Mr. McIntyre :
While acolytes may call these guys " professionals " , the process of
data adjustment is really a matter of statistics and even accounting .
In these fields , Hansen and Mann are not " professionals " - Mann
admitted this to the NAS panel explaining that he was " not a
statistician " .
As someone who has read their works closely , I do not
regard any of these people as " professional " .
Much of their reluctance
to provide source code for their methodology arises , in my opinion ,
because the methods are essentially trivial and they derive a certain
satisfaction out of making things appear more complicated than they
are , a little like the Wizard of Oz .
And like the Wizard of Oz , they
are not necessarily bad men , just not very good wizards .
For more , please see my Guide to Anthropogenic Global Warming or , if you have less time , my 60 - second argument for why one should be skeptical of catastrophic man-made global warming theory .
Update : Nothing new , just thinking about this more , I can not get over the irony that in the same week Newsweek makes the case that climate science is settled and there is no room for skepticism , skeptics discover a gaping hole and error in the global warming numbers .
Update # 2 : I know people get upset when we criticize scientists .
I get a lot of " they are not biased , they just made a mistake . "
Fine .
But I have zero sympathy for a group of scientists who refuse to let other scientists review their methodology , and then find that they have been making a dumb methodology mistake for years that has corrupted the data of nearly every climate study in the last decade .
Update # 3 : I labeled this " breaking news , " but do n't expect to see it in the NY Times anytime soon .
We all know this is one of those asymmetric story lines , where if the opposite had occurred ( ie things found to be even worse / warmer than thought ) it would be on the front page immediately , but a lowered threat will never make the news .
Oh , and by he way .
This is GOOD news .
Though many wo n't treat it that way .
I understand this point fairly well because , in a somewhat parallel situation , I seem to be the last anti-war guy who treats progress in Iraq as good news .
Update # 4 : I should have mentioned that the hero of the Newsweek story is catastrophic man-made global warming cheerleader James Hansen , who runs the GISS and is most responsible for the database in question as well as the GISS policy not to release its temperature aggregation and adjustment methodologies .
From IBD , via CNN Money :
Newsweek portrays James Hansen , director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , as untainted by corporate bribery .
Hansen
was once profiled on CBS ' " 60 Minutes " as the " world 's leading
researcher on global warming . "
Not mentioned by Newsweek was that
Hansen had acted as a consultant to Al Gore 's slide - show presentations
on global warming , that he had endorsed John Kerry for president , and
had received a $ 250,000 grant from the foundation headed by Teresa
Heinz Kerry .
Update # 5 : My letter to the editor at Newsweek .
For those worried that this is some weird skeptic 's fevered dream , Hansen and company kind of sort of recognize the error in the first paragraph under background here .
Their US temperature chart with what appears is the revised data is here .
Update # 6 : Several posts are calling this a " scandal . "
It is not a scandal .
It is a mistake from which we should draw two lessons :
We always need to have people of opposing opinions looking at a problem .
Man -made global warming hawks expected to see a lot of warming after the year 2000 , so they never questioned the numbers .
It took folks with different hypotheses about climate to see the jump in the numbers for what it was - a programming error .
Climate scientists are going to have to get over their need to hold their adjustments , formulas , algorithms and software secret .
It 's just not how science is done .
James Hansen saying " trust me , the numbers are right , I do n't need to tell you how I got them " reminds me of the mathematician Fermat saying he had a proof of his last theorem , but it would n't fit in the margin .
How many man-hours of genius mathematicians was wasted because Fermat refused to show his proof ( which was most likely wrong , given how the theorem was eventually proved ) .
Final Update : Some parting thoughts , and recommendations , here .
The Firefox people , just about to release version 2.0 of the browser , have put up a wiki page asking for feature requests and suggestions for future Firefoxes .
Now , that to me sounds like a great idea .
And then I looked at the list .
There are already about four hundred suggestions on the list .
As far as I can tell , damned nearly every one of them is useless .
Let ’s examine the reasons for uselessness .
Things that already exist “ I would like to see an option that would allow me to click on a link and it open in a new window or tab and not leave the page I ’m on until the new window / tab has fully loaded . ”
That ’s load - tabs - in - the - background , which I have turned on right now .

That ’s load - tabs - in - the - background , which I have turned on right now .
“ When a numeric portion of the URL in the address bar is highlighted , allow it to be incremented / decremented using the mouse wheel . ”
If you want Pornzilla , you know where to find it .

If you want Pornzilla , you know where to find it . “ Or a variant that could be run from an usb stick , that you could use your personalised browser anywhere . ”
Portable Firefox .

Portable Firefox . “ Make it possible to have firefox started as a new process with a switch ( firefox.exe - np ) to be able to have two instances running in case you are testing something that crashes the browser . ”
Just create a second profile and launch with it .

“ Tab Exposé ” .
Foxpose .
Things that clearly belong in an extension “ These days , we seem to be only allowed to “ save as ” in HTML or text .
This then means we have to use time - consuming external programs instead of it being a quick and easy drop - down selection .
Please give us back our old “ save as ” options [ed : as PDF , etc ] and also include a new ODF “ save as ” option . ”
This sort of thing is operating system level , not Firefox level .
Install CutePDF on Windows ;
Macs can already print to PDF ; everything can already print to PostScript .
I can vaguely see the use of some of these , but “ I want to save this as PostScript ” is such a geek edge - case anyway that doing it through Print To File is hardly a barrier .

I would like to see user - picked colors for specific domains . ”
Interesting use - case ( a synaesthete ) , and he says he ’ll write it himself , so that ’s good ; it ’s an extension , though .
Not Firefox core .
Things that are basically impossible to do “ Sessions / Tabs Isolation :
Make sure sessions from other tabs do not leak between tabs .
This is a major security hazard . ”
What this means is that every tab is an independent browser .
Firefox ’s memory usage would go through the roof .
This goes double for people who say “ one tab crashing should n’t crash anything else ” , which means that every tab is a separate process .

“ Use heuristics to try and avoid caching sensitive data for autocompletion .
For example , if something looks like a credit card number or social security number , do n’t cache it . ”
I assume that means “ like a US Social Security number ” , right ?
Or will you not mind if you enter what you think is a phone number and it refuses to cache it because it looks like a Russian SSN ?
Make Firefox into Internet Explorer “ Allow an option run a downloaded setup file ( in the place of “ open ” ) instead of saving it , like in Internet Explorer . ”
There is a reason it does n’t do this .
It should not be easy to click a web exe and have it run !

Add fallback mode to support non-standards based rendering when “ IE only ” features are present in a web page so that the page will render correctly . ”
This means : completely implement total compatibility with IE .
As if it were made easy by saying it .
Let alone that Firefox policy is generally , when faced with a choice , to do it right rather than to emulate IE .

There are quite a few “ turn Firefox into Opera ” requests , too .
Why not just use Opera if that ’s what you want ?
Things that are moronic “ Allow us to specify which order each plugin will sit in . ”
Why ?
WHy is this even remotely useful ?

You want JavaScript to be unrestrictedly allowed to open socket connections ?
Ahahaha .
No .
If you strip out all of those , then you ’re left with barely anything .
More importantly , there ’s nothing actually good left in the list ; it ’s all little incremental improvements .
Is Firefox really so good that no - one can think of anything it might do differently ?
It ’s the perfect execution of the web browser concept ?
It surely is n’t .
I intend to lay out a few thoughts on what I ’d like to see happen in a future post , but for now I ’ll just say : ca n’t we do better than this ?
To be honest , I ’m being unfair .
There are some good suggestions in the list .
What disappoints me is the lack of decent solutions , the lack of vision .
Most of the ones that are in my “ it already exists ” category above ( and there are many that I did n’t highlight ; the above is just a selection ) are things where I happen to know that it exists but I can understand that users do not .
I need to go through the Firefox list and update it with some of these complaints or pointers to existing implementation , so that people can know .
The moronic suggestions , by contrast , tend to be things that fall foul of Raymond Chen ’s “ what would happen if it actually did this ? ” thought experiment .
The interviewing has begun !
Yesterday I sat with the people ’s choice , Peter Norvig for our first interview session .
I ’ve also signed up Joe Armstrong , inventor of Erlang , and Bernie Cosell , one of the software geniuses behind the original ARPANET IMPs .
Both of these guys were not only kind enough to agree to be interviewed but also invited me to stay in their homes when I travel to interview them .
Simon Peyton Jones has also agreed to be interviewed assuming the publisher of another book of interviews that has already signed him up for a group interview about Haskell does n’t object .
I ’ve got a half - dozen other queries out with more on the way .
Hopefully soon I ’ll have my full roster of sixteen interviewees signed up and can start figuring out how to stretch my rather small travel budget to get me all the places I need to go to do the interviews .
On a geekier note , after I did a practice interview with a friend and went to try out the transcription software I had downloaded , I discovered that it did n’t understand the WMA files that my digital voice recorder produces .
Turns out on GNU / Linux the best way to convert WMA to MP3 involves using the program Mplayer to convert the WMA to a WAV file .
While skimming through the Mplayer man page I discovered it has a “ slave mode ” where you can type commands at it .
“ Hey , ” I thought , “ If I can control it by typing commands at it that means I can also control it by having Emacs type commands at it . ”
A bit of elisp hacking later and I turned Emacs + Mplayer into a quite nice bit of transcription software .
A few features :
Auto - insertion of timestamps into the transcript at the beginning of each paragraph .
Rewinding the audio back to the previous timestamp at the touch of a key ( combo ) .
Automatically backing up a few seconds when I pause .
I experimented with having it automatically pause whenever I hit the backspace key and resume when I started typing again but that did n’t turn out to be as handy as I thought it would .
The nice thing , of course , about having written my own software to do this is that as I get into the work of transcribing all these interviews I ’ll be able to spend an endless amount of time procrastinating by fiddling with my transcription software .
Er , that is , I ’ll be able to tweak it just the way I want it to maximize my transcribing efficiency .
( Ironically , because of either a limitation of the WMA format or a bug in Mplayer the jumping to timestamps does n’t work quite right when transcribing WMA files so I still end up having to convert to MP3 files . )

Neck Deep Secret : Gore Was Right Having written several books that span periods of years , I ’m often surprised how patterns emerge that are n’t apparent to me in day - to - day news coverage .
In Neck Deep , our new book about George W. Bush ’s presidency , one of those surprises was how often former Vice President Al Gore turned up making tragically prescient comments .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Gore , whose admirers sometimes call him “ the Goracle , ” comes across more as a Cassandra , warning the nation of looming disasters and finding himself either ignored or mocked by the dominant politicians and media pundits .
Time and again – from Campaign 2000 to the post - 9/11 “ war on terror ” to the invasion of Iraq to Bush ’s expansion of presidential powers – Gore pointed to grave dangers when nearly all other national political leaders and media bigwigs were either running with the herd or keeping silent .
In our daily coverage of those political developments at Consortiumnews.com , we ’d run stories citing Gore ’s speeches , but it was n’t until we pulled together the book that Gore ’s extraordinary role jumped out .
Though there were a few other political leaders who made prophetic comments , such as Sen.
Robert Byrd in his pre-Iraq
War speeches on the Senate floor , none was as consistently on target as Al Gore .
Indeed , a poignant aspect of Neck Deep is the recognition that a less hostile press treatment of Gore during Campaign 2000 or a full - and - fair recount of votes in Florida after Election 2000 might have put the United States on a very different track .
Hearing Gore ’s nuanced advice about how to proceed after the 9/11 attacks , why invading Iraq made little sense or what are the proper limits of presidential power , you ca n’t help but wonder where the United States would be now if the popular will of the American voters had been respected in November - December 2000 .
There ’s a good chance that more than 3,700 American soldiers would be alive today , along with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
The United States also might not be faced with the horrible choice of either continuing an open - ended occupation of Iraq or withdrawing troops with the prospect of a sectarian war engulfing the Middle East .
Even if Gore and his national security team could not have prevented the 9/11 attacks – and there ’s a case to be made that they might have – President Gore surely would have focused American retaliation on Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda , not left the job half done and gone after Iraq , which had nothing to do with 9/11 .
Gore did n’t buy into the neoconservative agenda of invading Muslim countries to impose regime change designed to bring those governments in line with Israel ’s goals for the region .
Though a supporter of Israel who picked Sen .
Joe Lieberman as his vice presidential running mate , Gore kept the neocon agenda at arm ’s length .
Gore also did n’t share Dick Cheney ’s agenda of establishing an imperial presidency that could ride roughshod over the rule of law , the constitutional checks and balances , and the inalienable rights of American citizens .
Like no other American politician , Gore perceived the challenges and the opportunities of the 21st century .
He recognized the potential of the technological revolution and understood the threat of uncontrolled climate change .
Despite some weaknesses as a politician – he certainly lacked Bill Clinton ’s glibness and George W. Bush ’s swagger – Gore might have been a near ideal leader for the start of the new Millennium .
And one could argue that the American people made that judgment by giving Gore a narrow plurality in the popular vote .
But , as Neck Deep explores , deep - seated problems in the U.S. political process and the U.S. news media kept Campaign 2000 close enough so Bush could exploit irregularities in Florida ’s balloting to snake away with its electoral votes and thus the White House .
Now , as the nation is poised at the starting line for another presidential race , the same failings are still there .
The tragic lessons of recent American history remain little understood by either the broad public or the political elite .
One of the chief reasons for writing Neck Deep was to place the troubling events of the George W. Bush era in the fullest historical context possible , a perspective informed by original investigative journalism that explodes some popular myths and spotlights many crucial facts that will change how people understand these extraordinary years .
Our hope is that an American public , armed with enough information , will not tolerate the kind of distorted political process that overturned the popular will in Election 2000 and launched the nation on a disastrous course .

" Crap , this address is wrong , " Brenda sighed , cursing herself for screwing up another address label .
Jason S. happened to be within earshot of the aggravated Accounts Receivable clerk , and having worked on the customer management application and label printing mechanism , he asked Brenda what she meant .
" These always get sent back to me when I go to send them to Australia and forget they 're ' special , ' " she explained .
" Special " meant to Brenda what " international " means to the rest of us .
Looking at the returned envelope , Jason noticed that no country was specified on the shipping label .
" See , I had run out of country labels on a day that I was sending a bunch of invoices out and did n't have time to make new ones .
I print them up on label paper , and cut them out so that I have little stacks of labels for the different countries .
Then I print out the address label and put the country labels over the mailing labels that need it . "
" And this has n't ever caused problems ? " Jason asked .
" Not really , " replied Brenda .
" I mean , we 've been doing this for years .
It 's really not a big deal except when big invoices are returned , then wind up overdue , then we have to go in the accounting system and open an invoice extension request , and then it 's just - "
" I'm sorry , can you give me a sec ? " Jason interruped .
During the 20 second walk back to his desk , he thought to himself , this is like a 20 second walk .
Why would n't Brenda just walk over and report the issue so I could fix it ?
Jason went back to his desk and checked the customer file .
Sure enough , their country was set to Australia .
He opened the Crystal Reports file used to print labels , and as expected , the country name was n't a part of the template .
He added the country name to the report , tested it out , and it worked .
Jason grabbed the latest version from source control , made the change , and checked it in .
All tolled , it took about five minutes .
Twenty seconds later , he was back at Brenda 's desk , happily reporting that the issue had been fixed .
Brenda was still skeptical , though , and hung on to her freshly printed and cut pile of country labels .
Still , there 's a good lesson here that 's often missed ; pay attention to what users are doing with the provided system and by unblocking minor bottlenecks you can become the hero .

lambdaことはじめ
私の職場では一部のプロジェクト でSchemeを使っている。私はハッピーなのだが、 C言語に慣れている他の同僚は、戸惑うことも多いようだ。 今日も同僚の一人( 仮に Chrisとしとこう ) がオフィスにやってきて尋ねた。
「 あるリストの各要素に対して関数 foo を適用したいんだ。 for - each が使えそうなんだけど、問題があって、 foo は 2つ引数を取るんだ。一つ目にはリストの各要素を、 二つ目にはこのコードのローカルで定義されている変数を渡したい。どうすれば良いんだろう?」
わかりやすくするために、CとSchemeでコードを書いてみる。Chrisがやりたいのは、 Cで書けばこんな感じのコードなのだろう。( リストを表す
List 型は どっかで適当に定義されているとする ) 。
/* 例 1 */ void bar( List list , Context ctx ) {
List listp ; for ( listp = list ; listp ; listp = listp -> next ) { foo( listp -> element , ctx ) ; } }
Schemeには、与えられたリストの各要素に対して関数を呼び出す for - each という組み込み関数がある。これが使えそうだ。
( for - each 関数 リスト ... )
例えば、次のコードはリストの各要素 " a " , " b " , " c " に対して関数 display を適用して、出力に ` abc ' と表示する 。
; ; 例 2 ( for - each display ' ( " a " " b " " c " ) )
複数の引数を取る関数を渡すこともできる。その場合、それぞれの引数に対応する
リストを for - each に渡す。例えば ：
;; 例3 ( for - each cons ' ( 1 2 3 ) ' ( 4 5 6 ) )
この例では、 ( cons 1 4 ) , ( cons 2 5 ) , ( cons 3 6 ) が順に実行される。 ( for - each は結果を捨ててしまうので、このコード例は 実質的に何もしない。同じ構文で使える map では、各要素への実行結果が リストになって返される。 )
さて 、Chrisの問題に戻ろう。 foo が一つの引数しか取らないのであれば、 例 2 のようにしてやれば良いわけだが、 foo は 二つの引数を要求している。では例3のパターンを使ってみようか。
; ; 例4 ( define ( bar list context ) ;; DOESN'T WORK ( for - each foo list context ) )
残念ながらこれはうまく動かない。 for - each は第2引数以降にリストを要求するのに、
Chrisは foo に context そのままを渡したいのだ。 ここ でSchemerがやるのは、 lambda を使ってローカルな関数を作ってやることだ。
;; 例5 ( define ( bar list context ) ( for - each ( lambda ( listp ) ( foo listp context ) ) list ) )
lambda で始まる部分は、一つの引数を受け取る無名の関数を生成する。 それによって、 例2のパターンが使えるようになる。 lambda の内部からはそれを囲むローカル変数が参照できるので、その中で context を foo に渡してやれば、問題解決というわけだ 。
でもさ、いちいち関数を作るの、重くない?
しかし 、Chrisは納得できないようだ。
「 うーん、lambdaを使うやり方は思い付いたんだよ。でもさ、
Cで書いたバージョ ン( 例1 ) では foo をループから直接呼べたのに、 Schemeバージョ ン ( 例5 ) では一回関数呼び出しが増えてるでしょ。 それに、この lambda は 「 関数を生成する 」 と言うけど、 bar が呼ばれる度に毎回毎回関数を生成してるのかな。 なんだかよく分からないけど、重そうじゃない ?
もっとストレートにやる方法はないのかなあ。」
いや、例5のバージョンはこれ以上無い程ストレートなのだが… なるほど、 C言語においては、関数とその呼び出しコードは、明示的にインライン宣言でもしない限り
レジスタ退避・スタックフレームの作成や破棄などの
定型処理を含めたコードとしてコンパイルされる。そのオーバヘッドは、
関数本体の処理が小さい程、そして呼ばれる回数が多い程、負担になる。
例5のように、何も処理をせずに別の関数を呼ぶためだけの関数なんて
無駄以外の何者でもない、と思ってしまっても無理はない。
実はSchemeでは、関数は抽象的に処理単位を記述するために使われ、
実際に実行されるコード上でのスタックフレームの操作とは必ずしも
一対一に対応しないのだ。 特に、 lambda で作られた関数や ローカルに定義された関数は処理系がその使われ方を解析できることが多いため、 様々な方法で最適化が可能だ 。
例5のような場合、少なくとも2通りの最適化が考えられる。 lambda フォーム内の foo の呼び出しは、 lambda で定義された関数の一番最後にあるから、これは末尾呼び出しだ ( * 1 ) 。
この場合、処理系が賢ければ、fooへの制御の受渡しは関数呼び出しではなく
単なるジャンプ処理に変換されるので、 関数呼び出しのオーバヘッドはfooを直接呼ぶ場合とほどんど変わらない。 これが一つの方法。
また、 for - each は組み込み関数だから、 ユーザによって置き換えられていない限り、 これをインライン展開することも可能だ。 すると、 lambda で作られる関数はここでしか使われていないから、 それ自身もインライン展開が可能で、 結局、実行されるコード はC言語版の 例1 とほとんど同じになり、 関数呼び出しのオーバヘッドは foo を呼び出すだけとなる。 このステップを疑似コードを使って書いてみると、下の例6のようになる。
; ; 例 6 : 例 5 の 関数の最適化 ;; 元の関数 ( define ( bar list context ) ( for - each ( lambda ( listp ) ( foo listp context ) ) list ) ) ;; for - each をインライン展開 ( define ( bar list context ) for each element listp in list : ( lambda ( listp ) ( foo listp context ) ) ) ;; lambdaをインライン展開 ( define ( bar list context ) for each element listp in list : ( foo listp context ) )
処理ブロックとしての lambda
Cにも例えば sort など関数ポインタを受け取る標準関数というのはあるが、
Schemeではずっと多くの標準関数が関数の形の引数を取る。 上に挙げた for - each もそうだし、例えばファイルの入出力に便利な call - with - output - file なんかもそのパターンだ 。
( call - with - output - file filename func )
この関数は、filenameで与えられるファイルをオープンして 得られるポートを関数funcに渡す。 funcから戻るか、func内でエラーが生じて制御が外に出る際に、 ファイルは閉じられる( * 2 ) 。
ファイルのオープン／クローズを気にせずに簡単にファイル入出力が行えるので なかなか便利だ。よくfuncのところにlambda式を入れた形で使われる。
; ; 例7 ( call- with-output - file " tempout.txt " ( lambda ( port ) ;; port は " tempout.txt " への出力ポート ( display " Hello , world " port ) ;; " Hello , world " をファイルへ出力 ( newline port ) ;; 改行をファイルへ出力 ) )
このように使われるlambdaは関数を生成しているというより、
C言語で {} で囲まれたブロックを使うという感覚だ。 そして実際、処理系が call - with - output - file の動作を知っていれば、 for - each の時と同じようにインライン展開が可能で 、
例7は下の例8のCコードと同じように実行され得る。
/* 例8 */ { FILE port = fopen ( " tempout.txt " , " w " ) ; /* エラー処理は省略 */ fprintf ( port , " Hello , world " ) ; fprintf ( port , "
" ) ; fclose ( port ) ; }
一般に、 lambda で生成された関数は、 処理系がその関数の使われる場所を全て追うことができれば、 すなわち、どこかに保存されたり未知の関数の引数として渡されたりしなければ、 あたかもローカルのコードブロックのように扱うことが可能だ。
Schemeプログラマは、よく関数の中でローカルに関数を定義して使う。
ローカルな関数も、要は lambda で作られる無名の関数に あとから参照しやすいように名前をつけているだけだから、
処理系がその関数の使われ方を解析できれば、
関数本体をコードブロックのように展開することができる。
次に示すのは例7と等価なコードだ。等価というのは、
単に同じ動作をするというだけでなく全く同じ効率で動作し得るということだ。
;; 例9 ( letrec ( ( proc ( lambda ( port ) ; 処理ブロックに名前をつけておく ( display " Hello , world " port ) ( newline port ) ) ) ) ( call-with-output - file " tempout.txt " proc ) ) ;;
上の式が関数定義のボディだったり、let文の中に置かれた場合は、次のような ;; " internal define " という構文も使える。ローカル関数を定義しているという ;;
ことがはっきりわかるので、このスタイルを好む人もいる。実行効率は上のコードと ;; 同じなので、どちらを使うかは単なるスタイルの問題。 ( let ( ) ( define ( proc port ) ; ローカル関数procを定義 ( display " Hello , world " port ) ( newline port ) ) ( call-with-output - file " tempout.txt " proc ) )
私は、複雑な処理をこなさなければならない時に部分部分をどんどん
ローカル関数にしてしまう流儀だ。 例えば、次のようなCの関数を考えてみる。
/* 例 10 */ void big_function ( Obj v , Obj w , Obj x , Obj y , Obj z ) { Obj r , Obj s , Obj t , Obj u ; /* 処理のローカルなコンテキスト */ int error = 0 ; /* エラーが起きたらセットされる */ /* 第 1ステップ */ ... ( r , s , t , v , w , x , y , z を使う長ーい処理 、500行 ) ... if ( error ) return ; /* 第 2ステップ */ ... ( またr , s , t , v , w , x , y , z を使う長ーい処理 、500行 ) ... if ( error ) return ; /* 第 3ステップ */ ... ( またまたr , s , t , v , w , x , y , z を使う長ーい処理 、500行 ) ... if ( error ) return ; }
あまり良いコーディングではないけれど、 こういうコードをいじらなければならないことは現場では往々にしてあるものだ。
この関数を各ステップ毎に分割しようとすると、
それぞれの関数に処理のコンテキストである変数
r 〜 z を引数経由で渡してやらねばならない。実行効率が気になる時や、 まだ書きかけの状態で引数の仕様などがはっきりしていない時には あまりそういうことをしたくないものだ。
Schemeでは、ローカル関数を定義して見通しを良くすることができる。 big-function は依然として大きな関数だが、 内部の define を使って処理を関数の形で分割したものが次のコードだ。
; ; 例 11 ( define ( big- function v w x y z ) ( let ( ( r # f ) ( s # f ) ( t # f ) ( u # f ) ) ( define ( step - 1 ) ;; 第 1 ステップ。エラー時に#f , 成功時に#tを返す ... r , s , t , u , v , w , x , y , z を使う長ーい処理 ... ) ( define ( step - 2 ) ;; 第 2ステップ。エラー時に#f , 成功時に#tを返す ... r , s , t , u , v , w , x , y , z を使う長ーい処理 ... ) ( define ( step - 3 ) ;; 第 3 ステップ。エラー時に#f , 成功時に#tを返す ... r , s , t , u , v , w , x , y , z を使う長ーい処理 ... ) ;; 関数本体。処理の流れが一目瞭然。 ( and ( step - 1 ) ( step - 2 ) ( step - 3 ) ) ) )
ここでも、処理系がしっかりしていれば 各ローカル関数 step - 1 , step - 2 , step-3 はインライン展開され、関数呼び出しのオーバヘッドは発生しない。
まあ、関数の定義の開始部と本体とが離れてしまうので
依然として読みにくいことは読みにくいが…
ローカル変数の束縛と引数の束縛
例7と例8のコードを見比べてみると、ローカルに定義された lambda の 引数 ( port ) が、オープンに展開された時にローカル変数に置き換えられて
いるのに気付く。実際、 lambda の名前の由来でもある ラムダ算法においては、ローカルな変数 ( ほんとは変数という名称は適切でないが…束縛かな)
はラムダ式を使って導入される。次の二つの例を比べてみよう。
; ; 例 11 ( let ( (a 1 ) ( b 2 ) ) (+ a b ) ) ;; このコードは次のコードと等価 ( ( lambda ( a b ) (+ a b ) ) 1 2 )
先に述べたようなコードのオープン化を行えば、この両者は全く同等に実行される。 次の例も同じだが、 lambda がローカルに束縛されている。
; ; 例 12 ( define ( foo x y ) ( letrec ( ( bar ( lambda ( a b ) (+ a b ) ) ) ) ( bar x y ) ) ) ;; このコードは次のコードと等価 ( define ( foo x y ) ( let ( ( a x ) ( b y ) ) (+ a b ) ) )
この例でわかるように、ローカル変数の束縛と引数の束縛とは実質的に同じものだ。
Schemeプログラマが lambda を多用する時は、 多かれ少なかれこのような最適化を処理系に期待しており、 暗黙のうちに両者を読み替えている場合が少なくないと思う。
Cプログラマがよく混乱す るSchemeの構文に、named - let構文がある。 ローカル変数を束縛する通常の let とよく似ているが、 let と変数束縛の記述との間にシンボルが入っているものだ。 次のように定義される*3:。
; ; named let構文 ( let name ( ( var expr ) ... ) body ... ) ;; これは次のコードと等価 ( letrec ( ( name ( lambda ( var ... ) body ... ) ) ) ( name expr ... ) )
私が最初にこの説明を見たとき、何がなんだかさっぱりわからなかったのを覚えている。 let はローカル変数を定義する構文なのに、何故 lambda が出て来る必要があるのか 。
例12の関係が理解できるまで、どうしても納得がいかなかった。
( named let構文の定義 は 例 12 の書き換えを逆にして、 let の後に名前を入れただけだ ) 。
何でわざわざ特別な構文まで用意するのかというと、
この構文が実に便利だからだ。 私は特に、ループを書く時に多用する。 次の例はtrivialだが、1から100までを加算するコードだ。
( Schemeにおいて " loop " という識別子には特別の意味はなく、 単なるローカル変数として使われている ) 。
; ; 例 13 ( let loop ( ( num 1 ) ( sum 0 ) ) ( if (> num 100 ) sum ( loop (+ num 1 ) (+ sum num ) ) ) ) ;;
これは次のコードと等価。つまり再帰で計算をしている。 ;; 末尾再帰なので実行効率はループと同じ。 ( let ( ) ( define ( loop num sum ) ( if (> num 100 ) sum ( loop (+ num 1 ) (+ sum num ) ) ) ) ( loop 1 0 ) )
遅延処理構文としての lambda
lambda はまた、 特定のコードブロックの処理の実行を遅らせる構文と考えることも出来る。 通常の関数呼び出しでは、関数が呼ばれる前にその引数が全て評価されて、 関数本体にはその結果だけが渡されるわけだが、 上に例をあげた for - each や call - with - output - file では、関数が欲しいの は 「 評価すべき内容」であって 「 評価の結果」ではない。
どんなプログラミング言語にも、 「 評価結果ではなく評価すべき内容 」 を必要とする場合がある。 例えば条件分岐では、条件の真偽によってその後に実行すべき内容が変わるから、 if 文に渡される引数を最初に全部評価してしまうわけにはいかない。
Schemeでも if は関数ではなく構文( syntax ) として定義されている 。
しかし、関数呼び出しを基本とするSchemeにおいて構文とは特殊な存在であり、
あまり無節操に構文を増やしたくはない。でないと、
コードを読む度にこの引数は評価されるのかどうかと悩むことになってしまう。
そのため、かどうかは実は知らないのだが、
他のプログラミング言語では構文にしてしまっているような機能が、
Schemeでは組み込み関数として定義されているものがいくつもある。
もちろんその場合、呼び出す側はコードブロックを lambda で括って渡すわけだ。上の例にあげた call - with - output - file の例も、 lambda フォームはコードブロックを評価せずに渡す役割をしている と見ることができる。
例外事態が起きてルーチンを抜ける前に、ファイルを閉じるとか一時ファイルを
消すとか、何らかの後始末を行っておかねばならない場合がしばしばある。
C++ だったら、try-catch構文を用いることで実現できる。
/* 例 14 */ void foo( ) throws Exception { FILE * fp = fopen ( " input " , " r " ) ; try { /* fpを使った処理。例外時に はException がthrowされる。 */ } catch ( Exception e ) { fclose ( fp ) ; /* closeを忘れずに */ throw(e ) ; } fclose ( fp ) ; return OK ; }
Schemeには、このような場合のために dynamic - wind という組み込み関数が用意されている * 4 :。 これは3つの引数無しの関数を受け取って、それを順繰りに実行する。
とりあえず、3つの関数はそれぞれ前処理、処理本体、後処理と考えて良いだろう。
そして、もし処理本体でエラーが発生して処理が中断された場合でも、
後処理ブロックは必ず実行される。 ( 厳密な説明をするには「継続」の説明をしなくてはならないので、
この文書の範囲を超える。今のところはこのように理解しておいて欲しい。)
上のC++コードと似たような処理は、こんなふうに書ける。
; ; 例 15 ( define ( foo ) ( let ( ( fp # f ) ) ( dynamic - wind ( lambda ( ) ;; 1 番目のブロック。前処理。 ( set ! fp ( open - input - file " input ) ) ) ( lambda ( ) ;; 2番目のブロック。処理本体 ; ; inputを使った処理 ) ( lambda ( ) ;; 3 番目のブロック。後処理 ( close - input - port fp ) ) ) ) )
C++の例と違って、後処理ブロックは本体が正常終了しても必ず実行される。
( 逆に、特定の例外だけを捕まえるための構文というのはScheme規格にはない。 継続を使えば出来るが、その説明はまたの機会に。)
もちろん、他で3 つの関数を定義しておいて dynamic - wind に渡してやっても構わない。 for - each の時と同様に、 アグレッシブな処理系は dynamic - wind に渡された関数がローカルなものであればインライン展開するだろう。
dynamic - wind は実質的には言語組み込みの機能だから、 構文にしてしまっても良かったのでは、という気もするかもしれない。 実際 、CommonLispでの対応する機能 unwind - protect は構文として定義されている。 dynamic - wind だって、次のよ う
に3つのフォームを受け取るように定義しておけば、 lambdaが省けてすっきりする 。
; ; 例 16 構文版のdynamic wind ( dynamic - wind - syntax ( begin ... ) ;; 前処理フォーム ( begin ... ) ;; 本体フォーム ( begin ... ) ) ;; 後処理フォーム ;; これを使って例15を書くとこうなる。lambdaは不要。
( define ( foo ) ( let ( ( fp # f ) ) ( dynamic - wind - syntax ( set ! fp ( open - input - file " input ) ) ) ( begin ; ; inputを使った処理 ) ( close - input - port fp ) ) ) )
どちらが良いかは、まあ、究極、好みの問題になるのかもしれない。 きっと、慣れたSchemeプログラマはlambdaをほとんど無意識に使用するので、
例15のようなlambdaの洪水を見ても別に気にならないのだ。
だから、コーディング上すっきりする dynamic - wind - syntax よりも、 関数という一般的な概念で全てが記述できる現在の dynamic - wind の方を好むのだろう。 ( ちなみに、慣れ たLispプログラマはカッコの存在を意識しないなんて話もある ) 。
「 関数を生成する」って具体的には何をしているの?
ここまでは、lambdaで生成された関数やローカルで定義された関数が
最適化によってインライン展開される、すなわちC言語での関数みたいに重くはならないんだ、
という議論だった。しかし、最適化出来ない場合というのもたくさんある。
具体的にはこんなケースだ。
生成された関数が、他の未知の関数に引数として渡される場合
生成された関数がグローバル変数に束縛される場合
生成された関数が戻り値として返されて、そのあとどのように使われるかわからない場合
こういう場合は、ちゃんとスタックフレームの処理などを伴うC言語的な「関数 」 が生成される必要がある ( ここでは実行モデルに、C言語との親和性が高い スタックアーキテクチャを使っていると考える。
継続渡しスタイル等にすれば事情はちょっと変わって来るが、それは別の話。)
これも、C言語に親しんで来たプログラマにはぴんと来ない話だと思う。
Cでは全ての関数はコンパイル時に決定されていて、
その関数アドレスを受け渡したりすることはできるが、
実行時に関数を「作る」とは? まさかlambdaフォームが評価される度にコンパイラが走ったりしているのだろうか。
次 は、lambdaフォームによる実行時の関数の作成を示すのに良く使われる例だ。
;; 例 17 ; ; 「 与えられた数にXを加える」という関数を生成する関数
( define ( addx x ) ( lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) ;; 「 与えられた数に4を加える」という関数add4を作成 ( define add4 ( addx 4 ) ) ;; add4の適用 ( add4 5 ) => 9 ( add4 8 ) => 12 ; ; 「 与えられた数に-1を加える」関数sub1を作成 ( define sub1 ( addx - 1 ) ) ( sub1 5 ) => 4 ( sub1 8 ) => 7 ; ; addxで作られる関数を直接呼び出すこともできる ( ( addx 13 ) 17 ) => 30
関数addxは引数xを取り、新たな関数を作成して返す。 作られる関数はひとつの引数yを取り、 それに作成時に与えられるxの値を足したものを返す。 xを変えてaddxを何度も呼べば、その都度異なる動作をする関数が返って来る。
ここで知りたいのは、addxの中で具体的に何が起きているか、だ。
addxがいくつ関数を作ろうが、 それぞれの関数が内部で行っている「処理のステップ」は全く同じである、
ということに注目しよう。 add4 も sub1 も、 内部でやっていることは引数 y を受け取って x と加算する という手順だ。 違う動作をするように見えるのは、そこで参照されている x が add4 の場合は4 、 sub1 の場合は - 1である、 という違いがあるからだ 。
例17のコードは、頑張ればC++で書き直すことができる。 ( Cでもできるけどもう少し複雑になる。 )
/* 例 18 */ class Closure { public : int x ; int apply ( int ) ; } ; /* これがlambdaの中身 */ int Closure : : apply ( int y ) { return ( this ->x + y ) ; } /* addxの本体 */ Closure * addx ( int x ) { Closure *c = new Closure ; c->x = x ; return c ; } /* add4やsub1を作ってみる */ Closure * add4 = add x ( 4 ) ; add4-> apply ( 5 ) ; /* =>
9 */ add4->apply ( 8 ) ; /* => 12 */ Closure * sub1 = addx ( - 1 ) ; sub1 -> apply ( 5 ) ; /* => 4 */ sub1 -> apply ( 8 ) ; /* => 7 */
addxの中のlambdaで処理されるべきステップ、すなわちxとyを足す、
というのはコンパイル時に確定しているから、
それは一つの関数としてコンパイルしておける
( Closure : : apply ) 。しかし、 addxが呼ばれた時点 でのxの値を記憶しておくために、 クラス Closure を定義している。 addxは関数ポインタではなく Closure のインスタンスを返す 。
実は、この Closure こそ がSchemeにおける 「 関数」の正体なのだ。 Schemeに限らず、ローカルな関数の定義を許す言語では、
関数は 「 処理手順 」 と「 環境」のペアで表現される。 上の例では " xとyを足す " というのが処理手順で、xの値がその環境だ。 処理手順はコンパイル時に確定している ( Cの関数は 「 処理手順」のみによって構成されていると考えられる )。
実行時に関数が 「 作られる」というのは、 既にコンパイルされている処理手順へのポインタと、
関数が作られる時点での環境とを合わせたオブジェクトが作られる、ということだ。
Schemeの場合、環境とは関数が定義される場所から見えている変数束縛の全てだ。
関数を作った時点で、それらの変数束縛を関数の中に「閉じ込む」ことから、
このようにして作られる関数をclosureと呼ぶ。
Closureは実用的なプログラム中でも非常に便利なものだ。 例えば、GUI関係のコードをCで書いたことのある人なら、
特定のイベントが起きた時の動作をコールバックで記述したことがあるだろう。
Cのインタフェースでは、 コールバックを登録する時に付加的なデータへのポインタを一緒に登録するようになっていることが
多い。次に示すのは仮想的なGUIライブラリを使って、
ボタンひとつのトップレベルウィンドウを作り、
ボタンがクリックされたらトップレベルウィンドウを消す、というコードだ。
/* 例19 仮想的なGUIコード */ void quit_button_callback( void * client_data ) { Widget main_window = ( Widget) client_data ; destroy_window( main_window ) ; } Widget make_main_window ( ) { Widget main_window = make_toplevel_window( ) ; Widget button = make_button ( main_window ) ; /* add_callback ( Widget w , void ( * callback ) ( void * ) , void * data ) */ add_callback( button , quit_button_callback , ( void * ) main_window ) ; }
GUI ツールキットによって詳細は違うが ( それに普通はもっとめんどくさいが ) コードのだいたいの骨格は似たようになるだろう。ここでは、 add_callback の3番目の引数が付加的な情報として、コールバック関数に渡されている。
Schemeの場合、渡したい付加的な情報はクロージャの中に閉じ込むことが出来るから、
余分な引数は必要ない。次の例では、 コールバック関数をlambdaで直接作成している。
; ; 例 20 ( define ( make - main - window ) ( let* ( ( main - window ( make- toplevel - window ) ) ( button ( make - button main - window ) ) ) ( add - callback button ( lambda ( ) ( destroy - window main - window ) ) ) ) )
まとめ
以上、長々と説明してきたが、簡単にまとめると：
Schemeにおける「関数」はより抽象的な処理ブロックを記述するのに使われ、
C言語における 「 関数」とは一対一に対応しない。
ローカルに定義されてすぐ適用される関数は、ほとんどの場合、インライン化可能。 だからSchemeプログラマは気軽にlambdaを使いまくる。
実際に関数が生成されるという場合でも、既に固定された「処理手順」に
その時の「環境」を対にして返しているだけ。
ということになる 。
C言語を使い込んだ人であればある程、 C言語の関数が機械語レベルでどのように実行されるか知っているがゆえに、
Schemeの関数の概念に戸惑うことがあると思う。 この文章が理解の助けになれば幸いだ。

Microsoft announced today that Windows Home Server has been released to manufacturing ( RTM ) .
Major Microsoft partners will be receiving final code in the coming weeks , which means we 'll start seeing official server products based on Windows Home Server sometime in September .
HP , Gateway , Fujitsu - Siemens , Lacie , Medion and Iomega have all announced products based on WHS .
" System builder " code , which is partner - speak for the shrink - wrap " OEM version , " should be available in approximately two month 's time , which is also when a 120 - day evaluation copy should also rear its head .
French , German and Spanish editions wo n't be far behind .
Microsoft made a very wise decision when it reversed its position on making WHS available to end users through " system builder " programs last May .
As a result , users can obtain Windows Home Server from any number of resellers who will offer the server software in " OEM bundles " with hard drives , motherboards , or even just cables .
Microsoft has not yet announced pricing , but this could be a fantastic way to put an old PC to use .
Charlie Kindel , GM of Windows Home Server , shared part of the toast he gave to the WHS Team on the project 's blog where the announcement was first made : " A community of highly enthusiastic customers rose around us .
We made them part of the development process and rewarded them and they amplified our efforts , " he said .
" Congratulations and thanks for helping ship the coolest version of Windows ever : Windows Home Server . "
We must admit to being fans of Windows Home Server ourselves , and we can testify to the strength of the community testing WHS .
Participating in the beta over the past several months , we 've found the code to be stable , the features well - thought - out ( though we have some complaints ) , and the level of interest in the project is strong .
If that interest spills over into development , WHS could become even better , since Microsoft released a WHS SDK in April .
So far , Microsoft is playing all its cards right with this product .
We outlined the essential features of WHS earlier this year , but we 'll be bringing you a review of the RTM code before too long .
We have three reviewers working on WHS , so when our review is ready , it will be thorough .

According to Hrag Vartanian , a blogger who also works at the Armenian General Benevolent Union , the backlash against the Anti-Defamation League started on July 8 * , when Jewcy published Fire Foxman , our call for Abe Foxman to be fired as head of the ADL in part for his denial of the Armenian Genocide .
Then the Huffington Post got on board , the Armenian blogosphere took notice , and before long the Boston Globe had published a supportive op - ed about the controversy .
Last night , the Armenian community of Watertown , Massachusetts voted to break all connections with the Anti-Defamation League by severing ties with its No Place for Hate Program , which attempts to promote tolerance ( though not , apparently , for descendants of the Armenian Genocide . )
Armenian - American activists in Watertown are promising to lobby all 67 of the Massachusetts towns still participating in NPFH to drop their connection , too .
Ultimately , they want the Massachusetts Municipal Association to stop working with the ADL entirely .
These activists have Jewcy ’s emphatic support , and we will do what we can to help their cause along .
The ADL has made a monster of itself by denying a genocide .
It has made the entire Jewish community look morally incompetent for allowing ourselves to be represented by someone who engages in Holocaust denial .
And it has earned the justified fury of the Armenian - American community , which bears witness to the mass - murder of its forebears , and refuses to see that memory trampled upon .
Several weeks ago , it might have been enough for Abe Foxman to give up encouraging others to share his agnosticism about the Armenian Genocide .
But the controversy has gained momentum , and now it ’s too late for him to just stop talking .
We think it would be fitting to see Foxman take a sensitivity course on the challenges faced by the modern Armenian - American community , but all we really want from him are three simple responses :
Acknowledge the Armenian Genocide Apologize to the Armenian - American community Apologize to the Jewish community , for humiliating us before our fellow - citizens
Over on the Shvitz , you ’ll find John DiMascio ’s first - hand account from last night ’s meeting .
John DiMascio is an incorrigibly eccentric columnist for the Watertown TAB & Press , and has played a leading role in getting the ADL evicted from Watertown .
This is n’t just an abnormally short Jewcy article , by the way ; it ’s a petition .
If you ’re with us , show us ( and the ADL ) your support by signing on in the comments section .
Tell us why you ’re motivated to sign , and , if the spirit moves you , either register ( you can use a pseudonym ) or add your name .

The correct date is July 8 . *

Reacting to yesterday 's Gonazales hearing , even Josh Marshall finally discusses impeachment :
Though other events in recent months and years have had graver consequences in themselves , I 'm not sure I 've seen a more open , casual or brazen display of the attitude that the body of rules which our whole system is built on just do n't apply to this White House .
Without going into all the specifics , I think we are now moving into a situation where the White House , on various fronts , is openly ignoring the constitution , acting as though not just the law but the constitution itself , which is the fundamental law from which all the statutes gain their force and legitimacy , does n't apply to them .
If that is allowed to continue , the defiance will congeal into precedent .
And the whole structure of our system of government will be permanently changed .
Whether because of prudence and pragmatism or mere intellectual inertia , I still have the same opinion on the big question : impeachment .
But I think we 're moving on to dangerous ground right now , more so than some of us realize .
And I 'm less sure now under these circumstances that operating by rules of ' normal politics ' is justifiable or acquits us of our duty to our country .
No , Josh , I do n't think it 's ordinary prudence or pragmatism or intellectual inertia .
I think some of it is working in an environment that rewards logic and caution ; some of it is a belief in logic ( " reality based , " if you will ) as an overriding system .
Academics are prone to such things , and are famous for not seeing the forest for the veins on the leaves .
Most of all , it is a blind faith in political process as an inherently self - correcting mechanism .
It 's a reluctance to engage on substantive issues that may conceivably carry a heavy price .
But the purpose of impeachment is not to convict , nor to score a political victory .
James Madison was clear on that :
It is to stop the abuses of the political process .
George Mason argued that the President might use his pardoning power to â€œpardon crimes which were advised by himselfâ€  or , before indictment or conviction , â€ œto stop inquiry and prevent detection .
â€ James Madison responded : â€ œ [ I ] f the President be connected , in any suspicious manner , with any person , and there be grounds to believe he will shelter him , the House of Representatives can impeach him ; they can remove him if found guilty .â€ 
I keep thinking about Barbara Jordan 's speech regarding the articles of impeachment on Richard Nixon , given 33 years ago yesterday :
My faith in the Constitution is whole , it is complete , it is total ; and I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution , the subversion , the destruction of the Constitution .
She was a black woman from Texas who lived long enough to see the Constitution protect and defend her to the point where she became a member of Congress .
She knew that the strength of our nation lies in the concept that even the lowliest person in America is equal to us all in the eyes of the law .
These men who have taken over our country and defiled our Constitution are , to use an old - fashioned word , evil .
They are covert , hidden .
They avoid the light of the day like the vampires they are .
It is time to expose the actions they have taken in secret .
" We know the nature of impeachment , " Jordan said in a speech that is still considered one of America 's finest .
" We 've been talking about it awhile now .
It is chiefly designed for the President and his high ministers to somehow be called into account .
" It is designed to bridle the executive if he engages in excesses .
' It is designed as a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men . '
The framers confided in the Congress the power if need be , to remove the President in order to strike a delicate balance between a President swollen with power and grown tyrannical , and preservation of the independence of the executive . "
After listing Nixon 's alleged offenses , she concluded :
James Madison again at the Constitutional Convention : " A President is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the Constitution . "
The Constitution charges the President with the task of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed , and yet the President has counseled his aides to commit perjury , willfully disregard the secrecy of grand jury proceedings , conceal surreptitious entry , attempt to compromise a federal judge , while publicly displaying his cooperation with the processes of criminal justice .
" A President is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the Constitution . "
If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the offenses charged here , then perhaps that 18th - century Constitution should be abandoned to a 20th - century paper shredder .
Has the President committed offenses , and planned , and directed , and acquiesced in a course of conduct which the Constitution will not tolerate ?
That 's the question .
We know that .
We know the question .
We should now forthwith proceed to answer the question .
It is reason , and not passion , which must guide our deliberations , guide our debate , and guide our decision .
It 's time to answer the question , Josh .
Is the Constitution anything more than a piece of paper ?
Are we a nation of laws - or are we a nation of cronies ?
History will not judge us kindly if we let this pass .

They lost my confidence
Attorneys ' dismissals were related to performance , not to politics .
As any employer or manager knows , the handling of personnel matters — especially the termination of employees — is one of the most challenging tasks in any business .
Personnel matters in the federal government are no exception .
To be clear , it was for reasons related to policy , priorities and management — what have been referred to broadly as " performance - related " reasons — that seven U.S. attorneys were asked to resign last December .
The Justice Department , out of respect for these individuals , would have preferred not to talk publicly about those reasons , but disclosures in the press and requests for information from Congress altered those best - laid plans .
Although our reasons for their dismissal were appropriate , our failure to provide those reasons to these individual U.S. attorneys at the time they were asked to resign has only served to fuel wild and inaccurate speculation about our motives .
That is very unfortunate because faith and confidence in our justice system are more important than any one individual .
We have never asked a U.S. attorney to resign in an effort to retaliate against him or her or to inappropriately interfere with a public corruption case ( or any other type of case , for that matter ) .
Indeed , during the last six years , the department has established an extremely strong record of rooting out public corruption , including prosecuting a number of very high - profile cases .
Like me , U.S. attorneys are political appointees , and we all serve at the pleasure of the president .
If U.S. attorneys are not executing their responsibilities in a manner that furthers the management and policy goals of departmental leadership , it is appropriate that they be replaced .
After all , the responsibility of the Department of Justice , and of the Congress , is to serve the people of the United States .
While I am grateful for the public service of these seven U.S. attorneys , they simply lost my confidence .
I hope that this episode ultimately will be recognized for what it is : an overblown personnel matter .

Sophisticated roadside bombs are capable of piercing Abrams tanks
Senior defence officials told reporters in Baghdad that the bombs were being used to deadly effect , killing more than 170 US troops since June 2004 .
The weapons known as " explosively formed penetrators " ( EFPs ) are capable of destroying an Abrams tank .
US claims the bombs were smuggled from Iran cannot be independently verified .
The US officials , speaking off camera on condition of anonymity , said EFPs had also injured more than 620 US personnel since June 2004 .
The weapons had characteristics unique to being manufactured in Iran
US defence official
They said US intelligence analysts believed the bombs were manufactured in Iran and secretly sent to Iraqi Shia militants on the orders of senior officials in Tehran .
" We assess that these activities are coming from the senior levels of the Iranian government , " one official said .
He pointed the finger at Iran 's elite al - Quds brigade , a unit of the Revolutionary Guards , saying that a senior commander from the brigade had been one of five Iranians seized by US forces in a raid in the Iraqi town of Irbil in January .
' Flushing the evidence '
The defence official said that when the men were captured they had been tying to flush documents down a toilet and that one of them had been contaminated with explosives residue .
They had also reportedly shaved their heads to alter their appearance - bags of their hair were found during the raid .
US handouts showed weapons retrieved from attacks
The US officials also referred to a raid in Iraq in December in which the security forces said they found inventory sheets of weaponry and equipment that had been brought into Iraq .
The US has claimed in the past that Iranian weapons were being used in Iraq , but it has never before accused Iranian government officials of being directly involved .
Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement .
Weapons on display
The US officials said that as well as bomb - making technology Iran was supplying Shia groups in Iraq with money and military training .
The BBC's Jane Peel attended the briefing in Baghdad , at which all cameras and recording devices were banned .
Examples of the allegedly smuggled weapons were put on display , including EFPs , mortar shells and rocket propelled grenades which the US claims can be traced to Iran .
" The weapons had characteristics unique to being manufactured in Iran ...
Iran is the only country in the region that produces these weapons , " an official said .
Truck bomb
Police have frequently been the targets of attacks in Iraq
At least 25 people were injured in the attack on the station in Adwar , about 175 km ( 110 miles ) north of Baghdad .
The casualties are reported to include prisoners held in cells at the police station , as well as civilian visitors .
Two US soldiers were killed by small - arms fire in Baghdad and north - east of the capital , the US military said .
Separately , the US military said it had no information on a helicopter that residents said came down near the town of near Taji , about 20 km ( 12 miles ) north of Baghdad .

News 's own partial disclosure , we now know that her producer plagiarized significant portions of Ms. Couric 's blog from Mr. Zaslow 's piece .
But we still do n't know what Ms. Couric was so busy doing on April 4 that she needed a team of producers to figure out what was on her mind that day .
And why did CBS News fire the producer responsible , but decline to reveal the identity ?
In an era when plagiarists get dismissed and outed weekly by their employers at news organizations around the country , the decision by CBS News not to disclose the producer 's name  and to call an act of flagrant plagiarism an " omission "  seems curious at best .
According to sources within CBS News , her name is Melissa McNamara , a cbsnews.com Web producer ( and herself a blogger for cbsnews.com ) who joined the network in October 2005 after working as a news assistant in the Washington bureau of the New York Times and as a researcher at CNN .
Ms. McNamara could n't be reached yesterday for comment .
Asked to explain the reason for CBS News 's silence about her identity , a spokeswoman said in a written statement : " We believe the matter has been dealt with appropriately and that the producer has paid the necessary price . "
She added that the network " quickly and decisively dealt with the issue " by posting a correction on its Web site and firing the producer .
It 's no surprise to see CBS News scrambling its way out of a public - relations nightmare , and doing so in ham - handed fashion without taking any responsibility for its mistakes and embarrassments .
Yesterday , a CBS Corp. director and former president of the NAACP , Bruce Gordon , told the Associated Press that he had asked the company 's president and chief executive , Leslie Moonves , to fire radio host Don Imus for his recent , racist comments ; so far , the company has declined to comment on its long - term plans regarding Mr. Imus , who for now faces only a two - week suspension from CBS Radio .
Two years ago , in the wake of the " 60 Minutes " National Guard documents fiasco , the network fired two news executives and two producers and spared the reporter involved ( Dan Rather ) and the executive responsible ( then - president Andrew Heyward ) from punishment .
In this instance , Ms. Couric has declined to comment on the episode and appears unlikely to take any public responsibility for the plagiarism that she read into a camera little more than a week ago .
CBS
News disclosed the plagiarism in the " Notebook " section of its
Web site the night it aired , conveniently ( and dishonestly ) calling it a " correction . "
" Much of the material in the notebook came from Mr. Zaslow , " the correction stated , " and we should have acknowledged that at the top of our piece . "
It would have been fascinating to see Ms. Couric thread that needle .
" Funny thing happened the other day when I was reading the Wall Street Journal piece about libraries by Jeffrey Zaslow , " Ms. Couric might have begun .
" Turns out I agreed with every word of it , so I 'm just going to read you some of his better lines ... here we go ! "
Why was n't the network straight with its
Web site readers in describing what happened ?
It should have admitted the deception rather than pretend  by calling it a correction  that it was a mistake .
It has been standard practice for years to allow evening - news anchors  the public face of the networks  to use the services of writers and producers to draft their commentaries and essays .
The fact that Ms. McNamara wrote Ms. Couric 's blog was n't itself an act of deception .
But with the expansion of the blogosphere , where dueling networks routinely parlay the cult of personality into a weapon in the publicity war , it seems sad that Ms. Couric can't play the game by the same rules as her NBC counterpart Brian Williams does .
Anyone who has ever read Mr. Williams 's highly personal blog entries on the NBC News Web site knows he wrote them himself .
Ms. Couric 's own writing skills may be part of the problem .
In a blog entry written in March right after the resignation of Rome Hartman as her executive producer , Ms. Couric wrote : " [ Hartman is ] a man of integrity , character , and honor .
In the TV news business , those characteristics are too often mutually exclusive . "
Perhaps she can be forgiven for not knowing what " mutually exclusive " means ; she was no doubt too busy typing " indefatigability , " a word she apparently made up herself to describe Mr. Hartman 's work methods .
But CBS does n't pay Ms. Couric $ 15 million for her writing skills ; she was hired last spring to be the appealing and highly promotable public face of CBS News .
Alas , so far the show has remained where it had been with Dan Rather at the helm  in third place , behind NBC and ABC .
Her ratings struggles have been endlessly chronicled elsewhere and need not be rehashed .
But it does seem ironic that Ms. Couric may have been too busy with her promotional duties to keep track of her own blog .
Let 's hope the public relations fallout from this plagiarism episode reminds Ms. Couric that foremost among her duties as anchor should be to maintain the integrity and standards of CBS News .
Ms. Couric needs to take charge of her show , her blog , and her reputation before it 's too late .
A demonstrator wears a similar T - shirt at a New York protest in July
Raed Jarrar said security officials warned him his clothing was offensive after he checked in for a JetBlue flight to California on 12 August .
Mr Jarrar said he was shocked such an action could be taken in the US .
US transport officials are conducting an inquiry after a complaint from the US Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee .
JetBlue said it was also investigating the incident but a spokeswoman said : " We 're not clear exactly what happened . "
' Authoritarian regimes '
Mr Jarrar 's black cotton T - shirt bore the slogan in both Arabic and English .
He said he had cleared security at John F Kennedy airport for a flight back to his home in California when he was approached by two men who wanted to check his ID and boarding pass .
Mr Jarrar said he was told a number of passengers had complained about his T - shirt - apparently concerned at what the Arabic phrase meant - and asked him to remove it .
He refused , arguing that the slogan was not offensive and citing his constitutional rights to free expression .
Mr Jarrar later told a New York radio station : " I grew up and spent all my life living under authoritarian regimes and I know that these things happen .
" But I 'm shocked that they happened to me here , in the US . "
After a difficult exchange with airline staff , Mr Jarrar was persuaded to wear another T - shirt bought for him at the airport shop .
" We Will Not Be Silent " is a slogan adopted by opponents of the war in Iraq and other conflicts in the Middle East .
It derives from the White Rose dissident group which opposed Nazi rule in Germany .
“ She actually showed me her apartment , and she showed me what you could do with it , ” Ms. Wegenaar said .
“ It felt so right . ”
Obi Onyejekwe
It can be harder to find what feels right for buyers who do n’t want to stray far from Manhattan ’s most central neighborhoods .
When Obi Onyejekwe moved from Atlanta in 2003 to work as an art director , producing commercials for SpikeTV , he thought he would quickly be able to buy an apartment with the $ 50,000 he had saved .
Mr. Onyejekwe ( pronounced on - yeh - JECK - weh ) had been saving and investing in a 401 ( k ) since his first $ 7 an hour job at J. C. Penney .
After college , he saved more than half of his salary from his early jobs by living at his mother ’s home in Atlanta .
So when he arrived in Manhattan , he was determined to save and buy even while making less than $ 100,000 a year .
He rented an $ 800 - a- month apartment in Harlem and limited nights out to once a week .
He spent less than $ 6 a day for lunch in SpikeTV ’s cafeteria .
While he never entirely stopped dating — an expense he calculated could cost him $ 400 a month — he said that he kept his eye on the larger goal of homeownership .
“ It ’s great to date , go out and have fun , ” said Mr. Onyejekwe , 30 .
“ But you have to be established first . ”
He soon found it was harder to save in Manhattan than in Atlanta , especially as he made friends .
In 2004 , he moved to a $ 1,350 - a- month one - bedroom apartment in Hell ’s Kitchen to be closer to his friends .
He also found himself going out three or four nights a week .
He considered moving to Brooklyn , where he could afford to buy , but he wanted to hold out for something centrally located in Manhattan .
Karen Fornash , his sales agent at the Corcoran Group , helped him narrow his search .
He finally saved enough by making friends with people at work who shared his obsession of buying their own apartments .
They chose to eat out at places with entrees that never cost more than $ 15 and went to events like the Warm Up dance parties at P.S. 1 , where the only thing they bought was beer .
They also became regulars at a bar near Times Square where they could get five drinks for the price of four .
Clearly , Rumsfeld was reviled in certain parts of the Bush administration .
Yet such antagonisms occur in every presidency .
But what did it mean , I wondered , that Rumsfeld had " deserted his post " ?
Though most people assume that the chain of command runs from the president to the vice president , the cold war bequeathed a significant constitutional readjustment .
In an age when an enemy attack might allow only a few minutes for detection and reaction , control of American military power became vested in the National Command Authority , which consists of the president and the secretary of defense .
Collectively , the NCA is the ultimate source of military orders , uniquely empowered , among other things , to order the use of nuclear weapons .
In time of war , therefore , Rumsfeld was effectively the president 's partner , the direct link to the fighting forces , and all orders had to go through him .

Such orders were supposed to be transmitted from a two - story complex at the end of a narrow passageway across the corridor from Rumsfeld 's office .
This was the National Military Command Center , staffed twenty - four hours a day with as many as two hundred military officers and civilian staff and equipped with arrays of communications systems , including multiple screens for video conferences .
" All very Star Trek , " recalls an official who formerly served there .
This was the operational center for any and every crisis , from nuclear war to hijacked airliners .
The command center organized conference calls enabling key officials around the government to communicate and coordinate .
At 9:39 A.M. that morning , just over a minute after the Pentagon was hit , the navy captain in charge of the command center announced on the " air threat conference call " that had just begun that " an air attack on North America may be in progress , " and asked that the secretary of defense come to the center .
A few minutes later , the secretary 's office reported back that he was nowhere to be found .
The chain of command was broken .
In fact , Rumsfeld was at the crash site , though eventually it occurred to him that he might perhaps be in the wrong place : " ... at some moment I decided I should be in here , " he told Parade magazine in his office a month later , " figuring out what to do , because your brain begins to connect things . "
Rumsfeld was back in the building by ten o'clock , but despite the anxious pleas from the military , he did not go to the command center .
Instead , he headed for his office , where he spoke to President Bush , though afterward neither man could recall what they discussed .
Next , in his words , he moved to " a room about 30 yards away here in this building ... that 's sealable . "
That would have been the Executive Support Center , conference rooms " secure " against electronic eavesdropping right next door to the military command center .
Waiting here was a small group , distinguished above all else by their personal loyalty to Rumsfeld .
One was Stephen Cambone , the aide who had been inquiring so anxiously for his whereabouts minutes before .
Of all in Rumsfeld 's court , Cambone cast the longest shadow , energetically accumulating power thanks to the protective embrace of his mentor and his acknowledged intelligence .
Also there was Rumsfeld 's personal chief of staff , Larry Di Rita , a former naval officer who had moved into Rumsfeld 's orbit from the right - wing staff of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison .
Di Rita 's defining characteristic was his devotion to the boss .
( An Olympic - standard squash player , he would still dutifully lose to Rumsfeld . )
The third person in the room was his spokesperson , Victoria ( Torie ) Clarke , a consummate public relations professional , artful enough to promote Rumsfeld - who was so secretive that he would refuse to tell his own deputy what had happened in White House meetings - as a paragon of openness and transparency .
After a brief discussion with this select group , Rumsfeld finally made his way to the military command center .
It was almost 10:30 .
Only then , as he later explained to the 9/11 Commission , did he begin to gain " situational awareness " of what was going on .
After a brief interval he spoke with Vice President Dick Cheney , who was in a bunker under the White House and for the previous forty minutes had been issuing orders to shoot down suspicious airliners .
HOPEDALE , La. —
The brave little oyster boats chug out daily from the dock here , but their richest harvest may actually be sitting in the office towers of downtown New Orleans , 60 miles west of this remote spot where marsh , sky and water converge .
In an arrangement that is a Louisiana seafood specialty , though one that ca n’t be fried or covered in sauce , an oysterman here in the nation ’s top oyster - producing state can make as much , if not more , collecting damage settlements from oil companies as from harvesting the bivalves themselves , according to a recent study by two Louisiana State University economists .
Such payments often flow to an oysterman even in cases where there are no oysters to be damaged , said the report , which has infuriated the oyster community here , eliciting complaints that the conclusions are simply lies .
The authors say that while the number of oysters per acre has been in decline over the last four decades — a trend that they attribute to a vast increase in the acreage harvested — revenue from the oil companies that grudgingly share the rich bottomlands with the oystermen is increasing , thanks to a peculiar accommodation that coastal Louisiana has whispered about for years but nobody had quantified until now .
With the outcome essentially preordained , advocacy groups on both sides of the issue were readying campaigns to try to shape public opinion as the showdown unfolds .
Groups aligned with the Democrats plan to capitalize on the connection between the veto and the “ mission accomplished ” anniversary .
Americans United for Change has produced a television commercial that replays scenes of Mr. Bush on the carrier and says : “ He was wrong then .
And he ’s wrong now .
It ’s the will of one nation versus the stubbornness of one man . ”
Allies of the president are mobilizing as well .
The conservative Web site Townhall.com was organizing an online “ no surrender ” petition , and urging visitors to the site to tell the Democratic Party ’s “ rogues ’ gallery that we will not stand for their defeatism , ” adding , “ While they may lack courage , our troops do not and they deserve the resources needed to win this war . ”
With the vote barely behind them , House Democrats were already considering how to respond legislatively to Mr. Bush ’s veto .
Though there are differing ideas , Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania , a Democrat who oversees defense appropriations , said his preference would be to “ robustly fund the troops for two months , ” and include benchmarks but no timetable for withdrawal .
The briefing by General Petraeus and other senior Pentagon officials appeared to do little to influence the House vote .
Lawmakers said the commander had made no overt plea for them to oppose the legislation , which provides more money for the Pentagon than the president had sought for the war as well as billions of dollars for other unrelated projects .
“ I ’m not going to get into the minefield of discussions about various legislative proposals , ” General Petraeus told reporters at the end of the two briefings .
“ I do n’t think that is something military commanders should get into . ”
The general pointed to a drop in sectarian killings and security gains in Anbar Province as improvements in recent weeks but referred to reversals as well .
“ The ability of Al Qaeda to conduct horrific , sensational attacks obviously has represented a setback and is an area in which we are focusing considerable attention , ” he said .
A former United States attorney for the District of Columbia , Joseph E. diGenova , said that by suggesting that any contempt efforts would be blocked by the Justice Department , the administration was “ making it clear that this is not going to be an easy road for Congress to go and the president will use all his powers to make it difficult for them . ”
Administration officials have cited a 1984 internal legal memorandum written by the Justice Department when Congress sought to charge a Reagan administration official with contempt .
The memorandum concluded that a United States attorney was not required to bring a contempt charge if requested to do so by Congress .
In addition , the memorandum said that contempt of Congress would not apply to an executive branch official “ who asserts the president ’s claim of executive privilege . ”
Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said any effort by the White House to block the federal prosecutor from bringing a contempt citation on behalf of Congress would demonstrate the very problem Congress was seeking to investigate : whether federal prosecutors have been subjected to political influence .
“ This administration has consistently chosen to stonewall Congressional oversight attempts , and this latest decision to interfere with those checks and balances is deeply disturbing , ” Mr. Leahy said .
Underlying the discussion is the awkward procedure Congress would normally use to hold someone in contempt .
Under most circumstances , Congress would have to ask the federal prosecutor in Washington to convene a grand jury and consider indicting on contempt charges any official who refused to respond to Congress ’s requests for information or testimony .
But the officials who have refused to cooperate — Harriet E. Miers , the former White House counsel , and Joshua B. Bolten , Mr. Bush ’s chief of staff — have declined to do so because the White House has invoked executive privilege .
In addition , Sara M. Taylor , a former White House political director , refused to answer several questions when she appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee , also citing executive privilege .
Congress has another route to enforce its will , an inherent power of contempt .
But that has not been used since early in the 20th century .
It has long been deemed unwieldy in the modern era as it entails Congress stopping all work to hold its own trial and imprisoning any offenders in the basement of the Capitol .
Why are Neanderthal and modern human skulls shaped differently ?
Historically , scientists figured there were adaptive purposes at work : Neanderthals needed an architecture for the all - purpose tool of their extra-big teeth , while our own comparatively sunken faces were better for articulating complex languages .
These theories are plausible enough , reflecting both stereotype ( Those simpleminded , oafish Neanderthals !
No wonder they died ! ) and reality ( thanks to language , humans are pretty darn smart ) .
But evolution does n't always have a good reason .
But University of California , Davis anthropologist Tim Weaver and colleagues compared skull measurements of 2,500 humans and 20
neanderthals , then contrasted the results with genetic data from another 1,000 people .
The result of all the number - crunching ?
Natural selection does n't appear to have anything to do with the difference .
We conclude that rather than requiring special adaptive accounts ,
Neandertal and modern human crania may simply represent two outcomes from a vast space of random evolutionary possibilities .
There but for the grace of ... something ... go we .
Were neandertal and modern human cranial differences produced by natural selection or genetic drift ?

As the White house launches an " Iraq War Room " to desperately try to spin the coverage of the occupation in Iraq ahead of their long awaited faux Petraeus White House report to congress next month , reality is n't coooperating .
Despite the escalation which has pushed our military to its breaking point , Iraqi deaths have doubled since the surge began and US military casualties are way up too .
More and more soldiers are speaking out , calling the White House 's claims " surreal " , yet much of the media remains content to report just what Bushco wants them to .
Did n't the traditional media learn anything from their pathetic sycophantic shilling for the White House in the lead up to the war ?
Apparently not .
Today , on NPR , “ War Czar ” Lt. Gen .
Lute was asked about whether he wants to see a return to government slavery , also known as conscription or “ the draft ” .
Here ’s his answer :
I think it makes sense to certainly consider it , and I can tell you , this has always been an option on the table , but ultimately , this is a policy matter between meeting the demands for the nation ’s security by one means or another .
Today , the current means of the all - volunteer force is serving us exceptionally well .
It would be a major policy shift — not actually a military , but a political policy shift to move to some other course .
What is interesting though is that he a minute before had been describing the manpower shortages bedeviling the U.S. military :
As an Army officer , this is a matter of real concern to me .
Ultimately , the American army , and any other all - volunteer force , rests with the support and the morale and the willingness to serve demonstrated by our — especially our young men and women in uniform .
And I am concerned that those men and women and the families they represent are under stress as a result of repeated deployments .
There ’s both a personal dimension of this , where this kind of stress plays out across dinner tables and in living room conversations within these families , and ultimately , the health of the all - volunteer force is going to rest on those sorts of personal family decisions .
And when the system is under stress , it ’s right to be concerned about some of the future decisions these young men and women may make .
I think our military leaders are right to be focused on that .
There ’s also a professional and broader strategic argument to this , and that is that when our forces are as engaged as they have been over the last several years , particularly in Iraq , that we ’re concerned as military professionals that we also keep a very sharp edge honed for other contingencies outside of Iraq .
So , the good general basically said that the all - volunteer military was under a great deal of stress , that a draft was not yet needed , but that the military would n’t have a problem with one .
This of course is 180 turn around from a few years ago when the senior officers were opposed to conscription .
Meantime the media had a very different take on the interview .
Notice the spin :
Frequent tours for U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan have stressed the all - volunteer force and made it worth considering a return to a military draft , President Bush ’s new war adviser said Friday .
“ I think it makes sense to certainly consider it , ” Army Lt. Gen.
Douglas Lute said in an interview with National Public Radio ’s “ All Things Considered . ”
“ And I can tell you , this has always been an option on the table .
But ultimately , this is a policy matter between meeting the demands for the nation ’s security by one means or another , ” Lute added in his first interview since he was confirmed by the Senate in June .
President Nixon abolished the draft in 1973 .
Restoring it , Lute said , would be a “ major policy shift ” and Bush has made it clear that he does n’t think it ’s necessary .
“ The president ’s position is that the all volunteer military meets the needs of the country and there is no discussion of a draft .
General Lute made that point as well , ” National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
In the interview , Lute also said that “ Today , the current means of the all - volunteer force is serving us exceptionally well . ”
Still , he said the repeated deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan affect not only the troops but their families , who can influence whether a service member decides to stay in the military .
“ There ’s both a personal dimension of this , where this kind of stress plays out across dinner tables and in living room conversations within these families , ” he said .
“ And ultimately , the health of the all - volunteer force is going to rest on those sorts of personal family decisions . ”
The military conducted a draft during the Civil War and both world wars and between 1948 and 1973 .
The Selective Service System , re-established in 1980 , maintains a registry of 18 - year - old men .
Rep. Charles Rangel , D - N.Y. , has called for reinstating the draft as a way to end the Iraq war .
Bush picked Lute in mid-May as a deputy national security adviser with responsibility for ensuring efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan are coordinated with policymakers in Washington .
Lute , an active - duty general , was chosen after several retired generals turned down the job .
Now , to my jaded eye this is quite interesting .
The wire report makes it sound like the General was suggesting that there be a political debate to bring back conscription , when in fact he was declining to rule it out after the interviewer raised the subject .
Folks , this is Fabian socialism in action :
Let ’s say that these news reports prompt a furor .
The General can point to his actual comments and claim , truthfully , that he did n’t recommend a return to the draft .
Those who kick up a fuss about the draft are made to look stupid , and the idea will float in the back up people ’s consciousness , ready to be raised again .
On the other hand , if there is no furor , then the debate will probably take place .
In the meantime , the media has actually made a case that the draft is reasonable and a traditional part of U.S. history .
In effect the wire report is an editorial in favor of bringing it back .
Why the change on the part of the Bush administration ?
The problem is that to continue occupying Iraq , they will have to continue to activate and deploy reserve units .
This means middle aged people with families and mortgages will find themselves deployed 3 or 4 times every 10 years .
This tempo is not sustainable .
I think that with this interview , the White House is signalling an interest in returning to conscription , because General Lute is lying about the ease with which the military can adopt conscription .
Instituting conscription requires a massive change in a millitary ’s doctrine and organization .
Imagine you managed a business that made whiskey with free laborers , and one day the owner called you into his office and told you that he would be bringing in slaves to do much of the labor .
Now , would you be able to put the slaves immediately to work ?
No .
You would need to arrange for overseers to watch them closely .
You ’d have to put locks on the doors so that slaves ca n’t escape .
You ’d have to stop work periodically to count your slaves etc .
The claim that such a change is not a “ military shift ” does not pass the B.S. test .
The lie effectively torpedoes the most effective argument against the draft , which is that the military does not want one .
In this way , the Bush administration could get conscription without seeming to agitate for it .
In fact , given their unpopularity and political weakness , the only way they will get a return to the draft is by having someone else do the heavy lifting while they put up an seemingly ineffectual false resistance .
It is shameful that , over a hundred years after the U.S. government claimed that it had eliminated slavery within its borders , its officers are still infatuated with it and wish to bring it back .
Slavery has no part in civilization , and it is high time that the U.S. government , and governments thoughout the world for that matter , abandoned this disgusting practice of systematically enslaving young men .
First Kuwaiti General Trade and Contracting Co is the primary Builder .
KBR , formerly owned by Dick Cheney associated Haliburton Corporation is in charge of servicing the embassy and the troops .
KBR and First Kuwaiti are arguing over the blame for this fiasco .
The story is comic .
The first signs of trouble , according to the cable , emerged when the kitchen staff tried to cook the inaugural meal in the new guard base on May 15 .
Some appliances did not work .
Workers began to get electric shocks .
Then a burning smell enveloped the kitchen as the wiring began to melt .
All the food from the old guard camp -- a collection of tents -- had been carted to the new facility , in the expectation that the 1,200 guards would begin moving in the next day .
But according to the cable , the electrical meltdown was just the first problem in a series of construction mistakes that soon left the base uninhabitable , including wiring problems , fuel leaks and noxious fumes in the sleeping trailers .
But we are spending $ 592 million of our dollars .
That 's a very small amount compared to the total amount spent in Iraq .
The results are similar .
The administration placed " Brownies " in charge of this project .
After the electrical problem was discovered and no quick fix seemed available , the embassy was forced to serve the guards MREs ( meals - ready - to - eat ) for several days until all the food could be moved back to the old housing , known as Camp Jackson , according to the embassy cable 's detailed account .
The original plan was for the guards to wait only one or two weeks before the electrical issues were fixed .
But the problems mounted .
The 252 prefabricated residential trailers , with either two or three rooms each , filled with formaldehyde fumes .
The trailer manufacturer , a Saudi company called Red Sea Housing Services Co. , confirmed to the embassy it had used the toxic chemical in preparing the housing .
Red Sea told the embassy to keep the windows open and use charcoal in the rooms to absorb the odor , but " the fumes are still prevalent , " the cable said .
The embassy cable noted that five people had been identified at various times as the project manager , and that it was all but impossible for embassy officials to obtain information from them , with no one seeming to be in charge .
" Two of the project managers have had extremely limited previous project management experience , " the cable said .
A $ 500,000 project to install a fire - suppression system appeared to be proceeding without proper supervision , it added .
The US government is proceeding without proper supervision .
I am beyond outrage .
I am beyond anger .
Let 's get the hell out of Iraq before we fuck something else up .
GO HOME .
It 's just that simple .
There is absolutely nothing we can do right in Iraq .
We have even contaminated the ground the embassy is built on .
Finally , on May 25 , a KBR hazardous - materials expert discovered that all 10 generators had developed leaks .
The fuel tanks were installed without corrosion protection or leak detectors , and fuel had begun to saturate the soil around the tanks .
The cable said that Teflon tape designed for water pipes had been used on the fuel tanks , and that such tape " will dissolve on contact with diesel fuel . "
KBR refused to operate the power generators unless its liability was waived .
The criminals guilty for this corruption must be held accountable .
You know who they are and what we must do .
Welcome to Regular-Expressions.info
The Premier website about Regular Expressions
A regular expression ( regex or regexp for short ) is a special text string for describing a search pattern .
You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids .
You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager .
The regex equivalent is ^.*\. txt $ .
But you can do much more with regular expressions .
In a text editor like EditPad Pro or a specialized text processing tool like PowerGREP , you could use the regular expression \b [ A - Z0 - 9 . _%+-]+@[ A - Z0 -9.-]+\. [ A - Z ] {2 , }\b to search for an email address .
Any email address , to be exact .
A very similar regular expression ( replace the first \b with ^ and the last one with $ ) can be used by a programmer to check whether the user entered a properly formatted email address .
In just one line of code , whether that code is written in Perl , PHP , Java , a .NET language , or a multitude of other languages .
Regular Expressions Quick Start
If you just want to get your feet wet with regular expressions , take a look at the one - page regular expressions quick start .
While you ca n’t learn to efficiently use regular expressions from this brief overview , it ’s enough to be able to throw together a bunch of simple regular expressions .
Each section in the quick start links directly to detailed information in the tutorial .
Complete Regular Expressions Tutorial
Do not worry if the above example or the quick start make little sense to you .
Any non -trivial regex looks daunting to anybody not familiar with them .
But with just a bit of experience , you will soon be able to craft your own regular expressions like you have never done anything else .
The free Regular - Expressions .
info
Tutorial explains everything bit by bit .
This tutorial is quite unique because it not only explains the regex syntax , but also describes in detail how the regex engine actually goes about its work .
You will learn quite a lot , even if you have already been using regular expressions for some time .
This will help you to understand quickly why a particular regex does not do what you initially expected , saving you lots of guesswork and head scratching when writing more complex regexes .
Replacement Strings Tutorial
A replacement string , also known as the replacement text , is the text that each regular expression match is replaced with during a search - and - replace .
In most applications , the replacement text supports special syntax that allows you to reuse the text matched by the regular expression or parts thereof in the replacement .
This website also includes a complete replacement strings tutorial that explains this syntax .
While replacement strings are fairly simple compared with regular expressions , there is still great variety between the syntax used by various applications and their actual behavior .
Applications & Languages That Support Regexes
There are many software applications and programming languages that support regular expressions .
If you are a programmer , you can save yourself lots of time and effort .
You can often accomplish with a single regular expression in one or a few lines of code what would otherwise take dozens or hundreds .
Many applications and programming languages have their own implementation of regular expressions , often with slight and sometimes with significant differences from other implementations .
When two applications use a different implementation of regular expressions , we say that they use different “ regular expression flavors ” .
Unlike most other regex tutorials , the tutorial on this website covers all the popular regular expression flavors , and indicates the differences that you should watch out for .
Not Only for Programmers
If you are not a programmer , you can use regular expressions in many situations just as well .
They make finding information a lot easier .
You can use them in powerful search and replace operations to quickly make changes across large numbers of files .
A simple example is gr[ae ]y which finds both spellings of the word gray in one operation , instead of two .
There are many text editors and search and replace tools with decent regex support .
Further Reading
If you ’re hungry for more information on regular expressions after reading this website , there are a variety of books on the subject .

In 1936 Marie Slocombe was working as a summer relief secretary at the BBC .
One of her tasks was to sort out - and dispose of - a pile of dusty broadcast discs .
She noticed that among them were recordings of GB Shaw , HG Wells , Winston Churchill , Herbert Asquith and GK Chesterton .
So she hesitated .
In that moment was the humble beginning of what became one of the most important collections of recordings in the world - the BBC Sound Archive .
She worked in a climate of indifference , even opposition , by BBC management , which doubted the usefulness of recordings , and was troubled by the expense of keeping them .
But Slocombe persevered and by 1939 had 2,000 discs , including the voices of Hitler and Goebbels .
" History , " she says in a recorded interview made shortly before her death in 1995 , " was piling into the archives . "
She recalls the Canadian war reporter Stanley Maxted coming in with the Battle of Arnhem recordings hidden under his great - coat .
Slang culture
Those who knew her recall with affection her Oxford - educated gentility - floral print dresses and cups and saucers rather than mugs .
But she was liberal in her views and no snob .
The archive includes a recording of Adolf Hitler
After the war she made the archive active rather than merely a passive receptor .
It was Slocombe who first co-operated with the Leeds University Dialect Survey , a highly significant oral atlas of British society .
And she sent out recordists to collect songs and interviews from more than 700 people across Britain , used in the series " As They Roved Out " .
The programme was key to the revival of interest in the traditional music of the country .
She effectively created a cell at the heart of the BBC establishment devoted to vernacular culture .
The work in preserving folk music and dialect grew out of her involvement in the English folk song and dance society .
Slocombe 's efforts in this area have become a cornerstone of the society 's collection , and helped spark folk 's renaissance , says its librarian Malcolm Taylor .
" Had that not happened a lot of the folk revival could not have sustained itself .
It would have had no touchstone .
It 's one thing looking at the dots on the paper and the words in text but the sound fleshed it all out . "
Slocombe was an enabler and encourager of sound collectors ; among others , she brought the famous German natural history recordist Ludwig Koch into the BBC - his collection included the earliest known recording of birdsong , dating from 1890 .
Slocombe herself made remarkable field recordings of polyphonic singing in remote parts of Portugal .
She gave tapes ( and sometimes surreptitiously loaned recording equipment ) to people going further afield .
As a result the BBC has a collection of Australian Aboriginal music , the sound of the kind of harp King David played , recorded in Ethiopia , and - something of which she was inordinately fond - some Vietnamese spoon music .
Spirit of Britain
Behind the apparently prim Miss Marple / Joan Hickson image , there was a maverick , mischievous side to Marie Slocombe .
She kept what she called " a special cupboard " into which went recordings she deemed to be important , but which were often of a sensitive nature .
Marie Slocombe saved recordings from the scrap heap
It was held under lock and key in the cupboard until she eventually revealed it to a producer , who broadcast it in a feature .
Slocombe waited for the storm ... but it never came .
" It was her and a couple of people she worked with that really saw the value of retaining recordings for the future , " says Simon Rooks , who as the current BBC archivist manages Slocombe 's legacy .
" And she really was the one that set about organising them - archives are no good unless you can find them again .
It 's no good if you just shove them on a shelf .
In the mid-40s onwards she was driving what was being collected and laying the foundations of what we have today . "
The self - appointed mission of her and her colleagues was to capture the life of the nation , for future recordings and for history , he says .
Political heavyweights also feature
It 's an ambition Slocombe would have approved of .
She possessed great foresight in thinking how future generations would value the recordings and better understand history , says Rooks .
" Where she was a real pioneer was in saying that these sound recordings are historical documents and just as important as a book and as valuable .
She was thinking ' what will people think in 100 years ?
Will people remember who Hitler was ? ' "
Sean Street , professor of radio at Bournemouth University , presents Saving the Sounds of History on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday 1 September at 2000 BST .
As a student of sound production techniques in Yorkshire , I believe this to be a great plus for the people working at all levels of this field .
Not only are the archives invaluable as access to historic people and events , but we can look upon the techniques used to capture the recordings and track their development through history to the present day .
Honours to Marie Slocombe !
Ben Charleswirth , Doncaster , England
Thanks to the forward vision and determination of Marie Slocombe and a few others like her we have a unique and immeasurably valuable source of history available to us .
These archives should be made accessible to all and for free - after all the public paid for the original materials ( licence fees ) .
Perhaps the project should be named ' The Slocombe Archives ' in her honour ?
David Peden , Birmingham
Wonderful lady and wonderful work .
As a child I heard on a BBC programme the sound of the trumpet from Tutankamen 's tomb .
Never forgotten experience .
Rose Umelo , Ibadan , Nigeria
It 's the history of our past that sustains us today .
Let 's always remember and retain our history so we can continue to learn and grow as individuals and as different cultures .
I 'm interested in knowing if it 's possible for me to access the archives discussed in this article .
Thank you .
Tom Pickering , Mt Vernon , Iowa , USA
It 's a great pity that Ms Slocombe 's attitude has n't prevailed .
Over the years , the BBC have thrown out so many of their own masterpieces , especially the comedy .
They then have to beg , or borrow them back to broadcast again - crazy !
Mike , Epsom , UK
I 'd love to hear GK Chesterton , probably the greatest writer of the 20th century .
Mark Neill , Poole
If Ms Slocombe started at the BBC in 1937 how did she manage to record the King 's abdication speech in 1936 ?
Iain Clark , London
How wonderful !
MJR , Toronto , Canada
Thank goodness someone realised the value of those recordings .
I adore the BBC archive trial that 's running , enjoy the old recordings the net is so good for , and salute Marie for her foresight
Leslie Schramm , Stewarton / Ayrshire Scotland
Could we get a daily excerpt from Ms. Slocombe 's archive ?
The recording from the battle of Arnhem fascinated me , as I 'm sure it did many others .
Curt Carpenter , Dallas , Texas
And seventy years on Archives are still the Cinderella of broadcasting .
For nearly 20 years I worked in broadcast archives first at the BBC and later in a regional film & TV archive .
In all that time we still found ourselves having to work " in the margins " and make do and mend ... because even now that the value of the material has been understood there still is n't a proper funding package in place to preserve everything that merits retention .
The BBC is better placed than many but sadly a lot of noteworthy programmes have been made by small regional or independent production companies and these gems are all too often allowed to rot away because no one has worked out how to pay for them to be properly preserved .
Jenny Day , Saltash Cornwall UK
God bless her for being a strong independent and intelligent woman .
I 'm hoping my daughter will grow up to be of the same type .
As a sound designer / audio engineer with a strong sense of history , these recordings are of great interest and priceless .
I would love to be able to browse through them .
So BBC , get on with the beta testing so you can share this great resource with the world .
I 'm eagerly waiting .

Group shows FEMA anticipated Katrina 's destruction of New Orleans Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email
This A major report published Wednesday by a Washington , DC - based watchdog shows that the Federal Emergency Management Agency anticipated the destruction that would result from a major hurricane striking New Orleans , yet failed to follow through on its own internal warnings .
" FEMA s disaster planning was based on a set of predictions that proved to be remarkably accurate .
In 2000 - 2001 , FEMA looked at a population of New Orleans that was over 1.3 million people and predicted that when a catastrophic hurricane struck , the city would be flooded with 14 - 17 feet of water .
One million people would evacuate and 250 - 350,000 people would be trapped in the city , " according to the report , The Best Laid Plans : The Story of How the Government Ignored Its Own Gulf Coast Hurricane Plans .
The report , published by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , is based on 7,500 documents that were released to the group by the Department of Homeland Security in whole or in part .
A key documents was the ' Southeast Louisiana Catastrophic Hurricane Plan , ' which CREW called " strikingly comprehensive . "
" The documents CREW received from its FOIA request reveal failures by FEMA and the federal government at nearly every stage of preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina , " the report notes .
" Why , despite longstanding anticipation of a hurricane strike on New Orleans , significant forewarning of Katrinas imminent landfall , the potential impact on the Gulf Coast , as well as the extensive planning in the days leading up to Katrinas landfall was the federal response so flawed ? "
RAW STORY was awaiting comment from FEMA officials at press time on CREW 's findings .
While the report could not explain precisely why FEMA did not follow its own plan , it did identity several themes that might have undermined the agency 's ability to respond to the disaster .
Dysfunction at the agency emerged as a key cause of the poor disaster preparation and response .
" Documents portray FEMA as an agency plagued with low morale and the federal disaster response structure in general as woefully disorganized , " CREW 's report states .
" Several documents suggest a level of disarray that is alarming .
For instance , the day before Katrina made landfall , some of FEMAs key officials did not have copies of the SLCHP , including Deputy Director Patrick Rhode , who stated that he believed Michael Brown had his copy . "
Melanie Sloan , CREW 's executive director , stated in a press release that " The next national emergency -- whether another natural disaster or a terrorist attack -- undoubtedly will require both adequate preparation and competent execution ; based on the findings in this report , what confidence can the American people have that our government will be ready to face those challenges ? "

抽象化につい て
抽象化っていうのは 「細かいことは忘れちゃって，問題を解くのに都合が良いように考えましょう」っていうこと．数学的もクソもない．
型っていうのは， 「この値にはどういう操作が可能なんだろうか?」っていうことをいちいち考えたくないから，導入された概念．ある操作が可能な集合を型として抽象化することによって，この疑問は「ある値がある型に所属しているかどうかを判定する問題」になる．こっちの問題の方が簡単であれば，抽象化したものの勝ち．
抽象化には訓練が必要で，誰にでもできるってわけじゃない．自明な抽象化はできるかもしれないけれど．でも，難しい問題っていうのは，抽象化が難しいから難しいんだということが良くある．でも，ちゃんと訓練をつめば，よっぽど脳の構造がこういう分野に向いていない人を除けば，誰でもそれなりにできるようになる．本当に難しい問題には歯がたたないかもしれないけど，本当に難しいわけではない問題が大部分というのは，どの世界でも一緒だと思う．
あと，こういうことは瑣末な問題でもある．数学で重要なのは「どの問題を解けば数学の進歩に貢献できるか」ということだし，プログラミングでも「どういうプログラムを書けばビジネスが成功するか」ということが大切．
普通にイメージされるところの数学が，プログラミングとどういうふうに関係するのかというのはちょっとイメージしにくいのかもしれない．そういう数学からは「定評のある抽象化を学ぶ」ことができる．プログラミングで言うなら「綺麗に抽象化されたライブラリの使いかたを学ぶ」ということかもしれない．そういう勉強から「どういう抽象化が優れているか」ということを，言葉で表現できるだけきっちり学ぶことは困難だろうけど，でも「どういうのが優れた抽象化なのか」ということを感覚として身につけることはできる．ついでに「良く出てくる問題」の解きかたも知ることができる．
あーでも，数学的な抽象化って言いたくなる場面もある．例えば，「ほげほげのアルゴリズムはAPTIME完全だけど，典型的な入力に対しては実用的な時間で処理できる」と言うときには，APTIME完全を指して「数学的な抽象化」だと言いたくなるといえばなる．この場合でも，数学的な抽象化と数学的じゃない抽象化があるわけではなくって．この「数学的な」は非限定的な形容という言えば良いんだろうか．
Are you tasked to repair a corrupted PDF ?
Well , fret not because there are many ways you can do just that .
Gone are the ...
Patch design by The Heads of State Here is a set of rational priorities for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , in descending order of importance : ( 1 ) Conduct research , particularly environmental research , on Earth , the sun , and Venus , the most Earth - like planet .
( 2 ) Locate asteroids and comets that might strike Earth , and devise a practical means of deflecting them .
( 3 ) Increase humanity 's store of knowledge by studying the distant universe .
( 4 ) Figure out a way to replace today 's chemical rockets with a much cheaper way to reach Earth orbit .
Here are NASA 's apparent current priorities : ( 1 ) Maintain a pointless space station .
( 2 ) Build a pointless Motel 6 on the moon .
( 3 ) Increase humanity 's store of knowledge by studying the distant universe .
( 4 ) Keep money flowing to favored aerospace contractors and congressional districts .
Only one priority of four correct !
Worse , NASA 's to - do list neglects the two things that are actually of tangible value to the taxpayers who foot its bills — research relevant to environmental policymaking and asteroid - strike protection .
NASA has recently been canceling or postponing " Earth observation " missions intended to generate environmental information about our world .
For instance , a year and a half ago the agency decided not to fund Hydros , a satellite that would have provided the first global data on soil moisture trends .
NASA focuses its planetary research on frigid Mars rather than Venus , which suffers a runaway greenhouse effect .
The agency is conducting only a few sun-study missions — even though all life depends on the sun , and knowing more about it might clarify the global - warming debate .
But $ 6 billion a year for astronauts to take each other 's blood pressure on the space station ?
No problem !
Meanwhile , geologic studies increasingly show that catastrophic asteroid and comet hits were not confined to ancient times .
In 1908 , a small asteroid smacked Siberia with a blast impact equivalent to the strongest nuclear bomb ever detonated by the US ; recent evidence suggests an enormous object struck the Indian Ocean a mere 4,800 years ago , causing global tsunamis that may have engendered the Flood referred to in the Bible .
Yet NASA has no program to research ways of deflecting space objects , and the agency recently told Congress it could not spare $ 1 billion to catalog the locations and movements of potentially dangerous asteroids .
But hundreds of billions of dollars for a moon base ?
No problem !
Of course , " Keep money flowing to favored contractors and congressional districts " is not a formal NASA objective , but these words explain the agency 's core problem .
Since the end of the Apollo glory days , NASA seems to have been driven by the desire to continue lucrative payments to the contractors behind manned spaceflight ( mainly Boeing and Lockheed Martin ) while maintaining staff levels in the congressional districts ( mainly in Alabama , Florida , Ohio , and Texas ) that are home to huge centers focused on manned missions .
If the contractors and the right congressional committee members are happy , NASA 's funding will continue and NASA managers will keep their jobs .
The space station project was built to give the shuttle a destination , keeping the manned - space spending hierarchy intact .
With the space station now almost universally viewed as worthless , the manned - space funders need a new boondoggle .
The moon - base idea , pushed by President Bush , fits the bill .
For a sense of how out of whack NASA priorities have become , briefly ponder that plan .
Because the Apollo missions suggested there was little of pressing importance to be learned on the moon , NASA has not landed so much as one automated probe there in three decades .
In fact , the rockets used by the Apollo program were retired 30 years ago ; even space enthusiasts saw no point in returning to the lunar surface .
But now , with the space station a punch line and the shuttles too old to operate much longer , NASA suddenly decides it needs to restore its moon - landing capability in order to build a " permanent " crewed base .
The cost is likely to be substantial — $ 6 billion is the annual budget of the space station , which is closer to Earth and quite spartan compared with what even a stripped - down moon facility would require .
But set that aside :
What will a moon base crew do ?
Monitor equipment — a task that could easily be handled from an office building in Houston .
In 2004 , former astronaut Harrison Schmitt , now an engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin , calculated that NASA can place objects on the moon for $ 26,000 a pound .
At that price , each bottle of water a crew member uncaps will cost the taxpayer $ 13,000 .
Even if the new moon rocket being designed by NASA cuts launch costs in half , as agency insiders hope , that 's still $ 6,500 for one Aquafina ( astronauts and moon base are extra ) .
Prices like this quickly push the total construction bill for any serious facility into the hundreds of billions of dollars .
A private company facing such numbers would conclude that a moon base is an absurd project — at least until a fundamentally different way of reaching space is found — and would put its capital into the development of new propulsion technologies .
But NASA takes a cost - is - no - object approach that appeals only to those who personally benefit from the spending .
Given NASA 's politicization , we should hope that the space industry evolves as aviation did — transitioning from ponderous government - run projects to mostly private - sector activities attuned to customer needs .
That raises the question : Could entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos eventually put NASA out of business ?
Perhaps , but not for the next couple of decades — space has colossal economic barriers to entry .
Given that NASA is sure to be around for a while , taxpayers should insist the space agency be recon figured to produce tangible benefits for all of us .
With any luck , private space enterprise will eventually find success and begin to exert competitive market pressures on the government space program .
NASA 's success in putting men on the moon in the 1960s is one of history 's enduring achievements .
But it 's the 21st century now — long past time for a new set of space priorities .

Harriet Miers rejects subpoena compliance deadline , shakes off ' contempt ' threats Michael Roston

Former White House Counsel Harriet Miers has again rejected calls from the House Judiciary Committee to comply with a subpoena for her testimony on the firing of 9 US Attorneys in 2006 and 2007 .
The Committee had set a deadline of 5 PM for Miers to explain how she would comply with the subpoena .
" In light of the continuing directives to Ms. Miers and as previously indicated to your Committee , I must respectfully inform you that , directed as she has been to honor the Executive privileges and immunities asserted in this matter , Ms. Miers will not appear before the Committee or otherwise produce documents or provide testimony as set forth in the Committee 's subpoena , " wrote Miers ' attorney , George Manning , in a letter delivered Tuesday to Rep.
John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Chairman of the Judiciary Committee .
A copy of the letter was sent directly to RAW STORY .
In his letter , Manning suggested that the prohibition on Miers ' subpoena compliance was ' unequivocal . '
" The correspondence communicating these unequivocal directives has been previously provided to the Committee , " he wrote .
" The Subcommittee has demanded that Ms. Miers do precisely what the President has prohibited her from doing . "
Conyers had set 5 PM , July 17 , as the deadline for Miers to make her intentions known about complying with the committee 's subpoena .
The Judiciary Committee had warned last week that it would contemplate other actions , including criminal contempt proceedings , if Miers failed to comply with the subpoena .
In a statement released late on Tuesday afternoon , Rep. Conyers said the committee 's next move was being planned .
" The subcommittee has overruled Ms. Miers ' claims of immunity and privilege , " he said .
" Her failure to comply with our subpoena is a serious affront to this committee and our constitutional system of checks and balances .
We are carefully planning our next steps . "
But even if contempt charges were being planned , Miers appeared ready to stand up to the possibility .
" In fact , the cases cited in your letter confirm that the contempt statute is inapplicable to Ms. Miers , " Manning wrote in the letter to Conyers .
" None of these cases involves an assertion of Executive privilege and immunities at issue here .
More importantly , as your letter acknowledged , these cases hold that the contempt statute does not apply where a witness has an ' adequate excuse . ' "
Manning argued that Miers did in fact have such an ' adequate excuse ' against complying with the subpoena , and that she also was not acting ' willfully ' in contempt of Congress .
Manning 's letter to Conyers can be downloaded at this link .

First they came for the Communists , and I did n’t speak up , because I was n’t a Communist .
Then they came for the Jews , and I did n’t speak up , because I was n’t a Jew .
Then they came for the Catholics , and I did n’t speak up , because I was a Protestant .
Then they came for me , and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me .
by Rev. Martin Niemoller , 1945
A few weeks ago , someone on alt.activism asked who said these words and what had happened to him .
First , the version above is taken from an article on the 50th anniversary of the beginning of WW II that appeared in TIME Magazine , Aug 28 , 1989 .
There are many versions of this poem floating around … by no means is this the authorative one .
Similarly , the author of the poem is often not mentioned .
On one level , that is not important .
Indeed , Martin Niemoller was an outspoken advocate for accepting the burden of collective guilt for WW II as a means of atonement for the suffering that the German nation ( through the Nazis ) had caused before and during WW II .
On the other hand , I think that something is missed if one does n’t understand that the words come from a man who also declared that he “ would rather burn his church to the ground , than to preach the Nazi trinity of ‘ race , blood , and soil . ’ ”
Niemoller was tainted .
He had been a U - boat captain in WW I prior to becoming a pastor .
And he supported Hitler prior to his taking power .
Indeed , initially the Nazi press held him up as a model … for his service in WW I . [ Newsweek , July 10 , 1937 , pg 32 ]
But Niemoller broke very early with the Nazis .
In 1933 , he organized the Pastor ’s Emergency League to protect Lutheran pastors from the police .
In 1934 , he was one of the leading organizers at the Barmen Synod , which produced the theological basis for the Confessing Church , which despite its persecution became an enduring symbol of German resistance to Hitler .
From 1933 to 1937 , Niemoller consistantly trashed everything the Nazis stood for .
At one point he declared that it was impossible to “ point to the German [ Luther ] without pointing to the Jew [ Christ ] to which he pointed to . ” [ from Charles Colson , Kingdoms in Conflict• ]
He rejected the Nazi distortion of “ Positive Christianity ” ( postulating the ‘ special virtue ’ of the German people ) , as opposed to “ Negative Chistianity ” which held that all people regardless of race were guilty of sin and in need of repentance .
An excerpt from a sermon of his printed in TIME Magazine [ Feb 21 , 1938 , pg 25 - 27 ] :
“ I cannot help saying quite harshly and bluntly that the Jewish people came to grief and disgrace because of its own ‘ Positive Christianity ! ’
It [ the Jewish people ] bears a curse throughout the history of the world because it was ready to approve of its Messiah just as long and as far as it thought it could gain some advantage for its own plans and its own aims for Him , His words and His deeds .
It bears a curse , because it rejected Him and resisted Him to the death when it became clear that Jesus of Nazareth would not cease calling [ the Jews ] to repentance and faith , despite their insistence that they were free , strong and proud men and belonged to a pure - blooded , race - concious nation !
“ ‘ Positive Christianity , ’ which the Jewish people wanted , clashed with ‘ Negative Christianity ’ as Jesus himself represented it !…
Friends , can we risk going with our nation without forgiveness of sins , without that so - called ‘ Negative Christianity ’ which , when all is said and done , clings in repentence and faith to Jesus as the Savior of sinners ?
I cannot and you cannot and our nation cannot !
‘ Come let us return to the Lord ! ’ ”
And in a celebrated manifesto , produced and smuggled out of the country in classic Charter - 77 style , and reprinted in the foreign press just prior to the 1936 Olympics , he along with 9 other pastors wrote to Hitler :
“ Our people are trying to break the bond set by God .
That is human conceit rising against God .
In this connection we must warn the Führer , that the adoration frequently bestowed on him is only due to God .
Some years ago the Führer objected to having his picture placed on Protestant altars .
Today his thoughts are used as a basis not only for political decisions but also for morality and law .
He himself is surrounded with the dignity of a priest and even of an intermediary between God and man …
We ask that liberty be given to our people to go their way in the future under the sign of the Cross of Christ , in order that our grandsons may not curse their elders on the ground that their elders left them a state on earth that closed to them the Kingdom of God. ” [ from TIME Magazine July 27 , 1936 ]
Rev. Martin Niemoller was protected until 1937 by both the foreign press and influential friends in the up - scale Berlin suburb where he preached .
Eventually , he was arrested for treason .
Perhaps due to foreign pressure , he was found guilty , but initially given only a suspended sentence .
He was however then almost immediately re-arrested on Hitler ’s direct orders .
From then on until the end of WW II , he was held at the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps .
Near the end of the war , he narrowly escaped execution .
[ from Charles Colson ’s Kingdoms in Conflict• ]
After the war , Niemoller emerged from prison to preach the words that began this post , that all of us know …
He was instrumental in producing the “ Stuttgart Confession of Guilt ” , in which the German Protestant churches formally accepted guilt for their complicity in allowing the suffering which Hitler ’s reign caused to occur .
In 1961 , he was elected as one of the six presidents of the World Council of Churches , the ecumenical body of the Protestant faiths .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seen in this file photo in Tehran May 20 , 2007 .

REUTERS / Raheb Homavandi
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s president said on Sunday the Lebanese and the Palestinians had pressed a “ countdown button ” to bring an end to Israel .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who triggered outrage in the West two years ago when he said Israel should be “ wiped off the map ” , has often referred to the destruction of the Jewish state but says Iran is not a threat .
“ With God ’s help , the countdown button for the destruction of the Zionist regime has been pushed by the hands of the children of Lebanon and Palestine , ” Ahmadinejad said in a speech .
“ By God ’s will , we will witness the destruction of this regime in the near future , ” he said .
He did not elaborate .
Iran often praises the Palestinians for what it says is their resistance against Israeli occupation .
Tehran also described the war last summer between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel as a victory for the Iranian - backed group .
“ If you make a mistake and create another war against the oppressed Lebanese nation , this time the angry ocean of the nations of the region will remove your rotten ... roots from the region , ” the president said in another speech on Sunday night .
Ahmadinejad ’s speeches were made ahead of ahead of Monday ’s anniversary of the death in 1989 of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic Republic , whose words Ahmadinejad echoed when he called for Israel to be “ wiped off the map ” .
The president ’s comments caused consternation in Israel and the West , which also fear Iran is seeking to build an atomic arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear power programme , a charge Tehran denies .
Although Ahmadinejad has said Iran is not a threat to Israel , Iranian officials have said Tehran would respond swiftly to any Israeli attack .
Some analysts have speculated Israel could seek to knock out Iran ’s atomic sites .
One of the most commonly repeated assertions about introduced invasive / exotic species is that they are the second leading cause of biodiversity decline worldwide after habitat destruction .
It is clearly an idea that has captured the imaginations of those who strive to raise awareness of the invasives issue and build support for actions and policies which will help address its consequences .
What disturbs me is not that invasives are n't a real problem worthy of attention - from my perspective they assuredly are - but instead that the claim itself has become canonical , an invasives cataclysm recited as dogma by believers in the true faith who willingly repeat it , often without attribution .
Its acceptance as fact simply because it has been said many times by various groups and authorities , rather than based on the measurable scientific data that should inform such a conclusion , is startling to say the least , and worrisome .
Consider this random sample , plucked straight from the prevailing electronic media stream , of declarative derivations on this " second leading cause " theme :
" The second biggest threat to Connecticut 's natural habitats is invasion by alien plants and animals ( behind loss of habitat to sprawling land development . ) "
- Eastern Connecticut Forest Landowners Association " the second greatest threat to the 500 + endangered & threatened plant species in Florida is adverse effects from invasive exotic plants ( the greatest threat is direct habitat destruction via population growth , urban sprawl , etc. ) .
" Florida Invasive Pest Plant Council " Ecologists believe that biological invasions are second only to habitat destruction as a threat to biodiversity . "
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation , Australia
" In the past 25 years , exotic invasive species has risen from the 6th to the 2nd threat to biodiversity , second only to habitat destruction . "
- Great Lakes United " The World Conservation Union has identified invasive alien species as the second most significant threat to biodiversity , after habitat loss . "
Alberta Invasive Plant Council
" The renowned Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson has claimed that the introduction of alien species is second only to habitat destruction as the leading cause of extinctions worldwide . "
Discover Magazine
There is remarkable consensus in the environmental community that these unsubstantiated statements should be accepted as fact , but startling vagueness as to their source material and originators .
Those versions that are actually attributed to someone , not simply repeated as mantra , are often themselves mere repetitions , reinforced with the added weight and authority of those who repeat them .
Thus the USDA or The Nature Conservancy declares invasive species to be the second greatest threat and becomes the cited authority by a local Exotic Pest Council or waterhsed group in its publications and pronouncements on the subject .
There is no objective basis for evaluating such claims taken at face value or their implications if substantiated .
At issue is the misrepresentation and exaggeration of scientific data though careless repetition and popular imagination .
This is very shaky ground on an issue where we cannot afford sloppy science .
So where did this idea originate , and what is the basis for its conclusions ?
Apparently it was first proposed in The Diversity of Life ( 1992 ) by no less authority than biologist and Harvard Professor E O Wilson , who has compellingly addressed issues of biodiversity and the anthropogenic factors accelerating global extinctions .
According to a 2003 letter by two Arizona State Professors , published in Science Magazine , the basis of Wilson 's reasoning on the biodiversity impacts of invasive species is " a vast intuitive extrapolation from unpublished data about North American fishes . "
The authors contend that the idea 's emotional appeal allowed it to proliferate " without rigorous quantitative support . "
Wilson is concerned with biodiversity decline , and places invasive species after habitat destruction as the leading cause worldwide .
So far , so good , assuming you have read his work and accept the evidence Wilson marshalls in support of his argument .
Most of us do not read all the primary source material that informs what we accept as true , but scientists should be concerned with documentation and the assumptions behind hypotheses .
With that admonition and taken at the surface level , this is still a compelling idea .
The second leading cause of anything must be , by implication , highly significant .
Yet according to Daniel Simberloff , in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee who writes in the March - April , 2002 edition of The American Scientist , " habitat destruction contributes to the threat to 85 percent of all imperiled and federally listed species in the United States , and contributes similarly to the threat to imperiled birds alone . "
If true , then at least in the United States invasive species are a far distant second leading cause of rare species decline .
There is also a tendency for those who repeat Wilson 's statement to substitute " plants " for " species " when speaking of leading causes of biodiversity decline .
In fact , I am unaware that there is strong evidence of even a single rare species that has gone extinct from causes attributed primarily to invasive plants : invasive animals and pests and pathogens have caused extinctions , certainly , but not plants so far as I know .
Invasive plants are a legitimate concern with extensive environmental , economic and cultural impacts that are worth developing strategies to address , but declaring them the second leading threat to rare species is just not supported by the available evidence .
E O Wilson has written since then that " Extinction by habitat destruction is like death in an automobile accident : easy to see and assess .
Extinction by the invasion of exotic species is like death by disease : gradual , insidious , requiring scientific methods to diagnose . "
I am in complete accord with this conclusion .
We do need better measures and better data informing our understanding of the behavior and impacts of invasive species .
We also need better standards for declarations of scientific fact .
No matter how compelling it may be to repeat and how it fires the imagination , " the second leading cause " theme is just a meaningless mantra without them .
Former White House aides to be interviewed in Tillman investigation Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 2 , 2007
Print This Email This A House committee investigating Patrick Tillman 's death by friendly fire agreed Thursday to off - the - record interviews with White House aides .
Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman agreed to " informal " interviews with three former presidential aides : communications director Dan Bartlett , spokesman Scott McClellan and speechwriter Michael Gerson .
" We believe this is a constructive offer and we are willing to proceed on this basis , " Waxman and ranking Republican Tom Davis wrote to White House counsel Fred Fielding .
The committee reserved the right to subpoena the former aides if it was not satisfied after the private session that they were not involved in mishandling the disclosure of the circumstances surrounding Tillman 's death .
In requesting the former officials ' testimony and documents from the White House , the Oversight Committee is trying to determine who knew what , and when White House officials learned that Tillman was killed by US troops , not enemy fire .
Committee members also are expected to address the White House 's strategy in responding to press inquiries about Tillman 's death in the weeks after he was killed .
Tillman , who quit the NFL to join the Army after Sept. 11 , became a national hero in the wake of his death , and was posthumously awared the Silver Star for his service .
News that he was killed by friendly fire did not emerge for a month after his death in April 2004 .
The committee also requested drafts of President Bush 's May 1 , 2004 , White House Correspondents Dinner speech , which was delivered the week after Tillman was killed .
" Friends say that this young man saw the images of September the 11th , and seeing that evil , he felt called to defend America , " Bush said in that speech .
" He set aside a career in athletics and many things the world counts important : wealth and security and the acclaim of the crowds . "
At FOO Camp this weekend , I attended an impromptu gathering convened by Danese Cooper and Michael Tiemann , both of whom are board members of the Open Source Initiative .
The topic was the recent attempts by some companies to pass off licenses that do not meet all the requirements of the Open Source Definition as so - called “ open source ” licenses .
Michael first wrote about this here ( his post was Slashdotted ) , and today he followed up with another post .
Three cheers for the OSI , for seeing that there is a real danger of the term “ open source ” being diluted into meaninglessness here , and doing something about it .
And for those who are wondering what the big deal is , let me explain , starting with this clause from the Zimbra Public License ( I do n’t mean to pick on Zimbra ; there are other companies doing the same thing , this was just the nearest example at hand ) :
However , in addition to the other notice obligations , ( 1 ) all copies of the Original Code in Executable and Source Code form must , as a form of attribution of the original author , include on each user interface screen ( i ) the original Zimbra logo , and once for each user session ( ii ) the copyright notice as it appears in the Original Code ; and ( 2 ) all derivative works and copies of derivative works of the Covered Code in Executable and Source Code form must include on each user interface screen ( i ) the “ Zimbra Powered ” logo , , and once for each user session ( ii ) the copyright notice from the version of the Covered Code from which the copy or the derivative work was made .
In addition , the original Zimbra logo or the “ Zimbra Powered ” logo , as appropriate , must be visible to all users , must appear in each user interface screen , and must be in the same position as and at least as large as the Zimbra logo is within the Original Code .
When users click on the original Zimbra logo it must direct them to http://www.zimbra.com/, and when users click on the “ Zimbra Powered ” logo it must direct them to http://www.zimbra.com/powered.
This obligation shall also apply to any copies or derivative works which are distributed under the alternative terms of Section 3.6 and this obligation must be included in any such license .
That clause makes the license not open source .
If you do n’t have the right to modify the code in such a way as to not display the logo , then you do n’t have true freedom to fork .
Perhaps the OSI could have written clause 3 of the Open Source Definition a bit more strongly , to make this utterly clear .
Right now it says :
3. Derived Works
The license must allow modifications and derived works , and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software .
I wish it also said “ The license may not restrict the functionality or behavior of derived works . ”
Then its meaning would be undeniable .
But really , the meaning is already undeniable to anyone familiar with the traditions of open source : it means you must have the complete freedom to modify the source code , and to redistribute the modified version .
If you do n’t have that , you do n’t have the freedom to fork , and you do n’t have open source .
Anyway , the above in combination with clauses 5 and 6 below should put any doubt to rest :
5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons .
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor .
For example , it may not restrict the program from being used in a business , or from being used for genetic research .
The Zimbra license discriminates against Zimbra ’s competitors , because it forces them to do advertising for Zimbra while not forcing Zimbra to advertise for anyone else .
In the Zimbra license , Zimbra Inc. is a special party , treated differently from others .
Finally :
10 . License Must Be Technology - Neutral
No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface .
The incompatibility between that and the Zimbra license is pretty glaring , no further comment needed .
The reason this matters is that open source , as a development methodology and as a culture , depends utterly on the freedom to fork .
You ca n’t have open source practices without open source freedoms : the practices depend on the freedoms .
For example , take the issue of governance in an open source project .
Many projects use the benevolent dictator model , in which one designated person gets to make the final call in controversial decisions .
“ Designated by whom ? ” the skeptic might ask .
The surprising answer is “ It does n’t matter — because if anyone disagrees strongly enough , they can copy the project and take it in another direction . ”
In other words , benevolent dictatorship is n’t really dictatorship , because it depends completely on the consent of the governed .
Now try to imagine how this scenario would play out in the Zimbra development community .
Zimbra ( the company ) starts out as the benevolent dictator , but eventually there ’s some major disagreement between the company and an external developer , a disgreement in which the solution Zimbra decides on simply is n’t bearable to the external developer .
( Perhaps it ’s a disagreement about the size and placement of the logo on interface screens , cough cough . )
So can that external developer fork ?
Can she simply walk away , taking a copy of the code with her and striking out anew , in the traditional open source way ?
Realistically , no .
She can only do a restricted , crippled fork .
She ’ll never be able to get that Zimbra logo off her interface screens , because the license of the software she forked prevents her from doing so .
This is discriminatory , and is an artificial restraint on any fork ’s ability to attract its own developers .
It ’s hard for a fork to compete on its own merits if it must constantly refer back to the place from which it forked .
It ’s like being forced to wear a sign that says “ Do n’t take me too seriously , the real stuff is over at Zimbra , Inc . ”
Now walk back the cat : since there can be no credible threat of a fork in the Zimbra development community , there is no pressure on Zimbra , Inc. to be a good benevolent dictator .
Maybe they will be good stewards of the software anyway , or maybe they wo n’t , but the point is that the open source method depends on that pressure — the threat of a fork is an integral and necessary part of true open source development .
Zimbra has eliminated that threat , and therefore is not doing open source .
( And this is not just about the benevolent dictatorship model ; it would be equally true with any other system of governance .
In all open source projects , no matter how decisions are made , the threat of a fork is the ultimate guarantor of every developer ’s right to empowered disagreement . )
Note that the OSI ’s objection is not to the Zimbra license per se .
The objection is just to Zimbra ’s calling that license “ open source ” .
They can use any license they want , but they should n’t call it open source unless it actually is .
Freedom is freedom , and no amount of spin will change that .
So what should we do about this ?
The term “ open source ” is n’t trademarked .
Years ago , the OSI tried to register it , but it was apparently too generic .
There may still be some legal angle available — perhaps false advertising , based on the generally - understood meaning of “ open source ” .
I do n’t know , I am not a lawyer , and the OSI has its own lawyers to advise it on legal strategies .
But there is public opinion .
What Danese and Michael are proposing doing is organizing a lot of open source developers ( and I mean “ open source ” according to the traditional definition , the one the OSI and I and most other open source developers I know adhere to ) to stand up and , basically , say “ All of us agree on what the definition of ‘ open source ’ is , and we reject as non -open source any license that does not comply with the letter and spirit of the Open Source Definition . ”
Their hope is that the threat of widespread bad publicity from the developer community may be enough of an incentive to get these companies to either stop calling their licenses open source , or change the licenses to actually be open source .
I think this could actually work .
Getting the open source blogosphere angry at you is bad for business and worse for recruiting ; even just on business grounds it might be enough to persuade the companies to change their tactics .

Microsoft must work with , not against , open source otherwise it risks sacrificing developer support and credibility among customers - even Windows loyalists .
That 's according to the chief executive of a fast growing open source competitor to Microsoft 's popular , but closed - source , SQL Server database .
Marten Mickos , MySQL chief executive , told The Register the secret to growth in Microsoft 's core Windows franchise lies in working with open source .
According to Mickos : " If you wo n't work with MySQL , PHP and Ruby then you are lost - that 's always been our message . "
Microsoft is clearly aware it must ensure open source languages , middleware and applications run just as well on Windows as Windows - only languages , middleware and applications , otherwise open source developers will deploy on Linux .
As such , Microsoft has technology deals with SugarCRM , Zend Technologies , JBoss ( now part of Red Hat ) and Novell , while it 's devised versions of Python and Ruby for the .NET Framework .
MySQL , meanwhile , last year joined Microsoft 's Visual Studio Industry Partner ( VSIP ) program and developed a Visual Studio plug in for developers building applications for its database .
There 's plenty of scope left to help developers using Visual Studio for MySQL and to improve data , analytics and application interoperability between MySQL , SQL Server and other Microsoft server and Office applications .
Speaking in the wake of claims in Fortune by Microsoft 's legal team that Linux and open source infringe on 235 of the company 's patents , Mickos suggested , though , that Microsoft is n't going far enough in its efforts with open source , and that this will cost the company dearly .
" I do n't think you can say Microsoft is pragmatic on open source - it 's religious .
It 's categorical in a way it should n't be , and it 's harming them , " Mickos said .
" You must never lose the trust of the customer [ even ] customers who are not using open source .
They are looking at Microsoft and asking : ' why are you doing that ? '
People have a sense of fairness , and you do n't want to get hurt .
" It hurts their credibility with customers .
The question that arises is if Microsoft is ready to sue Linux for patent infringement , what says they wo n't sue a customer ?
As an end user , I 'd be worried if I was using a vendor that threatens to sue me . "
MySQL is certainly leveraging the Microsoft fear factor .
With 700 partners in the systems integrator , VAR and ISV markets , Mickos 's company is promising that - unlike Microsoft - it wo n't end up competing with them , should they develop a lucrative business .
Some 60 per cent of MySQL revenue comes form the embedded market , with partners OEMing MySQL 's database .
" We are sticking to the knitting - the database , " Mickos promised . ®
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- Reports Wednesday suggested that Chinese officials have begun threatening a concerted series of foreign reserve sales to deliberately weaken the U.S. dollar and punish the U.S. Congress for its efforts to impose trade tariffs .
We should be so lucky .
Such sales would effectively accomplish what China 's congressional critics want -- i.e. reduce U.S. imports -- while at the same time destroying part of the value of China 's foreign exchange holdings .
Massive sales of U.S. treasuries would doubtless cause interest rates to rise and , combined with the already faltering U.S. housing market , probably push the U.S. economy into a recession we 're probably overdue for .
The real question the Chinese leadership must resolve is whether the damage to their own country 's economy , or at least to its apparatchiks and nouveau oligarchs , would be any less severe .
In some ways the U.S. relationship to China is a variant of the old saying :
If you owe a billion dollars , the bank owns you .
If you owe a trillion dollars , you own the bank .
As China 's most significant export market , a healthy U.S. economy means China has a place to offload all the plastic gizmos it can make , along with toys covered in lead - based paints and tubes of toxic toothpaste .
Maintaining blistering growth has been important enough for China 's own " political " leadership that they 've been willing to subsidize U.S. consumption by buying up U.S. debt and keeping interest rates low .
At some point that will have to change .
China will have to let its currency 's appreciation against the dollar accelerate , irrespective of what anybody in Congress says .
So Americans should probably be grateful .
After all , as long as we 're heading down this mountain with no brakes on , we 're better off having the accident sooner rather than later , even if the collateral damage takes out a few politicians on both sides of the Pacific .

Scientists are eyeing the jet stream , an energy source that rages night and day , 365 days a year , just a few miles above our heads .
If they can tap into its fierce winds , the world 's entire electrical needs could be met , they say .
The trick is figuring out how to harness the energy and get it down to the ground cost - effectively and safely .
Dozens of researchers in California and around the world believe huge kite - like wind - power generators could be the solution .
As bizarre as that might seem , respected experts say the idea is sound enough to justify further investigation .
The jet stream typically blows from west to east 6 to 9 miles over the northern hemisphere at speeds up to 310 mph .
By lofting generators into the upper atmosphere , scientists theorize they could capture the power of the jet stream and transmit the electricity along cables back to Earth .
A wind machine , floated into such a monstrous force , would transmit electricity on aluminum or copper cables -- or through invisible microwave beams -- down to power grids , where it would be distributed to homes and businesses .
Unlike ground - based wind generators , the high - altitude devices would be too high to be heard and barely visible against the blue sky .
" My calculations show that if we could just tap into 1 percent of the energy in high - altitude winds , it would be enough to power all civilization .
The whole planet ! " said atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University .
Research into high - altitude wind machines began in the 1980s .
Bryan Roberts of the University of Technology in Sydney , Australia , was an early pioneer .
Working with a team of researchers , he has field - tested a small , two - rotor prototype device tethered a short distance above the ground , successfully generating the electricity from low - level winds and transmitting it to Earth .
Creating a much larger , commercially viable system envisioned by scientists would take millions of dollars of research .
Scientists need to figure out the structural materials that could stand up to the jet stream 's buffeting winds and find a way to adjust the generator 's position as the jet stream meanders back and forth across the sky .
Perhaps more vexing is determining the appropriate size and composition of the cable that would act like the string on a child 's kite to keep the machine from blowing away while it functions as an electrical transmission line .
Obstacles aside , some optimists think the jet stream could supply commercial electricity within a decade or two .
" My opinion is that 15 years from now , it 'll supply most of the power in the United States , " said David Shepard , a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur from Ramona ( San Diego County ) , who with Caldeira and other researchers in Australia and Canada is helping Roberts plan the helicopter - like version of a wind machine .
Others , like Caldeira , are more cautious .
" In the 19th century , it took 25 years for oil to replace 1 percent of the coal market , " Caldeira said .
" The energy infrastructure tends to evolve slowly . "
Engineering aside , there will be other hiccups to work out .
For instance , there 's uncertainty about how much the machines or their cables would threaten birds .
" These wind turbines will fly far above most birds and would fill only a tiny fraction of the sky , " Caldeira said .
" Nevertheless , it may be important to find ways to warn off birds . "
Another concern might be whether such technology would pose a danger to airplanes .
For his part , Shepard is n't worried .
He points out that U.S. authorities have maintained a fleet of tethered balloons as part of drug - traffic - tracking operations along the U.S. - Mexican border .
The Tethered Aerostat Radar System , which monitors aircraft , typically floats at an altitude of 15,000 feet and planes have never collided with them .
There is a remarkable variety of designs for high - flying wind machines , some of which resemble blimps or futuristic helicopters .
Others look like Alexander Calder - style mobile sculptures .
An early , 240 - kilowatt prototype of a wind machine could weigh 1,140 pounds and have four rotors , each of which might be 35 feet wide from tip to tip and would spin up to five times per second .
At the moment , though , only small lab prototypes used in field tests have seen the light of day .
Rafe Pomerance , president of the nonprofit Climate Policy Center in Washington , thinks the jet stream - energy idea has merit .
He held a private teleconference with Shepard and his colleagues on April 30 to find out more about it .
Afterward , Pomerance , a member of the U.S. negotiating team for the Kyoto treaty on global warming and a deputy assistant secretary of state for environment in the Clinton administration , told The Chronicle that high - altitude wind power should be investigated .
He said he will be looking into whether his center should do anything to find research funds from federal agencies or private investors for Shepard 's team .
" We need to be investing in multiple options because global warming requires massive transformation of the global energy system , " he said .
Bob Thresher , director of the U.S. National Wind Technology Center , a division of the Department of Energy , offered a more restrained view of the scientists ' plans .
" There 's a tremendous advantage in going up ( toward the jet stream ) because there 's much more energetic winds , " he said .
But if high - altitude wind generators are to succeed , " you have to be able do it very cheaply because the cost of ( ground - based ) wind energy has come down so dramatically , it 's becoming competitive with conventional sources . "
In the March 1 issue of IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion , a journal for electric power professionals , Roberts and six other researchers , including Caldeira and Shepard , described their plans for a prototype , 240 - kilowatt flying electric generator costing " something in the ballpark of $ 5 million , " according to Caldeira .
Some schemes are more modest .
In December , the Canadian government 's Sustainable Development Technology Corp. awarded a $ 950,000 grant to a startup firm , Magenn Power of Ottawa , to develop its proposed MARS -- or Magenn Air Rotor System -- wind generator .
Held aloft by a helium balloon , it would fly only from 600 to 1,000 feet high and tap into the brisker winds closer to the ground , where trees and topography tend to muffle breezes .
Backers hope it can generate 10 kilowatts , enough to support a village of 250 people with limited electricity needs .
" In India alone there are a million villages without power , " said Mac Brown , Magenn 's chief executive officer .
" Our target market is that village which might have 50 or 60 or 70 huts .
All they want is one or two lights in a hut , an electric water pump , and a TV and VCR for the village school .
And they want a refrigerator for medicine , for when the doctor stops in once a month . "
Magenn just opened an office in San Francisco and is sending its representative , Tom Tansy , to Silicon Valley , where he hopes to find investors .
Is a high - altitude wind machine too good to be true ?
" It might be , " Caldeira acknowledged .
" But the way to find out is by trying .
High - altitude winds are the largest concentrated source of renewable energy available on Earth .
In the middle of the jet stream , the amount of power available per unit area can be 100 times more concentrated than the energy of sunlight on the surface of the Earth .
" So the idea that we 're not tapping into it -- or at least investigating it -- seems crazy to me .
All the energy we need is flying by , 5 miles over our heads . "
TO TRY AND CATCH THE WIND
The total energy contained in wind is 100 times the power used by everyone on the planet .
If we could tap into just 1 percent of that energy , scientists say it still wouldnt produce a major adverse effect on the environment .
-- LADDER MILL : A loop of kites attached to a cable would generate power as it moves continuously , pushed by high - altitude winds .
-- ROTOR KITE : A helicopter - like wind machine would use four or more rotors to generate electricity , up to 240 kilowatts .
-- ROTATING KITE : A wind generator held aloft by a helium balloon would fly 600 to 1,000 feet high , tapping into the brisker winds closer to the ground .
It could generate about 10 kilowatts , enough to support a Third World village of 250 people .
-- TURNTABLE KITE : Wind - blown kites would drive a rotating turntable just as falling water turns a turbine in a hydroelectric plant .
Torrent of raw energy
The jet stream is made up of several large currents of high - speed air that rush eastward through the upper atmosphere .
Six miles high , the winds have exceeded 300 mph .
BERLIN - " This morning we saw pictures of the Warsaw ghetto at Yad Vashem and this evening we are going to the Ramallah ghetto . "
Several hours earlier on Sunday you probably would not have heard German Bishop Gregor Maria Franz Hanke choose such a divisive analogy .
But then on Sunday morning he was still in Israel and the rhetoric was considerably different than the one elected by the German Bishops '
Conference once they crossed over in to the Palestinian Authority on Sunday evening .
Israeli -German relations Still a special relationship ?
Dr. Yves Pallade Something has gone awry in idyllic Israel - Germany relationship Still a special relationship ?
The visit of 27 members of the German Bishops ' Conference to Israel included a historic first - time visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem as well as guided tours of sites holy to Christianity and meetings with Christian congregations in Israel and in the Palestinian Authority .
During their time in Israel the bishops uniformly made moderate and balanced statements , but once in the PA they provided German reporters accompanying them with a plethora of harsh proclamations against Israel .
Their criticism received widespread coverage in the German media on Monday .
While crossing one of the checkpoints into East Jerusalem the Archbishop of Cologne , Cardinal Joachim Meisner , told reporters : " This is something that is done to animals , not people . "
Meisner , a resident of eastern Germany , said that the fence reminded him of the Berlin Wall and that in his lifetime he did not believe he would see such a thing again .
As the Berlin Wall was brought down so will this wall be brought down , he said , adding that the fence served no purpose .
The delegation 's visit to Ramallah took place several hours after their visit to Yad Vashem and several of the bishops chose to equate the situation in the Palestinian Authority with the Holocaust .
" Cages in the image of ghettos , " said the Bishop of Augsburg of the territories .
Augsburg was once under the spiritual leadership of Pope Benedict XVI , who was Archbishop of the Munich - Freising Archdiocese and his brother Monsignor Georg Ratzinger still resides there .
" Israel has , of course , the right to exist , but this right cannot be realized in such a brutal manner , " said Bishop Hanke , who later stated that he intends to amend this year 's Easter message to German churches so as to include the delegation 's political impressions from their visit to the territories and a demand to change the situation .

That has to hurt when the head of your party of one thinks you 've gone too far .
The Connecticut Post : ( h/t W.G. )
Connecticut for Lieberman Party Chairman John Orman called Tuesday for Sen . Joe Lieberman to resign , saying his advocacy of a military strike against Iran could explode into a global conflict .
" He has crossed the line , " said Orman , a professor of politics at Fairfield University .
" His unilateral warmongering could lead to a new World War III . "
During an appearance on " Face the Nation " on CBS Sunday , Lieberman said the United States should consider a military strike against Iran because of Tehran 's involvement in Iraq .[.. ]
Orman , a former Democrat , switched party affiliation and took over the Connecticut for Lieberman Party earlier this year .
Lieberman created the party last August to run for re-election as an independent after losing the state 's Democratic primary to Ned Lamont of Greenwich .
However , Lieberman never joined the new party and remains a registered Democrat .

The Most Powerful Volcanic Eruption of the 20th Century
Article by : Hobart M. King , PhD , RPG
June 6th , 1912
The morning of June 6th arrived on the Alaska peninsula to find the area which is now Katmai National Monument being shaken by numerous strong , shallow earthquakes .
The most powerful volcanic eruption of the 20th Century was about to begin – but very few people knew about it .
The Alaska peninsula has a low population density today , but in 1912 it was even lower .
Beyond the land shaken by the earthquake activity , the beginnings of this event were almost unnoticed .
People in Juneau , Alaska , about 750 miles from the volcano , heard the sound of the blast – over one hour after it occurred .
Forty years after the eruption , investigators finally realized that Novarupta - and not Katmai - was the source of the tremendous blast .
Volcanic Monitoring - 1912 vs. Today
Today the stirring of an important volcano draws enormous global attention .
Weeks or even months before most large eruptions , a buzz circulates through an electronically connected community of volcano scientists as clusters of small earthquakes are detected by a global array of seismographs .
Many scientists working at diverse global locations interpret this data and begin to collaborate about an awakening volcano and the eruption that might follow .
Reports are posted on the internet , and news stories communicate the volcano 's activity to millions of people .
Often it is a false alarm – the volcano is simply stirring .
If the earthquakes strengthen and begin moving upwards , many of these scientists will travel to the area of potential eruption to make observations and set up a local network of data - gathering instruments .
However , in 1912 , Alaska was not a U.S. state , very few scientists were supported to do volcanic studies , and a worldwide network of seismic monitoring was not in place .
Scientists were just starting to understand the mechanics of volcanic eruptions .
Novarupta Volcano Erupts !
On June 6th , 1912 , a tremendous blast sent a large cloud of volcanic ash skyward , and the eruption of the century was underway .
People in Juneau , Alaska , about 750 miles from the volcano , heard the sound of the blast – over one hour after it occurred .
For the next 60 hours , the eruption sent tall dark columns of tephra and gas high into the atmosphere .
By the time the eruption ended the surrounding land was devastated , and about 30 cubic kilometers of ejecta blanketed the entire region .
This is more ejecta than all of the other historic Alaska eruptions combined .
It was also thirty times more than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , and three times more than the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo , the second - largest in the 20th Century .
The eruption was rated on the Volcanic Explosivity Scale at VEI 6 .
Impact of the Eruption The inhabitants of Kodiak , Alaska , on Kodiak Island , about 100 miles away , were among the first people to realize the severity of this eruption .
The noise from the blast would have commanded their attention , and the visual impact of seeing an ash cloud rise quickly to an elevation of 20 miles then drift towards them would have been terrifying .
Within just a few hours after the eruption , a thick blanket of ash began falling upon the town - and ash continued falling for the next three days , covering the town up to one foot deep .
The residents of Kodiak were forced to take shelter indoors .
Some buildings collapsed from the weight of heavy ash on their roofs .
Outside , the ash made breathing difficult , stuck to moist eyes , and completely blocked the light of the sun at midday .
Any animal or person who was caught outside probably died from suffocation , blindness , or an inability to find food and water .
Pyroclastic Flow Back on the peninsula , heavy pyroclastic flows swept over 20 kilometers down the valley of Knife Creek and the upper Ukak River .
( A pyroclastic flow is a mixture of superheated gas , dust , and ash that is heavier than the surrounding air and flows down the flank of the volcano with great speed and force . )
These flows completely filled the valley of Knife Creek with ash , converting it from a V - shaped valley into a broad flat plain .
By the time the eruption was over , the world ’s most extensive historic ignimbrite ( solidified pyroclastic flow deposit ) would be formed .
It covered a surface area of over 120 square kilometers to depths of over 200 meters thick near its source .
( The accompanying satellite image shows the original geographic extent of pyroclastic flow deposits as a yellow line . )
Volcanic Ash Immediately after the June 6th blast , an ash cloud rose to an elevation of about 20 miles .
It was then carried by the wind to the east , dropping ash as it moved .
The ash deposits were thickest near the source of the eruption and decreased in thickness downwind .
( The satellite image above has red contour lines showing the thickness of the ash deposits in the area of the eruption .
Measurable thickness of ash fell hundreds of miles beyond the one - meter contour line . )
When the eruption stopped on June 9th , the ash cloud had spread across southern Alaska , most of western Canada and several U.S. states .
Winds then carried it across North America .
It reached Africa on June 17th .
Although the eruption had these far - reaching effects , most people outside of Alaska did not know that a volcano had erupted .
More surprising is that no one knew for sure which of the many volcanoes on the Alaska peninsula was responsible .
Most assumed that Mount Katmai had erupted , but they were wrong .
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes
After the eruption , the National Geographic Society began sending expeditions to Alaska to survey the results of the eruption and to inventory the volcanoes of the Alaskan peninsula .
Robert Griggs led four of these expeditions .
During his 1916 expedition , Griggs and three others traveled inland to the eruption area .
What they found exceeded their imagination .
First , the valley of Knife Creek was now barren , level , and filled with a loose , sandy ash which was still hot at depth .
Thousands of jets of steam were roaring from the ground .
Griggs was so impressed that he called it the “ Valley of 10,000 Smokes ” .
James Hine , a zoologist on the expedition , described the location : “ Having reached the summit of Katmai Pass , the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes spreads out before one with no part of the view obstructed .
My first thought was :
We have reached the modern inferno .
I was horrified , and yet , curiosity to see all at close range captivated me .
Although sure that at almost every step I would sink beneath the earth 's crust into a chasm intensely hot , I pushed on as soon as I found myself safely over a particularly dangerous - appearing area .
I did n't like it , and yet I did . ”
Katmai Caldera & Novarupta Dome During the eruption a large amount of magma was drained from magma chambers below .
The result was a removal of support from beneath Mount Katmai , which is six miles from Novarupta .
The top several hundred feet of Katmai - about one cubic mile of material - collapsed into a magma chamber below .
This collapse produced a crater about two miles in diameter and over 800 feet deep .
Early investigators assumed that Katmai was responsible for the eruption .
This assumption was based upon Katmai being near the center of the impact area , Katmai was visibly reduced in height , and early witness accounts thought that the eruption cloud ascended from the Katmai area .
Closer observation was not possible , and expeditions into the impact zone would be very difficult to accomplish .
The first scientific investigation to get an up - close look at the eruption area did not occur until 1916 when Robert Griggs found a 2 - mile - wide caldera where Mount Katmai once stood .
He also found a lava dome at the Novarupta vent .
These observations convinced Griggs that Katmai was the source of the eruption .
It was not until the 1950s - over forty years after the eruption - that investigators finally realized that ash and pyroclastic flow thicknesses were greatest in the Novarupta area .
This discovery produced a revelation that Novarupta - and not Katmai - was the volcano responsible for the eruption ( see satellite image medium resolution , 164 KB or higher resolution , 1330 KB ) .
This is possibly the most important false accusation in the history of volcanic study .
An eruption the size of Novarupta would ground commercial jet traffic across the North American continent .
Could Novarupta Erupt Again ?
Other large eruptions on the Alaska peninsula are certain to happen in the future .
Within the last 4000 years there have been at least seven Novarupta - scale eruptions within 500 miles of where Anchorage is located today .
Future activity is expected because the Alaska peninsula is on an active convergent boundary .
These large eruptions will have enormous local and global impact .
Local impact will include the lahars , pyroclastic flows , lava flows and ash falls that are expected from a volcanic eruption .
These can result in a significant loss of life and financial impact .
The activity of these volcanoes is monitored by the United States Geological Survey and others so that eruptions can be predicted and their events mitigated .
Large eruptions of Novarupta 's scale at high latitudes can have a significant impact upon global climate .
Recent studies have linked high latitude volcanic eruptions with altered surface temperature patterns and low rainfall levels in many parts of the world .
The 1912 eruption of Novarupta and other Alaskan volcano eruptions have been linked with drought and temperature changes in northern Africa .
Another significant impact is the distribution of volcanic ash .
The illustration on this page shows the ashfall impact areas for five important volcanic eruptions of the 20th century .
Augustine ( 1976 ) , St. Helens ( 1980 ) , Redoubt ( 1990 ) , and Spurr ( 1992 ) all produced ashfalls of significant regional impact .
However , Novarupta 's ashfall was far greater than any other Alaska eruption in recorded history and contained a greater volume than all of the Alaska eruptions which have been recorded combined .
One of the most important reasons to monitor volcanic eruptions is the potential danger that they present to commercial air traffic .
Jet engines process enormous amounts of air , and flying through finely dispersed ash can cause engine failure .
Impacting the tiny ash particles at high speed is very similar to sandblasting .
This can " frost " the jet 's windshield and damage external parts of the plane .
Before the danger of flying through finely dispersed ash was appreciated , several commercial jets were forced to land after sustaining serious damage while in the air .
Eruptions the size of Spurr , Augustine , Redoubt and St. Helens can damage jets flying over 1000 miles away .
An eruption the size of Novarupta would ground commercial jet traffic across the North American continent .
What Can We Do About It ?
People cannot prevent this type of eruption .
They can assess the potential impact , develop with the possibility of loss in mind , plan a response , educate the public and key decision makers , and monitor the region where it might occur .
The more you know about a natural hazard , the greater your chances of avoiding injury or loss .
We are lucky to have this record of the past .

Security stops of cars in rural New England near the US border with Canada , which became more frequent after the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , have yet to snare a single terrorist -- but they have contributed to a huge , unexpected increase in marijuana seizures , according to homeland security authorities .

The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Absolutely Absorbing Bathroom Reader STUMP SOMEONE Meaning :
Ask someone a question they ca n’t answer Origin : Actually refers to tree stumps .
“ Pioneers built their houses and barns out of logs … and they frequently swapped work with one another in clearing new ground .
Some frontiersmen would brag about their ability to pull up big stumps , but it was n’t unusual for the boaster to suffer defeat with a stubborn stump . ”
( From I ’ve Got Goose Pimples , by Marvin Vanoni ) PAINT THE TOWN RED Meaning : Spend a wild night out , usually involving drinking Origin : “ This colorful term … probably originated on the frontier .
In the nineteenth century the section of town where brothels and saloons were located was known as the ‘red light district . ’
So a group of lusty cowhands out for a night on the town might very well take it into their heads to make the whole town red . ”
( From Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins Vol. 3 , by William and Mary Morris ) STAVE OFF Meaning : Keep something away , albeit temporarily Origin : “ A stave is a stick of wood , from the plural of staff , staves .
In the early seventeenth century staves were used in the ‘ sport ’ of bull - baiting , where dogs were set against bulls .
[ If ] the dogs got a bull down , the bull ’s owner often tried to save him for another fight by driving the dogs off with a stave . ” ( From Animal Crackers , by Robert Hendrickson ) WING IT Meaning :
Do something with little or no preparation Origin : “ Originally comes from the theater .
The Oxford English Dictionary suggests that it refers to the hurried study of the role in the wings of the theater . ” ( From The Whole Ball of Wax , by Laurence Urdang ) PUT ON YOUR THINKING CAP Meaning : Carefully and thoughtfully consider something Origin :
In previous centuries , it was customary for judges to put a cap on before sentencing criminals .
Because judges were respected thinkers , it was referred to as a “ thinking cap ” ( From Gordon ’s Book of Familiar Phrases ) PLAY FAST AND LOOSE Meaning : Stretch the truth or meaning of words or rules , deceive or trifle with someone Origin :
This term dates from the 16th century .
It comes from a game called “ fast and loose , ” which was played at fairs .
Operators rolled up a strap and left a loop hanging over the edge of a table .
To win , a player had to catch the loop with a stick before the strap was unrolled .
But they never won .
Cheating operators rolled it up in such a way that the feat was impossible .
( From Have a Nice Day – No Problem ! by Christine Ammer ) BOTCH A JOB Meaning : Repair badly Origin : “ In old England , bodgers were peasant chairmakers …
They produced , by traditional handicraft methods , simple and serviceable objects .
When chairmaking was transformed into high art , the bodgers was correspondingly downgraded to ‘ bodge ’ or ‘ botch , ’ ” which came to mean an item or service of poor quality .
( From To Coin a Phrase , by Edwin Radford and Alan Smith ) IN HOCK Meaning : Broke ; have all of your belongings in a pawn shop Origin : Comes from the Old West .
In a common gambling card game called “ faro , ” “ the last card [ to be played ] was called the hocketty card .
It was said to be in hocketty or in hock .
When a player bet on a card that ended up in hock he was himself in hock , at risk of losing his bets . ” ( From The Whole Ball of Wax , by Laurence Urdang ) TAKE ANOTHER TACK Meaning : Try a different strategy Origin : “ Sailing ships could not move directly into the wind but had to tack – zigzag back and forth with the wind first on one side , then on the other .
If a skipper approaching harbor found that his vessel could n’t make the harbor mouth on the starboard tack , he was obviously on the wrong tack , and would have to take the other ( port ) tack . ”
( From Loose Cannons and Red Herrings , by Robert Claiborne ) GOT OFF ( OR GO ) “ SCOT - FREE ” Meaning : Escape punishment Origin : “ In the thirteenth century , scot was the word for money you would pay at a tavern for food and drink , or when they passed the hat to pay the entertainer .
Later , it came to mean a local tax that paid the sheriff ’s expenses .
To go scot - free literally meant to be exempted from paying this tax . ” ( From How Does Olive Oil Lose its Virginity ? , by Bruce Tindall and Mark Watson ) SLUSH FUND Meaning : A hidden cache of money used for illegal or corrupt political purposes Origin : “ Derived from Scandinavian words meaning ‘ slops , ’ this phrase is derived from the nineteenth - century shipboard practice of boiling up large pots of pork and other fatty meats .
The fat that rose to the top of the kettles was stored in vats and then sold to soap and candle makers .
The money received from the sale of the ‘ slush ’ was used for the crew ’s comfort and entertainment . ”
( From Eatioms , by John D. Jacobson ) TAKE SOMEONE DOWN A PEG Meaning : Humble someone who is self - important and conceited Origin : “ The expression probably originally referred to a ship ’s flags .
These were raised or lowered by pegs – the higher the position of the flags , the greater the honor .
So to take someone down a peg came to mean to lower the esteem in which that person is held . ” ( From Get to the Roots , by Martin Manser ) BUY A PIG IN A POKE Meaning : Buying something sight unseen Origin : “ The poke was a small bag ( the words pouch and pocket derive from the same roots ) , and the pig was a small pig .
As related in Thomas Tusser ’s Five Hundredth Good Pointes of Husbandrie ( 1580 ) , the game was to put a cat in the poke and try to palm it off in the market as a pig , persuading the buyer that it would be best not to open the poke because the pig might get away . ”
( From The Dictionary of Cliches , by James Rogers ) TOUCH AND GO Meaning : A risky , precarious situation Origin : “ Dates back to the days of stagecoaches , whose drivers were often intensely competitive , seeking to charge past one another , on narrow roads , at grave danger to life and limb .
If the vehicle ’s wheels became entangled , both would be wrecked ; if they were lucky , the wheels would only touch and the coaches could still go . ” ( From Loose Cannons and Red Herrings , by Robert Claiborne ) KNOCK OFF WORK Meaning : Leave work for the day Origin : “ [ This phrase ] originated in the days of slave galleys .
To keep the oarsmen rowing in unison , a drummer beat time rhythmically on a block of wood .
When it was time to rest or change shifts , he would give a special knock , signifying that they could knock off . ”
( From Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins Vol.2 , by William and Mary Morris ) DOES THAT RING ANY BELLS ?
Meaning : Does that sound familiar ?
Origin : “ Old - fashioned carnivals and amusement parks featured shooting galleries , in which patrons were invited to test their marksmanship by shooting at a target – often with a bell at the center : if something was right on target , it rang the bell .
Similarly , to say that something ‘ does n’t ring a bells ’ means that it does n’t strike any ‘ target ’ ( evoke any response ) in your mind . ”
( From Loose Cannons and Red Herrings , by Robert Claiborne ) BEAT THE RAP Meaning : Avoid punishment for wrongdoing Origin : “ It is likely that this slang Americanism originated in another expression , take the rap , in which rap is slang for ‘ punishment , ’ facetiously , from a ‘ rap on the knuckles . ’
One who takes the rap for someone else stands in for the other ’s punishment .
Beat the rap ... often carries with it the connotation that the miscreant was actually guilty , though acquitted ” ( From The Whole Ball of Wax , by Laurence Urdang ) BE ABOVEBOARD Meaning : Be honest Origin : Comes from card playing .
“ Board is an old word for table . ”
To drop your hands below the table could , of course , be interpreted as trying to cheat – by swapping cards , for example .
“ But if all play was above board this was impossible ” ( From To Coin a Phrase , by Edwin Radford and Alan Smith )
I thought I ’d pick a nit with something that Ted Leung mentioned in his response to Sam Ruby ’s response to Russ ’ original post about Java needing an overhaul .
Particularly this comment about the Erlang community :
This is actually 2 problems .
Thereâ€™s the issue with the libraries , and thereâ€™s the issue with the community that did / didnâ€™t produce the libraries .
We donâ€™t just need a technology , we need a community .
Hmm , Erlang lab , anyone ?
I ’d like to assert that there is a vibrant Erlang community , it ’s just smaller than you ’re used to , and might be a little harder to find than most .
I ’ve been lurking , participating , and sharing what I ’ve learned in #erlang on irc.freenode .
net since the Erlang movie blew my mind .
I started tinkering with Erlang and the PDF for Programming Erlang came out a few days later .
I still consider myself an Erlang noob .
I still ask questions with obvious answers , spend hours trying to do something that should have taken 5 minutes , and sometimes do n’t do things in the most Erlangish manner .
But the Erlang community has been great to me .
Whenever I ask a question in #erlang , I almost always get the answer I was looking for , whether it ’s a pointer to a specific part of the Erlang docs , a snippet of code , an opinion on the best way to do something , or a link to a blog post that has the answer .
I ’ve been around long enough that I can offer the same to people who are just picking up Programming Erlang and are running in to the same things I was a month or two back .
If you do n’t think there ’s an Erlang community , please come by #erlang and spend some time .
They ’ve been one of the most helpful communities I ’ve ever been a part of .
Activity is currently skewed more towards the European timezones , but as the community grows and more people across the world pick up Erlang that ’s changing .
There ’s also a pretty huge community outside of IRC .
I ’ve been subscribed to erlang - questions , the most active Erlang mailing list for a month or two too .
The solution to one of my problems with bit syntax was asked and answered before I even knew that ’s what I wanted .
I ’ve also learned a lot of things about Erlang that I would n’t have otherwise from the mailing list .
The community does n’t stop there .
Head over to trapexit.org and check out the Wiki and the forums .
When you ’re done there , check out the packages available at CEAN ( the smaller Erlang counterpart of CPAN ) .
There are lots of libraries included here if that ’s what you ’re looking for .
Anything in CEAN can be installed from within the Erlang shell .
If you ’re looking for libraries , do n’t forget to check out Erlang ’s module documentation .
It ’s far from Python ’s batteries included , but there ’s more there than it gets credit for .
Aside from a distributed database there are TCP and UDP socket libraries , an http client and server , an XML library and support for SNMP and SSH .
You ’ll find many more protocol implementations at CEAN while the building blocks reside in Erlang ’s standard library .
Other places to look for sample code or libraries is Jungerl , a loosely knit collection of useful ( but sometimes aging ) libraries and applications , or Google Code .
While many third party Erlang libraries feel like they ’re at the 0.1 stage ( and many are simply because their authors are new to Erlang ) , do n’t forget about the polished apps and libraries .
I ’m specifically thinking of ejabberd , RabbitMQ , YAWS , and Wings3D to name a few .
Also worth a specific mention is ErlyWeb and the several libraries that it is built on top of .
So yes : the Erlang community is quite small .
Think Python 10 - 12 years ago or Ruby before the Rails .
But do n’t pretend that it does n’t exist , because while tiny , it ’s vibrant and extremely helpful .
Moyers had delivered a scathing denunciation of Rove , making the Turd Blossom sound just like his nickname .
Karl
Rove figured out a long time ago that the way to take an intellectually incurious draft - averse naughty playboy in a flight jacket with chewing tobacco in his back pocket and make him governor of Texas , was to sell him as God 's anointed in a state where preachers and televangelists outnumber even oil derricks and jack rabbits .
Using church pews as precincts
Rove turned religion into a weapon of political combat — a battering - ram , aimed at the devil 's minions , especially at gay people .
It 's so easy , as Karl knew , to scapegoat people you outnumber , and if God is love , as rumor has it , Rove knew that , in politics , you better bet on fear and loathing .
Never mind that in stroking the basest bigotry of true believers you coarsen both politics and religion .
Sounds to me like Moyers should get the Nobel Piece ( of My Mind ) Prize for ripping Rove a new one .
And every word of it God 's Truth .
At the end of his righteous rant , Moyer says " even as reports were circulating that he himself ( Rove ) had confessed to friends his own agnosticism " and " you have to wonder how all those folks on the Christian right must feel discovering they were used for partisan reasons by a skeptic , a secular manipulator . "
This is what the ombudsman takes issue with .
How can Moyer say such a thing ?
Getler asked .
How dare he base such a statement on " reports were circulating ? "
Harumph !
Moyers responded with a blog entry providing sources .
There were several references to it online as well as in print journalism last week .
The San Antonio Express News , which knows Rove well , wrote in an editorial ( August 14 ) : " The White House will miss his indubitable political acumen .
What other agnostic could have mobilized hundreds of thousands of conservative Christians behind a political banner ? "
On TheAtlantic.com ( " No One Like Karl Rove , " August 13 ) Marc Ambinder wrote : " I could be wrong here , but I distinctly recall conversations with Rove friends who ’ve told me that his struggles with faith did not lead him to Jesus Christ .
Yet he knew and understood how to interact with ( and manipulate , at times ) the standard - bearers of the evangelical Right and the Catholic conservative intellectual elite ..... "
James Moore ( " The Rove Goes on Forever " : http://www.huffingtonpost.com ) wrote that " [ Rove ] told his friend Bill Israel years ago that he was agnostic and that ‘he wished he could believe , but he cannot . ’"
But here is the rich part --
Rove called to complain :
" If someone says he is a believer , why is that not accepted ?
He ( Moyers ) has decided he will be the judge and the jury about whether I 'm a believer .
He attributes this to unknown parties and then defends it in a letter to Chris Wallace , with no personal interface with me at all .
How does the San Antonio Express know ?
They do n't .
They do n't know me well .
He ( Moyers ) then relies on a blogger who says ' I could be wrong here . '
Well , he is wrong . "
Rove calls Moore an " incredible left - wing ideologue . "
Bill Israel , he says , " was once my teaching assistant .
He was no more a close friend of mine than the man in the moon .
I attend church in my neighborhood and here in Washington .
I was married in church , worship in church , tithe to the church .
My faith is my business .
This is just beyond the pale . "
Beyond the pale ?
Karl Rove complains about beyond the pale ?????
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha !!!!!!!!!!
Stop me before I die of laughter !
Gosh , Karl , you wonder why the world doubts that you are a true and faithful follower of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth ?
You can ask that with a straight face ?
And you wonder how anyone else 's religious beliefs can be called into question ?
Anyone ?
Like ... oh , say ... Bill and Hillary Clinton perhaps ?
The ombudsman then quoted a long string of mostly right - wing emails complaining about Moyers , as if to prove his point .
Here 's two samples :
I am outraged and disgusted at the recent incoherent ravings of Mr. Moyers on PBS .
Obviously , he actively hates the President of the United States and more viciously hates Mr. Rove and I guess anyone else who is not a rabid liberal .
... I happened to have seen Bill Moyers ' commentary on Karl Rove .
His holier - than - thou posturing and frankly stupid comments on Rove and Bush ( and religious Christians in general ) cast Moyers as the intellectually inferior of those he desperately attempts to malign .
He unwittingly reveals that liberals are not tolerant nor frankly intellectually gifted as advertised .
The ombudsman asked PBS to justify Moyers ' piece .
The response , essentially , was to tell him to go find something else to whine about :
" As we stated last month in our reply to your ( previous ) inquiry , ' the title of the series , Bill Moyers Journal , signals to viewers that they can expect to encounter the strongly reasoned viewpoints of Bill Moyers and his guests .' ... Mr. Moyers is not hiding anything from viewers ; his show is not a ' nightly news ' program where the format standards are more narrowly defined .
It is completely appropriate for him to express his informed analysis . "
Mr. Getler , after complaining about how he has to spend so much time dealing with Moyer , wrote one of the longer ombudsman pieces you will ever find .
I have a suggestion for him .
If the task is that onerous , find another line of work .

New York , NY : Inhaling cannabis significantly increases daily caloric intake and body weight in HIV - positive patients , is well tolerated , and does not impair subjects ’ cognitive performance , according to clinical trial data to be published in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes ( JAIDS ) .
Researchers reported that smoking cannabis ( 2.0 or 3.9 percent THC ) four times daily " produced substantial … increases in food intake … with little evidence of discomfort and no impairment of cognitive performance . "
On average , patients who smoked higher - grade cannabis ( 3.9 percent ) increased their body weight by 1.1 kg over a four - day period .
Researchers reported that inhaling cannabis increased the number of times subjects ate during the study , but did not alter the average number of calories consumed during each meal .
Investigators said that the administration of oral THC produced similar weight gains in patients , but only at doses that were " eight times current recommendations . "
The US Food and Drug Administration approved the prescription use of Marinol ( a gelatin capsule containing synthetic THC in sesame oil ) to treat HIV / AIDS - related cachexia in 1992 .
Subjects in the study reported feeling intoxicated after using either cannabis or oral THC , but remarked that these effects were " positive " and " well tolerated . "
Although not a primary outcome measure of the trial , authors reported that patients made far fewer requests for over - the - counter medications while taking either cannabis or oral THC than they did when administered placebo .
Most of these requests were to treat patients ’ gastrointestinal complaints ( nausea , diarrhea , and upset stomach ) , investigators said .
Patients in the study also reported that smoking higher - strength marijuana subjectively improved their sleep better than oral THC .
" The data demonstrate that over four days of administration , smoked marijuana and oral [ THC ] produced a similar range of positive effects : increasing food intake and body weight and producing a ‘ good [ drug ] effect ’ without producing uncomfortable levels of intoxication or impairing cognitive function , " authors wrote .
They added , " Smoked marijuana … has a clear medical benefit in HIV - positive [ subjects ] by increasing food intake and improving mood and objective and subjective sleep measures . "
A previous preliminary trial by Columbia investigators published in the journal Psychopharmacology in 2005 also reported that inhaling cannabis " produce [s ] substantial … increases in food intake [ in HIV + positive patients ] without producing adverse effects . "
Survey data indicates that an estimated one out of three HIV / AIDS patients in North America use cannabis therapeutically to combat symptoms of the disease or the side - effects of antiretroviral medications .
Clinical trial data published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2003 reported that cannabis use by HIV patients is associated with increased CD4 / T - cell counts compared to non-users .
A separate study published in JAIDS in 2005 found that HIV / AIDS patients who report using medical marijuana are 3.3 times more likely to adhere to their antiretroviral therapy regimens than non-cannabis users .
Most recently , investigators at San Francisco General Hospital and the University of California 's Pain Clinical Research Center reported this year in the journal Neurology that inhaling cannabis significantly reduced HIV - associated neuropathy ( nerve pain ) compared to placebo .
The Columbia University study is one of the first US - led clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of smoked cannabis to take place in nearly two decades , and it is the first to compare the tolerability and efficacy of smoked marijuana and oral THC in HIV patients .

Rhode Island : Legislature Makes One - Year - Old Medical Cannabis Law Permanent
June 28 , 2007 - Providence , RI , USA
Providence , RI : More than 80 percent of House and Senate lawmakers voted last week to make the state ’s one - year - old medical cannabis law permanent .
The votes override an earlier veto from the state ’s Republican governor , who sought to close the statewide program .
Under the state ’s law , known as the Edward O. Hawkins and Thomas C. Slater Medical Marijuana Act , an estimated 300 state - authorized patients and their caregivers are provided state legal protections to possess medical cannabis .
The law was set to expire at the end of June unless it was reauthorized by the legislature .
In 2006 , Rhode Island became the eleventh state since 1996 to legalize the medical use of cannabis for qualified patients .
This past April , New Mexico became the twelfth state to enact such a law , and only the fourth to do so legislatively .
Earlier this month , Republican Governor M. Jodi Rell vetoed a similar proposal in Connecticut .
However , state news outlets have reported that lawmakers may attempt to override her veto in a special legislative session later this year .
A New York state proposal to authorize the possession and use of medical cannabis passed the Assembly earlier this year before stalling in the Senate .
Proponents are hopeful that the proposal may also be revisited in a special legislative session this summer .

‘ Pro-Pot ’ Speech By Students Not Constitutionally Protected , Supreme Court Rules
June 28 , 2007 - Washington , DC , USA
Washington , DC : The Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 this week that students ’ speech that may be " reasonably viewed " as " promoting illegal drug use " is not protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution and may be prohibited by school administrators .
The ruling marks the first time the Court has determined that schools can prohibit student expression that is neither obscene nor published under the school ’s auspices .
The decision reverses a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determination that found that school officials infringed upon a student ’s free speech rights when they suspended him for unfurling a banner stating " Bong Hits 4 Jesus " at an off - campus student function in 2002 .
" Drug abuse by the nation ’s youth is a serious problem [ and ] …. the governmental interest in stopping student drug abuse allow [s ] schools to restrict student expression that they reasonably regard as promoting such abuse , " Chief Justice John Roberts opined for the Court .
Justices Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy , Antonin Scalia , and Clarence Thomas sided with the majority .
Justice Stephen Breyer filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part .
Writing for the dissent , Justice John Paul Stevens opined that the majority ’s ruling could potentially " silence opponents of the war on drugs . "
He wrote : " Even in high school , a rule that permits only one point of view to be expressed is less likely to produce correct answers than the open discussion of countervailing views .
...
In the national debate about a serious issue , it is the expression of the minority ’s viewpoint that most demands the protection of the First Amendment .
Whatever the better policy may be , a full and frank discussion of the costs and benefits of the attempt to prohibit the use of marijuana is far wiser than suppression of speech because it is unpopular . "
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and David Souter joined in Justice Stephen ’s dissent .
The case is Morse v. Frederick , No. 06-278 .

Tijuana has been badly affected by drug - linked violence
The troops will hunt suspected traffickers , patrol the coast and man checkpoints , a senior official said .
The city , across the border from San Diego in California , is a major entry point for drugs into the US .
It has been hit by violence between rival drug gangs , with more than 300 killings in 2006 .
The new president , Felipe Calderon , who was sworn in last month , has vowed to curb drug - related violence .
' Hostage to crime '
Interior Minister Francisco Ramirez Acuna said the Tijuana force would be backed by 28 boats , 21 planes and nine helicopters .
" We will carry out all the necessary actions to retake every region of national territory , " he said .
" We will not allow any state to be a hostage of drug traffickers or organised crime . "
Hundreds of police arrived in the city on Tuesday , the Associated Press news agency reported , and more are expected in the coming days .
Last month Mr Calderon sent 7,000 troops to Michoacan state on the Pacific coast to curb the drug violence .
More than 500 people died in violence there in 2006 .
In the worst incident , masked men burst into a bar in Uruapan and flung five human heads onto a crowded dance floor in an apparent warning to a rival drug gang .
Since the deployment in Michoacan the troops have arrested more than 50 people , some suspected members of rival gangs .
In a New Year 's message , Mr Calderon pledged to intensify the fight against crime and drug trafficking .
" The operations will allow us to re-establish the minimal security conditions in different points of Mexico so we can recover little by little our streets , our parks and our schools , " he said .
At 5.50 am on 5 July 1967 , a bill to legalise homosexuality limped through its final stages in the House of Commons .
It was a battered old thing and , in many respects , shabby .
It did n't come close to equalising the legal status of heterosexuals and homosexuals ( that would take another 38 years ) .
It did n't stop the arrests : between 1967 and 2003 , 30,000 gay and bisexual men were convicted for behaviour that would not have been a crime had their partner been a woman .
But it did transform the lives of men like Antony Grey , who had fought so hard for it , meaning that he and his lifelong partner no longer felt that every moment of every day they were at risk .
It is hard for us to imagine now how repressive was the atmosphere surrounding homosexuality in the 1950s .
' It was so little spoken about , you could be well into late adolescence before you even realised it was a crime , ' says Allan Horsfall , who campaigned for legal change in the north west , where he lived with his partner , a headmaster .
' Some newspapers reported court cases but they talked of " gross indecency " because they could n't bring themselves to mention it , so young people were lucky if they could work out what was going on . '
Antony Grey , who later became secretary of the Homosexual Law Reform Society ( HLRS ) , describes having to make ' painstaking circular tours through the dictionary ' to articulate the feelings he'd had since he was nine .
The one thing he did manage to pick up was that ' there was a hideous aura of criminality and degeneracy and abnormality surrounding the matter ' .
Grey , a middle - class boy , fearful of breaking the law , remained ' solitary , frustrated and apprehensive ' until he met his partner at the age of 32 .
Grey is now 89 and has a civil partnership with that same man ( Grey 's partner has always remained anonymous and prefers to do so now ) .
I met them at their house in north - west London , where we talked in a room overflowing with books .
Grey is tall and used to look distinguished ; he has had leukaemia and is gaunt now .
But his memories of the period are precise .
In the early days , they tell me , living together was a dangerous business .
When a drunk coach driver crashed into their car outside their house in the night , ' the first thing we had to do was make up the spare bed .
We knew from experience that if you called the police and they suspected you were homosexual , they would ignore the original crime and concentrate on the homosexuality . '
This was what happened to Alan Turing , the mathematician and Enigma codebreaker .
In 1952 , he reported a break - in and was subsequently convicted of gross indecency .
Though he escaped prison , he was forced to undergo hormone therapy and lost his security clearance ; he later committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide .
For all that the law was draconian , it was also unenforceable .
As a result , arrests often seemed to have an arbitrary , random quality .
When Allan Horsfall became a Bolton councillor in 1958 , he discovered that a public lavatory used for cottaging was well known to police and magistrates , yet there had n't been a conviction in 30 years .
On the other hand , there would be intermittent trawls through address books of suspected homosexuals , with the result that up to 20 men at a time would appear in the dock , accused of being a ' homosexual ring ' , even though many of them might never have met many of the others .
A case of this kind , involving eight men in Bolton , spurred Horsfall to set up the North Western Homosexual Law Reform Society ( later the Campaign for Homosexual Equality ) .
He explains : ' In this case , there was no public sex , no underage sex , no multiple sex .
Yet they were all dragged to court and a 21 - year - old considered to be the ringleader was sentenced to 21 months .
I wrote a letter to the Bolton Evening News .
They had four more letters in support and none against and the deputy editor was visited by the local police , who wanted to know if he thought this was what the people of Bolton really thought about the enforcement of this law . '
Horsfall thought it probably was and set up his campaigning group , which would play an important role in demonstrating to politicians that reform was n't merely the preoccupation of a metropolitan coterie .
When the objection was made , as it often was , that the powerful miners ' groups would n't stand for legalisation , Horsfall was able to point out that he ran his campaign from a house in a mining village where he lived with another man and had never had any trouble with the neighbours .
In the mid-1950s , there was an atmosphere of a witch - hunt ( probably not unrelated to what was happening in America with McCarthy ) , with consequent opportunities for blackmail .
Leo Abse , who eventually piloted the Sexual Law Reform Act through Parliament , recalls that , as a lawyer in Cardiff , his fees from criminals suddenly all started coming from the account of one man .
He investigated and found he was 'a poor vicar .
The bastards were bleeding him .
I sent for one of the criminals and told him if I had another cheque from this man , I 'd get him sent down for 10 years .
I sent for the vicar and told him to come to me if they approached him again . '
MPs on both sides of the House began to demand action .
One or two newspapers ran leaders .
And then there was another high - profile case in which the police were called on one matter and ended up prosecuting another .
Edward Montagu , later Lord Beaulieu , contacted the police over a stolen camera and ended up in prison for a year for gross indecency .
Two of his friends , Michael Pitt - Rivers and Peter Wildeblood , got 18 months .
Their trial in 1954 probably played into the decision of the Home Secretary , David Maxwell - Fyfe , to establish the Wolfenden Committee to consider whether a change in the law was necessary .
As Lord Kilmuir , Maxwell - Fyfe led the opposition to law reform in the Lords , so it was ironic that he started the process .
Perhaps he thought , by handing over to a committee , to shelve the issue .
Perhaps he assumed Wolfenden would find against , in which case , he chose a curious chairman , because Wolfenden had a gay son , Jeremy .
Antony
Grey told me that when Wolfenden accepted the job , he wrote to Jeremy saying it would be better if he were n't seen around him too often in lipstick and make - up .
Allan Horsfall believes homosexuality was tacked on very late in the day to the business of a committee that had already been set up to look into the legal status of prostitution .
( Certainly , its remit covered both ; its findings were popularly referred to as the Vice report . )
That would make sense of the choice of chairman , although it is also possible that , given the secretive atmosphere of the time , Maxwell - Fyfe did n't know Wolfenden had a son who wore make - up .
The Wolfenden Committee sat for three years and recommended that homosexual acts between consenting adults in private should no longer be illegal .
Setting the tone for the discussion about law reform that would follow , it made no attempt to argue that homosexuality was n't immoral , only that the law was impractical .
The age of consent should , in the committee 's view , be set at 21 ( it was 16 for heterosexuals ) .
The weedy reasoning behind this was that young men left the control of their parents for university or national service .
In fact , it seems to have reflected a general prejudice that homosexuals were even more simple - minded than girls .
I met Leo Abse at his beautiful house overlooking the Thames at Kew where , he says , he is kept alive by his young wife Ania .
He is 90 now and deaf , but mentally acute and still writing books .
We talked in his first - floor drawing room as swans floated by outside .
For all its shortcomings , the Wolfenden report is usually regarded as the key turning point in the fight for legalisation , the moment at which a government - appointed body said unequivocally that the law should change .
Abse insisted that its importance has been exaggerated .
' People talk sloppily about Wolfenden , which was not by any means a key turning - point .
A myth has grown up : the myth of pre-Wolfenden and after .
It was only a staging post .
When I arrived in the Commons after Wolfenden , the vote against it was overwhelming .
Ten years of struggle came after . '
It 's true that an awful lot of lobbying remained to be done .
The HLRS got off the ground in 1958 , following a letter to the Times signed by 30 of the great and the good , including former Prime Minister Clement Attlee , philosophers AJ Ayer and Isaiah Berlin , poets C Day Lewis and Stephen Spender , playwright JB Priestley and various bishops .
( From our perspective of the early 21st century , when the churches seem so afraid of homosexuality , it 's interesting that in this period they consistently and visibly backed reform . )
Antony
Grey became secretary in 1962 , using the pen name he used for any letters he had published ( his real name is Anthony Edward Gartside Wright ) : ' My father was dying .
I did n't tell my parents I was gay until I was nearly 30 and they thought it was some foul disease .
They were never comfortable with it .'
A long campaign ensued of talks to the WI and Rotary Clubs , university debates , public meetings and letter - writing .
The meagre amount that the HLRS could afford to pay Grey was supplemented by means of a Saturday sub-editing job on The Observer , offered him by David Astor , then the paper 's owner and editor , who was a supporter of reform .
The campaigning work was exhausting and often thankless and the opposition a mixture of vituperative and mad .
Grey once caused consternation at a Rotary dinner when asked what homosexuals were really like , by answering , ' rather like a Rotary Club ' .
An opponent in a Cambridge University debate , Dame Peggy Shepherd , asked him over a nightcap at their hotel , ' Tell me , why are you so concerned about these unfortunate people ? '
Various stabs were made at bringing the matter before Parliament , but the first really promising development came with a bill in the Lords in July 1965 .
It was sponsored by Lord Arran , an unlikely reformer : known to his friends as Boofy , he kept a pet badger .
Grey recalls going for tea with him , with the creature in his lap .
He had inherited the title because his older brother , who was gay , had committed suicide .
' He was n't the sort of person you 'd think would do it , ' Grey says .
' But he was invaluable .
He was related to everyone and was always saying things like , " I 'll have a word with Cousin Salisbury about that . "
He was a bit mad - he referred to the bill as William - and he became an alcoholic while he was doing it .
He more or less had to be dried out afterwards . '
For the opposition , Lord Kilmuir warned against licensing the ' buggers ' clubs ' which he claimed were operating behind innocent - looking doors all over London .
But Arran , supported by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York , won his third reading by 96 votes to 31 .
In the Sixties , the Lords led the way , quite unlike the situation in 2000 , when the age of consent was finally equalised after the government invoked the rarely used Parliament
Act to overrule a House of Lords that had thrown it out three times .
Like the churches , the Lords has become more conservative about homosexuality over the years .
The Catholic Archbishops of Westminster and Birmingham argued for exemptions in the 2007 Equality Act which would have allowed homosexuals to be turned away from soup kitchens and hospices .
Arran 's bill ran out of parliamentary time , but its success meant the pressure was now on for the Commons .
A Conservative MP , Humphrey Berkeley , tried to sponsor a bill in the lower house .
He was gay and in many ways , the lobby , certainly Grey , would have preferred him .
' He was a nice person and not as quirky as Leo , ' Grey says now .
' Both Arran and Abse thought that having got so far , they needed to make concessions , placate the implacable .
It seemed to me that most people were n't worried about the details . '
Abse takes a different view .
' The House did n't like Humphrey Berkeley .
He was gay and everyone knew .
He was an enfant terrible who never grew up .
I do n't think he could have got it through . '
Berkeley ran out of parliamentary time and then lost his seat at the 1966 general election .
Back in the new Parliament , Abse gave notice in the July that he intended to move a 10 - Minute Rule bill .
By his own account , he was not the man the Home Secretary , Roy Jenkins ( who wanted reform , fought for it in cabinet , guaranteed parliamentary time and assiduously sat through all the debates ) would have chosen to pilot it through .
' We had a reconciliation before he died , but when Roy Jenkins talked to me in those days , he used to shut his eyes , as though he wanted to blot me out . '
Abse believes Jenkins would have preferred Michael Foot , for two reasons .
First , he says , Jenkins wanted ' to bog down Michael ' , whom he saw as a potential rival in any leadership contest ; and second , he ' thought I was too dangerous a character .
I was too colourful ' .
He points to a shield on the wall , given to him by the Clothing Federation for being the best - dressed MP in Parliament .
' I used to dress up .
My wife - my first wife - used to dress me up .
By God , they needed some colour in Parliament !
It was n't only my narcissism .
It was a part of opening up society .
But I think Jenkins found it somewhat ... he did n't feel comfortable .'
Abse 's story is that he and Foot , who were and are great friends , outmanoeuvred the Home Secretary .
Foot did n't want the job .
' He had n't specially involved himself in the homo issue ' ( even allowing for the fact that he is 90 , Abse 's language seems a bit odd here ) , and when he realised what was involved , politely backed off .
Jenkins did then give his support , Abse acknowledges , ' although on the way there were a couple of occasions when he lost his nerve and I did n't ' .
Human - rights campaigner Peter Tatchell points out : ' The tone of the parliamentary debate alternated between vicious homophobia on one side and patronising , apologetic tolerance on the other . '
The Earl of Dudley 's contribution in the Lords sums up the level of the opposition 's argument : ' I can not stand homosexuals .
They are the most disgusting people in the world .
I loathe them .
Prison is much too good a place for them . '
But , as Tatchell suggests , the tone of the supporters is , from this distance , hardly less cringe - inducing .
No one mentioned equality or love .
The consistent position was that homosexuals were pitiful and in need of Christian compassion .
Abse argues now that much of this was tactical .
' The thrust of all the arguments we put to get it was , " Look , these people , these gays , poor gays , they can't have a wife , they can't have children , it 's a terrible life .
You are happy family men .
You 've got everything .
Have some charity . "
Nobody knew better than I what bloody nonsense that was .
' My inspiration was ideology .
It 's a dirty word these days , but I was and am an ideologue .
I am a Freudian .
And I had been taught by Freud that men and women are bisexual .
People should come to terms with their bisexuality , not repudiate it and become homophobic .
You knew you were doing more than releasing thousands of people from criminality , ' he explains .
' It was the start of opening up society to be more caring and sensitive .
One was battling for all men and women to have a greater freedom . '
Commentators have argued over whether Abse was sufficiently ambitious with the substance of the bill , but there is no doubt that he was an adept tactician .
He kept the mining MPs away from all the votes , ' calling in my debts ' .
He used his friendship with the chief whip , John Silkin , to ensure there was enough time and he drew the opposition 's sting by gingering up a row over whether the law should apply to merchant seamen .
For a bit , it looked as though this arcane dispute might scupper the bill , but then Abse produced a compromise which , though patently absurd ( merchant seamen could have homosexual sex with passengers and foreign seamen , but not each other ) wrong - footed his opponents at a crucial moment .
Right at the end , in the report stage , he managed to keep the required 100 - plus supporters in the chamber all night so as to call for closure on the various amendments .
On the last of these , he had 101 people there , which was all he needed but which , he says , ' shows how precarious the bill was , and it's why I get so damned annoyed when people say Wolfenden was a watershed .
We got that bill through on one vote . '
Perhaps
Abse is so anti-Wolfenden because his bill has been accused of being even more tentative than that report a decade earlier .
Certainly , for those who had been lobbying , the act was a disappointment in several respects , not least in its confirmation of Wolfenden 's age of consent .
' Of course , 21 was absurdly high , ' Abse acknowledges now , ' but I would n't have had a hope of getting it through under that . '
This does not seem to be his entire thinking though because he also says : ' Adolescence is a difficult time and many young men go through a homosexual phase .
Great care is needed in that you do n't corroborate them in their fixation . '
To make matters worse , the maximum penalty for any man over 21 committing acts of ' gross indecency ' ( which included masturbation and oral sex ) with a 16 - to 21 - year - old was increased from two years to five years .
Same - sex relations were also legal only in private , which was interpreted , as Tatchell says , as being ' behind locked doors and windows and with no other person present on the premises ' .
While sex may have been legal , most of the things that might lead to it were still classified as ' procuring ' and ' soliciting ' .
' It remained unlawful for two consenting adult men to chat up each other in any non-private location , ' Tatchell says .
' It was illegal for two men even to exchange phone numbers in a public place or to attempt to contact each other with a view to having sex . '
Thus the 1967 law established the risible anomaly that to arrange to do something legal was itself illegal .
We should n't think this provision was quietly ignored either .
In 1989 , during the Conservative campaign for family values , more than 2,000 men were prosecuted for gross indecency , as many as during the 1950s and nearly three times the numbers in the mid-Sixties .
So , is Abse right that he got as much as he could in the circumstances ?
Antony Grey thinks certainly not ; Allan Horsfall is more equivocal .
It is hard to judge at this distance , although the experience of recent years suggests there is a lot to be said for moving swiftly to consolidate positions gained , as Stonewall has done in sweeping on from Section 28 to civil partnership to protections for sexual orientation legislation .
Stonewall 's chief executive , Ben Summerskill , acknowledges that in recent years , MPs with trade union backgrounds like John Prescott or Alan Johnson have been prepared to assert that equality means equality , which simply was n't the case in the 1960s .
Other Labour ministers of the recent past have been susceptible to arguments about their legacy , where Harold Wilson 's government was mainly preoccupied with economic troubles and international crises .
Abse was disappointed in a different way by the aftermath of his Sexual Offences Act .
' Those of us putting the bill through thought that , by ending criminality , we'd get the gays to integrate .
But I was disconcerted and frightened at first because they were coming out and turning themselves into a self - created ghetto . '
Abse 's views of integration sound rather more like wholesale capitulation to majority behaviour .
But , in any case , he is wrong .
Horsfall says : ' Nobody in the circles I moved in realised things had changed .
It was 1970 before the Gay Liberation Front appeared and we were well into the Seventies before the Labour Party campaign for gay rights . '
Abse is disappointed that ' the gays ' were n't more grateful .
' On my 90th birthday , I had lots of telegrams .
I never had one word of thanks from any gay activist or lobby .
When I 've shown any reservations about the gays , they have n't forgotten .
The ghetto suggests they are not at ease .
They 've got to have a gay world .
Perhaps it was presumptuous to think they would integrate and become part of society .
They use the excuse of external pressure and discrimination , but really it 's not good enough . '
He is , unfortunately , taking a partial view .
The single thing that more than any other has ' normalised ' gay relationships has been civil partnerships .
They could only have come about through lobbying , not by bien pensant intellectuals as before 1967 , but by gay people themselves .
And while it seems inconceivable now that we could ever go backwards , it is worth remembering the discrimination Abse dismisses was unchecked only recently .
Summerskill points out that recent events in Russia when gay activists , including Tatchell , were beaten up , possibly by plainclothes police , ' were not unthinkable in Britain 20 years ago ' .
Those archbishops arguing for the exclusion of homosexuals from hospices in 2007 offered a glimpse of a grimy homophobia that still sits mouldering on the underbelly of some British institutions .
The 1967 act was terribly flawed , but the world changed overnight for those like Antony Grey and Allan Horsfall who lived with their partners .
The law also emboldened them and others to campaign for the right for those partnerships to have the same standing in law as any other marriage and for other rights to be themselves and have the same freedoms as everyone else .
Mealy - mouthed , half - hearted , embarrassed by itself as it was , the act made possible the equality that has since been so painstakingly fought for .

· The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday July 1 2007 .
The article above referred to Allan Horsfall as ' a former Bolton councillor ' .
Although in 1963 he was a resident of Bolton when he set up what became the Campaign for Homosexual Equality , he was n't a councillor there .
He was , however , a councillor in Nelson , Lancashire in the late 1950s .
You do n’t say ?
Six senators and representatives are calling on the inspector general of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting ( CPB ) to investigate whether liberal bias and censorship prevented a documentary about Islam from being aired by the Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) .
In a letter obtained yesterday by Inside the Beltway , Kenneth A. Konz is being asked to determine why the $ 675,000 taxpayer - funded film , “ Islam vs. Islamists : Voices from the Muslim Center , ” was not aired in April when it was scheduled to run as part of an eight - film series , “ America at a Crossroads , ” that examined challenges confronting the post - September 11 world .
“ Islam vs. Islamists ” was rejected by WETA , the Washington PBS station that oversaw the series , and PBS for failing to meet editorial standards .
The lawmakers are suspecting “ censorship ” of the film , which was produced by former Reagan administration official Frank Gaffney Jr. , a columnist for this paper .
They also cite reports indicating “ conflicts of interest and in some cases sympathy to Islamist groups or apologists from among PBS officials and series consultants . ”
On May 7 , a bipartisan group of eight lawmakers wrote to CPB President Pat Harrison seeking similar answers .
She responded 10 days later , but the lawmakers now tell Mr. Konz that “ she made several claims that we have reason to believe may not accurately describe the facts and warrant your review . ”
The most recent letter was signed by Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Tom Coburn and James M. Inhofe , both of Oklahoma ; and Reps. Trent Franks of Arizona , Peter Hoekstra of Michigan and Peter T. King of New York , all Republicans .
Oregon Public Broadcasting is scheduled to air the program in August .
Like father …
Expect the country ’s vegetable growers to be upset all over again because of finicky eaters in the White House .
You ’ll recall the first President Bush declaring : “ I do not like broccoli .
And I have n’t liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it .
And I ’m president of the United States and I ’m not going to eat any more broccoli . ”
The country ’s broccoli growers grew furious over Mr. Bush ’s statement and in protest shipped tons of the green stalks to the White House .
Regardless , Mr. Bush refused to eat the vegetable and sent the fresh stash to area food banks .
Yesterday , it was his son , President Bush , providing too much information .
Participating in the first White House Conference on the Americas , Mr. Bush heard Maria Pachecho , an organic farmer from Guatemala , say that she had helped more than 1,000 rural women become vegetable - growing entrepreneurs .
“ I ’m not big on vegetables , ” Mr. Bush told her .
How weird
We have to laugh at the current New York magazine interview with “ CBS Evening News ” anchor Katie Couric , who now acknowledges that there are days when she wishes she had n’t made the move to the network from NBC .
“ I ’m human , ” Mrs. Couric says .
“ I ’m not going around , ‘ Dee - da dee - da dee . ’
I have days when I ’m like , ‘ Oh my God , what did I do ? ’
But for some weird reason , they do n’t happen that often . ”
Probably because she ’s getting paid $ 45 million over three years .
Must be summer
Even the White House press corps is rushing to report that , despite it ’s being summer , it ’s hot outside .
“ The main thing is that it was hot , ” reads the first sentence of a White House pool report surrounding President Bush ’s arrival on the White House South Lawn .
As far as the last sentence of the report : “ It was still hot . ”
No more games
In light of the fact that a mere 14 percent of Americans think Congress is doing a good job , Rep. Dan Burton , Indiana Republican , questions whether congressmen and senators deserve their automatic annual pay raise , or “ congressional COLA ” ( cost - of - living adjustment ) .
“ Under the circumstances , if we truly believe we deserve a raise , then we have an obligation , especially those of us fighting for fiscal responsibility , openness and accountability in Washington , to stand before the American people — in the full light of day — and say to them , ‘ I think I have earned a pay raise , and here ’s why , ’ ” he says .
Mr. Burton has introduced legislation that would give members the opportunity for a straight up or down vote on the 2008 COLA .
He calls it “ showing respect to the people of this country who elected us in the first place .
It ’s time to stop the games and play straight with the American people . ”

Warning :
If you are new to programming , DO NOT READ THIS POST .
GO BACK .
I ’ve been going through the most amazing period in my life now .
I ’ve actually started to work for CAIR , DRDO this year and I am waiting to return there once my exams get over .
I am enjoying every moment of it .
So , now what does loosing one ’s zeal have to do with enjoying oneself in a job that you really like ?
Nothing .
But
Its the lesson that I learnt , that has made me lose my zeal .
So here goes the story …
I started my journey into this wonderful world of Lisp some time back , and it literally put my brain through a mixer .
If you have n’t had the fun of putting your brain on a roller - coaster and watching it from afar , then you should try lisp .
I promise you will enjoy it .
Infact , Lisp is such an amazing language that if you do n’t turn into a zealot , then you never got it in the first place , or so I thought .
Now , moving a bit back in time , say a couple of years back .
This was the time I learnt this funny language called python .
I had the same “ brain in the roller coaster experience ” , dynamic typing , garbage collection , containers as part of the language , what not .
This was like taking a kid who has never seen anything more than his own backyard playpen and giving him an “ All rides free ” pass to disney land .
Thats exactly how I felt coming from programming in C / C++ for as long as I can remember .
If you are a C / C++ hippie , or you are one of the many unfortunate souls who have been put through the torture of going through anna university thinking that all code is written inside of braces , take a look at python .
I promise its great fun .
Now all this talk about C++ brings about older memories … far older , when I was still in 8th .
I had discovered the C programming language .
I could let my computer dance to my tunes , or atleast dance at the tunes it was producing .
I was amazed at all those silly vector graphics that I could produce with good old borland ’s graphics library .
I was amazed at my own skill , I endeavoured to write small games which no one but I would play ( all night long ) .
The fact that the computer could actually do “ anything ” I wanted excited me to an infinite extent .
See a pattern ?
Yes , I ’ve been attached to each and every programming language I ’ve ever learnt , thinking I could conquer the world with my new knowledge .
How so naive of me .
If you are under the same illusions that I was suffering from , I suggest go and write “ production ” code .
Why ?
because production code is a wholly different deal from your hobby programming .
if you are programming because there are no more good blogs to read , then its ok if you do n’t put a tricky loop doing network i/o inside a try – catch / except ( unwind - protect ) kind of construct .
But thats a big NO with production code .
Thats downright stupid in production code .
And you thought your pet language could do anything faster , better and sometimes even in supernatural ways than those of the “ other ” lesser languages ?
“ Ha Ha Ha ” , you self - delusional lemon-eater .
In production code , when the demands are high everything that ’s available tends to hit a brick wall .
Wether its the global interpreter lock in python ( one thats biting me big time right now ) or the lack of good threading in lisp or the fact that working with C is like building a sky - scraper with lego blocks .
The fact that the available tools do n’t really fit your needs is the ground reality , no matter who says what on which news group , trade show or promotional video .
The reason you got hired was precisely because of this reason .
I am here to retrofit it so everyone else can have a gala time .
I am here to give these people the tools , the frameworks so that they can write their code without them worrying about things like “ deep - copy vs. shallow - copy ” .
They can create threads without the worry that their pricey “ dual - core ” system does n’t see it as a huge process which is using too much cpu time and asks the scheduler to put it to sleep .
Its these kind of things that I am building , that has brought upon this realisation .
That no language , no matter how fun , mind - blowing , roller - coaster loopin a language it is , it ai n’t perfect
This has also sucked the zeal that I had whenever I had embarked on learning a new language .
Strangely it has made me cynical of these languages .
Whenever I start seeing a new language , I can hear myself saying , “ Hmm .. thats where I would run into trouble .. ” , Its made me turn pessimistic .
Probably it gave me a little more maturity in language design , but thats debatable .
I am constantly mumbling three words in my sleep , consciously when I am trying to debug code , or think about problems of / in design .
I am chanting them to keep me going , to stop my pessimistic “ inner demons ” from taking over , I am mumbling those three words as I type right now .
I am mumbling “ Half glass full . “

George Bush 's favourite role model is , famously , Jesus , but Winston Churchill is close behind .
The US president - who was yesterday again comparing the struggle in Iraq with the allies ' efforts in the second world war - admires the wartime prime minister so much that he keeps what he calls " a stern - looking bust " of Churchill in the Oval Office .
" He watches my every move , " Bush jokes .
These days , Churchill would probably not care for much of what he sees .
I thought a great deal about Churchill while working on my book Troublesome Young Men , a history of the small group of Conservative MPs who defied Neville Chamberlain 's policy of appeasing Hitler , forced Chamberlain to resign in May 1940 , and helped make Churchill his successor .
I thought my audience would be limited to second world war buffs , so was pleasantly surprised to hear the president has been reading my book .
He has n't let me know what he thinks , but it 's a safe bet that he 's identifying with the portrayal of Churchill , not Chamberlain .
I think Bush 's hero would be bemused ; parallels do leap out - but between Bush and Chamberlain , not Bush and Churchill .
Like Bush , and unlike Churchill , Chamberlain came to office with almost no understanding of foreign affairs or experience in dealing with international leaders .
None the less , he was convinced that he alone could bring Hitler and Mussolini to heel .
He surrounded himself with like - minded advisers , and refused to heed anyone who told him otherwise .
In the months leading up to war , Chamberlain and his men saw little need to build a strong coalition of European allies to confront Nazi Germany - ignoring appeals from Churchill and others to fashion a " grand alliance " .
Unlike Bush and Chamberlain , Churchill was never in favour of his country going it alone .
Throughout the 1930s , while urging Britain to rearm , he strongly supported using the League of Nations - the forerunner of the United Nations - to provide smaller countries with one - for - all and all - for - one security .
After the league failed to stop fascism 's march , Churchill was adamant that Britain must form a true partnership with France and even reach agreement with the despised Soviet Union , neither of which Chamberlain was willing to do .
Like Bush , Chamberlain laid claim to unprecedented executive authority , evading the checks and balances supposed to constrain the office of prime minister .
He scorned dissenting views , inside and outside government .
When Chamberlain arranged his face - to - face meetings with Hitler in 1938 that ended in the catastrophic Munich conference , he did so without consulting his cabinet .
He also bypassed the House of Commons , leading Harold Macmillan , a future Tory prime minister and then an anti-appeasement MP , to complain that Chamberlain was treating parliament " like a Reichstag , to meet only to hear the orations and to register the decrees of the government " .
As was true of Bush and the Republicans before the 2006 midterm elections , Chamberlain and his Tories had a large majority in the Commons , and , as Macmillan noted , the prime minister tended to treat parliament like a lapdog legislature , existing only to do his bidding .
" I secretly feel he hates the House of Commons , " wrote one of Chamberlain 's most fervent parliamentary supporters .
" Certainly he has a deep contempt for parliamentary interference . "
Churchill revered parliament .
He considered himself " a child " and " servant " of the Commons and strongly believed in the legislature 's constitutional role to oversee the executive .
In August 1939 , when Chamberlain rammed through a two - month parliamentary adjournment just weeks before the war , Churchill - still a backbencher - exploded with anger , calling the prime minister 's move " disastrous " , " pathetic " and " shameful " .
He encouraged anti-appeasement colleagues to mount similar attacks , and when Ronald Cartland called Chamberlain a dictator to his face , Churchill congratulated Cartland with an enthusiastic : " Well done , my boy , well done ! "
Likewise , Churchill almost certainly would look askance at the Bush administration 's years - long campaign to shut down public debate over the " war on terror " and the conflict in Iraq - tactics markedly similar to Chamberlain's .
Like Bush and his aides , Chamberlain intimidated the press , restricted journalists ' access to sources and claimed that anyone who dared criticise the government was guilty of disloyalty and damaging the national interest .
Just as Bush has done , Chamberlain sanctioned the wiretapping of citizens without court authorisation ; Churchill was among those whose phones were tapped .
Churchill also believed firmly in the need to protect individual liberties from government encroachment .
That 's not to say that he was never guilty of infringing them .
In June 1940 , when a Nazi invasion seemed imminent , he ordered the internment of more than 20,000 aliens , mostly refugees from Hitler 's and Mussolini 's regimes .
But as the invasion scare abated , the vast majority were released , also by his order .
" The key word in any understanding of Churchill is the simple word ' liberty ' , " wrote Eric Seal , his principal private secretary .
" He ... reacted violently against all attempts to regiment ... opinion . "
I 've discovered that writing about Churchill and Chamberlain is like a Rorschach test .
Readers draw parallels between the events of the 30s and today , according to their own political philosophies .
I 've received congratulations from people who see similarities between US woes in Iraq and Chamberlain 's disastrous conduct of the so - called phony war in 1939 - 40 .
But I 've also had fan mail from readers who favourably compare the Tory rebels ' courageous fight against Chamberlain to the Bush administration 's campaign against those opposing the Iraq war .
Among those who 've written to me in praise of the book are outgoing Bush adviser Karl Rove and Howard Wolfson , the communications director of Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign .
The president no doubt has his own Churchill .
" He was resolute , " Bush has remarked .
" He was tough .
He knew what he believed . "
But Churchill would snort , I believe , at the administration 's equation of " Islamofascism " , an amorphous , ill - defined movement forced to resort to terrorism by its lack of military might , with Nazi Germany , a global power that had already conquered several countries before Churchill took office .
Still , key members of the Bush administration have compared critics of the war on terror to the appeasers of the 30s , equating their boss and themselves with Churchill and the " troublesome young men " who helped bring him to power .
During bleak days in Iraq , the administration 's hawks can be forgiven for hoping that history will show them to be as far - sighted about a gathering storm as Churchill was in the 1930s .
He believed that the US and Britain had a responsibility to serve as exemplars of democracy for the rest of the world , and both countries had to do their best to ensure that the " title deeds of freedom " were strongly safeguarded within their own boundaries .
" Let us preach what we practise , " he declared in his 1946 " iron curtain " speech in Fulton , Missouri .
" But let us also practise what we preach . "

In the last two or three years there has been an explosion of interest in Haskell , and it is now being used for a bewildering variety of applications .
In this tutorial , I will try to show you why programming in Haskell is such fun , and how it makes you think about programming in a new way .
10 Rules for IT Job Success
I got a call last month from a newsletter reader in India who wanted help in making a career decision .
He was a bit vague about the details , but it seems that he impetuously quit his previous job over a difference of opinion with his manager .
Now he was n’t sure whether to try to patch things up or to move on to another company .
I wo n’t go into the details of the advice I gave the reader , but the phone call prompted me to consider what general career advice I would offer to lower - and mid-level people in IT .
I came up with the following set of 10 rules :
1 . You do n’t become an executive by being a better employee .
As Robert Kiyosaki pointed out in his excellent book Before You Quit Your Job , people usually gravitate toward either being entrepreneurs or being employees .
The education system in the United States ( and probably elsewhere as well ) is focused on training people to become employees .
It teaches them to follow rules and procedures , to maximize their use of existing resources , and to follow the orders of the people in charge .
Entrepreneurs , on the other hand , learn through trial and error to obtain the resources they need and to make something out of nothing .
Employees want the security of a full - time job ; entrepreneurs want the freedom to accomplish their dreams .
I point out the difference because lower - and mid-level people in IT are very definitely employees , but the higher you go in the executive ranks the more likely you are to find an entrepreneurial spirit .
This creates a natural barrier which prevents lower - level people from ever becoming executives .
Only by leaving behind the very essence of why you became an employee can you ever rise to the executive level .
2 . There are no right answers to any question – just opinion guided by ethics , legality , experience and tradition .
This of course contradicts what you ’re taught in school , but see rule # 1 .
Even the answers to basic questions like “ How much is 2 + 2 ? ” are based on years of tradition that developed our modern number system .
In a different context , for example in a chemical reaction , 2 + 2 might not equal 4 at all .
If someone tells you that there ’s only one way to do something , what the person really means is that he always does it that way .
It does n’t mean there is n’t a better way , and it does n’t mean you ca n’t improve on things .
3 . Pick your battles .
Of course , life is full of people telling you that there ’s only one way to do things .
And although there are probably better ways to do almost everything , it often is n’t worth the time or investment to figure out a better way to do most of them .
The key is to prioritize : to focus on improving the things that are most important to you or that are most important to your business .
4 . The people who make the least mistakes are the ones who have the most experience .
But the people with the most experience are the ones who have made ( or observed ) the most mistakes in the past ; making mistakes is how they got the experience in the first place .
The only way to learn is to make mistakes ; babies do n’t walk the first time they try , but they keep trying until they stay upright .
If you do your job by copying exactly what someone else does , then you might do the job as well but you wo n’t know why .
You wo n’t be able to respond to changing conditions by altering what you do , because you wo n’t understand the implications of doing things a different way .
Overprotective parents often correct their children ’s homework because they do n’t want their children to “ fail . ”
But the lesson they teach their children is that it ’s unacceptable to fail , while the lesson they ought to be teaching their children is that it ’s ok to fail as long as you learn from your mistakes .
Try new things , and try to do old things new ways .
Some new approaches wo n’t work , but you ’ll learn why and you ’ll be better for the knowledge .
5 . The more credibility you have , the more people will listen to you .
If you ’re perceived as an expert , then people will pay attention to what you say .
This seems obvious .
But it ’s the route to this credibility that confuses most people .
See the next rule .
6 . Build credibility by being successful at what you do – not by telling other people they ’re wrong .
When you first start your career , just do the best you can at the work you ’re assigned .
Treat each assignment as a challenge to exceed ( not just meet ) your goals , and gradually you ’ll build your credibility .
But be very careful to keep your opinions to yourself about topics for which you have n’t yet established credibility .
It ’s very easy to get a reputation as a trouble - maker when the number of your critical comments exceeds your demonstrated capability .
7 . Titles convey temporary credibility , but the credibility expires if it is n’t proven .
New managers or people who are new to senior technical positions often expect that they get credibility just because of their title .
While it ’s true that new people in titled positions are given the benefit of the doubt for a month or so , all of the credibility associated with the position will disappear if you do n’t show evidence that the credibility is warranted .
You do n’t get credibility because of a title – you get a title because of your credibility .
8 . The lower you are in an organization , the more you have to do what you ’re told .
There are four scenarios for doing what you ’re told :
a . If you do what you ’re told and things go well , then you ’ll be perceived as right .
b . If you do what you ’re told ( and it ’s well documented ) and things go badly , then your boss is wrong .
But you ’re also wrong if you did n’t point out the problem earlier .
c. If you do n’t do what you ’re told and things go well , then you might be right or you might be lucky , but you ’ve got to be careful in either case .
Was this a battle worth fighting ?
d . If you do n’t do what you ’re told and things go badly , then you ’ll be perceived as wrong whether or not you really are .
Try to learn from every assignment you ’re given , even if you do n’t happen to agree with the way you ’re supposed to do the work .
Figure out why the work is being assigned that way ; there ’s always a reason even if it ’s not a very good one .
9 . You can learn something every day if you look for it .
You might learn something you should do , or you might learn something you should n’t do .
Either way it ’s progress .
10 . Enjoy the journey .
Sure it might be great to be an executive someday .
But enjoy what you ’re doing right now .
Life is about more than anticipation – it ’s about the learning experience you go through to get to your destination .
To me , that learning experience has always been the fun part .

Jamil el - Banna was detained by the US in 2002 after Britain sent the CIA false information about him .
He had also failed to accept an MI5 offer to turn informant .
If refused entry to Britain , Mr Banna could be returned to face torture in his native Jordan , from where he fled to Britain in 1994 after alleging ill treatment .
Speaking through his lawyer from Guantánamo , Mr Banna described how he longed to be reunited with his wife and five children , and denied involvement in terrorism .
" They should admit the truth - that they have been holding an innocent man for four - and - a - half years .
I just want to be home with my family , " he said .
Mr Banna 's lawyers will launch an emergency court battle within days to seek a guarantee from the government that he will be allowed to return to the UK and be reunited with his family .
Today they will mark his 45th birthday but friends and lawyers fear he faces a " nightmare choice " between languishing in Guantánamo or facing torture in Jordan .
Jordan fear
The Blair government , despite its criticism of Guantánamo , has refused to help Mr Banna during his incarceration .
At least two other former British resident inmates who were cleared for release have been barred from returning to the UK .
Mr Banna 's MP , Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather , said ministers should let him return home to north - west London : " It would be a moral outrage if this government now stood idly by and let him be sent to a country where they know his safety would be at risk . "
Mr Banna was granted refugee status by Britain after it was accepted he had been tortured in Jordan .
In 2002 he was seized by the CIA after MI5 wrongly told the Americans that his travelling companion was carrying bomb parts on a business trip to Gambia .
He was taken to Bagram airbase in Afghanistan and then to Guantánamo .
He alleges ill treatment in both places and has never been charged with any offence .
This month Mr Banna was seen in Guantánamo by his lawyer , Zachary Katznelson from the group Reprieve .
According to Mr Katznelson 's transcript of the meeting , seen by the Guardian , Mr Banna said : " The British government has let me stay here for four and a half years .
What crime did I commit ?
Together with the Americans , they have kept me from my children .
They have deprived me of the chance to see them grow up , to hold them , to kiss them , to laugh with them , to play with them .
There is no way to turn back time , to give me back those moments . "
During the visit , Mr Banna was allowed to watch a home video of his children , including his first sighting of his four - year - old daughter Maryam .
He said : " If there is any justice and fairness in Britain , the British government should tell the Americans immediately : ' You made a mistake ; it is time to get him [ Jamil ] out of there . '
Just tell me you are sorry , that you made a mistake .
If they apologised , I would forgive them . "
Mr Banna came to the attention of MI5 because he knew Abu Qatada , the cleric accused of being al - Qaida 's spiritual leader in Europe .
Days before the trip to Gambia an MI5 agent went to Mr Banna 's home in an attempt to recruit him .
He is also wanted in Spain , which has expressed an interest in extraditing him .
His friend , Bisher al - Rawi , was also seized by the US on the trip to Gambia and imprisoned in Guantánamo for four years .
He was released in March after it emerged he had helped MI5 monitor Abu Qatada .
Speaking from Guantánamo , while shackled to the floor , Mr Banna said : " I have always told the truth .
I have no information about terrorism .
I 've said since the very first day : put me on trial anywhere at any time .
I will gladly stand up and tell my story .
And I know that a fair court would set me free .
But there is no chance of that here in Guantánamo .
There is no justice here . "
Mr Banna said his diabetes is not being treated and his sight is deteriorating .
Mr Katznelson said : " Now he 's been cleared for release , he faces the start of a new nightmare .
Each time I see him he 's more depressed .
He is increasingly despondent about being sent to Jordan . "
During the visit Mr Banna also said that letters from his children were taking up to 16 months to reach him .
Ms Teather , who has fought for Mr Banna 's release , said : " Hearing that Jamil has been cleared for release should be a moment of rejoicing for his family .
But instead it seems they are about to be torn apart .
Jamil was arrested because of false information passed by British security services , and he has been left in Guantánamo to rot because the British government refuses to act .
Now he has finally been cleared for release , the only thing that stands between this father and his family is permission from the government for him to come home . "
Repugnant
Solicitor Irène Nembhard said the home secretary would be taken to court to give a guarantee that he would be allowed entry into Britain : " Since the British government had a role in his detention , to refuse him re-entry would be repugnant .
" It would be unlawful as his children are British nationals with a right to family life under article eight [ of the European Convention on Human Rights ] . "
The government has maintained a position that it has no obligation to help British residents held by the US in Guantánamo .
A spokesman for the Pentagon refused to discuss the case and no date has been set for Mr Banna 's release .

Help from the the usual suspects
( CNN ) -- Michael Moore 's " Sicko , " which opened nationwide Friday , is filled with horror stories of people who are deprived of medical service because they can't afford it or have n't been able to navigate the murky waters of managed care in the United States .
A couple featured in Michael Moore 's " Sicko " leave a London hospital with their newborn .
It compares American health care with the universal coverage systems in Canada , France , the United Kingdom and Cuba .
Moore covers a lot of ground .
Our team investigated some of the claims put forth in his film .
We found that his numbers were mostly right , but his arguments could use a little more context .
As we dug deep to uncover the numbers , we found surprisingly few inaccuracies in the film .
In fact , most pundits or health - care experts we spoke to spent more time on errors of omission rather than disputing the actual claims in the film .
Whether it 's dollars spent , group coverage or Medicaid income cutoffs , health care goes hand in hand with numbers .
Moore opens his film by giving these statistics , " Fifty million uninsured Americans ... 18,000 people die because they are uninsured . "
Watch Michael Moore talk about " Sicko " with CNN's Larry King . »
For the most part , that 's true .
The latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say 43.6 million , or about 15 percent of Americans , were uninsured in 2006 .
For the past five years , the overall count has fluctuated between 41 million and 44 million people .
According to the Institute of Medicine , 18,000 people do die each year mainly because they are less likely to receive screening and preventive care for chronic diseases .
Moore says that the U.S. spends more of its gross domestic product on health care than any other country .
Again , that 's true .
The United States spends more than 15 percent of its GDP on health care -- no other nation even comes close to that number .
France spends about 11 percent , and Canadians spend 10 percent .
Like Moore , we also found that more money does not equal better care .
Both the French and Canadian systems rank in the Top 10 of the world 's best health - care systems , according to the World Health Organization .
The United States comes in at No. 37 .
The rankings are based on general health of the population , access , patient satisfaction and how the care 's paid for .
So , if Americans are paying so much and they 're not getting as good or as much care , where is all the money going ?
" Overhead for most private health insurance plans range between 10 percent to 30 percent , " says Deloitte health - care analyst Paul Keckley .
Overhead includes profit and administrative costs .
" Compare that to Medicare , which only has an overhead rate of 1 percent .
Medicare is an extremely efficient health - care delivery system , " says Mark Meaney , a health - care ethicist for the National Institute for Patient Rights .
Moore spends about half his film detailing the wonders and the benefits of the government - funded universal health - care systems in Canada , France , Cuba and the United Kingdom .
He shows calm , content people in waiting rooms and people getting care in hospitals hassle free .
People laugh and smile as he asks about billing departments and cost of stay .
Not surprisingly , it 's not that simple .
In most other countries , there are quotas and planned waiting times .
Everyone does have access to basic levels of care .
That care plan is formulated by teams of government physicians and officials who determine what 's to be included in the universal basic coverage and how a specific condition is treated .
If you want treatment outside of that standard plan , then you have to pay for it yourself .
" In most developed health systems in the world , 15 percent to 20 percent of the population buys medical services outside of the system of care run by the government .
They do it through supplemental insurance , or they buy services out of pocket , " Keckley says .
The people who pay more tend to be in the upper income or have special , more complicated conditions .
Moore focuses on the private insurance companies and makes no mention of the U.S. government - funded health - care systems such as Medicare , Medicaid , the State Children 's Health Insurance Program and the Veterans Affairs health - care systems .
About 50 percent of all health - care dollars spent in the United States flows through these government systems .
" Sicko " also ignores a handful of good things about the American system .
Believe it or not , the United States does rank highest in the patient satisfaction category .
Americans do have shorter wait times than everyone but Germans when it comes to nonemergency elective surgery such as hip replacements , cataract removal or knee repair .
That 's no surprise given the number of U.S. specialists .
In U.S. medical schools , students training to become primary - care physicians have dwindled to 10 percent .
The overwhelming majority choose far more profitable specialties in the medical field .
In other countries , more than one out of three aspiring doctors chooses primary care in part because there 's less of an income gap with specialists .
In those nations , becoming a specialist means making 30 percent more than a primary - care physician .
In the United States , the gap is around 300 percent , according to Keckley .
As Americans continue to spend $ 2 trillion a year on health care , everyone agrees on one point :
Things need to change , and it will take more than a movie to figure out how to get there .

Craig 's quick condemnation shows hypocrisy in Senate GOP , critics say Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 30 , 2007
Print This Email This CREW wants Vitter , Stevens to be demoted as well Sen.
Larry Craig had not even publicly addressed charges he tried to solicit sex in a public men's room before members of his own party began to vehemently criticize his alleged conduct .
Less that 24 hours after he expressed regret for pleading guilty to disorderly conduct after an undercover cop said the Idaho Republican propositioned him , Craig was ousted from his committee posts in a decision Senate leaders said was " in the best interest " of the chamber .
Meanwhile , it has been 52 days since Craig 's GOP colleague David Vitter acknowledged the " serious sin " of soliciting a call girl , yet the Louisiana senator has not budged from his committee posts .
Where Craig faced condemnation , Vitter received words of encouragement from colleagues -- or at the very least , silence .
Sen .
Ted Stevens 's prominent position in the Senate also seems safe , despite the Alaska Republican 's own taint of scandal .
The FBI raided Stevens 's home last month in connection with a political corruption scandal in his home state .
Substantial renovations of the home were carried out by contractors hired by oil - services company Veco Corp. , whose executives have been accused of bribing state lawmakers .
" A disorderly conduct plea requires a member to give up his committee assignment , but a full - fledged bribery investigation does not , " observed Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
" Apparently , in the view of the Republican conference there is almost nothing more serious than a member attempting to engage in gay sex . "
The key distinction between Craig 's case and those of Stevens and Vitter , in the eyes of Republican leaders , is that Craig has been charged with and pleaded guilty to a crime , where the others have not , a leadership source tells RAW STORY .
CREW does not see things that way , and the private watchdog group has asked that Stevens and Vitter be stripped of their committee assignments .
Republican leaders already have asked the ethics committee to investigate Craig 's conduct , echoing an earlier call from CREW , but it is unlikely that Vitter or Craig will be demoted , the source said .
In Vitter 's case , the rendezvous with prostitutes he admitted to occurred before his 2004 election to the Senate and hence would fall outside the purview of the ethics committee .
As for Stevens , the most senior Republican in the chamber , he has insisted he is not a " target " of the FBI 's investigation and has not been accused of any crime .
Salon 's Glenn Greenwald outlines some other possible explanations for the different treatment of Craig 's and Vitter 's sexual escapades .
For one thing , Craig 's vacant seat would be filled by a Republican governor , whereas Vitter would be replaced by a Democrat , further tipping the balance of power in the Senate .
But Greenwald goes on to observe that attacks on gay Republicans have " no political cost " because they condemn none of the " values voters " upon which the party relies .
Conversely , heterosexual perversion , divorce , and out - of - wedlock childbirth are substantial problems , especially in the very regions of the country where Republican support is highest , so the party is unwilling to lead moral crusades against those sins , Greenwald argues .
" The only kind of ' morality ' that this movement knows or embraces is politically exploitative , cost - free morality , " he says .
" That is why the national Republican Party rails endlessly against homosexuality and is virtually mute about divorce and adultery : because anti-gay moralism costs virtually all of its supporters nothing ( since that is a moral prohibition that does not constrain them ) , while heterosexual moral deviations -- from divorce to adultery to sex outside of marriage -- are rampant among the Values Voters faithful and thus removed from the realm of condemnation . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Just when it appeared the U.S. economy would pick up steam after a year - long soft patch , the U.S. consumer is running out of gas .
The signs of stress are all around .
Prices are rising , but incomes and wealth are n't .
With most households already overburdened with debt , consumers are being squeezed .
There 's only one thing to do , even though it goes against every fiber of their being :
Cut back on expenses .
" Adrian Johns has written a fascinating , bold , and original book .
Neither as a reader , a writer , or a bookseller will I ever think simplistically about the nature of the book again . "
— Larry McMurtry
" A compelling exposition of how authors , printers , booksellers and readers competed for power over the printed page .
His examples are drawn from 17th - and 18th - century England , but the questions he raises regarding the relationship of trust between reader and book are valid for all time .
… The richness of Mr. Johns ' book lies in the splendid detail he has collected to describe the world of books in the first two centuries after the printing press arrived in England . …
Mr. Johns ' curiosity has led him into delightful and unexpected corners . "

Ten Things You Didn't Know about Your Books
by Adrian Johns
author of The Nature of the Book : Print and Knowledge in the Making
1 . Who invented printing ?
Given that printing is usually granted a key role in the emergence of modern society , its origins are oddly obscure .
Almost everyone believes that Johann Gutenberg , a goldsmith from the German town of Mainz , invented printing .
But while his existence has never been in doubt , everything else about Gutenberg is uncertain .
There is almost no evidence of his character and activities .
No book ever bore his name , and no one knows what he looked like .
This obscurity encouraged the emergence of about a dozen rival candidates for the title of inventor .
For centuries , even as printing made possible unprecedented progress in knowledge of all other kinds , its own origin remained both murky and controversial .
2 . The most remarkable candidate for the inventor of printing was Faust , the legendary sorcerer who sold his soul to Mephistopheles .
A simple confusion of names supported the tale : Gutenberg 's financier had been a banker named Fust , whose name in Latin became Faustus .
Connecting the printing press to magical powers proved irresistible and the story reappeared in countless forms — including scholarly histories , polemics , and even puppet - plays — throughout the Enlightenment .
3 . Early printers were craftsmen .
They did not feel compelled to reproduce an author 's copy slavishly letter by letter .
They were expected to use some creativity and interpret the words for their readers .
The idea was that they must preserve the good name of their printing house and its head , the master printer , by producing a well - crafted creation .
As a result , authors had to monitor the printing process personally if they wanted to control the final product .
Readers were — and are — well advised to do a little detective work before deciding how much of a given book can be properly attributed to its " author . "
4 . Typography wanted to be a science as well as an art .
Printed letters look as they do now partly because printers wished to make their craft into something more like philosophy , or even science .
Following the traditions of classical architecture and mathematics , they argued that typographers must make letters only from combinations of geometrical shapes — circles , squares , and regular polygons .
Over the years , they succeeded in standardizing the forms of letters .
The uniform appearance of the modern printed page rests on their efforts to restore an ancient aesthetics .
5 . Did a typo launch Oxford University Press ?
The most notorious misprint ever produced was committed in 1631 by the King of England 's official bible printer .
The seventh commandment appeared in print without the word " not , " becoming " Thou shalt commit adultery . "
In an age fearful of religious heresy and moral degeneracy , this so - called " wicked " bible was taken as bearing a seriously dangerous message , if not a deliberate one .
So , the printer had to pay an appropriately serious fine .
Pressing his advantage , the archbishop of Canterbury further compelled him to publish three texts in ancient Greek , to launch what he intended as an extensive publishing program in the classics .
The program was to be associated with Oxford University , and would issue works of specialized learning that the commercial market could not support .
The initiative was interrupted by the outbreak of civil war and the archbishop 's own execution as a traitor , but revived in 1660 when the war ended .
The relaunched project eventually became what is now Oxford University Press .
6 . These days we are discouraged from writing in books — whether they come from the library or from our own shelves .
But the practice was once a widely practiced part of reading , particularly for scholars .
They developed elaborate schemes of annotations , providing for commentary , cross-referencing , and rebuttal .
Now known as adversaria , books containing such jottings are regarded as invaluable testaments to readers ' thought processes in a distant age , and they are much sought after by historians .
7 . Printers and censors were not always opponents .
For the first two hundred and fifty years of printing history , printers supported government regulation of their product , the book .
They did so because such regulation preserved a stable commercial environment , which was necessary to the development of publishing .
The first country to eliminate government licensing of publications was England , which created a clamor when it did so in 1695 .
Because of the uproar , a legal replacement was put in place to restore the same sense of stability to the industry : it came to be called copyright .
8 . In the eighteenth century , " lascivious " or " obscene " books were among the most profitable of all .
In France , the " philosophical books " that fueled the Enlightenment included not only the works by Rousseau and Voltaire that we still recognize as philosophical , but many others that would now be labelled as outright pornography .
And in fact it was often difficult to draw a clear distinction between these two kinds of literature , least of all in terms of manufacturer .
The first printer known to have been arrested as part of a government - sponsored anti-porn crusade was Joseph Streater of London .
He was caught in 1688 , shortly after finishing work on the greatest book in the history of science , Isaac Newton 's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy .
9 . Piracy of intellectual property is not an invention of modern society .
Long before software hackers , third - world CD factories , and cyberpunk authors , the first pirates set up shop shortly after the invention of the printing press .
By around 1525 , Martin Luther could already find that the unauthorised versions of his German Bible were being turned out at a rate ninety times that achieved by his own printers .
Piracy pervaded the world of print , making any book difficult to trust .
Copyright was developed largely to discriminate piracy from authorized publishing , and to criminalize the rampant copying .
10 .
What is reading anyway ?
Descriptions of the experience of reading — the physiological and psychological processes — vary from time to time .
In the Renaissance , physicians and philosophers appealed to magic , theology , and anatomy to explain the effects of reading .
Nowadays we have recourse to psychology .
Either way , the explanations reach to the deepest recesses of the psyche .
We cannot simply assume , when we sit down to read , that we are replicating the responses of men , women , and children in the past .
Keep that in mind as you read a literary classic .
Straight out of college , the two went into BPOs ( Business Process Outsourcing ) because they could earn more money faster than in any other industry .
Their starting monthly salary was 10,000 rupees , a little under US $ 300 .
Every three months they stayed on the job , monthly pay grew by 3,000 rupees .
There ’s a big incentive to start young and hang out as long as you can stand it .
The average call center employee is 22 .
And it does n't take too long to rise through the ranks .
In about seven years one of 60 callers can realistically become one of four managers .
Twenty minutes from the center of Chennai , down a narrow ally on the second floor of an old yellowing building , the Call Center InfoSearch buzzes and the phones never stop .
Sixty English - speaking employees call Australia in the morning , England in the afternoon , and America all night .
Chennai -
We ’ve all talked to “ Jennifer , ” the girl who calls you up on Saturday afternoons trying to offload a Direct TV subscription , or " Alan " who answers the tech support line when your HP printer busts again .
Ever wondered who these people really are and what they think of you ?
It 's a tough life .
They stay up ten hours a night calling Americans , who are generally annoyed .
They only get a few scattered five - minute breaks to rush to the bathroom , and then return to their desks to discover another 50 calls blinking on their service queue .
“ We hate phones , ” Vimesh says .
They complain of back , neck and stomach pain , partly caused by hunching over a computer , and partly caused by irregular sleeping patterns .
In the summer , it 's tough to sleep during the intense heat of the daytime .
“ It ’s not simple working in a call center , ” says Saravama .
Talking to the Americans , I ’m told , is the good part of the job .
Sure , there ’s some abuse now and then , but thankfully most Americans save these callers time by “ hanging up right away if they ’re not interested , ” rather than lingering on the line .
" I 'm proud of talking to Americans ; I can sell them anything , " a 22 - year - old call center employee named Rakesh Kumar tells me .
He lives with his parents and spends the bulk of his salary on designer clothes , clubs , and music electronics .
He would love to see America , but the goods will have to do for now .
It 's all about " building rapport " with American callers , they tell me .
The key to the sell is not just the product , but the personal connection .
So they always ask first how their potential customer is doing and " how the weather is , " as they ’re taught in a week of " U.S. Culture Training . "
Vimesh is so successful at this that some elderly people tell him they wait for his calls .
He wishes he could call them more often , but their phones are run by a machine that automates whose number gets dialed and when .
On top of this , they are n't supposed to be on any one call for more than 5 minutes .
They have to make their friends fast .
Speed is of the essence .
These callers need to make 30 sales a month , one per day .
They dial 700 numbers each day to accomplish this .
Machines answer 300 of those calls .
200 people just hang up .
195 say their parents or the homeowners are gone .
Of the remaining 5 , only one pulls through .
Lots of talk .
Little love .
Yet these men embrace their proximity to America , the land of opportunity .
The same things that drew them to the call center life -- the ability to rise through the ranks fast based on merit ( sales ) -- also attract them to America .
Vimesh and Saravama both see America as a place where “ money flows " without getting trapped in the hands of a few corrupt elite -- at least better than in India .
Vimesh tells me , “ it 's a place where rules must be obeyed ” and no one is beyond the law .
In Chennai , they complain , the rich stay rich because they break the law and horde wealth .
Spread the wealth .
That ’s their motto .
But some Americans resent just that : spreading their jobs overseas .
I ask Vimesh and Saravama what they think of objections to outsourcing .
Vimesh 's response is : these are “ American companies ” and “ American customers ” so “ why should n’t they benefit ? ” Saravama adds , “ We say the customer is god for us because they pay for our product .
If they buy a product , normally we ’re going to get benefit .
The company will benefit .
Everyone will benefit . ”
Others may debate the political implications of their work .
But at the end of the day , as Saravama says , " It 's our job . "
The elusive rabbit is rarely captured on camera
The Sumatran striped rabbit was photographed in late January on the Indonesian island of Sumatra , the Wildlife Conservation Society said .
The species is listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union , due to loss of habitat .
The rabbit was previously photographed in 2000 , with the last sighting by a scientist back in 1972 .
Habitat risk
The 30 cm - long rabbit was photographed by a camera trap in Bukit Barisan National Park , said Colin Poole , director of the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Asia Program .
The sighting also highlighted the need to protect the habitat of the species , also known as Nesolagus netscheri , from threats such as farming , he said .
" This rabbit is so poorly known that any proof of its continued existence at all is great news , and confirms the conservation importance of Sumatra 's forests , " Mr Poole said .
Back in 1999 , researchers discovered another species of striped rabbit in the Annamite Mountains between Laos and Vietnam , and named it the Annamite striped rabbit .
Genetic samples revealed the species were distinct , though closely related , most likely diverging about 8 million years ago .
WASHINGTON — The Bush administration says that its zero - tolerance policy against terrorism applies to all suspected evildoers , not just Muslims , and that its zero - tolerance policy against Cuba is a principled position , not just an exercise in pandering to the implacable anti-Castro exiles in Miami .
On both counts , evidence suggests otherwise .
The fact is that Luis Posada Carriles , an accused terrorist who entered the United States illegally and was taken into custody by authorities , is not being kept in solitary confinement and dragged out for occasional waterboarding .
As of this writing , he is a free man .
Posada , 79 , has a long history of violent opposition to Fidel Castro ’s regime .
He was accused of masterminding the 1976 midair bombing of a civilian Cuban airliner , a terrorist act that killed 73 innocent people .
He is also suspected of involvement in a 1997 series of bombings of Havana hotels and nightclubs ; several people were injured and an Italian tourist was killed .
Terrorism , our government constantly reminds us , is the scourge of our times .
So why is a man described by our government as “ an unrepentant criminal and admitted mastermind of terrorist plots and attacks on tourist sites ” looking forward to a hero ’s welcome in Miami from his old Bay of Pigs comrades ?
Posada sneaked into the country in 2005 , and had the temerity to advertise his presence by giving a news conference .
After some dithering , Homeland Security officials took him into custody .
He was indicted in January on federal charges of immigration fraud for lying about how he entered the United States .
On Tuesday , in El Paso , Texas — where Posada had been held — U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone dismissed the indictment against Posada , saying the government had resorted to unconstitutional “ trickery ” in gathering its evidence against him .
It was Cardone ’s dismissal order that set Posada free .
Cardone found that in Posada ’s formal immigration interview after the feds whisked him away in 2005 , the government failed to provide adequate translation of the questions and answers .
What the government contended were lies about how Posada had made his way into the United States looked more like misunderstandings , Cardone concluded .
It ’s worth pointing out that this is n’t the first time Posada has used his allegedly poor command of English as an excuse :
He claims he did n’t understand what he was saying years ago when he boasted to a reporter of his role in the Havana bombings .
So , was the judge snookered into letting a hardened terrorist walk on a technicality ?
Not really .
It ’s more the case that the judge refused to play along .
Cardone ’s point was that if the government really wanted to keep Posada behind bars because he was a career terrorist , then prosecutors should have prosecuted him as a terrorist .
Then , faster than you can say “ Patriot Act , ” authorities could have made him disappear into the netherworld of indefinite detention where terrorist suspects named Muhammad are kept .
I ’ll wager that the evidence against Posada , which I find compelling , is more solid than the secret evidence against most of the detainees at Guantanamo .
But Posada ’s alleged crimes were against the Castro regime .
George W. Bush ’s stance toward Cuba has been even more hardheaded and counterproductive than the policies of his predecessors .
This administration has tightened the travel ban , increased economic pressure and made a show of planning for a post - Castro Cuba .
Meanwhile , Castro ( apparently recovering slowly from intestinal surgery ) and his brother Raul are as firmly in power as ever .
The administration ’s hard - line tactics have accomplished less than nothing — in Cuba , at least .
The zero - tolerance policy toward the Castro government has been popular , however , among the most strident exiles in Florida — the old men who will greet Posada when he comes home to Miami and a comfortable retirement .
A grand jury in New Jersey reportedly is investigating Posada ’s alleged involvement in the Havana hotel bombings , and it ’s possible that he will someday face a new indictment .
Meanwhile , our government has given Castro another cause celebre for billboards and demonstrations .
The administration is about to increase funding for its broadcasts into Cuba , even though they are seen and heard by few Cubans because Castro ’s people have gotten so good at jamming them .
The message is that the United States opposes the Castro regime but offers a hand of friendship to the Cuban people .
That ’s a tough idea to sell when our government wo n’t call a terrorist a terrorist — and when a bitter old man who likely has killed scores of Cuban civilians is allowed to walk free .

In the meantime , the election is over , and a small , cynical , part of my mind wonders how long it will be before we start adding more oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Last year 's Energy Policy
Act authorized increasing the size of the reserve to 1 billion barrels .
The current reserve is made up of 273.5 million bbls of sweet and 415 million bbls of sour , for a total of 688.5 million , as of November 3rd .
However , over the past few months there has been very little activity .
The reserve had been filled to its initial target of 700 million barrels by August 2005 , but then , following Katrina there was a period where it proved its intended value :
Dear Me !
There has been a considerable stir in the TOD house , since CERA have just come out with a report restating their position that there is no Peak Oil Problem .
For a mere $ 1,000 you may discover ( perhaps ) what is new since the last time they said this .
Now we have commented about problems with the CERA position on a number of occasions ( try one four and five for a start ) .
But since it is better to do a little checking first , it may take a little time to go through and see exactly what is different this time around , if anything .
On August 27 , 2005 , Hurricane Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico and began a path of destruction that caused massive damage to production platforms , terminals , pipelines , and refineries in states along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
Because of the severe disruption to petroleum supplies , Secretary Bodman immediately approved six requests for emergency loans of crude oil from the SPR and President Bush directed that a drawdown and sale of crude oil be conducted .
Ultimately , 9.8 million barrels were loaned and 11 million barrels were sold .
Because the loaned oil is repaid with similar quality oil , plus a negotiated volume of premium barrels , 10.3 million barrels were scheduled to be repaid .
By late Spring 2006 , repayment of 8.6 million barrels had been completed .
However , delivery of the remaining 1.7 million barrels was deferred at the President 's direction as part of his Four Part Plan to Confront High Gasoline Prices .
The final 1.7 million barrels will be delivered during Spring 2007 .
The President has directed the Department of Energy to defer filling the Reserve this summer .
Our Strategic Reserve is sufficiently large to guard against any major supply disruption over the next few months .
Deferring deposits until the fall will leave a little more oil on the market - and when supplies are tight , every little bit counts .
One can thus anticipate , that purchase coming in the spring .
However , in the President 's message in April , the deferral of purchases was meant only to be temporary .
The example of Katrina provides a justification for the SPR's , and this has , perhaps , not been lost on the Chinese , who have suffered a more - than - normally - vicious typhoon season this past year , including Saomai and Prapiroon .
They had initially planned to start filling their SPR about this time last year , but hesitated because of concerns that the price was high and that buying for the reserve would drive prices up further .
They have obviously now changed their minds , and have been buying for over a month , but the size of the reserve anticipated may now be considered too small .
The current size is sufficient for about 7 days , though this is projected to increase to 10 days .
China 's first batch of the four strategic petroleum reserve bases are designed to be in Zhenhai ( Ningbo of Zhejiang Province ) , Huangdao ( Qingdao of Shandong Province ) , Daishan ( Zhoushou of Zhejiang Province ) and Dalian ( Dalian of Liaoning Province ) .
The other three reserve bases are expected to be completed by 2008 .
By then , they will form a total petroleum strategic reserve capacity for consumption of more than ten days .
A second set of sites is now in process of being identified .
Now that the current sites are being filled , there remains the issue of price ,
The Ministry of Commerce issued the statistics on increase of major import commodities of China in the first half .
Of them , import volume of crude oil increased 15.6 % year on year , and the value surged 53.9 % ; while import volume of oil products went up 16.1 % , and the value up 71.8 % .
According to the latest statistics from the General Administration of Customs , the average price of import of crude oil was 452.9 US dollars / ton in the first half , up 33 % year on year , and the average price of imported oil products was 423.3 US dollars / ton , up 48 % .
As the second biggest oil consumer in the country , China 's dependence on import of oil products is 40 % .
Prices of oil , as a basic energy , have influenced the prices of the whole industrial sector , and will finally affect the GDP growth .
A second batch of tanks at China 's second reserve site in Zhejiang province should be ready by the end of the year , a newspaper reported on Monday .
More tanks are also planned for Qingdao in Shandong province and Dalian in Liaoning province as part of a first phase of a reserve plan , due for completion in 2008 , that will have a total capacity of 16.2 million cubic metres ( 102 million barrels ) -- or about a month of imports at current rates .
Oil traders fear China will have to increase imports by as much as 100,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in order to fill the reserves .
That would be a relatively small volume in global terms but represent a 3.4 percent rise from current imports .
But the fact that China is now pressing ahead suggests that they might be recognizing that , as the supply volumes shorten , there might not be a time when the price is cheaper than now .
Their current source is apparently Russian oil , with some 3 million bbl already stored , about 10 % of that available .
It is expected that they will have another 4.4 million bbl in storage by mid-December .
There will be additional space available in the beginning of the year .
The actual rates at which the SPR is filled is giving rise to some concern .
There is also some worry that the Chinese will use their reserve in a more commercial manner .
But this is where my opening question regains a bit of relevance , since if the US starts to fill it 's SPR at 100,000 bd , and the Chinese start filling theirs at 100,000 bd , and this is added to current incremental growth in demand , and the change in purchasing practices of those nations now in depletion , then the drivers to higher gas prices may already be falling into place .
It is also worth noting that the Chinese are getting their additional oil from Russia , and that they are paying for it from their dollar reserves .
This leads on into questions about Russian exports , but that would get us into another lengthy story , that is better left to another day .
In similar fashion the CERA inability to distinguish between what they call reserves , which includes
Those who believe a peak is imminent tend to consider only proven remaining reserves of conventional oil , which they currently estimate at about 1.2 trillion barrels .
In the view of many petroleum geologists , this is a pessimistic estimate because it excludes the enormous contribution likely from probable and possible resources , those yet to be found , and plays down the importance of unconventional reserves in the Canadian oil sands , the Orinoco tar belt , oil shale and GTL projects .
CERA believes the global inventory is some 4.8 trillion barrels , of which about 1.08 trillion barrels have been produced , leaving 3.72 trillion conventional and unconventional barrels , an order of magnitude that will allow productive capacity to continue to expand well into this century
and their reliance on un-named new technologies , also requires a much lengthier rebuttal - although it will largely be a repeat , as their press release and report appears to be , of ground that has been plowed before .
Well , I am sure that we will return to this again , before long .

Scientific opinion is divided on the impact of Chernobyl on wildlife
Recent studies said rare species had thrived despite raised radiation levels as a result of no human activity .
But scientists who assessed the 1986 disaster 's impact on birds said the ecological effects were " considerably greater than previously assumed " .
The findings appear in the Royal Society 's journal , Biology Letters .
In April 1986 , reactor number four at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded .
After the accident , traces of radioactive deposits were found in nearly every country in the northern hemisphere .
The paper 's authors , Anders Moller of University Pierre and Marie Curie , France , and Tim Mousseau from the University of South Carolina , US , said their research did not support the idea that low - level radiation was not affecting animals .
" Recent conclusions from the UN Chernobyl Forum and reports in the popular media concerning the effects of radiation from Chernobyl has left the impression that the exclusion zone is a thriving ecosystem , filled with an increasing number of rare species , " they wrote .
Instead , they added : " Species richness , abundance and population density of breeding birds decreased with increasing levels of radiation . "
The study , which recorded 1,570 birds from 57 species , found that the number of birds in the most contaminated areas declined by 66 % compared with sites that had normal background radiation levels .
It also reported a decline of more than 50 % in the range of species as radiation levels increase .

The findings build on a previous study of barn swallows in the affected area , which showed that the number of the birds declined sharply in contaminated areas .
The birds ' decline was probably the result of depressed levels of antioxidants after its long migration back to the area , making it more vulnerable to the low - level radiation , the researchers concluded .
" It suggests to us that barn swallows are not alone ; there are many other species that appear to be affected in a similar way , " Professor Mousseau told BBC News .
" This paper also suggests that birds feeding on insects that are living in the upper surface of the soil , where contaminates are highest , seem to be most likely to be missing or depressed . "
He added that they were currently carrying out research to find out whether the decline was a result of the birds eating contaminated insects , or whether it was a result of fewer insects living in affected areas .
" We are also looking for funding to expand the range of ecological studies to include invertebrates , as well as plants and animals . "
Radioactive retreat
A recent paper published in the American Scientist magazine suggested that plants and animals were better off in the exclusion zone than specimens outside the 30 km radius surrounding the site of the destroyed nuclear reactor .
One of the paper 's co-authors , Robert Baker from the Texas Tech University , said that the benefits for wildlife from the lack of human activity outweighed the risks of low - level radiation .
Writing on his university web page , Professor Baker said : " The elimination of human activities such as farming , ranching , hunting and logging are the greatest benefits .
" It can be said that the world 's worst nuclear power plant disaster is not as destructive to wildlife populations as are normal human activities . "
Professor Mousseau acknowledged Professor Baker 's description : " It is true that the Chernobyl region gives the appearance of a thriving ecosystem because of its protection from other human activities .
" However , when you do controlled ecological studies , what we see is a very clear signature of negative effects of contamination on diversity and abundance of organisms .
" We clearly need to be applying scientific method to ecological studies before we can conclude , based on anecdotal observations , that there are no consequences . "
Surmounting several distinct hurdles to quantum computing , physicists at Harvard University have found that individual carbon - 13 atoms in a diamond lattice can be manipulated with extraordinary precision to create stable quantum mechanical memory and a small quantum processor , also known as a quantum register , operating at room temperature .
The finding brings the futuristic technology of quantum information systems into the realm of solid - state materials under ordinary conditions .
The results , described this week in Science , could revolutionize scientists ’ approach to quantum computing , which is built on the profound eccentricity of quantum mechanics and could someday far outperform conventional supercomputers in solving certain problems .
“ These experiments lay the groundwork for development of a new approach to quantum information systems , ” says Mikhail D. Lukin , professor of physics in Harvard ’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences .
Earlier advances in quantum computing have occurred inside high vacuums cooled to fractions of a degree above absolute zero .
Individual quantum bits , or qubits — the building blocks of a quantum computer , encoding information much as a conventional computer bit stores information as zeroes and ones — are extremely fragile .
Usually they decay very rapidly , losing quantum information within a tiny fraction of a second unless the qubit is suspended in high vacuum under these specialized , extreme conditions .
This short “ coherence time ” has been a major impediment to advances in quantum computing .
Quantum mechanics dictates that coherence is destroyed — and quantum information lost — through contact with virtually anything , which is why previous attempts at quantum computing have occurred under such extreme circumstances .
This need for absolute isolation has vexed scientists for more than a decade , not only because it is difficult to achieve experimentally — not to mention in a practical computer — but because it has complicated the ability to manipulate a quantum computer ’s input or read its output .
The new advance makes use of spinning properties of atomic nuclei , fundamental building blocks of matter with sub- nanometer dimensions , to encode quantum bits .
Acting as tiny magnets , such nuclear spins are well known for their exceptional stability .
But in practice the very weak interactions of nuclear spins with their surroundings — the very reason for their near - perfect isolation — means that it is essentially impossible to address and manipulate individual nuclei , and harder still to control interactions between them .
For instance , many billions of nuclei are required in conventional MRI machines , which work by detecting signals from spinning nuclei .
“ The problem is , what makes single nuclear spin so stable — its weak interaction with its surroundings — also prevents us from directly manipulating it , ” Lukin says .
“ How do you control something that ca n’t interact with anything ” ”
You do it gingerly and indirectly , the Harvard physicists report in Science .
They found that nuclear spins associated with single atoms of carbon - 13 — which make up some 1.1 percent of natural diamond — can be manipulated via a nearby single electron whose own spin can be controlled with optical and microwave radiation .
The excitation of an electron by focusing laser light on a nitrogen vacancy center , a stable defect in a diamond lattice where nitrogen replaces an atom of carbon and develops an electronic spin in its ground state , causes the single electron ’s spin to act as a very sensitive magnetic probe with extraordinary spatial resolution .
Using the nitrogen center as an intermediary , a single carbon - 13 atom ’s nuclear spin is cooled to near absolute zero , creating in the process a single , isolated quantum bit with a coherence time that approaches seconds .
The controlled interaction between the electron and nuclear spins allows the latter to be used as very robust quantum memory .
The Harvard physicists also observed and manipulated coupling between individual nuclear spins , thus demonstrating a way to increase the number of qubits working in the quantum register .
Because the electron spin and nuclear spin are controlled independently , the experiments lay the groundwork for development of larger , scalable systems in which such quantum registers are connected via optical photons .
“ Beyond specific applications in quantum information science , ” the authors write , “ our measurements show that the electron spin can be used as a sensitive local magnetic probe that allows for a remarkable degree of control over individual nuclear spins . ”

When israel ’s education ministry announced that history textbooks for third - graders would now include a heretofore unmentionable truth -- that the creation of a homeland for Jews in 1948 resulted in the exile of 700,000 Palestinians -- it seemed an enlightened step .
“ History is written by the victors , ” as Winston Churchill said , and for the last 59 years , Israeli elementary school textbooks have taught only the Jewish version of events :
The outcome of the Arab - Israeli war was justifiable because of Jews ’ historic roots in the Holy Land and their need for a permanent refuge from persecution .
The Palestinian exodus from Israel , called the Nakba ( catastrophe ) by Arabs , was nowhere to be found .
The education ministry ’s apparent openness , however , is deceptive .
For the new , balanced textbooks will be printed only in Arabic and distributed only to Arab classrooms .
Hebrew editions of “ Living Together in Israel ” wo n’t be revised .
Some education officials sought to amend Jews ’ textbooks too , but they were overruled by those who said Jewish third - graders cannot understand divergent interpretations of history .
Education Minister Yuli Tamir says the new books will help Arab children reconcile the history they learn at home with the history they are taught in school .
But Jewish children , who are less likely to hear the Palestinian version of events in their homes , need this information even more than their Arab peers , who at least may have the personal experiences of family and friends to educate them .
If Israel acknowledges the fact of the Palestinian exodus , then it should be taught to all children .
Instead , the ministry seeks to placate Palestinians without standing up to hard - line Jewish conservatives , who oppose the revisions even for Arab classrooms .
History is continually being revised .
Although written first by the victors , over time the voices of the defeated and disregarded demand inclusion .
China and Korea insist that Japan acknowledge wartime atrocities ; Native Americans , that their 4,000 - year history become a part of this country ’s founding narrative ; and women , that their deeds get equal scrutiny with those of men .
Whether most Palestinians fled their homes voluntarily or through coercion and force , and whether they have a right to return , will likely be argued until the end of time .
But that thousands did flee and have spent subsequent decades living in refugee camps -- the United Nations says that descendants have swelled the number of refugees to 4 million today -- is not at issue .
Why not teach that truth ?
By amending history textbooks for Arab children , Israel has acknowledged the validity of the Nakba .
And if it ’s valid for Arabs , it should be valid for Jews as well .

Mary Swenson struggled to finish her doctorate at Capella University .
So when she found Sharon Bender , it seemed a saving grace .
A Capella business professor , Bender took an interest in Swenson ’s management research , even suggesting they team up on a book , Swenson said .
Instead , she charges , her mentor began lifting her work .
Swenson said she discovered “ thinly veiled ” versions of her own writing on Bender ’s Web site and said that , when confronted , her mentor claimed she deserved some credit herself .
Bender said Swenson ’s claims are not true – and said it was Swenson who co-opted her ideas .
Passing off someone ’s work as your own is a cardinal sin in college research .
Students can be expelled .
Professional reputations can be wrecked .
While student plagiarism grabs headlines , allegations against teachers happen more than people realize , experts say .
Because students rarely fight back , most accusations fade in the grumbling over beers after class .
This time , though , the student is suing .
Scheduled for trial this summer in Anoka County , Swenson ’s lawsuit against Bender may offer an unvarnished look at who controls ideas in the give - and - take of college research .
It also may open a window on the complex ties between teachers and students who need a mentor ’s help and influence – and who understand they are unlikely to get the benefit of the doubt .
“ I ’ve rarely seen stories of this type , ” said Tim Dodd , director of the Center for Academic Integrity at Duke University , an organization of college students , faculty and administrators across the country that tracks plagiarism issues .
Dodd said he regularly fields calls from students who believe their research has been taken by a professor .
There ’s no good data but “ pretty regular anecdotal evidence ” of these conflicts , said Dodd , who recalled his own work being taken as a graduate student .
“ I just put my tail between my legs , ” he said .
“ I never confronted the professor . ”
Swenson , 46 , did n’t expect confrontation in 2000 when she signed up at Capella , a for - profit , online university based in Minneapolis .
Already a consultant based in Ham Lake , she liked the flexible scheduling she could have online .
Capella offered a doctoral program in organizational psychology ; the school said it was seeking accreditation from the American Psychological Association .
It all seemed to fit nicely .
( Capella has not received the accreditation . )
Swenson earned top grades in her courses while working on her dissertation , the book - length manuscript of original research required of doctoral candidates at any university .
Her research focused largely on women who transform into leaders during a crisis .
By examining their traits and personalities , Swenson hoped to create a way for businesses to train employees to solve problems , make decisions and resolve conflicts in an organization before they spin into crises .
It was potentially a “ multi-million - dollar ” management idea , she felt .
Inside Capella , however , she was stuck in her own organizational battles .
She clashed with faculty on her thesis , fighting over editing and research methods .
When Bender agreed to be her mentor , it seemed a good match .
She ’d never taught Swenson but had done research on female entrepreneurs .
And she also had received her doctorate from Capella .
They never met face to face .
Bender lived in New Jersey and communicated with Swenson online and by phone .
Swenson said the model she built drew on the personal , professional and community experiences of women who had grown to be leaders .
She found they were excellent communicators and motivators and managed situations well – they were people who connected with their “ minds , hearts and souls . ”
She even gave the model a hip name – Power Chip .
“ There is a lot going for this model and its application to provide life solutions .
Cool ! ” Bender wrote in an e-mail provided by Swenson .
With the right publisher and marketing , the model might catch fire .
It had the potential , Bender told Swenson in the e-mail , to be bigger than management guru Stephen Covey ’s “ Seven Habits of Highly Effective People . ”
By late 2004 , however , the relationship had disintegrated .
Reading Bender ’s business
Web site , Swenson said she saw her mentor using the model .
Initial versions had Bender and Swenson sharing credit .
Swenson said it still bothered her because her unpublished work was being made available free online .
Then , claims Swenson , her name was dropped .
Swenson said when she called Bender on it , Bender said she deserved some credit because of her efforts guiding Swenson through the process and for contributions she provided on some of the procedural work .
Bender said none of the allegations is true .
“ I stuck my neck out at the university … to absolutely help her ” finish her doctorate , Bender said .
“ She ’s using the slides that I created , ” Bender added .
“ All she did was move words around .
She plagiarized the template that I produced . ”
The terminology that Swenson claims Bender took from her is found regularly in the “ performance - improvement field , ” Bender added .
“ I kept on saying to her : ‘ This stuff is not new ; it ’s how we do it .
We have to be on the same page . ’
She went off and did her own thing on it . ”
Capella ’s written guidelines to students on academic honesty warn that “ not giving proper credit to your sources is considered plagiarism , which can have serious consequences , including suspension or even expulsion from the university , ” while plagiarism can be avoided by “ properly acknowledging your sources . ”
Swenson said she can prove the ideas were hers first .
She applied for a patent on The Power Chip model while writing her thesis , and a basic patent was granted in July .
Bender said she is challenging the patent .
Dodd said the case is particularly unusual because Capella is an online university , with a New Jersey professor working with a Minnesota student .
Typically in disagreements at traditional universities , students and professors can meet face to face and talk through the dispute , he said .
If the disagreement continues , a department chair or dean might intervene or an office of research misconduct might investigate , Dodd added .
Capella is not a party in the suit and declined substantial comment , citing student privacy .
The university said that it is aware of the case and provided information when requested , but that resolution “ is in the province of the court . ”
But in an April 2006 letter , provided by Swenson , a Capella attorney told her she was the problem , noting she was the only psychology student ever to fail her dissertation at Capella and pointing out she failed twice .
The letter also warned that Swenson ’s “ continual actions in placing blame on others , including claims that everyone from her editor to her mentor to members of the ( doctoral ) committee changed her work , raise serious issues of academic integrity . ”
Bender received her doctorate from Capella in 2000 , a few months after Swenson enrolled and four years after finishing her associate ’s degree at Thomas Edison State College in New Jersey .
She ’s no longer with Capella and now serves as a part - time administrator at Aspen University , an online school .
Bender ’s business
Web site includes a variation of the “ heart , mind , soul ” model Swenson said is hers .
It ’s on a Web page titled “ inventions , ” although in a disclaimer , Bender cautions , “ Content at this site is not warranted as being fit for a particular use .
Your use is at your own discretion , risk and responsibility … consider this site as you would Wikipedia or other evolving site of content . ”
Swenson estimates she ’s spent about $ 60,000 at Capella for a doctorate she still does n’t have .
“ My degree , ” she said , “ has now become a bargaining chip . ”

If you or I knowingly funneled $ 1.7 million to one of the worst , and best known , terrorist organizations in the world , we'd be sent to Guantanamo permanently .
But when it's the senior management of Chiquita Banana , the Bush administration gives them a fine .
A fine .
Some war on terror we 're running .
We 'll throw grandma in Cuba just for being Muslim , but if you 're a corporate executive who knew what you were doing , and knew it was wrong ( their own lawyers told them not to do it ) , the Bush Justice Department gives you a slap on the wrist .
Great message to be sending our troops , and every country on earth .
Terrorism is bad , unless you 're a big corporate friend of Bush .
Then , not so bad .
One of the groups Chiquita funded was the terrorist group FARC in Colombia .
Let me give you a quick look at who FARC is .
From the Council on Foreign Relations :
FARC is responsible for most of the ransom kidnappings in Colombia ; the group targets wealthy landowners , foreign tourists , and prominent international and domestic officials .
FARC stepped up terrorist activities against infrastructure in cities before Colombia ’s May 2002 presidential election .
Recent FARC operations include :
* the November 2005 kidnapping of sixty people , who are currently being held hostage by FARC , until the government decided to release hundreds of their comrades serving prison sentences .
Former presidential candidate , Ingrid Betancourt — who was kidnapped in 2002 — is among the hostages ;
* the February 2002 hijacking of a domestic commercial flight and kidnapping of a Colombian senator on board ;
* the February 2002 kidnapping of a presidential candidate , Ingrid Betancourt , who was traveling in guerrilla territory ;
* the October 2001 kidnapping and assassination of a former Colombian minister of culture ; and
* the March 1999 murder of three American missionaries working in Colombia , which resulted in a U.S. indictment of FARC and six of its members in April 2002 .

Gigantic Jets Over Oklahoma
Credit : Richard Smedley
Explanation :
Have you ever seen a gigantic jet ?
They are extremely rare but tremendously powerful .
Gigantic jets are a newly discovered type of lightning discharge between some thunderstorms and the Earth 's ionosphere high above them .
Pictured above is one such jet caught by accident by a meteor camera in Oklahoma , USA .
The gigantic jet , at the lower left , traversed perhaps 70 kilometers in just under one second .
Clicking on the image will bring up a movie in many browsers , also visible here .
Gigantic jets are much different from regular cloud - to - cloud and cloud - to - ground lightning .
The bottoms of gigantic jets appear similar in appearance to another type cloud - to - ionosphere strike called blue jets , while the tops appear similar to upper - atmosphere red sprites .
Although the mechanism and trigger that causes gigantic jets is a topic of research , it is clear that the jets reduce charge imbalance between different parts of Earth 's atmosphere .
A good way to look for gigantic jets is to watch a powerful but distant thunderstorm from a clear location .
The conservative movement that for a generation has been the source of the Republican Party 's strength is in the dumps
Illustration by Kevin Kallaugher
THIRTY years ago Eric Hobsbawm , the dean of Marxist historians , chose as his subject , for the Marx memorial lecture , “ The forward march of labour halted ? ”
Things turned out even worse , for his side , than he had expected , thanks in part to the rise of a very American brand of conservatism .
But are we now witnessing Mr Hobsbawm 's revenge : the forward march of American conservatism halted ?
The right has dominated American politics since at least 1980 .
The Republicans ' electoral successes have been striking : five out of seven presidential elections since 1980 and a dramatic seizure of the House in 1994 after 40 years of Democratic rule .
Even more striking has been the right 's success in making the political weather .
The Republican Party is only the most visible part of the American right .
The right 's hidden strength lies in its conservative base .
America is almost unique in possessing a vibrant conservative movement .
Every state boasts organisations fighting in favour of guns and against taxes and abortion .
The Christian right can call upon megachurches and Evangelical colleges .
Conservatives have also created a formidable counter - establishment of think - tanks and pressure groups .
And many Americans who are not members of the movement happily embrace the label “ conservative ” .
They think of themselves as God-fearing patriots who dislike big government and are tough on crime and national security .
In 2004 roughly a third of the voters identified themselves as conservatives ; just over 20 % identified themselves as “ liberal ” ( as American left - wingers are somewhat strangely called ) .
Conservatives have driven the policy debate on everything from crime to welfare to foreign policy .
Yet today this mighty movement is in deep trouble .
Veteran activists are sunk in gloom ( “ I 've never seen conservatives so downright fed up , ” says Richard Viguerie , a conservative stalwart ) .
And the other side is cock - a- hoop .
Stanley Greenberg , a Democratic pollster , describes the shift from conservatism as “ breathtaking ” .
The Democrats are well positioned to retake the White House in 2008 .
True , the Republican front - runner , Rudy Giuliani , a “ big tent ” Republican who combines liberal views on abortion and gay marriage with stellar credentials as “ America 's mayor ” , is a strong candidate .
The Democratic front - runner , Hillary Clinton , suffers from high negatives and a scandal - prone husband .
But the Clinton operation looks far more professional than Mr Giuliani's — and he has plenty of scandals of his own .
Overall , the Democrats are much more confident : 40 % of Republicans believe that the Democrats will win , but just 12 % of Democrats believe that the Republicans will win .
They are more motivated : in the second quarter the two leading Democrats raised $ 60 m , against just $ 32 m for the two leading Republicans .
And 61 % of Democratic primary voters are happy with their choice of candidates , compared with only 36 % of Republicans .
Generic polls show voters expressing a preference for a Democratic president by a 24 - point margin , a gap unheard of since the Watergate era .
The Democrats are also likely to keep Congress .
The tide that enabled the party to pick up 31 House seats and six Senate seats in 2006 , along with six governorships and 321 state - legislature seats , is still swelling .
The Republicans will be defending more vulnerable Senate seats than the Democrats in 2008 , and they are losing the race for cash .
The public favours Democratic control of Congress by a margin of 10 - 15 points .
Off the record , Republicans use words like “ catastrophe ” and “ Armageddon ” to refer to 2008 .
The issues that people care about are also tipping the Democrats ' way .
A Pew Research poll in March discovered growing worry about income inequality combined with growing support for the social safety net .
The proportion of Americans who believe that “ the government should help the needy even if it means greater debt ” has risen from 41 % in 1994 , at the height of the Republican revolution , to 54 % today .
The poll also revealed a decline in support for the things that drove the Republican resurgence in the mid-1990s , such as traditional moral values .
Infographics
In 2002 the electorate was equally divided between Democrats and Democratic - leaners ( 43 % ) and Republicans and Republican - leaners ( 43 % ) .
Today only 35 % align themselves with Republicans , and 50 % with Democrats .
The Republicans are doing particularly badly among independents ( the fastest - growing group in the electorate ) and younger voters .
The proportion of 18 - 25 - year - olds who identify with the Republican Party has declined from 55 % in 1991 to 35 % in 2006 , according to Pew .
Tony Fabrizio , a Republican pollster , notes that the share of Republican voters aged 55 and over has increased from 28 % in 1997 to 41 % today , whereas the share aged 18 - 34 has fallen from 25 % to 17 % .
No wonder Ken Mehlman , a former Republican Party chairman who oversaw George Bush 's 2004 victory , is now advising hedge funds on how to deal with a Democratic - leaning America .
The Republicans have alienated America 's fastest - growing electoral block — Hispanics — with their visceral opposition to immigration reform .
Nearly 70 % of Hispanics voted Democratic in House races in 2006 , up from 55 % in 2004 .
That trend is sure to have been solidified by the Republicans ' recent scuppering of the McCain - Kennedy immigration bill , in a revolt sodden with xenophobia .
Lyndon Johnson once noted that the Democrats ' support for civil rights had cost them the South for a generation ; the Republican Party 's opposition to immigration reform may well have cost it the Hispanic vote for a generation .
Republicans have also whipped up a storm of opposition among middle - of - the - road voters on social issues .
The religious right 's opposition to abortion has always been an electoral liability : only 30 % of voters favour overturning Roe v Wade .
But in the past few years social conservatives tested people 's patience still further over a federal marriage amendment and Terri Schiavo .
Fully 72 % of Republican voters opposed the Republicans ' attempt to use the might of the federal government to keep the severely brain - damaged woman alive .
The voters got their revenge in the 2006 mid-term elections — “ bloody Tuesday ” in the words of Troy Newman , the president of Operation Rescue , an anti-abortion group .
Rick Santorum , once the religious right 's most prominent champion in the Senate , barely scraped 41 % of the vote in Pennsylvania .
Ken Blackwell , social conservatism 's most prominent black champion , went down to a humiliating defeat in the race for the Ohio governorship .
Social conservatives lost ballot initiatives on everything from abortion to gay marriage .

Why the conservative crack - up ?
The obvious cause of the right 's implosion is the implosion of the Bush presidency .
Mr Bush has the worst approval ratings since Jimmy Carter — 29 % according to Newsweek and 31 % according to NBC News .
Only 19 % of Americans think that America is headed in the right direction under Mr Bush .
An astonishing 45 % of Americans , including 13 % of Republicans , support impeaching Mr Bush , according to the American Research Group .
The most obvious cause of the implosion of the Bush presidency is the disaster in Iraq .
The Republican Party 's biggest advantage over the Democrats has long been on foreign and defence policy .
You voted Democratic if you cared about schools and hospitals .
But you voted Republican if you cared more about keeping America safe in a dangerous world .
September 11th 2001 turbo- charged that advantage .
The Republicans used the “ war on terror ” to roll over the Democrats in elections in 2002 and again in 2004 .
But the war in Iraq has buried this vital advantage under a mound of discredited hype ( “ mission accomplished ” ) and mind - boggling incompetence .
A CBS News / New York Times poll found that only 25 % of people approved of Mr Bush 's handling of the situation in Iraq .
An ABC News / Washington
Post poll found that 63 % of respondents did not trust the Bush administration to report honestly about possible threats from other countries .
The damage is not limited to the Bush administration : a Rasmussen poll on July 25th - 26th found that Mrs Clinton outscores Mr Giuliani as the candidate voters trust most on national security .
Mr Bush has also presided over the biggest expansion in government spending since his fellow Texan , Lyndon Johnson , provoking fury on the right .
His prescription - drug benefit was the largest expansion of government entitlements in 40 years .
He has increased federal education spending by about 60 % and added some 7,000 pages of new federal regulations .
Pat Toomey , the head of the Club for Growth , says the conservative base feels “ disgust with what appears to be a complete abandonment of limited government . ”
Many conservative activists would like to pin the blame on Mr Bush alone — either because he pursued foolish policies ( the paleo - conservative version ) or because he pursued sensible policies in a cack - handed manner ( the neoconservative version ) .
William Buckley , the conservative movement 's pope , says that , if Mr Bush were the leader of a parliamentary system , “ it would be expected that he would retire or resign . ”
Bruce Bartlett , a former Reagan - administration economist , accuses him of “ betraying ” the conservative movement .
Other conservatives would like to pin the blame on the Republican Party .
“ We have to recognise that this was a defeat for Republicans , not for conservatives , ” Newt Gingrich , a former Speaker of the House , argued after the 2006 mid-term elections .
In fact , the Republican Party in Congress is just as responsible as Mr Bush for most of the recent troubles .
The Republican majority routinely appropriated more spending than the president asked for .
It also larded spending bills with as much extra pork as possible .
The number of congressional “ earmarks ” for projects in members ' districts increased from 1,300 in 1994 , when the Republicans took over Congress , to 14,000 in 2005 .
The Republican majority also cheered Mr Bush all the way to Baghdad .
Add to this the corruption of congressmen like Tom DeLay , a conservative hero , and the semi-corrupt institutional relationship that the Republicans formed with lobbyists , and you see that Mr Bush was only part of a much bigger problem .
Nor can conservatives claim that Mr Bush is a country - club Republican like his father .
He has devoted his energies to giving “ the movement ” what it wants : the invasion of Iraq for the neoconservatives ( who had championed it long before September 11th ) ; tax cuts for business and the small - government conservatives ; restricting federal funding for stem - cell research for the social conservatives ; and conservative judges to please every faction .
This desire to pander to the conservative movement is partly to blame for the administration 's practical incompetence .
Mr Bush outdid previous Republican presidents in recruiting his personnel from the conservative counter - establishment .
But this often meant choosing people for their ideological purity rather than their competence or intelligence .
Some 150 Bush administration officials were graduates of Pat Robertson 's Regent University , including Monica Goodling , who put on such a lamentable performance before a House inquiry into the firing of nine US attorneys .
A more pragmatic president would surely have sacked many of the neoconservative ideologues who have made a hash of American foreign policy
The Republicans ' problems are creating a civil war on the right about how to dig themselves out of their hole .
This is producing some spectacular intellectual fireworks — fireworks that prove there is still a lot of intellectual life in the right .
But such internal strife tends to put off the voters .
And this civil war has the added problem that , from the point of view of broadening the Republican coalition , the wrong side has won too many important battles , not least on immigration .
One fight is over the size and scope of government .
Small - government conservatives accuse Mr Bush of betraying conservatism 's core principle : that government is the problem rather than the solution .
Big - government conservatives retort that there is only a limited constituency for small government .
The general public strongly opposes cutting entitlements .
“ Anti -government conservatism turns out to be a strange kind of idealism , ” argues Michael Gerson , Mr Bush 's former speechwriter , “ an idealism that strangles mercy . ”
A second fight is over social conservatism .
Libertarians argue that the Republican Party is too much in the pocket of ageing social conservatives such as James Dobson of Focus on the Family , activists who do not represent the views of common - or - garden Evangelicals let alone middle - of - the - road Americans .
Social conservatives retort that they are the people who deliver the votes : if the Republican Party relies only on business conservatives and libertarians , it will be reduced to a rump .
A third fight concerns Mr Bush 's foreign policy , particularly his stubborn defence of the Iraq war .
Some conservatives predicted that the “ war on terror ” might take the place of the “ war on communism ” , both as a glue holding conservatism together and a guarantee of long - term Republican advantage over the Democrats .
That happened for a while .
But the sustained unrest in Iraq has opened deep divisions on the right — not least between Mr Bush ( who rides off into the sunset in January 2009 ) and politicians who would like to hang around for a bit longer .
Senate Republicans are on the verge of a full - scale revolt against the White House .
Dead right ?
It is always tempting to read too much into this or that crisis .
David Frum predicted doom for his fellow travellers in “ Dead Right ” just as Mr Gingrich was about to seize control of Congress .
Emmett Tyrell described a conservative crack - up only to see the movement come back together .
The Democrats ' good fortune is much more the result of a Republican collapse than a Democratic revival .
The March Pew poll shows that the proportion of people who express a positive view of the Democratic Party has actually declined by six points since January 2001 .
It 's just that the proportion of people who express a positive view of the Republican Party has declined by 15 points .
The Democratic - controlled Congress is even more unpopular than the Bush White House , with the lowest approval rating in 35 years .

Americans remain sceptical about the Democrats ' favourite tool for improving the world — government action .
A Democracy Corps poll found that Americans believe by a majority of 57 % to 29 % that government makes it harder for people to get ahead in life .
The same poll found that 83 % of people believe that , if the government had more money , it would probably waste it , the highest level of anti-government sentiment in a decade .
America is not entering into a new era of liberal activism .
The Democrats have ceded a lot of ground to the conservatives .
The party has sidelined liberal groups who oppose the death penalty or want to restrict gun-ownership .
The big three Democratic presidential candidates compete with each other to prove how religious they are : Mrs Clinton repeatedly claims that she is a “ praying person ” who once considered becoming a Methodist minister .
The Party put forward anti-abortion candidates in both Colorado and Pennsylvania .
And the conservative movement is at its most deadly as an insurgency .
The movement was born during the 1964 Goldwater campaign as a revolt against the liberal establishment .
It enjoyed its glory days when it was battling Hillarycare and trying to impeach Bill Clinton .
A Clinton presidential nomination would undoubtedly reunite and re-energise the movement .
Deeply rooted in gun clubs , anti-tax groups , right - to - life groups and Evangelical churches , American conservatives will never be reduced to the feeble status of their British cousins .
But even when you enter all the qualifications the right 's situation is dire .
It is a sign of weakness that the conservatives are retreating to their old posture as insurgents , and need a bogeywoman like Mrs Clinton to hold them together .
The Republicans have failed the most important test of any political movement — wielding power successfully .
They have botched a war .
They have splurged on spending .
And they have alienated a huge section of the population .
It is now the Democrats ' game to win or lose .

The five chemicals shown in the picture below are all consumed by millions of Americans as a means for increasing alertness ( sometimes some are used for other purposes as well ) .
But each has different effects on the human body in terms of addictiveness , carcinogenicity , acute toxicity , and actual effectiveness , as illustrated .
Based on this information , can you decide which is legal and which is not ?
CLICK IMAGE TO SEE LARGER VERSION
Consumption of each chemical has a greater or lesser probability of causing addiction [***** means highly addictive , *** is somewhat addictive , (. ) means not addictive if consumed as suggested but could be addictive if consumed by a non-standard means , the blank ( 5 ) is not addictive under any circumstances ] .
Consumption of one chemical ( 2 ) is associated with carcinogenicity .
This chemical is also associated with acute toxicity , while three others [ labeled ( * ) ] are only toxic if consumed in very large amounts .
Finally , four of the chemicals are associated with a greater or lesser effectiveness at providing people with an increase in mental alertness ( to perform better on a college exam , for example ) , while one does n't do anything in this regard .
OK .
Here 's the premise for the contest .
One of these chemicals is legally available only through a difficult - to - obtain prescription ( although many college students use it illegally ) .
Another one can only be purchased by adults .
The other three can be purchased legally without age restrictions .
Which chemicals are in each of these legality classes ?
The first person to post a completely correct answer wins the contest .

The attorney general ’s job is to present such a case before the court , not to decide it .
Sound familiar ?
There was another provision that was quietly slipped into the reauthorization of the Patriot Act granting Gonzales excess power .
You know , the one that allowed him to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation ?
Should n’t we be scouring that bill for more sneaky power - granting amendments ?
And it ’s not difficult to predict what Gonzales will do with this newfound control over capital litigation .
As gubernatorial counsel to Bush for three years in Texas , Gonzales advised him on 57 executions .
Clemency was denied in all of them .

NEW DELHI , March 15 — Suspected Maoist rebels stormed a police post in the heavily forested center of India early Thursday morning , killing nearly 50 police in what was apparently the biggest attack on state law enforcement in the last several years of leftist insurgency .
There are now Maoist rebels in pockets of nearly half of India ’s 28 states , according to the government .
They are largely entrenched in the forest belt , which is rich in natural resources , like timber and iron ore , but home to some of the poorest communities of indigenous people .
Nearly 900 people were killed in the Maoist conflict in 2005 , according to the most recent available official statistics .
In central Chhattisgarh state , where the incident took place , the conflict has turned ever more nasty in the last two years with the emergence of an anti-Maoist counterinsurgency force , called the Salwa Judum .
Nearly 50,000 villagers , displaced by fighting , now live in flimsy tent camps along the road , as police and the militia try to flush Maoists out of the countryside .
The Salwa Judum has also sent young men and women to join state security forces as so - called special police officers .
In remote rural corners of India , police forces are often understaffed .
Thursday ’s incident claimed dozens of those special police officers , when rebels ambushed a police post near the town of Bijapur at around 2 a.m. , using gasoline bombs and improvised explosive devices , said Rajinder K. Vij , an inspector general of police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh .
Among the 49 killed , the Indian Home Ministry said in a statement , the vast majority were newly recruited special police officers .
Another 12 were injured .

So I was at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in Manhattan Beach yesterday , when I had this revealing conversation with the cashier –
ME : I ’d like a regular size Black Forrest ice blended please .
CASHIER : Will that be for here ?
Or to go ?
ME : To go please .
[ After waiting a beat … ]
ME : Um ….excuse me .
I was just thinking [ usually a bad idea in my case , but it happened despite my best efforts to prevent it ] , why do you bother to ask people if the order “ to go ” or not ?
I mean , you serve the drinks in the same paper cups and plastic containers regardless of if they drink the coffee here or elsewhere , right ?
So , why spend the energy to ask people if their drinks are “ to go ” ?
CASHIER : We have to charge them tax if they drink it here .
ME : I beg your pardon ??
CASHIER : There is a tax if you drink your coffee on the premises .
But there ’s no sales tax if its to go .
ME : You ’re joking .
CASHIER : Nope .
ME : You mean even if I actually drink most of it here , as long as I tell you its “ to go ” , then I wo n’t get charged sales tax ??
CASHIER : Yep .
ME : That ’s crazy .
CASHIER : I know .
[ Another coffee store that will go unnamed ] does n’t even bother to ask their customers .
They just assume that none of their orders are “ to go ” and charge everyone the tax .
ME : Wow .
Thanks for asking then .
It ’s a good thing I actually do want this to go .
I would n’t have known to give the right answer otherwise .
CASHIER : No problem .
ME : Tax law sure is crazy in this state .

Scott Stanfield forwarded me a link to Roger Sessions ' A Better Path to Enterprise Architecture yesterday .
Even though it's got the snake - oil word " Enterprise " in the title , the article is surprisingly good .
I particularly liked the unusual analogy Roger chose to illustrate the difference between iterative and recursive approaches to software development .
It starts with Air Force Colonel John Boyd researching a peculiar anomaly in the performance of 1950 's era jet fighters :
Colonel John Boyd was interested not just in any dogfights , but specifically in dogfights between MiG - 15s and F - 86s .
As an ex-pilot and accomplished aircraft designer , Boyd knew both planes very well .
He knew the MiG - 15 was a better aircraft than the F - 86 .
The MiG - 15 could climb faster than the F - 86 .
The MiG - 15 could turn faster than the F - 86 .
The MiG - 15 had better distance visibility .
The F - 86 had two points in its favor .
First , it had better side visibility .
While the MiG - 15 pilot could see further in front , the F - 86 pilot could see slightly more on the sides .
Second , the F - 86 had a hydraulic flight control .
The MiG - 15 had a manual flight control .
The standing assumption on the part of airline designers was that maneuverability was the key component of winning dogfights .
Clearly , the MiG - 15 , with its faster turning and climbing ability , could outmaneuver the F - 86 .
There was just one problem with all this .
Even though the MiG - 15 was considered a superior aircraft by aircraft designers , the F - 86 was favored by pilots .
The reason it was favored was simple : in one - on - one dogfights with MiG - 15s , the F - 86 won nine times out of ten .
How can an inferior aircraft consistently win over a superior aircraft ?
Boyd , who was himself one of the best dogfighters in history , had a theory :
Boyd decided that the primary determinant to winning dogfights was not observing , orienting , planning , or acting better .
The primary determinant to winning dogfights was observing , orienting , planning , and acting faster .
In other words , how quickly one could iterate .
Speed of iteration , Boyd suggested , beats quality of iteration .
The next question Boyd asked is this : why would the F - 86 iterate faster ?
The reason , he concluded , was something that nobody had thought was particularly important .
It was the fact that the F - 86 had a hydraulic flight stick whereas the MiG - 15 had a manual flight stick .
Without hydraulics , it took slightly more physical energy to move the MiG - 15 flight stick than it did the F - 85 flight stick .
Even though the MiG - 15 would turn faster ( or climb higher ) once the stick was moved , the amount of energy it took to move the stick was greater for the MiG - 15 pilot .
With each iteration , the MiG - 15 pilot grew a little more fatigued than the F - 86 pilot .
And as he gets more fatigued , it took just a little bit longer to complete his OOPA loop .
The MiG - 15 pilot did n't lose because he got outfought .
He lost because he got out - OOPAed .
This leads to Boyd 's Law of Iteration : speed of iteration beats quality of iteration .
You 'll find this same theme echoed throughout every discipline of modern software engineering :
When in doubt , iterate faster .
About a month ago , Florida State Rep. Bob Allen ( R ) , a co-chairman of John McCain ’s presidential campaign in the Sunshine State , ran into a little trouble with the law .
He was arrested in a public park after allegedly offering to pay to perform oral sex on an undercover police officer .
Not a good career move .
Josh Marshall notes today , however , that ol ’ state Rep .
Allen can explain everything .
[ I ]t turns out that Allen revealed the true reason for the alleged park - john - offer in a tape recorded statement he made just after his arrest .
“ This was a pretty stocky black guy , and there was nothing but other black guys around in the park , ” said Allen , according to this article in the Orlando Sentinel .
Allen went on to say he was afraid of becoming a “ statistic . ”
OK , let me get this straight .
Allen was in a public park , late at night .
For some reason , he ’s afraid of black people .
As a result of this irrational fear , he wanders into a bathroom , where he offers another man $ 20 to perform oral sex .
In other words , Allen thought he might be attacked by some “ stocky ” black men , and this is his first instinct ?
Josh added , “ I guess this raises the question of whether if you thought you were about to get mugged by a group of stocky black guys , your first plan of escape would be to try to give one of them a blowjob . ”
Conversation with Kip Hawley , TSA Administrator ( Part 3 )
This is Part 3 of a five - part series .
Link to whole thing .
BS : Let ’s talk about ID checks .
I ’ve called the no-fly list a list of people so dangerous they cannot be allowed to fly under any circumstance , yet so innocent we ca n’t arrest them even under the Patriot Act .
Except that ’s not even true ; anyone , no matter how dangerous they are , can fly without an ID ­or by using someone else ’s boarding pass .
And the list itself is filled with people who should n’t be on it — dead people , people in jail , and so on — and primarily catches innocents with similar names .
Why are you bothering ?
KH : Because it works .
We just completed a scrub of every name on the no-fly list and cut it in half — essentially cleaning out people who were no longer an active terror threat .
We do not publicize how often the no-fly system stops people you would not want on your flight .
Several times a week would low - ball it .
Your point about the no-ID and false boarding pass people is a great one .
We are moving people who have tools and training to get at that problem .
The bigger issue is that TSA is moving in the direction of security that picks up on behavior versus just keying on what we see in your bag .
It really would be security theater if all we did was try to find possible weapons in that crunched fifteen seconds and fifteen feet after you anonymously walk through the magnetometer .
We do a better job , with less aggravation of ordinary passengers , if we put people - based layers further ahead in the process — behavior observation based on involuntary , observable muscle behavior , canine teams , document verification , etc .
BS : We ’ll talk about behavioral profiling later ; no fair defending one security measure by pointing to another , completely separate , one .
How can you claim ID cards work ?
Like the liquid ban , all it does is annoy innocent travelers without doing more than inconveniencing any future terrorists .
Is it really good enough for you to defend me from terrorists too dumb to Google “ print your own boarding pass ” ?
KH :
We are getting at the fake boarding pass and ID issues with our proposal to Congress that would allow us to replace existing document checkers with more highly trained people with tools that would close those gaps .
Without effective identity verification , watch lists do n’t do much , so this is a top priority .
Having highly trained TSOs performing the document checking function closes a security gap , adds another security layer , and pushes TSA ’s security program out in front of the checkpoint .
BS : Let ’s move on .
Air travelers think you ’re capricious .
Remember in April when the story went around about the Princeton professor being on a no- fly list because he spoke out against President Bush ?
His claims were easily debunked , but the real story is that so many people believed it .
People believe political activity puts them on the list .
People are afraid to complain about being mistreated at checkpoints because they ’re afraid it puts them on a list .
Is there anything you can do to make this process more transparent ?
KH : We need some help on this one .
This is the biggest public pain point , dwarfing shoes and baggies .
First off , TSA does not add people to the watch - lists , no matter how cranky you are at a checkpoint .
Second , political views have nothing to do with no - flys or selectees .
These myths have taken on urban legend status .
There are very strict criteria and they are reviewed by lots of separate people in separate agencies : it is for live terror concerns only .
The problem comes from random selectees ( literally mathematically random ) or people who have the same name and birth date as real no - flys .
If you can get a boarding pass , you are not on the no-fly list .
This problem will go away when Secure Flight starts in 2008 , but we ca n’t seem to shake the false impression that ordinary Americans get put on a “ list . ”
I am open for suggestions on how to make the public “ get it . ”
BS : It ’s hard to believe that there could be hundreds of thousands of people meeting those very strict criteria , and that ’s after the list was cut in half !
I know the TSA does not control the no-fly and watch lists , but you ’re the public face of those lists .
You ’re the aspect of homeland security that people come into direct contact with .
Some people might find out they ’re on the list by being arrested , or being shipped off to Syria for torture , but most people find out they ’re on the list by being repeatedly searched and questioned for hours at airports .
The main problem with the list is that it ’s secret .
Who is on the list is secret .
Why someone ’s on is secret .
How someone can get off is secret .
There ’s no accountability and there ’s no transparency .
Of course this kind of thing induces paranoia .
It ’s the sort of thing you read about in history books about East Germany and other police states .
The best thing you can do to improve the problem is redress .
People need the ability to see the evidence against them , challenge their accuser , and have a hearing in a neutral court .
If they ’re guilty of something , arrest them .
And if they ’re innocent , stop harassing them .
It ’s basic liberty .
I do n’t actually expect you to fix this ; the problem is larger than the TSA .
But can you tell us something about redress ?
It ’s been promised to us for years now .
KH : Redress issues are divided into two categories : people on the no-fly list and people who have names similar to them .
In our experience , the first group is not a heavy user of the redress process .
They typically do n’t want anything to do with the U.S. government .
Still , if someone is either wrongly put on or kept on , the Terrorist Screening Center ( TSC ) removes him or her immediately .
In fact , TSA worked with the TSC to review every name , and that review cut the no-fly list in half .
Having said that , once someone is really on the no-fly list , I totally agree with what you said about appeal rights .
This is true across the board , not just with no - flys .
DHS has recently consolidated redress for all DHS activities into one process called DHS TRIP .
If you are mistaken for a real no -fly , you can let TSA know and we provide your information to the airlines , who right now are responsible for identifying no - flys trying to fly .
Each airline uses its own system , so some can get you cleared to use kiosks , while others still require a visit to the ticket agent .
When Secure Flight is operating , we ’ll take that in - house at TSA and the problem should go away .
BS : I still do n’t see how that will work , as long as the TSA does n’t have control over who gets on or off the list .

Drawing a cartoon is no trivial pursuit .
It turns us into a director , writer , narrator .
Through a cartoon or comic , you tell a story that takes place in a certain time , a certain environment , with certain characters .
This is why you will learn here not just how to draw a cartoon in Adobe Illustrator , but how to decide on character , place and situation .
Before grabbing your pencil or software tool , ask yourself , “ What will be my topic ? ”
How many characters you will use , and who will they be ?
What background will they move against ?
What era will they live in ?
In what scene will you put them ?
Through the steps in this tutorial , I will explain to you my own choices .
Let ’s begin .

How many characters you will use , and who will they be ?
What background will they move against ?
What era will they live in ?
In what scene will you put them ?
Through the steps in this tutorial , I will explain to you my own choices .
Let ’s begin .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
1. The Subject
The topic I ’ve chosen for my cartoon relates to a recent discovery .
For the first time , we ’ve picked up a signal caused by gravitational waves .
Albert Einstein first theorized the existence of gravitational waves in 1918 .
Exciting !
So , what better topic for my cartoon ?
2. The Character
The character I ’ll draw , then , is Einstein .
Open Adobe Illustrator .
Insert the file I ’ve provided in Illustrator by going to “ File ” → “ Place . ”
Now , adjust the artboard by going to “ Object ” → “ Artboards ” → “ Fit to Artwork Bounds . ”
The dimensions of your artboard should now match the file you ’ve just inserted : 2305 × 3250 pixels .
Block the layer where you ’ve just put the file .
Double - click on the layer ’s name and rename it “ Sketch . ”
Create another layer above the “ Sketch ” layer by hitting Command + L on a Mac or Control + L on Windows , and call it “ Lines . ”
Now , we need to trace the image with the Pen tool ( P ) , similar to how I showed you in my previous tutorial .
What we are going to learn here is not the mere tracing of shapes , but rather how to trace the black outline of a drawing .
We do this because we are drawing a cartoon , and cartoons usually have this black outline around the shapes to distinguish them .
Double - click on the stroke ’s color , and set the hexadecimal value to # FF06A0 .
We use this color to distinguish our lines on the artboards .
We will change it later .
Zoom into the drawing at 200 % , and begin to draw the face outline with the Pen Tool ( P ) .
Do this until you ’ve drawn the top of the head .
Once you ’ve finished drawing the head ’s outline , draw the internal outline .
Now , select both outlines you ’ve created , the external and internal one , and click on the Shape Builder tool ( Shift + M ) .
Go to the button to swap the fill and stroke color ( Shift + X ) , and click on that little arrow .
The stroke ’s color should now be changed to the fill ’s color .
Now , enable the Shape Builder tool ( Shift + M ) , and put the cursor in the empty space between the two outlines we created before .
You will see something like a transparent background , which indicates the space where the Shape Builder tool will create a shape .
Just click and you will see the selected area be given the fill color .
Thus , we ’ve created a fill - colored outline for our cartoon .
Now , let ’s repeat the same action with the other body parts : mustache , eyes , ears , nose , hair and so on .
For the little shapes , like the forehead wrinkles , you can just draw a closed shape and then swap the stroke with the fill .
For shapes like the eyes , use the Ellipse Tool ( L ) and set the stroke weight to 8 points .
This is our work so far .
Notice how I ’ve closed the paths , even if they cover the face .
I did that because we will be able to fill the shape with color with just a click , simply by creating a closed path .
Then , we will hide some parts , positioning one part over another .
But we will see that later .
It ’s a little different for the hand holding the old phone .
Here , you have to draw the hand in two shapes : the fingers and the palm .
Do it using Pencil Tool ( N ) .
Et voilà !
Here is our drawing :
Hide the “ Sketch ” layer , and you will see your clean vector .
Now , double - click on the Magic Wand tool ( Y ) , and select “ Fill Color ” in the popup window , setting the tolerance to 20 .
After you ’ve set the tool this way , it will select all objects with the same fill color .
Just click on your work to see it in action .
After you ’ve selected them , double - click on the fill color and set it to # 000000 .
Your image should look like this :
Double - click again on the Magic Wand Tool ( Y ) and select “ Stroke Color , ” setting the tolerance to 20 .
Click on your image , and all strokes with the same color will be selected now .
Set the color to # 000000 .
Now , our image will have all black outlines .
Let ’s color Einstein .
Set the skin color to a hexadecimal value of # FBD2B7 .
Select the head with the Selection tool ( V ) , and then click on Live Paint Bucket ( K ) .
Click on the face to fill it with the selected color .
Do the same with the other shapes , giving them the same color : ears , chin , neck , hands .
Remember that you have to select a group of objects first and then color them with the Live Paint Bucket ( K ) , or else it wo n’t work .
Note :
If you are not able to color something with the Live Paint Bucket ( K ) , it probably means your object has open paths .
It happened to me with the fingers :
In this case , you can use the Blob Brush tool ( Shift + B ) to color the internal shape of the fingers .
Set the color to # FBD2B7 , set the brush ’s weight to 30 points , and fill the fingers and other shapes that have open paths .
When you color in this way , the color is positioned above the path .
To move it under the path , just select the color shape and hit ⌘ and [ to move it down .
If other objects are overlying the fingers , select them and move them down the same way you did for the fingers ’ color .
Or you can right - click and select “ Arrange ” → “ Send Backward ” to send them back .
Go on coloring with these two methods .
Note how the path under Einstein ’s mustache disappears when you fill the mustache with color :
Remember that you can move objects forward ( right - click → “ Arrange ” → “ Bring Forward ” or ⌘ + ] ) or backwards ( right - click → “ Arrange ” → “ Send Backward ” or ⌘ + [ ) to find their right position .
Here ’s our Einstein colored in .
We still have to correct something .
The antique phone ’s handset is divided into pieces because of our previous tracing :
We have to unify these pieces into one .
With the handset selected , enable the Shape Builder tool ( Shift + M ) and drag on the objects we need to unify :
Now , we have to get rid of that line under Einstein ’s ear :
We ’ll use the Scissors tool ©. Select our two lines and cut them in four places as shown here :
Now , select the cut lines and delete them .
Here ’s the result :
3. Environment ( Laboratory )
Let ’s move on to the next image .
When we think of Einstein , the first objects that come to mind ( well , to my mind ) are a laboratory and a blackboard .
Let ’s draw our laboratory on another artboard .
Click on the Artboard tool ( Shift + O ) , and then click on “ New Artboard ” in the menu .
You will get a copy of your first artboard with the same height and width .
Set the width to twice that of the previous table :
You should have something like this :
It ’s time to create the room .
We need a floor and two walls .
The tones and colors of the room will be similar because the room is a background .
The character will stand out because of the different colors and the thick edges .
The uniform tone of the background will serve not to distract from what is happening .
Create a new layer and call it “ Room . ”
Block the other layers .
Take the Pen Tool ( P ) and draw a polygon like the one in my image .
Set the fill color to # 424974 .
Draw the front wall with the Rectangle tool ( M ) .
Divide it into two colors , so that we have a more dynamic background .
Use # 53649C for the bottom rectangle , and # 424974 for the top rectangle .
Finally , insert the side wall .
You can use the Rectangle tool again .
Then , put your shape under the floor by right - clicking , then “ Arrange ” and “ Send Backward ” ( or ⌘ + [ ) .
I ’ve split it into two shapes .
The bottom rectangle is set to # 65739B , and the top one to # 506799 .
In a cartoon laboratory you will find strange machinery , buttons , screens and handles .
Let ’s create our first machine , a screen and a handle .
Create a rectangle with the Rectangle tool ( M ) , sized to 587 × 323 pixels and the color set to # 6A75AA .
Create another rectangle inside that with the Rounded Rectangle Tool ( M ) , the color set to # 172432 .
Go to “ Effect ” → “ Warp ” → “ Arc ” and select “ Horizontal . ”
Set the bend to 3 % , and under “ Distortion , ” set “ Horizontal ” to =0 % and “ Vertical ” to - 4 % .
With the Pen tool ( P ) , create three rectangles to draw the screen ’s sides , as shown below .
Finally , grab the Pen tool again and draw a zig - zag line , with the color set to # D8D89C and the stroke weight set to 5 points .
Draw a line as shown here :
Now , create another rectangle with dimensions of 160 × 372 pixels and the color set to # 6A75 AA .
Put it on the side of the first one .
With the Pen tool , draw the sides of the rectangle , the same way you did for the first one .
Create another rectangle inside this one , with the color set to # 172432 .
Create a rectangle again , coming out of the slot , as shown here :
Draw the handle ’s knob with the same color .
On the other side , create two circles with the Ellipse Tool ( L ) , with the same dimensions as the knob and the color set to # 6A75AA .
With both circles selected , go to the Pathfinder panel and click on “ Minus Back ” ( or by selecting “ Effect ” → “ Pathfinder ” → “ Minus Back ” ) .
You will get this shape :
Apply this to our knob to get a light effect .
Repeat the same steps to create our second machine .
Draw some shapes , such as trapezoids and circles , with the color set to # 6A75AA .
Do the same for our third machine , this time with rectangles , circles and squares .
You can create every single object by repeating the previous steps .
To create the pipe sticking out of the ground , just draw two rectangles with the same dimensions , 560 × 158 pixels .
Right - click on the bottom pipe and select “ Transform ” → “ Rotate , ” with the angle set to 90° .
Make an L - shape from the two rectangles :
Select both rectangles , go to the Pathfinder panel and click “ Unite . ”
With the Direct Selection Tool ( A ) , select the resulting shape .
Some little circles will show up , giving you dynamic corners .
Click and drag to the bottom right the ones shown here :
This is the result :
Let ’s work on the table now .
Draw a simple rectangle and let it extend past the artboard , so that it appears to be in the foreground .
The colors are # 787FAD for the light violet , # 6A75 AA for the dark violet , and # 8C92 AD ( very light violet ) for the lighting .
Create a button with the Ellipse tool ( L ) , set to # F7DF79 .
Draw sides of the bottom the way we did with our first machine , the colors set to # D3B42 F and # 8E6621 .
Create all of the other buttons the same way , with the following colors :
red button : # DD7676 , #DB5A5A , # D84141
green button : # C0C478 , #BFBB32 , #9B962A
brown button : # 937A44 , #A08453 , #8E6621
blue button : # 34495E , # 172432
pink button : # E0B39D , #DD9376
With the Pen tool ( P ) , create a curved shape , with a darker side .
This will be the base of another knob , the colors being # 787FAD and # 424974 :
Create a curved line in the center of the shape , again using the Pen tool .
Set the stroke weight to 16 points .
Now , create a handle with two simple rectangles .
Create the handle ’s sides with our trusty technique , the colors being # 172432 , #2a4359 and # 3a4a56 .
Let ’s create a futuristic table .
Create an ellipse with the Ellipse Tool ( L ) , and drag the anchor points as shown here :
Hit Control + C and Control + B to paste in the back .
Move down the shape we ’ve just pasted , and set its color to # 172432 .
Finish your futuristic table by adding the other shapes as shown below , simple ellipses and two triangles .
I ’ve created a couple of objects on the table as well , a book and a lamp , simply by using shapes , rectangles and the Ellipses tool .
Now , draw a big blackboard for where Einstein will write his formulas .
Take the Rectangle Tool ( M ) and draw a rectangle , the color set to # 172432 .
We need to write some formulas on the blackboard , and they need to look as though they ’re written in chalk .
Grab the Pencil Tool ( N ) and write some formulas ( mine are almost all made up ! ) .
Set # e6e6e6 as the color .
When you ’re done , select what you ’ve written , go to the Brushes panel , and click on the little arrow on the top right :
Select “ Open Brush Library ” → “ Artistic ” → “ ArtisticChalkCharcoalPencil , ” and select the last type of charcoal , which will give you a beautiful charcoal effect on the blackboard .
Take the Einstein vector and put it on the side of the blackboard .
4. The Period
The period in which our cartoon is set is about 1920 .
Einstein ’s theories about gravitational waves date back to 1918 .
For this reason , I ’ve inserted an old telephone , the kind Einstein would talk on .
5 . The Scene
I wanted to put Einstein in a scene in which he ’s talking with aliens , who are giving him this information .
( It is a cartoon after all — it should be a little funny ! )
Draw a cloud in the top right with the Pencil tool ( N ) , and then fill it with white ( # ffffff ) .
With the Rounded Rectangle Tool ( M ) , draw a rectangle , and round its corners until they are completely curved .
Set the fill to # d6d989 and the stroke to # 000000 .
With the Ellipse Tool ( L ) , draw an eye and a pupil , setting the color to # 787 fad .
With the Pen Tool and Ellipse tool , draw two little antennas .
Draw a small rectangle , which will be its phone , and tilt it by grabbing an angle and drawing the cursor down .
With the Pencil tool , draw a hand holding the phone and some lines for the phone ’s signal .
Conclusion
We ’re done !
I hope you ’ve liked this tutorial .
Feel free to leave a comment below , and show us your cartoon !
Last but not least , some of you were asking a high - res image of Einstein .
So here you go :
The final , traced Einstein carricature .
A bipartisan majority of Americans strongly supports the bills that whisked through the House in the first days of the Democratic - controlled Congress , but many remain uncertain about where the party wants to lead the nation , a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
Approval of Congress has increased since the midterm elections ousted Republicans from their House and Senate majorities , and Democrats are viewed in a more positive light after two weeks in power , according to the survey .
But only 25 % of those surveyed believed Democrats have formulated a clear direction for the country ; 58 % said they had failed to .
Those results amount to a mixed report card on the much - ballyhooed “ 100 - hour ” agenda House Democrats set for themselves as they took power .

They made a strong start with House passage of some broadly popular bills , such as an increase in the minimum wage and a cut in student - loan rates , which passed with significant Republican support .
It was a rare display of bipartisanship after years of the party - line splits that marked GOP control .
‘ So far , so good ’
But the survey underscores that Democrats still have much to prove to voters as the Senate debates these bills and lawmakers in both chambers turn to more divisive issues , such as the federal budget , global warming and Iraq .
Overall , the poll found 36 % approve of how Congress is doing its job -- hardly a mandate , but up from 30 % in September .

“ So far , so good , ” said Hildegard Wharton , a retiree in Wooster , Ohio , who responded to the poll .
Wharton , a Democrat , added , “ I hope they do a better job than the Republicans .
If they do n’t , they are not going to get reelected . ”
The Times / Bloomberg poll , supervised by Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , surveyed 1,344 adults by telephone Saturday through Tuesday .
It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
It found that pressure is especially high for Democrats to change course in Iraq ; 45 % identified the war as the most important issue for the new Congress to address , a far higher figure than for any other issue .

“ If they just tackle this war and get these boys home , they will be doing good , ” said Jerry Alexander , a retired car salesman in Savannah , Tenn. , who is an independent .
“ They better , because that ’s what they were elected for . ”
The positive reaction among those polled to the major elements of the initial Democratic agenda ratifies the political strategy behind its design :
Party leaders deliberately filled the congressional session ’s opening hours with issues that , for the most part , polls have found enjoyed broad bipartisan support and were likely to pass before President Bush ’s State of the Union address on Tuesday .
One aim was to provide a contrast with the gridlock that stalled many bills during the recent years of the Republican - controlled Congress .
Legislation approved
The student - loan rate cut that passed the House on Wednesday was supported by 79 % of those polled .

Legislation aimed at lowering prices in Medicare ’s prescription drug program , which passed the House last week , was backed by 80 % .
Repealing tax breaks for big oil companies , which the House approved Thursday , was supported by 61 % .
An expansion of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research , passed by the chamber last week , was backed by 59 % .
The most popular item was the push to increase the federal minimum wage , which under the House bill would rise over two years to $ 7.25 an hour from $ 5.15 .
The increase , which would be the first in a decade , was supported by 81 % of those surveyed -- including 66 % of self - described conservatives .

“ The minimum - wage increase was long overdue , ” said Susan Wilkinson , a homemaker and a Democrat who lives in Trabuco Canyon in Orange County .
“ It ’s pretty sad that it had to be even an issue to debate . ”
Democrats hope their early results will reinforce the judgment by voters in November that it was time for a change of control in Congress .
The new poll indicates a less critical view of congressional Democrats among the public -- although their favorable rating is virtually unchanged at 42 % , compared to 40 % in September ; their unfavorable rating was 32 % , down from 41 % .
Accompanying that drop was an increase -- to 22 % from 15 % -- in those who said they did not know enough about congressional Democrats to judge .
That suggests there is a sizable wait - and - see faction among voters .

“ I just do n’t know how much of what they have done is going to bear any fruit , ” said Jim Bauder , a computer programmer in Fort Jones , Calif .
Bauder , an independent , added , “ President Bush has declared he ’s going to veto many of the things they have passed .
Is it going to be a situation where anything gets accomplished ? ”
Some of the early promises emanating from Washington are being viewed with skepticism .
Almost three - quarters of those surveyed -- 72 % -- supported House - passed ethics reforms to ban gifts from lobbyists and require disclosure of pork - barrel projects .
But only 27 % said they believed such measures would make a real difference ; 60 % said they expect business as usual in the way Capitol Hill operates .
Advertisement
“ My experience ... is that there have been reforms , but there always seems to be new or expanding loopholes people find , ” said Bauder .
Helen Anderson , a teacher in Houston , said she was unimpressed with what Democrats have done in the opening weeks .
“ I think they are trying to make a big show to make it look like they are taking a new direction , ” said Anderson , a Republican .
“ All they can say is they want to do the opposite of what ’s being done now , but they do n’t say how they are going to do it . ”
Pelosi on the rise
Advertisement
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) , in the news spotlight since the November elections as the first woman to lead either congressional chamber , remains little known to many Americans but has made some headway in raising her national profile .
Among those with an opinion , 34 % viewed her favorably , 21 % unfavorably .
Still , 41 % of those surveyed said they had not heard enough about her to have an opinion .
In December , that figure was 50 % ; in September , 63 % .
By some measures , people seem more optimistic about the economy : 68 % said they thought it was doing well , up from 54 % in September .
Some attributed their upbeat outlook to the drop in gasoline prices .
“ As prices go down on gas and energy , other prices will be coming down , ” said Debra Glover , a substitute teacher in Oak Park , Mich. , who is an independent .
“ It ’s happening real fast .
I ’m liking that . ”

But the poll also found increased anxiety about the impact of free trade : 41 % said doing away with restrictions on international commerce hurts the economy .

non-coercion creates veto right :
Libertarians , as indicated above , emphasise the principle of non-coercion .
Many libertarian propaganda texts begin by stating the principle .
The Non-Statist FAQ says : ... libertarianism is the ideology that aggression is bad .
In libertarian argot , ' aggression ' is defined as the initiation of coercion , and ' coercion ' is defined as force , fraud or duress ; coercion exercised in self - defense or restitution is defined as retaliation , not initiation .
And Charles Murray writes in What it means to be a Libertarian ( p. 6 ) :
It is wrong for me to use force against you , because it violates your right to control of your person .... I may have the purest motive in the world .
I may even have the best idea in the world .
But even these give me no right to make you do something just because I think it 's a good idea .
This truth translates into the first libertarian principle of governance :
In a free society individuals may not initiate the use of force against any other individual or group .
Now it is logically inconsistent , to demand a ' noncoercive principle of governance ' .
Unless someone ( coercively ) enforces it , it will be meaningless .
And libertarians have a narrow and specific definition of coercion anyway ( see below ) .
But leaving that aside , this principle has an important political characteristic .
It carries an implicit secondary claim , that any veto on coercion is legitimate .
In a libertarian world , any person could exercise a veto over any project , if it required their coercion .
And as protesters have discovered , you can place yourself in a position where that coercion is required .
In other words the non-coercion principle is a licence for deep NIMBY - ism .
By literally or metaphorically ' sitting in front of the bulldozer ' , any project can be blocked .
To evade this , libertarian theorists would have to create exemptions to the non-coercion principle , and probably exemptions from these exemptions .
I have not seen any libertarian attempt to do this .
However , there is a good comparison with rights theory - where every right can be matched by a claimed counter - right .
In political practice , this has led to an inflation of rights ( which can also be found in some libertarian proposals ) .
The creation of a de facto veto right , or a specific set of exemptions from it , would undermine claims that the proposed society is a neutral set of rules and / or procedures .
selective benefit from the non-coercion principle :
There is no self - evident way to apply the non-coercion principle : it must be applied to someone or something .
The question is , to what , to whom ?
This is the problem which rights theorists faced , when people started claiming rights for animals , for species , for ecosystems , for land , and for rocks .
The non-coercion principle also has a limits problem .
May fish legitimately be coerced into nets ?
Is it coercion to demolish a building ?
May collectivities benefit from non-coercion ?
In other words , is the principle of non-coercion exclusive to natural persons ?
Some libertarians do say that , but even this is unclear .
Libertarians can not agree on whether an abortion is initiation of force , because they disagree on whether the fetus is a natural person .
Certainly libertarians insist that the State should respect the non-coercion principle .
Some libertarians might concede that the State is also protected by the principle , especially the so - called minarchists .
For instance , they might condemn extortion from the government as coercion , force or fraud .
If they concede the existence of a government at all , it will need protection against force in order to function .
But if they concede this extension , why not extend it further to clubs and associations , which also need protection in order to function ?
Or to ethnic minorities ?
Or to species ?
A libertarian society needs to define the limits of the non-coercion principle , in order to apply it .
These limits must then be enforced .
Once again the claim to neutrality is undermined .
The libertarian state would have to be maximal enough , to enforce their particular view of who deserves non-coercion .
market forces not defined as coercion :
Imagine a world where coercion ( or initiation of force ) is indeed forbidden , and everyone accepts that prohibition .
In such a world , power would rest with those who define ' coercion ' or ' initiation ' .
The Libertarian Party Principles state :
We hold that all individuals have the right to exercise sole dominion over their own lives , and have the right to live in whatever manner they choose , so long as they do not forcibly interfere with the equal right of others to live in whatever manner they choose .
In other words , interference with the lives of others is permitted , so long as it is not forcible .
Anti-coercion libertarians do not simply oppose coercion , they also claim to legitimately define it .
Their definition excludes much that others would see as coercion .
Most explicitly , market forces are not defined as coercion by libertarians .
Some take this to extremes - proposing for instance a free market in children , or the return of indentured labour and contract slavery .
On the other hand , any attempt to restrict market forces ( or competition ) would be defined by most libertarians as ' coercion ' .
Yet again the claim to neutrality is undermined : the libertarian state would also enforce their particular views of what constitutes non-coercion .
Cynically defined , a libertarian is a person who believes that all humans should live in total and absolute submission to market forces , at all times from birth to death , without any chance of escape .
Only liberal ideologies claim that living in a free market is equivalent to living in a free society .
Charles Murray writes in What it means to be a Libertarian ( p. 6 ) : Formally stated : A voluntary and informed exchange benefits both parties .
This characteristic of a voluntary and informed exchange makes a free society possible .
No , it does not .
There is a huge gap in the logic here .
The characteristics of the exchange do not determine the form of the society in which it takes place .
A society is not a two - person transaction .
A voluntary and informed exchange between two parties may already have dramatic consequences for a third party .
Billions of free - market transactions result in some ' third parties ' starving to death : that is neither voluntary , nor informed , nor an exchange .
A simple example : two islands exchange crops , to reach a minimum healthy diet .
Soil conditions mean that a full range of crops can not be grown : without the exchange the inhabitants of both islands will die .
Then an external trader arrives , and sells the necessary crops to one of the islands .
The trader sells honestly at fair prices : both parties ( trader and one island ) are satisfied with the deal .
Nevertheless , the inter - island exchange ends .
On the other island , the population dies of malnutrition .
Obviously , they never contracted to this , yet some libertarians would claim that they are in some sense more free .
To allow ' freedom ' in the sense that no - one finds themselves in a non-consensual condition as a result of transactions , would require the effect on all persons is known ( predictability ) , or at least the risks to all persons are identified
all those affected are informed , and
all those affected consent .
Even in a small village with a barter economy these conditions are impossible .
they are certainly impossible in a global economy .
Libertarians must know that free markets are not ' pure ' transactions in a social vacuum .
The voluntary and informed nature of a contract can , in reality , never extend beyond the contracting parties .
But its effects can .
Even if every single transaction is voluntary and informed , the resulting society might disadvantage everyone .
If , and only if , all its members have contracted to accept any and all outcomes of all transactions collectively , can it be a ' free society ' in the sense implied by Charles Murray .
Otherwise , the image of the voluntary transaction as a metaphor for society , is false and propagandistic .
existing world not defined as coercion :
Liberal political philosophy often has a hidden preference for the existing world , concealed within apparently neutral structures .
In libertarianism , it is found in the non-coercion principle .
Since humans have not freely chosen the world into which they were born , a truly non-coercive philosopher would demand that the cosmos disappeared - and only re-appeared , when everyone consented in writing to its existence .
The real world is not so helpful .
Libertarians take the existence of existing society as given .
That makes it unfairly privileged - since attempts to abolish it can be legitimately described as coercion .
In other words it gets a head start over all possible other societies : they have to prove ' non-coercion ' before coming into existence , the existing society does not .
Libertarians appear to reject destructive force in general , including the destruction of tradition , and of traditionally venerated objects .
Prohibiting the destruction of the existing is , by definition , a form of conservatism .
Libertarianism appears to be ' anti-iconoclastic ' in this sense , but specific libertarian condemnations of revolutionary iconoclasm are hard to find .
The anniversary of Marine Cpl. Brian R. St. Germain ’s death in Iraq was approaching , and Gunnery Sgt. Jason Alderman was making sure his buddy would never be forgotten .
He was getting a tattoo in his honor .
The design was one that Alderman had chosen after looking at a Marine - themed website , www.grunt.com.
The 11 - inch tattoo being permanently inked on his left calf , near his shrapnel wound , included a Marine Ka-Bar knife , the Marine eagle , globe and anchor emblem and the inscription “ SAINT 4-02 - 06 . ”
Alderman , 31 , said he wanted to show the tattoo to St. Germain ’s parents to assure them that their son would be remembered .
Marine Corps culture holds that Marines who die in combat must never be forgotten .
An increasing number of Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton and other bases are living that ethic by getting memorial tattoos to comrades killed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Advertisement
St. Germain , a mechanic and martial arts instructor , died in a vehicle accident outside the base at Al Asad .
The Rhode Island native was 22 and on his second combat tour in Iraq .
Alderman identified the body but missed the memorial service for St. Germain and the others who died in the accident because he developed an eye problem and had to be hospitalized .
It ’s been a source of disappointment and some guilt .
“ He was strong all the way through , ” Alderman said of St. Germain at the tattoo parlor Thursday night .
“ That ’s how I remember him .
He was a great Marine . ”
Tattoos have long been an integral , although unofficial , part of the Marine Corps .
But the widespread preference for memorial tattoos may prove to be a distinguishing mark of this generation of Marines .
Advertisement
“ Before Iraq , guys wanted all sorts of crazy stuff , ” said Kraig Santos , proprietor of Fallbrook Tattoo , where Alderman was getting his tattoo .
“ Now it ’s all crosses and angels -- memorial stuff . ”
Some of the tattoos list the names of the dead , others include mournful sayings such as “ Never Forget , ” “ Fallen But Not Forgotten , ” and “ R.I.P . ” Some tattoos are meant to remember a particularly popular or heroic Marine .
Some Marines began designing their memorial tattoos when they were still in Iraq .
Legend holds that the top three desires of young Marines returning from Iraq are a new motorcycle , a new tattoo and female companionship .
“ They come in here with their own ideas about memorials , ” said Dan Kuns , owner of Pairadice Tattoo , outside the base at Twentynine Palms .
“ Everything has to be perfect .
Every little bit means something to them , reminds them of the Marine who died . ”

When Cpl. Jason Dunham died in 2004 after diving on a grenade to save his buddies -- an act for which he received the Medal of Honor -- several members of his platoon from Twentynine Palms got tattoos .
Some had his name inked on their skin , others the date of his death , still others an ace of spades superimposed over a skull -- like Dunham ’s own tattoo .
At Camp Pendleton , Cpl. Christopher Shelhamer , recuperating from a sniper wound , has the names of five Marines killed in Fallouja on his back .
“ I want my guys with me , always , ” he said .
Cpl. Brian J. Reimers , 21 , has what he calls his Lost Brothers tattoo on his upper left arm to honor the 11 Marines in his battalion killed in Fallouja in 2006 .
“ Every time the needle went in , it hurt , ” he said .
“ But I thought about their sacrifice and how a little bit of pain does n’t compare to that . ”
Many of the survivors of the terrorist bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut have tattoos that say , “ Oct. 23,1983 .
Beirut , Lebanon .
241 . ” The 241 refers to the number of service personnel who died in the blast .
When two Marines wearing the Beirut tattoo meet , they share an immediate bond that needs no words .
Advertisement
Marine leaders tinker with traditions at their peril , never more so than when dealing with tattoos .
When Gen. James Conway , commandant of the Marine Corps , visited with Marines in Fallouja before Christmas , one of the first questions from the troops was about a possible change in regulations involving tattoos .
“ I love that question , ” he told the gathering .
“ It ’s one of the most popular in the Marine Corps . ”
Conway said the policy would ban only new tattoos of a garish and visible nature or in areas of the body that are visible to civilians when Marines are off base -- on the neck , below the wrist or near the ankle .
Senior enlisted leadership suggested the change , which became effective Sunday , as a way to protect the corps ’ public image .
Advertisement
Nothing in the new policy would prohibit Marines from honoring their dead comrades with tattoos , Conway assured the troops at Camp Fallouja .
A cheer went up from the more than 1,000 Marines and sailors assembled in an auditorium where Saddam Hussein once lectured his conscripts .
Just why today ’s Marines may be favoring memorial tattoos more than Marines of the past remains unclear .
One suggestion -- by a senior officer without tattoos -- is that memorial tattoos show the influence of rap music , since some rap stars also get them to honor friends .
Many of the Marines getting memorial tattoos already have the traditional USMC or Semper Fi or the popular abstract patterns known as “ tribal ” tattoos .
Alderman has a tribal on his biceps , from the day early in his Marine career when he and some buddies went to a parlor in Arizona .
As other Marines waited their turn in the tattoo chair Thursday night , artist Sharky Claunch was busily applying the ink to Alderman ’s calf .
It was a black - and - white job , in an easily accessible part of the body , relatively simple by tattoo standards , costing $ 200 and taking about 2 1/2 hours to complete .
It was Claunch ’s second memorial tattoo of the day .
He spent the afternoon inking a huge R.I.P. across a Marine ’s back , along with the name of his brother , killed in Iraq .
Advertisement
He and fellow tattoo artist Santos expected more memorial tattoo requests before the weekend was over because Friday was payday for the Marines , prime tattoo time .
“ Memories fade , but you put something on your body and it ’s forever , ” Santos said .
“ It ’s a way to keep a guy alive . ”

In September 1955 , James Dean was killed in a horrific car accident whilst he was driving his Porsche sports car .
After the crash the car was seen as very unlucky .
a)
When the car was towed away from accident scene and taken to a garage , the engine slipped out and fell onto a mechanic , shattering both of his legs .b )
Eventually the engine was bought by a doctor , who put it into his racing car and was killed shortly afterwards , during a race .
Another racing driver , in the same race , was killed in his car , which had James Dean 's driveshaft fitted to it .
c )
When James Dean 's Porsche was later repaired , the garage it was in was destroyed by fire .d )
Later the car was displayed in Sacramento , but it fell off it 's mount and broke a teenager 's hip .e )
In Oregon , the trailer that the car was mounted on slipped from it 's towbar and smashed through the front of a shop . f )
Finally , in 1959 , the car mysteriously broke into 11 pieces while it was sitting on steel supports .
In Detroit sometime in the 1930s , a young ( if incredibly careless ) mother must have been eternally grateful to a man named Joseph Figlock .
As Figlock was walking down the street , the mother 's baby fell from a high window onto Figlock .
The baby 's fall was broken and both man and baby were unharmed .
A stroke of luck on its own , but a year later , the very same baby fell from the very same window onto poor , unsuspecting Joseph Figlock as he was again passing beneath .
And again , they both survived the event .
Henry Ziegland thought he had dodged fate .
In 1883 , he broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who , out of distress , committed suicide .
The girl 's brother was so enraged that he hunted down Ziegland and shot him .
The brother , believing he had killed Ziegland , then turned his gun on himself and took his own life .
But Ziegland had not been killed .
The bullet , in fact , had only grazed his face and then lodged in a tree .
Ziegland surely thought himself a lucky man .
Some years later , however , Ziegland decided to cut down the large tree , which still had the bullet in it .
The task seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with a few sticks of dynamite .
The explosion propelled the bullet into Ziegland 's head , killing him .
The stories of identical twins ' nearly identical lives are often astonishing , but perhaps none more so than those of identical twins born in Ohio .
The twin boys were separated at birth , being adopted by different families .
Unknown to each other , both families named the boys James .
And here the coincidences just begin .
Both James grew up not even knowing of the other , yet both sought law - enforcement training , both had abilities in mechanical drawing and carpentry , and each had married women named Linda .
They both had sons whom one named James Alan and the other named James Allan .
The twin brothers also divorced their wives and married other women - both named Betty .
And they both owned dogs which they named Toy .
Forty years after their childhood separation , the two men were reunited to share their amazingly similar lives .
In the 19th century , the famous horror writer , Egdar Allan Poe , wrote a book called ' The narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym ' .
It was about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before they decided to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker .
Some years later , in 1884 , the yawl , Mignonette , foundered , with only four survivors , who were in an open boat for many days .

On 2002 , Seventy - year - old twin brothers have died within hours of one another after separate accidents on the same road in northern Finland .
The first of the twins died when he was hit by a lorry while riding his bike in Raahe , 600 kilometres north of the capital , Helsinki .
He died just 1.5 km from the spot where his brother was killed .
" This is simply a historic coincidence .
Although the road is a busy one , accidents do n't occur every day , " police officer Marja - Leena Huhtala told Reuters .
" It made my hair stand on end when I heard the two were brothers , and identical twins at that .
It came to mind that perhaps someone from upstairs had a say in this , " she said .
Joseph Aigner was a fairlly well - known portrait painter in 19th century Austria who , apparently , was quite an unhappy fellow : he several times attempted suicide .
His first attempt was at the young age of 18 when he tried to hang himself , but was interrupted by the mysterious appearance of a Capuchin monk .
At age 22 he again tried to hang himself , but was again saved from the act by the very same monk .
Eight years later , his death was ordained by others who sentenced him to the gallows for his political activities .
Once again , his life was saved by the intervention of the same monk .
At age 68 , Aiger finally succeeded in suicide , a pistol doing the trick .
His funeral ceremony was conducted by the same Capuchin monk - a man whose name Aiger never even knew .
In 1858 , Robert Fallon was shot dead , an act of vengeance by those with whom he was playing poker .
Fallon , they claimed , had won the $ 600 pot through cheating .
With Fallon 's seat empty and none of the other players willing to take the now - unlucky $ 600 , they found a new player to take Fallon 's place and staked him with the dead man 's $ 600 .
By the time the police had arrived to investigate the killing , the new player had turned the $ 600 into $ 2,200 in winnings .
The police demanded the original $ 600 to pass on to Fallon 's next of kin - only to discover that the new player turned out to be Fallon 's son , who had not seen his father in seven years !
When Norman Mailer began his novel Barbary Shore , there was no plan to have a Russian spy as a character .
As he worked on it , he introduced a Russian spy in the U.S. as a minor character .
As the work progressed , the spy became the dominant character in the novel .
After the novel was completed , the U.S. Immigration Service arrested a man who lived just one floor above Mailer in the same apartment building .
He was Colonel Rudolf Abel , alleged to be the top Russian spy working in the U.S. at that time .

In 1953 , television reporter Irv Kupcinet was in London to cover the coronation of Ellizabeth II .
In one of the drawers in his room at the Savoy he found found some items that , by their identification , belonged to a man named Harry Hannin .
Coincidentally , Harry Hannin - a basketball star with the famed Harlem Globetrotters - was a good friend of Kupcinet's .
But the story has yet another twist .
Just two days later , and before he could tell Hannin of his lucky discovery , Kupcinet received a letter from Hannin .
In the letter , Hannin told Kucinet that while staying at the Hotel Meurice in Paris , he found in a drawer a tie - with Kupcinet 's name on it !

After signing the register and being given his key to room 307 , he stopped by the mail desk to see if any letters had arrived for him .
Indeed there was a letter , the mail girl told him , and handed him an envelope addressed to Mr. George D. Bryson , room 307 .
This would n't be so odd , except the letter was not for him , but for room 307's just - previous occupant - another man named George D. Bryson .

In 1912 the Titanic , a transatlantic luxury liner widely touted as unsinkable strikes an iceberg and sinks with great loss of life on her maiden voyage .
In the Book , the Month of the Wreck was April , same as in the real event .
There were 3,000 passengers on the book ; in reality , 2,207 .
In the Book , there were 24 Lifeboats ; in reality , 20 .
Months after the Titanic sank , a tramp steamer was traveling through the foggy Atlantic with only a young boy on watch .
It came into his head that it had been thereabouts that the Titanic had sunk , and he was suddenly terrified by the thought of the name of his ship - the Titanian .
Panic - stricken , he sounded the warning .
The ship stopped , just in time : a huge iceberg loomed out of the fog directly in their path .
The Titanian was saved .

The speed with which the fire spread caught many people unawares
Officials raised the death toll from the fires over the past two days to 46 .
Searches of burnt cars , houses and fields were still turning up the remains of those who could not escape .
Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis called the situation " an unspeakable tragedy " .
The government appealed for EU help and later declared a state of emergency .
Greek newspapers are calling the southern Peloponnese region a " crematorium " , says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens .
The fires have been moving so fast that people have been cut off before they could escape .
With emergency services overstretched , desperate residents and local officials called television and radio stations to appeal for help .
We are living through an unspeakable tragedy today
Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis
In pictures : Forest fires Witnesses tell of fire horror
Some of the worst fires are concentrated along an 80 km ( 50 mile ) stretch on the west coast of the Peloponnese to Mani in the very south of the peninsula .
But others are burning across the country .
Two new fires broke out near Athens , forcing a road between the city and its airport to be closed
A monastery and homes were evacuated as flames closed in on the capital
Arson was suspected in several cases , with 20 new fires starting during the night , a fire department spokesman said
All top football matches were postponed on the opening weekend of the season
France responded to Greece 's appeal for help , sending two water - dropping planes , which were scheduled to arrive on Saturday afternoon , AFP reported
Family found
At least nine people are reported to have burnt to death in their cars as they attempted to flee the flames near the town of Zaharo , west of the Peloponnese .
The Associated Press reported that a car had crashed into a fire engine , causing a traffic jam from which people could not escape as the flames advanced .
Zaharo seemed to be the centre of the disaster .
Fire crews said they had found at least 30 bodies in villages near the town , as they searched burned out cars and houses .
" It 's a tragedy , " an eyewitness told Greek television .
" I can see the burnt bodies of a mother holding her child in her arms .
Further away there are more bodies .
It 's terrible . "
Fire officials confirmed that a mother and her four children had perished , as had three firefighters .
A local prefect close to the scene described it as horrific .
" The situation is extremely dire ...
The speed with which this fire has been spreading is astonishing , " said the mayor of Zaharo , Pantazis Chronopoulos .
Six deaths were confirmed in the seaside town of Areopolis in the Mani region of Greece 's deep south .
Hotels and several villages have been evacuated , fire officials said .
' Incredible efforts '
But hot , dry winds were expected to continue through Saturday , gusting up to gale force and fanning the flames .
The winds hampered the use of fire - fighting planes , though some helicopters have managed to take flight .
Fires have consumed hillsides in Taygetos , in southern Greece
" The helicopters are operating whenever the weather conditions permit ...
The pilots are making incredible efforts , " fire department spokesman Nikos Diamandis said .
The overstretched fire services are being helped by the military , but our correspondent says troops do not seem trained or equipped for the task , and are no match for the intense flames .
A hot , dry summer , with temperatures recently touching 40C ( 104 F ) has left much of the country vulnerable .
On the island of Evia , north of the capital , three villages were evacuated as a fire approached .
" If we do n't stop this now there will be nothing left , " said Sofia Moutsou , mayor of the town of Styra .
Friday and Saturday have been the deadliest days of a terrible summer spent battling forest fires , transforming what had previously been seen as predominantly an ecological disaster into a human one , our correspondent says .
There has been widespread public anger at the government 's response , which many have criticised as inadequate and slow .
Prime Minister Karamanlis visited Zaharo late on Friday , and was to chair an emergency meeting in Athens on Saturday .
He is under considerable political pressure , as he faces an early general election in three weeks ' time .

On our way to Maine one summer , my older son and I found ourselves following one of the most ridiculous looking cars I have ever seen .
It was a sports utility vehicle , laden with all the evidence of American consumerism and conspicuous consumption .
Lashed onto the top were a canoe and a kayak .
Strapped onto the back bumper were four bicycles .
Golf clubs , tennis rackets , and camping equipment were visible through the Jeep ’s back window .
Every car that passed by stared in astonishment at this visible study in recreational excess .
The thing I found most remarkable about the vehicle in front of us was that we owned it .
My husband and younger son were driving our Jeep up to Maine , and we followed .
After staring at our car for some miles , and noticing the attention it was attracting from drivers - by , I decided that this was an auspicious moment to have a discussion with my older child about “ nonmaterialism . ”
I explained , trying to keep a straight face , that his father and I were dedicated to an ethic of simplicity , diminishing consumption , and intentional reduction in material accumulation .
My son greeted this pronouncement with hysterical laughter .
Even I had to chuckle .
But I was persistent , and after his raucous laughter subsided , I explained how , throughout our married life we had , both of us , consistently chosen jobs that paid less , even when we were offered positions that paid more ; how we had invested our modest resources into education and travel rather than in real estate and furniture ; and how we tried constantly to decrease our dependence and reliance on material wealth .
Notwithstanding the visual evidence to the contrary , we were working to simplify our lifestyle .
Robert listened to everything I said , and then he replied , “ I understand Mom .
You and Dad are nonmaterialistic .
You just are n’t very good at it . ”
Conservative bloggers try to link Michael Moore to UK terror attempts Michael Roston

In reaction to the terrorist attack on the Glasgow airport in Scotland and seemingly related attempts in London , several conservative bloggers attempted to draw a connection between filmmaker Michael Moore and his film Sicko with the bombers , two of whom appeared to be doctors .
British news outlets revealed Sunday that two of the people detained by United Kingdom authorities were doctors .
" Two of the five terror suspects being held in the wake of the failed car bombings in London and Glasgow are hospital doctors working in the UK , " reported Sky News .
A number of right wing bloggers seized on the information and connected it to Moore 's new film Sicko .
The film criticizes the for profit health insurance system in the United States , and praises the United Kingdom 's state - run health care system .
One writer , Mark Steyn , who contributes to the National Review Online 's Corner blog , posted an e-mail he received in order to identify the connection between Moore 's Sicko and the British terrorists .
" ' Would these be Doctors who work for the U.K. health care system so lavishly praised by Michael Moore ? ... Perhaps they are not Jihadists at all but simply men driven insane by their employer ?
Maybe Michael Moore has spawned an entirely new breed of suicide bomber  the alienated UK health care worker ' "
Steyn quotes from one e-mail , after noting " I 've been getting more than a few letters along these lines . "
He also posted a second e-mail , and observed , " Now that Dr Mohammed Asha has been arrested in the Glasgow / London terrorist investigation , several readers have noticed that this artfully combines Michael Moore 's two most recent enthusiasms , ' insurgents ' and socialized health care . "
Steyn , however adds , " Mr Moore has yet to call these medico - jihadists ' Minutemen . ' "
The National Review's The Corner was not the only leading conservative website to try to link Moore with the British attacks .
" It seems like terrorists who really wanted to frighten Brits would have a field day by killing patients with just enough plausibility towards seeming like natural deaths .
It certainly will give patients a new reason to feel uncomfortable about going to hospital , " wrote Ed Morrisey at the blog Captain 's Quarters .
" I wonder what Michael Moore would make of this ? "
The message was echoed at a less trafficked blog .
" Is this the same British medical system praised by Michael Moore in his latest agitprop movie ? " asked Rick Moore of HolyCoast .
" I guess the Hippocratic Oath does n't apply to Muslims . "
ALBANY , April 25 — Gov. Eliot Spitzer plans to introduce legislation to overhaul the state ’s pioneering but antiquated abortion law , shoring up a woman ’s right to an abortion in New York State .
The move comes in the wake of the United States Supreme Court ’s decision last week to uphold the federal Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act , as several other states are moving to tighten restrictions on abortion .
It harks back to New York ’s early role in legalizing abortion — and could take on much broader significance if the Supreme Court were ever to return the matter to the discretion of the states .
But the legislation is far from a certainty to win the support of the Republican - led State Senate .
New York ’s abortion law , signed by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller , a Republican , in 1970 , predated the Roe v.
Wade decision by three years and made New York the second state after Hawaii to broadly legalize the procedure — and the first to allow abortions for out - of - state residents .
More than half of the women having abortions came from out of state in the first two years .
But the law is now considered out of date by abortion rights advocates .
Mr. Spitzer ’s bill , the Reproductive Health and Privacy Protection Act , would update the current law , which — for example — does not include a provision allowing for abortions late in pregnancies to protect a woman ’s health .
State laws on the books also consider abortion a homicide , with broad exceptions allowed .
You know the answer to that one already .
The Republican it 's coming from this time is Bill Sali , Idaho 's first congressional district representative who first said this :
" We have not only a Hindu prayer being offered in the Senate , we have a Muslim member of the House of Representatives now , Keith Ellison from Minnesota .
Those are changes -- and they are not what was envisioned by the Founding Fathers , " asserts Sali ....
According to Congressman Sali , the only way the U.S. can continue to survive is under that protective hand of God .
He states when a Hindu prayer is offered , " that 's a different god " and that it " creates problems for the longevity of this country . "
then followed up in a " clarification " to a local paper by saying :
multiculturalism is in conflict with the national motto " E Pluribus Unum , " or " out of many , one . "
He said multiculturalism would mean " out of the many , the many . "
" The question is , is multiculturalism good or not ? "
Sali said .
" I do n’t think the Founding Fathers were multicultural .
Multiculturalism is the antithesis of ( the motto ) . "
Sali said the United States was founded on principles derived primarily from the Scriptures .
And he said drifting away from those principles could put the country in danger .
" If we ’re going to move away from those principles ... we better consider the blessings of God that have been bestowed on this country and the protective hand of God that ’s been over this country , " Sali said .
Having come under fire in Idaho ( one paper called him a " Capitol Hill sideshow " ) and nationally for his bigoted remarks , Sali has extended an " apology " to Congressman Ellison .
Sali responded days later , sending Ellison an e-mail explaining he meant no offense .
" He said that he wanted to make sure that Congressman Ellison understood that he meant no harm or disrespect , " Sali spokesman Wayne Hoffman said .
Meant no harm .
Uh huh .
Rep. Ellison graciously accepted the apology , but that has to leave a lot of people hanging .
First of all , the people of the state of Idaho -- the majority of whom ( I promise ) do n't enjoy being embarrassed on the national stage , despite the propensity they have to sending embarrassing types to D.C .
Then there 's all the non-white , non-Christian citizens of the country who Sali apparently considers detrimental to our national experiment .
Sali's got a lot more apologizing to do , and next time a little sincerity would be appreciated .
Gen Musharraf faces increasing unrest and opposition at home
A spokesman said there was pressure on Gen Musharraf to declare an emergency but that he had decided not to because he was " committed to democracy " .
Earlier reports said the issue was being discussed because of external and internal threats to the country .
US President George W Bush urged Pakistan to hold free and fair polls .
On Wednesday Gen Musharraf abruptly called off a key visit to Afghanistan .
" No state of emergency is being imposed in Pakistan , " Federal Minister for Information Mohammad Ali Durrani told Pakistani television .
Elections are the president 's priority

" There was pressure on the president to impose emergency due to the situation in the country , but he is committed to furthering democracy and will not take any such step .
" He was being ill advised by some people .
He has decided against declaring the emergency .
Elections are the president 's priority , " Mr Durrani said .
Opposition and media figures said the suggestion of emergency rule was related to Gen Musharraf ''s desire to be re-elected for another term as both president and head of the army , said the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad .
' Difficult circumstances '
The discussion came as Pakistan faces an increasingly volatile political and security situation .
The emergency is a big step and the government should think twice before enforcing it
Benazir Bhutto ,
Opposition leader
Tensions soared last month after a siege by government troops of Islamabad 's radical Red Mosque ended with the deaths of more than 100 people .
Separately , in a move seen as a serious blow to the president , Pakistan 's Supreme Court reinstated the country 's chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry .
Mr Chaudhry , who was suspended by Gen Musharraf amid claims of corruption , became the focus of opposition to the president with lawyers staging protests demanding his reinstatement .
Pakistani opposition leader Javed Hashmi , a fierce critic of Gen Musharraf who had been jailed on charges of sedition , was also freed from prison on Saturday after the Supreme Court ordered his release on bail .
Speculation
Junior Information Minister Tariq
Azeem said emergency rule was being discussed , given external and internal threats to the country .
" The possibility of the enforcement of emergency , like other possibilities , is under discussion , " he said .
He said US threats to launch an operation in the tribal areas and the recent targeting of Chinese nationals by Islamic militants had played a role in the issue being discussed .
" In addition , the situation on the borders and the suicide attacks are also a concern , " Mr Azeem added .
Elections threat
Emergency rule would have limited the role of the courts , restricted civil liberties and curbed freedom of expression .
The president would have also been able to postpone national elections due to be held later in 2007 , which could have enabled him to continue in his role as chief of Pakistan 's powerful military .
Opposition political parties , like Pakistan 's largest party , the PPP , want Gen Musharraf to give up the role .
" The emergency is a big step and the government should think twice before enforcing it , " said former Prime Minister and PPP leader Benazir Bhutto .
Gen Musharraf pulled out of the three - day Afghan council , or jirga , on combating the Taleban , citing commitments in Islamabad .
Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is attending in his place .
Up to 700 tribal elders , Islamic clerics and leaders of both countries are invited to the council , starting on Thursday , which will discuss terrorism .
The Taleban have not been included , and are calling for a boycott of the event .
Caitlin Snaring of Redmond , Washington , is the new National Geographic Bee champion .
The home schooled eighth grader won by knowing which Vietnamese city , split by a river with the same name , was an imperial capital for more than a century .
( Answer : Hue . )
Snaring is only the second girl to win the national championship , and the first since 1990 .
" I knew that I had the upper hand today , " Snaring , who faced off with nine boys to claim the top spot , told National Geographic News .
" I saw every answer in my head . "
Following the competition , she was presented with the first place prize : a $ 25,000 U.S. college scholarship and lifetime membership in the National Geographic Society .
Suneil Iyer of Kansas battled Snaring through the final round , but finally had to settle for second place and a $ 15,000 scholarship award .
Mark Arildsen of Tennessee took third place with a $ 10,000 scholarship .
Sole Survivor
Snaring emerged as the sole survivor out of more than five million fourth to eighth graders who participated in National Geographic Bee competitions nationwide .
Moderated as always by Jeopardy game show host Alex Trebek , the bee finals were held yesterday and today at National Geographic headquarters in Washington , D.C .
Fifty - five state and territorial champions went into Tuesday 's elimination rounds , with the top ten advancing to the finals .
Bee rules allow each contestant to get one wrong answer before being eliminated on their second miss .
Snaring was the only contestant to not miss a single question either day .
" It [ has ] taken years , but there 's a girl up here , " Trebek said as he called Snaring to the stage to receive her award .
Experience Counts
Each of the top three finishers had competed in the national finals before .
Ten of the 55 contestants had been state champions in previous years , and 7 of those 10 survived elimination and made it into Wednesday 's championship round .
The three first - time state champions to reach the finals were Solomon Mayer of Kentucky , Tyler Bowen of Oklahoma , and Benjamin Taylor of West Virginia .
All three were eliminated in the fifth round of questions , leaving only the more experienced contestants to vie for the championship .
Andrew Lee of Alaska stumbled in round seven .
Lee 's question : Burushaski , a language isolate — meaning that it is not related to any other known languages — is spoken in the Gilgit District of what country containing part of the Karakoram Range ?
( Answer : Pakistan . )
In round nine , remaining finalists were given a series of five place names .
Four were related in some way , and contestants had to name the one that did not belong and also state why .
Colorado's Antonio de la Peña failed to single out Adelaide as a city in South Australia , listed among four other cities in Queensland state .
Arildsen missed noting that the Nubian Desert is in Africa .
The four other deserts listed are in Asia .
And Puerto Rico's Francisco Vargas was eliminated by not naming the Cook Strait as the only one of the five straits mentioned not located in the Northern Hemisphere .
That left only Snaring and Iyer in contention for the championship .
But first , a tense elimination round for third place was held among de la Peña , Arildsen , and Vargas .
After de la Peña faltered early , Arildsen and Vargas each answered a series of questions correctly .
Finally , Vargas faltered on the following question :
The Ogaden is a dry , sparsely populated region that was fought over by Ethiopia and what bordering country in the 1970s ?
( Answer : Somalia . )
Final Showdown
To claim the championship , Snaring finally wore down Iyer by answering all of her final questions correctly :
• What is the Arabic term for a valley in the hot desert areas of northern Africa and the Middle East that carries a stream occasionally ?
( Answer : wadi . )
• In late March 2007 , Protestant and Catholic political leaders from Northern Ireland agreed to form a power - sharing government that took effect in early May 2007 .
The leaders met in what city that lies at the mouth of the Lagan River ?
( Answer : Belfast . )
• The second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa is also the richest Portuguese - speaking country in Africa .
Name this country .
( Answer : Angola . )
• Lampedusa , an island whose geographical location has made it a target for illegal immigrants seeking to enter the European Union from Africa , is administered by which country ?
( Answer : Italy . )
• A city that is divided by a river of the same name was the imperial capital of Vietnam for more than a century .
Name this city , which is still an important cultural center .
( Answer : Hue . )
Traci Snaring , Caitlins mother , said that after last year 's competition , she asked her daughter if she really wanted to go through the pressure of competing again .
But Caitlin had made up her mind .
" She took one day off after the bee last year , and then she started studying , " Traci Snaring said .
Asked if she could explain the lack of girls among the bee finalists , Caitlin Snaring said she thought many were more attracted by spelling bees .
One hopes the leader of the free world has n’t really , truly lost touch with objective reality .
But one does have to wonder .
Last week , George W. Bush invited nine conservative pundits to the White House for what amounted to a pep talk , with the president providing all the pep .
Somehow I was left off the list — must have been an oversight .
Some of the columnists who attended have been writing about the meeting or describing it to colleagues , and their accounts are downright scary .
National Review ’s Kate O’Beirne , who joined the presidential chat in the Roosevelt Room , told me that the most striking thing was the president ’s incongruously sunny demeanor .
Bush ’s approval ratings are well below freezing , the nation is sooooo finished with his foolish and tragic war , many of his remaining allies in Congress have given notice that come September they plan to leave the Decider alone in his private Alamo — and the president remains optimistic and upbeat .
Bush was “ not at all weary or anguished ” and in fact “ very energized , ” wrote Michael Barone of U.S. News and World Report .
He was “ as confident and upbeat as ever , ” observed Rich Lowry of National Review .
“ Far from being beleaguered , Bush was assertive and good - humored , ” according to David Brooks of The New York Times .
Excuse me ?
I guess now he must be in an even better mood , since the feckless Iraqi government announced its decision to take the whole month of August off while U.S. troops continue fighting and dying in Baghdad ’s 130 - degree summer heat .
It ’s almost as if Bush were trying to apply the principles of cognitive therapy , the system developed by psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck in the 1960s .
Beck found that getting patients to banish negative thoughts and develop patterns of positive thinking was helpful in pulling them out of depression .
However , Beck was trying to get the patients to see themselves and the world realistically , whereas Bush has left realism far behind .
“ He says the most useful argument to make in support of his policy is to show what failure would mean , ” Barone wrote of the president and Iraq .
“ It would mean an ascendant radicalism , among both Shia and Sunni Muslims , and it would embolden sponsors of terrorism such as Iran .
Al - Qaeda would be emboldened and would be able to recruit forces . ”
Excuse me again ?
This is what Bush believes would happen ?
Has n’t he noticed that these catastrophes have already befallen us ?
And that they are the direct consequence of his decision to invade and occupy Iraq ?
At a news conference last week , someone tried to point this out .
Bush replied with such a bizarre version of history that I hope he was being cynical and does n’t really believe what he said : “ Actually , I was hoping to solve the Iraqi issue diplomatically .
That ’s why I went to the United Nations and worked with the United Nations Security Council , which unanimously passed a resolution that said disclose , disarm or face serious consequences .
That was the message , the clear message to Saddam Hussein .
He chose the course . …
It was his decision to make . ”
Let ’s see , we have learned that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction .
That means Bush is claiming that Saddam Hussein “ chose ” the invasion — and , ultimately , his own death — by not showing us what he did n’t have .
“ Bush gives the impression that he is more steadfast on the war than many in his own administration and that , if need be , he ’ll be the last hawk standing , ” wrote Lowry .
The president says the results of his recent troop escalation will be evaluated by Gen.
David Petraeus , wrote Barone , and not by “ the polls . ”
Translation : Everybody ’s out of step but me .
One of the more unnerving reports out of the president ’s seminar with the pundits came from Brooks , who quoted Bush as saying : “ It ’s more of a theological perspective .
I do believe there is an Almighty , and I believe a gift of that Almighty to all is freedom .
And I will tell you that is a principle that no one can convince me that does n’t exist . ”
It ’s bad enough that Osama bin Laden is still out there plotting bloody new acts of terrorism , convinced that God wants him to slay the infidels .
Now we know that the president of the United States believes God has chosen him to bring freedom to the world , that he refuses to acknowledge setbacks in his crusade and that he flat - out does n’t care what “ the polls ” — meaning the American people — might think .
I ’m having trouble seeing the bright side .
I think I need cognitive therapy .

Stephen Colbert , Michael Moore unite against CNN ' web of lies ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 20 , 2007 Print This Email This
In the spirit of " the enemy of my enemy is my friend , " filmmaker Michael Moore joined forces with Stephen Colbert to take on CNN in a segment on The Colbert Report Thursday night .
" Loyal viewers of the Report know there 's no love lost between me and CNN .
They are worse than the New York Times because I cannot line my birdcage with tapes of the Situation Room .
I 've tried , it 's not absorbent , " Colbert said .
" But I recently discovered in my disdain for CNN I have a strange bedfellow , Michael Moore , who for the past week has gone toe - to - toe with CNN over the facts of his new healthcare documentary , SiCKO . "
Earlier this month , Moore was engaged in a public spat with CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta over a report that claimed the film fudged facts with sloppy reporting .
After the report aired , CNN did acknowledge it had made one mistake .
" Wooo !
CNN admits it is a web of lies , " Colbert said .
Colbert called Moore a " mendacious , muckraking , loudmouth bully , " and accused him of being a sloppy dresser , before inviting the filmmaker to appear as a guest .
" It 's no secret , I 'm no fan ( of you ) , " Colbert told Moore .
" But the enemy of my enemy is my friend , and you really kicked CNN in the Blitzer on this one . "
Moore accused CNN of being beholden to its advertisers in the pharmaceutical industry in attacking his film .
" What 's wrong with that ?
Should pharmaceutical companies not advertise ? "
Colbert asked .
" Do we not get to know what 's going to cure our restless leg syndrome ? "
Moore said his film is meant to show " the other side of the story you 're not hearing on the nightly news . "

Russia plans to send a manned mission to the moon by 2025 and establish a permanent base shortly thereafter , the head of the Russian space agency Roskosmos said Friday .
" According to our estimates , we will be ready for a manned flight to the moon in 2025 , " Roskosmos chief Anatoly Perminov told state news agency RIA Novosti .
A station that could be inhabitedcould be built there between 2027 and 2032 , he said .
Russia had originally sought to join a U.S. plan to establish a moon base in 2024 .
But Perminov said earlier this year the U.S. rebuffed the offer tojointly explore the moon .
On Friday , Perminov said Russia plans to complete its section of the International Space Station by 2015 and will begin working on a modernization of the Soyuz spacecraft used to transport cosmonauts and equipment to the station .
While Russia will be refurbishing existing spacecraft , theU.S.is taking a different approach after the space station is finished — it plans to scrap the space shuttle program in favour of a new kind of spaceship to be called Orion .
An estimated timeline has NASA testing its first spaceships in 2009 ; making the first manned flight of Orion in 2014 ; landing the first four - person crew on the moon in 2020 ; and establishing its own moon base in 2024 .
The two nations are n't the only ones to have laid out ambitious plans to visit or establish a permanent base on the moon .
This year , China and Japan announced plans to send astronauts to the moon by 2022 and 2025 respectively .
India is also expected to develop technologies for manned space flight by 2015 and a moon flight by 2020 , according to the Asia Times .
Intel director does n't want US ' not torture ' tactics used on Americans David Edwards
Published : Sunday July 22 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an interview Sunday with Tim Russert on " Meet The Press " , the director of National Intelligence , Admiral Mike McConnell , parsed his words carefully on the President 's new " Executive Order " , and the use of torture on American citizens .
McConnell stated that whatever it is they do to the prisoners , it 's not torture and even if they used it on US citizens , there would be no permanent damage .
He would not go into what " enhanced interrogation measures " were , but did say he would not " want " a citizen to go through the process .
The United States will persist with techniques of interrogating terror suspects that have saved " countless lives , " but will stop short of torture , the top US spymaster said Sunday .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell refused to spell out whether methods such as the alleged practice of " waterboarding " were permitted under a new executive order of President George W. Bush .
" The United States does not engage in torture .
This executive order spells it out , " McConnell said on NBC television .
But he indicated that the implied threat of torture had reaped dividends in extracting life - saving information from detainees .
" And so this is a program where we capture someone known to be a terrorist , we need information that they possess , and it has saved countless lives , " McConnell said , without detailing any plots that might have been broken up .
" Because they believe these techniques might involve torture and they do n't understand them , they tend to speak to us in a very candid way . "
Under his order issued Friday , Bush forbade the Central Intelligence Agency to torture suspected terrorists in its detention and interrogation program instituted after the September 11 attacks of 2001 .
The order says that the CIA program , confirmed to exist in September 2006 , must abide by the Geneva Conventions on wartime detainees and directs the CIA director to enforce that standard .
It lists no specific practices that are affected , or punishments for violations , and does not describe in any further detail a secret CIA prison network that has drawn outrage from US allies in Europe .
Human rights groups said the executive order left out critical details , such as controversial tactics that administration officials often describe as " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
Those are said by critics and former detainees to include waterboarding , or simulated drowning , sleep deprivation , prolonged captivity in " stress positions " and sexual humiliation .
Bush spokesman Tony Snow said the order barred " cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment " and " acts of violence serious enough to be considered comparable to murder , torture , mutilation , and cruel and inhuman treatment . "
McConnell said that he had been " quite frankly appalled " at the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US guards at Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib jail .
" My view was America risked losing the moral high ground . "
But that was not a program administered by the CIA , and it was " not the program that the president approved in the recent executive order . "
Fewer than 100 people have been subject to enhanced interrogations , and they were kept under medical supervision and " not abused in any way , " McConnell added .
However , Human Rights Watch slammed Bush 's new order as " contrary to the Geneva Conventions " because it essentially affirmed CIA secret detentions , a program which is " illegal to its core , " according to a statement .
" The key aspect of this is all the parts that are n't said , " added Jennifer Daskal , HRW senior counter - terrorism counsel , who charged that the order allowed " a system of incommunicado detention to continue , with the blessing of the president . "
" What we have here is an administration basically reciting a number of legal principles and saying ' trust us . '
And that 's hard to take from an administration that refuses to renounce waterboarding , " she said .
CIA director Michael Hayden told employees in a statement that the order was necessary to ensure that detentions and interrogations were in step with recent US Supreme Court rulings .
" Simply put , the information developed by our program has been irreplaceable , " he also said .

Transcript of interview : # MR .
RUSSERT : Our issues this Sunday -- what is the real terrorist threat to the United States homeland ?
How good is our intelligence gathering , and nearly six years after September 11th , why is Osama bin Laden still at large ?
With us -- the director of National Intelligence , Admiral Mike McConnell , in his first television interview .
Then -- briefings , debates , and votes -- the Iraq war front and center .
With us , Democratic senator from Wisconsin , Russ Feingold .
And in our roundtable , insight and analysis from New York Times Columnist , David Brooks ; The Washington Post , Bob Woodward ; and The Weekly Standard , Stephen Hayes , author of " Change , The Untold Story of America 's Most Powerful and Controversial Vice President . "
But , first , this week , this document , the National Intelligence Estimate entitled " The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland , " was released .
How serious is this threat and what can we do about it ?
Joining us for an exclusive interview is the director of National Intelligence , Admiral Mike McConnell -- welcome .
MR .
MCCONNELL : Thank you .
MR .
RUSSERT : Let me show you a key judgment from this report , " We judge the U.S. homeland will face a persistent and evolving terrorist threat over the next three years . "
In laymen 's language , for the American viewers watching today , what is the most serious threat facing our country ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : Tim , the most serious threat is that the plotters that are being observed will be successful in penetrating our defenses and conducting an attack that would result in mass casualties .
Their intent is to effect and attack with mass casualties .
A secondary attempt would be a political or infrastructure targets to even include economic targets that would have long - lasting impact .
MR .
RUSSERT : Is it biological and chemical , or did they achieve nuclear ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : They have not achieved nuclear based on our current understanding .
The intent is either chemical , biological , nuclear radiological , or even nuclear to include a nuclear yield .
I would add what we see currently is primarily a focus on explosives -- explosives that can generate a large explosion , but they 're put together with commercially available material .
MR .
RUSSERT : Why are n't we seeing more suicide bombers the way we see in the Middle East ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : In the United States , you mean ?
The efforts that the United States and our allies have gone through over the past five years have been significant in establishing barriers .
So the terrorists perceive us as a much more difficult target , very different from what it was at 9/11 .
So barriers have been established , databases have been established , the National Counterterrorism Center , which conducts three times a day a teleconference with all the players -- federal level , state level , international -- to try to coordinate these things , and if someone can be identified , they 'll be taken out of the pipeline in their process to come into the United States .
MR .
RUSSERT : Let me read another key judgment , " Although we have discovered only a handful of individuals in the United States with ties to al Qaeda 's senior leadership since September 11th , we judge that al Qaeda will intensify its efforts to put operatives here . "
But there are people in the United States , you are saying , who have direct ties to al Qaeda senior leadership ?
MR . MCCONNELL : The way we describe it is we have strategic warning , we know what al Qaeda and their safe haven in Pakistan intends to do .
We 're watching them train and recruit , and their effort is to put someone inside the United States .
There have been some clues in some cases where there would be attack , but we do not have tactical warning currently that there are sleeper cells tied directly to al Qaeda inside the United States .
So we have the strategic warning not the specific tactical warning , but we know their intent .
MR .
RUSSERT : But you say there are handfuls of individuals in the United States with ties to al Qaeda senior leadership .
MR .
MCCONNELL : That 's correct , and that 's in the form of raising money or being sympathetic to .
But we have n't identified individuals who are actively plotting or planning .
But there have been some that have been sympathetic to al Qaeda 's cause .
MR .
RUSSERT : Do you believe there are sleeper cells in the U.S. ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : I worry that there are sleeper cells in the U.S. I do not know .
There is no specific on a sleeper cell .
There are some elements under surveillance because we 're not sure , so it 's warranted -- court - approved , warranted surveillance .
We have some ties .
This is what I meant when I said we 've raised the barriers and made it more difficult .
MR .
RUSSERT : This intelligence report that came out this month raised a lot of concern and alarm in the U.S. , and it seems to be in stark contrast to the National Intelligence Estimate from last April -- this one .
Let me read that key judgment to you , " United States - led counterterrorism efforts have seriously damaged leadership of al Qaeda and disrupted its operations .
We assess the global jihadist movement is decentralized ; lacks a coherent global strategy ; is becoming more diffuse .
That seems so different than your assessment in July of ' 07 .
What a difference a year makes .
What changed ?
We were told that the al Qaeda had been , in many ways , close to being destroyed or dismantled .
MR .
MCCONNELL : Following the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 , about two - thirds of al Qaeda 's not only leadership but their soldiers , the foot soldiers , had been eliminated .
And at that point in time , that was an accurate assessment of where we were .
Now , what happened ?
What 's different ?
What changed ?
In Pakistan , where they 're enjoying a safe haven -- the government of Pakistan chose to try a political solution .
A political solution meant a peace treaty with the region that 's never been governed -- not governed from the outside , not governed by Pakistan .
The opposite occurred .
Instead of pushing al Qaeda out , the people who live in these federally administered travel areas , rather than pushing al Qaeda out , they made a safe haven for training and recruiting .
And so in that period of time , al Qaeda has been able to regain some of its momentum .
The leadership is intact , they have operational planners , and they have safe haven .
The thing they 're missing are operatives inside the United States .
So that 's the difference between last year and this year in our assessment .
MR .
RUSSERT : Why have n't we captured Osama bin Laden ?
MR. MCCONNELL : Think about attempting to capture a single human being whose primary purpose and emphasis is to remain unobserved or hidden .
It 's a very difficult challenge .
From having been in intelligence for most of my professional life , it 's not difficult to find something large -- an armored division , ships that are being built or airplanes or whatever , but a single human being that wants to be unobserved , who is being assisted in that process , it just makes it very , very difficult .
MR .
RUSSERT : If we captured Osama bin Laden , we might lose General Musharraf and Pakistan because of unrest such apprehension might create in his country .
Would it be worth losing Musharraf but apprehending Osama bin Laden ?
MR. MCCONNELL : Well , first , I would n't agree that if we capture or kill Osama bin Laden it would be a particularly increased or direct threat to President Musharraf .
President Musharraf is one of our strongest allies .
He agrees with capturing or killing Osama bin Laden , and while he tried the political arrangement , the peace agreement , last fall , he has made decisions over the last few weeks -- you are aware of the Red Mosque and cleaning that out -- and he 's gone on the offensive to go back into this federally administered travel area , FATA , is the shorthand we use to refer to it .
Now , in doing that , there 's been a price .
He has lost already , I would say , 100 troops .
Broadly , across Pakistan , the number is probably approaching 300 from suicide bombs and roadside attacks .
So there is a price to pay , but President Musharraf is a moderate , he has a moderate view , and he is attempting to cause the nation of Pakistan to rally around a moderate 's view to eliminate the extremists .
MR .
RUSSERT : If his government fell , how detrimental would it be to the U.S. ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : It would have severe impact .
It would depend -- if it fell , it depends on who would replace him .
It 's a democratic nation , if they continue down this current path , so if the process of turnover happens in a democratic way , it may not have severe impact .
One of the things that I would like to highlight , however , is President Musharraf is one of our most valued allies , and let me just highlight this -- Probably , the majority of the senior leadership have been captured or killed or is the direct result of assistance and cooperation and participation by the Pakistanis .
MR .
RUSSERT : Are you convinced Osama bin Laden is alive ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : We have not heard from Osama bin Laden for over a year .
There 's a recent video where he appeared .
Many people thought that was current .
That was actually old videotape .
So it 's been a year .
There are rumors about his illness .
My personal view is that he 's alive , but we do n't know because we can't confirm it for over a year .
MR .
RUSSERT : And living in Pakistan ?
MR . MCCONNELL : I believe he is in the tribal region of Pakistan , and how he conducts his affairs , only speaking to a courier , staying complete removed from anything we could exploit to find him , I think he 's in that region .
MR .
RUSSERT : Let me ask you about the executive order the president issued about enhanced interrogation measures .
What does that allow a CIA - held target ?
What kind of measures can you use to get information from them ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : Well , Tim , as you know , I can't discuss specific measures .
There 's a variety of reasons for that .
One , if I announce what the specific measures are , it would aid those who want to resist those measures to train , to understand it , and so on , so I wo n't be too specific .
Let me go back to a higher calling in this context .
The United States does not engage in torture .
The president has been very clear about that .
The executive order spells it out .
There are means and methods to conduct interrogation that will result in information that we need , and what I would highlight -- I was concerned and worried and , quite frankly , appalled by Abu Ghraib .
My view is America risked losing the moral high ground , and so I focused on this when I came back .
What I can report to you is that was an aberration .
The people who were responsible for the atrocities at Abu Ghraib have been held accountable , and they 're serving a sentence for that .
That is not the program the CIA was administering .
It is not the program that the president approved in the recent executive order .
MR .
RUSSERT : But by use of the term " enhanced interrogation measures , " there clearly are things that are used to elicit information .
Have we eliminated water - boarding ?
Can you confirm that ?
MR. MCCONNELL : I would rather not be specific on eliminating exactly what the techniques are with regard to any specific .
When I was in a situation where I had to sign off , as a member of the process , my name to this executive order , I sat down with those who have been trained to do it , doctors who monitor it , understanding that no one is subjected to torture .
They are treated in a way that they have adequate diet and not exposed to heat or cold , they are not abused in any way , but I did understand when exposed to the techniques how they work and why they work -- all under medical supervision , and one of the things that 's very important , I think , for the American public to know -- in the history of this program it 's been fewer than 100 people .
And so this is a program where we capture someone known to be a terrorist , we need information that they possess , and it has saved countless lives because they believe these techniques might involve torture , and they do n't understand them , they tend to speak to us , talk to us in a very candid way .
MR .
RUSSERT : Does this new executive order allow measures that if were used against a U.S. citizen who was apprehended by the enemy would be troubling to the American people ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : I can report to you that it 's not torture .
MR .
RUSSERT : How do you define torture ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : Well , torture is -- an attempt to define torture in the executive order gives examples of mutilation or murder or rape or physical pain , those kinds of things .
Let me just leave it by saying the techniques work .
It 's not torture , you 're not subjected to heat or cold , but it is effective , and it's a psychological approach to causing someone to have uncertainty and , in a situation where they will feel compelled to talk to you about what you 're asking on that .
MR .
RUSSERT : Then you would find it acceptable if a U.S. citizen experienced the same kind of enhanced interrogation measures ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : Tim , it 's not torture .
I would not want a U.S. citizen to go through the process , but it is not torture , and there would be no permanent damage to that citizen .
MR .
RUSSERT : Let me turn to Iraq , another key judgment from the National Intelligence Estimate , " We assess that its association with AQI , al Qaeda in Iraq , helps al Qaeda to energize the broader Sunni extremist community , raise resources and recruit and indoctrinate operatives including for homeland attacks . "
That seems to suggest that the Iraq War has been a very effective recruiting tool for al Qaeda .
MR .
MCCONNELL : It has served as a recruiting tool to draw additional terrorists into Iraq , but it 's a mutually beneficial situation for both organizations .
Now , the debate often is -- was al Qaeda in Iraq prior to the U.S. - led coalition invasion ?
Some members of those who associate with al Qaeda were there -- Zarqawi , who had served in Pakistan with Osama bin Laden , was the principal lead .
In 2004 he swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden .
As you know , he was subsequently killed about a year ago -- June 2006 .
The person that replaced him as sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden .
So al Qaeda finds it beneficial in that it's in the press .
It draws in recruits , and al Qaeda in Iraq found it beneficial because it unites in a broader context .
There 's one thing I think is very important is in the NIE that 's often overlooked -- there is an element of extremism in the Middle East that runs from North Africa down into South Africa into the Levant , Syria , into Iraq and over to Afghanistan , even Pakistan .
What al Qaeda has done is find a method for uniting those extremist views , and so what we see now is groups who are predisposed to extremism and terrorism are uniting under the al Qaeda banner .
MR .
RUSSERT : But al Qaeda is a much more robust and larger presence in Iraq now than it was before the war ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : That 's fair to say , that 's fair to say .
Now , but , let me just highlight one thing that 's also important --
At one point in the war , al Qaeda controlled the huge expanse to the west , it 's called Anbar Province .
What 's happened is because of the atrocities in their approach that leadership , tribal sheikhs in that region , collaborated with the coalition and turned on al Qaeda .
So has al Qaeda defeated in Iraq -- no .
But in some areas , they 're back on their heels for two reasons .
The local citizens have turned against -- Iraqi citizens have turned against al Qaeda , and the coalition has been much more effective .
As you know , the troops in this surge arrived in about the middle of June , and so the effort has been to take the fight to al Qaeda , and they have a very high level of success in doing that .
MR .
RUSSERT : In terms of the balance in Iraq , which creates more of the violence ?
Which is the greater cause for violence ?
The sectarian conflict or al Qaeda ?
MR. MCCONNELL : I think it is both .
In some cases , we even have Shi'a on Shi'a sectarian violence .
But , for the most part , it is Sunni versus Shi'a , and al Qaeda is the one that takes -- is the organization that attempts purposefully to serve as an accelerant attacking things like the mosque , the Grand Mosque that was destroyed over a year ago , and then revisiting with attacking the two minarets that were still up .
The whole purpose is something massive against the Shi'a or against something Shi'a holds sacred to act as an accelerant to stimulate the violence .
MR .
RUSSERT : But there seems to be , Admiral , a coordinated campaign by the administration to elevate al Qaeda is the threat in Iraq , and yet the Pentagon quarterly report , which came out in March , said this , " The conflict in Iraq has changed from a predominantly Sunni- led insurgency against foreign occupation to a struggle for the division of political and economic influence among sectarian groups and organized criminal activity , " the Pentagon quarterly report on Iraq to Congress .
The Pentagon report also said sectarian violence has become " the greatest impediment to the establishment of security and effective governance in Iraq . "
Do you agree with that ?
MR. MCCONNELL : I agree with that , it 's true .
But what I would highlight is al Qaeda is part of that sectarian violence , al Qaeda is part of that crime .
In some neighborhoods , it would be a classic shakedown -- " We will provide security if you give us money and resources . "
So al Qaeda is a major portion -- not the only .
It 's had significant impact , but there are other sectarian disagreements and criminal activity going on , as I mentioned , even Shi'a on Shi'a in some cases .
MR .
RUSSERT : Stephen Hayes has written his book on Vice President Cheney , and as I was reading it , I found an interview with you about your views of the administration and some of their methods of gathering intelligence , and I want to share that with you and have a chance to talk about it .
It says here , " In November of 2006 , Michael McConnell , who had been working on intelligence issues in the private sector since resigning from the NSA in ' 96 was asked to consider joining the Bush administration as the nation 's top intelligence official .
McConnell was honored to be asked but had serious reservations .
He had been unimpressed with many aspects of the Bush administration and its conduct of the war on terror , particularly what he felt was a politicized use of intelligence and lead - up to the war .
All of these current players , Secretary Rumsfeld , Vice President Cheney , and the president , ' McConnell said in an interview in late November ' 06 , ' must come through from me as a citizen .
I am no longer on active duty , so I can say these things .
They had , first and foremost , very strong political convictions .
My sense of it is their political faith and convictions influence how they took information and interpreted it , how they picked up and interpreted outside events .
As a former intel pro , when you do n't like the answer , and you set up your own thing , you tend to get the answer you want .
You hire people that think like you do or want to satisfy the boss .
I 've read much more about the current set of players , and they did set up a whole new interpretation because they did n't like the answers .
They got results that , in my view , now have been disastrous . ' "
That 's pretty harsh .
MR .
MCCONNELL : We 're all influenced by what we see and hear and read .
I am a concerned citizen .
I read those things and read those accounts .
What I was taking greatest exception to was to have a secondary unit established in the Pentagon to reinterpret information .
The problem I have with that is the way you do intelligence is all sources considered .
You have to factor one issue against another and balance it .
If you start an independent effort with a point of view , it 's not infrequent that you would take a single piece of data to make a point as opposed to consider everything .
So what I was referring to and talking about at that time is I was worried that in the Pentagon there had been established this separate unit , and I thought it would have been too influential .
Now , you can imagine , I consider myself an intelligence professional , I 've been doing this either on active duty or serving this community for 40 years .
The first responsibility of an intelligence professional is ground truth , and the second responsibility is to speak truth to power .
So when I was asked to consider this nomination , that was the condition under which I would consider it , and I focused on it very intently once I came back .
What I found , or what I discovered , was quite refreshing .
As you know , I meet with the president and vice president six days and , on occasion , seven days a week .
That dialog is open and frank and direct , and the thing that the president and the vice president frequently will do , whether they 're talking to me or one of the analysts that go in with me , is that we 're not telling you what to think or how to think or what your conclusion should be .
We need your information .
We can challenge your assumptions or your assessment , but we want to know what your opinion is .
MR .
RUSSERT : But leading up to the war in Iraq , you strongly suggest that many Americans believe that we went to war on Iraq on faulty intelligence , skewed intelligence , or cherry - picked intelligence .
MR .
MCCONNELL : I would just report what came out of the WMD commission and even the 9/11 commission , to some extent , the assessment that was concluded , I think it was October 2002 , determined or made an assessment that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
I believed it at the time , and I mostly believed it because of my experience as intelligence officer for General Powell in the first Gulf War .
I knew they had them , I knew Saddam had killed 300,000 of his own countrymen .
He had engaged in two wars .
He had those weapons , so I believed it .
What I believe happened is that the community allowed itself to be lulled into making the call on information , in some cases , from people who thought they had them -- even Saddam 's generals thought they had weapons of mass destruction .
So those threads took us to a place that turned out to be not valid .
MR .
RUSSERT : But did the policymakers hype the intelligence ?
MR .
MCCONNELL : That 's a judgment that I think the American people will have to make .
I have paid very close attention to hyping of intelligence , and what I can tell you from personal experience is the decision - makers are making every attempt to call it straightforward based on the information that we provide to them , and we are not being asked to cherry - pick or to go down one path or another path but to give them complete information or the best assessments we can .
MR .
RUSSERT : Admiral Mike McConnell , we thank you very much for coming here and sharing your views this morning .
MR .
MCCONNELL : Thank you so much . #

Affectionate passenger gets federal rap
A California man who prosecutors said got a little too friendly with his girlfriend during a flight was convicted Thursday of interfering with flight attendants and crew members .
Carl William Persing and his girlfriend were seen “ embracing , kissing and acting in a manner that made other passengers uncomfortable ” during the September flight from Los Angeles to Raleigh , according to a criminal complaint .
Persing twice threatened a flight attendant who told the couple to stop and refused to serve them alcohol , prosecutors said .
The FBI met the couple when the plane landed in Raleigh .
Persing , 41 , will probably serve jail time for the federal felony conviction , Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bowler said .
He was convicted after a three - day trial in U.S. District Court in Wilmington .
It seems like a very serious charge considering the nature of the crime committed , but at least there is now help available for convicts when it comes to getting their lives back on track after a jail sentence , such as RJFF Jobs which help them to find employment .
Defense attorney Deb Newton said her client will appeal .
“ He ’s devastated , ” Newton said , adding that he was defending his right to be left alone .
Charges against girlfriend Dawn Elizabeth Sewell , who was accused of assisting Persing , were dropped this week .
The most awkward position as a player is an intermediate player .
That is because you have moved from a beginner position but still have not acquired all skills for the next level .
Therefore , when it comes to selecting a paddle , it may be a tedious process unless you know what to consider .

The scene at RIAA headquarters this week must have been fascinating .
The group yesterday announced that it has finished sending out a new batch of 503 " pre-litigation letters " to 58 different universities around the US , generously offering to let students settle copyright infringement claims " at a discounted rate " before those claims go to trial .
The letters blanketed the country , going everywhere from the University of Hawaii to Swarthmore , from Boston College to Tulane , from Emory to Chico State .
And then the RIAA learned that its aggressive litigation tactics have placed it on the receiving end of a class action lawsuit .
Single mom Tanya Andersen , a defendant in a previous lawsuit brought by the RIAA , was one of the first to have her case dismissed with prejudice ( it can not be refiled at a later date ) .
Throughout the court battle , she maintained her total innocence , a claim given even more plausibility by the fact that she was charged with downloading numerous gangsta rap tracks .
After the case was dismissed , Andersen then sued the RIAA for malicious prosecution , and her attorney filed court documents in an Oregon federal court on Wednesday that seek to elevate the case to class action status .
The development , first reported by p2pnet , hopes to make a class out of those " who were sued or were threatened with sued by Defendants for file - sharing , downloading or other similar activities , who have not actually engaged in actual copyright infringement . "
In other words , a class of the innocent .
In the complaint , Andersen alleges that the RIAA " has engaged in a coordinated enterprise to pursue a scheme of threatening and intimidating litigation in an attempt to maintain its music distribution monopoly . "
Andersen is also going after the RIAA 's investigative arm , SafeNet , formerly known as MediaSentry .
This group allegedly " conducts illegal , flawed and negligent investigations for the RIAA and its controlled member companies " and has also been featured in past complaints .
Some of Andersen 's claims against the RIAA have been tried by other defendants who chose to fight back , but this is the first time that a judge has been asked to consolidate such lawsuits into a class action .
Proving many of these charges will be difficult .
Andersen alleges that the RIAA has violated the RICO racketeering act , but we have previously discussed why this will be hard to prove .
The charge of malicious prosecution could be a bit easier , though Andersen ( and other defendants , if the class is certified ) will have to show a pattern of willful behavior by the RIAA , something that could be very difficult without having an insider from the organization " flip . "
Should the case eventually be certified as a class action , it would bring a whole new kind of negative attention to the RIAA 's legal campaign .
The fact that the class specifically includes only those who have not committed copyright infringement will certainly go a long way toward making this look like a David v. Goliath redux .
Whether deserved or not , these sort of cases are giving the RIAA a reputation for suing innocent people , a perception that a class action suit would only heighten .
Expect a vigorous defense from the association .

Correction : April 29 , 2007
A chart last Sunday on daily gun deaths in the United States included an extraneous symbol in some editions .
The symbol , a bullet , represented a single death of a person over 40 .
There should have been 39 bullets depicted , as the text indicated , not 40 .
A month ago , the SEC put up a site to identify companies doing business with the likes of Iran , Syria and the Sudan .
Linking only to annual reports by the companies , the site allowed investors to read the companies ' own explanations , plans , and history .
The purpose of the web site was to give investors an opportunity to decide whether they wanted to invest in such companies .
Yesterday , at 5:00 pm , they took the site down .
The reasons -- incompetence on the Government 's side and pressure by the companies .
So much for the US government at work for you .
Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings , Part One : A Critique
Perhaps the hardest thing , for me , in preparing this web - page is having to view this movie over again .
I saw it with friends in the theatre when it first came out , within mere days of its ' opening , and loathed it .
I came across it again last year , stumbling across it in a video store , and found myself thinking , " Oh , it ca n't possibly be as bad as I remember . "
Sadly , I was right .
In fact , memory had softened the blow and the movie seemed substantially worse .
This will be the third time I 've felt compelled to endure this movie .
I will admit I do n't think the movie is completely bad ; there are one or two things here and there which did work .
It would also be incorrect to say that I do n't like Mr. Bakshi ; I admire the fact that he was willing to attempt the Herculean task of committing The Lord of the Rings to film .
I just wish he could have done a much better job .
WARNING : This review makes absolutely no attempt to be objective .
If Mr. Bakshi , or someone else associated with the making of the film , would like to post a rebuttal to this review or other related information , I 'll be happy to add it ( or a link to it ) to this server .
Part One : The Game Attempt .
For the initial third of the movie , the filmmakers make their best attempt to tell the story .
True , they get bogged down in unwieldy , half - given explanations and make it clear that exposition is not their strong suit , but at least they gamely make the attempt .
Part Two : Tolkien 's Greatest Hits .
Once arriving at Rivendell , the movie shifts gears ; it assumes it 's given enough exposition , and now drops the plot in order to start hitting the " high points " of Tolkien 's work .
To its credit , this means the characters actually begin to show a bit of the personality Tolkien infused them with .
Unfortunately , without an adequate framework of plot to tie the scenes together and give them coherence and meaning , the movie simply becomes more confusing .
" The Balrog never speaks or makes any vocal sound at all ... [ he ] may think he knows more about Balrogs than I do , but he cannot expect me to agree with him . "
Part Three : Let 's All Fight A Lot .
Having discovered that Boromir 's fight scenes were moderately effective , and that they could be shot with a minimum of character and exposition , the filmmakers finally abandon the plot to fend for itself and rely on more and more combat to keep the movie going .
Without the plot , though , the battles become so confused that even the filmmakers soon have trouble figuring out who 's winning .
A Final Observation .
Many of you reading this , having only seen the movie in revival screenings or on videotape , may not have been aware of one other unique aspect of its ' original release .
When In Doubt , Blame It On Technology

There seems to be a growing trend in the UK of people suspending their common sense when they get in a car and turn on GPS navigation units .
There are people driving off cliffs and through flooded roads and taking detours that span half of England , apparently at the behest of their navigation units .
Things got so bad in one place that authorities even had to put up " ignore your sat nav " signs .
Now , a woman 's car got hit by a train , and for some reason , she 's blaming a GPS navigation unit .
She says the device led her " right into the path of a speeding train " : she was driving to her boyfriend 's house , using the GPS for directions , when she came up to a metal gate with a red circle on it , marked with a " little sign saying , if the light is green , open the gates and drive through . "
She does n't say whether or not the light was green , just that she opened the gate , drove through , got out to shut the gate and heard a train coming , then she realized she was standing on a train crossing .
She got out of the way , but the train hit her car and carried it for half a mile .
She says she " ca n't completely blame " the GPS unit -- but it 's not clear why the GPS is to blame at all .
First , you 'd imagine that one would be cognizant enough of their surroundings to realize when they were at a railroad crossing .
Second , if it was n't obvious enough , is n't the problem really inadequate signage or a lack of other safety equipment ?
Of course , it 's easier to put the blame on the GPS , since it can only answer back by saying , " Left turn in 400 yards , " rather than own up to your own fault .
The hunt for extraterrestrial life should be dramatically expanded , a panel of scientists convened by the country ’s leading scientific advisory group said today , to include what they call “ weird life , ” organisms that lack DNA or other molecules found in life as we know it .
“ The committee ’s investigation makes clear that life is possible in forms different from those on Earth , ” the scientists concluded .
Their report , “ The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems , ” was published today by the National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences and posted on the NAS web site , www.nationalacademies.org.
Other experts hailed the report as an important rethinking of the search for life .
“ It ’s going to help us a lot to make sure we go exploring with our eyes wide open , ” said Michael Meyer , the Mars exploration program lead scientist at NASA .
Starfish , sequoias , salamanders , and the rest of Earth ’s residents seem very diverse .
But they ’re surprisingly similar on the molecular scale .
Every species scientists have studied needs liquid water to survive , for example .
They all rely on DNA to carry genetic information .
They all use that information to build proteins from the same set of building blocks , known as amino acids .

" The notion … that inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon is no longer a controversial proposition . "
– Alan Greenspan , January 3 , 2004
Caroline Baum recently noted that the Fed just does n't get the credit it deserves for the effect it has on overall economic conditions at any point in time .
[ 1 ]
And , as I often do ( because Ms. Baum is a rare bird for my brain ) I agree with her completely .
For example , out of the multitude of economic indicators we Wall Street natives pant and chant over , none is less apt to link " get the credit it deserves " and " Federal Reserve " in many people 's mind than inflation .
I hope to show that when it comes to inflation , the Federal Reserve Bank deserves every bit of the credit .
Inflation is widely talked about but little understood .
Apparently , even the very word " inflation " has lost its scientific rigidity , turning all mushy definitionwise . [ 2 ]
A multitude of its effects are said to be its cause ; an absurdity in logic , but what can we expect from mere mortals ?
Considering the fact that a man with a reputation for a deep understanding of economics , such as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , can blame oil for inflation ( " a significant increase in energy prices can simultaneously slow economic growth while raising inflation " [ 3 ] ) in direct contradiction to such notable — and correct — scholars as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ( " the main reason for high inflation rates is the rapid rates of money growth " [ 4 ] ) it is clear that when it comes to the subject of inflation we 're all in a serious intellectual slump .
How can we " fight " inflation if we pretend not to have even a clear idea of its cause ?
Despite such obfuscation , we have established , straight from the harsh school of repeated experience , that inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon .
Not even the best minds that our Ivy League schools can timestamp fail to concur with this economic axiom .
A man who debates it is a man who will proclaim the Earth to be flat .
Repeat after me : there is no debate that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon .
Even if we 're all dead and not around to live with the inflation that an ever distant " long run " is sure to bring , it is caused by the growth in monetary aggregates , or , as Mr. Greenspan puts it , the " persistent over - issuance of money . "
And it should be superfluous for me to mention that since the Federal Reserve Bank , as per its website , " conduct (s ) the nation 's monetary policy by influencing the monetary and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of … stable prices " [ 5 ] that if inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon than it follows that the organization that " conduct (s ) the nation 's monetary policy by influencing the monetary and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of … stable prices " is directly responsible for inflation . [ 6 ]
Murray Rothbard once wrote of " the widely held misconception among historians that central banks serve , and are looked upon , as restraints upon state or private bank inflation . " [ 7 ]
Yet this misconception seems to be widely held today amongst non-historians , too .
Recently a colleague of mine , a man newly timestamped with college accreditations in the study of finance , said to me " inflation just happens ; the Fed is there to fight it . "
Unfortunately , this opinion of inflation and the Fed puts him with the solid majority of our peers .
I would have disagreed with him in public , but if I did , my fellow Wall Street employees would think me a lunatic .
It seems widely to be believed that many things cause inflation : oil , greedy businessmen , greedy unions , hurricanes , a rising level of aggregate demand versus supply , all food products , and those kids who run the iced tea stand during summer .
Anything and anyone at all , seemingly , but the people who control monetary policy at the Federal Reserve Bank .
But such beliefs are wrong because " the notion … that inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon is no longer a controversial proposition , " as the Greatest Central Banker of All Time and our current head central banker agree .
And I agree with them .
You should , too .
From front to back , not one economist I have personally spoken to or read denies that inflation is , and always has been , a monetary phenomenon .
Yet a person reading the voluminous research put out by Wall Street banks could be forgiven for taking away the belief that anything but the Federal Reserve Bank causes inflation .
No matter how many PhDs wax eloquent over oil 's inflationary effect , they are just plain wrong .
Oil has no power to cause inflation .
Wages have no power to cause inflation .
That power resides with , and only with , the people who control the money supply : the Federal Reserve Bank employees .
The Greatest of the Greatest Central Bankers of All Time
" A Federal Reserve chairman is judged not by the standards he sets for scientific analysis , but by how well he achieves price level stability . "
– Kevin L. Kliesen , Economist , St. Louis Fed
Being a big believer in holding our public servants accountable , I would like to see which one of the past thirteen
Fed chairmen was top dog in " maintaining a stable price level . "
Whether or not we agree with the wisdom — or even the possibility — of " maintaining a stable price level , " it would be interesting to know the Fed chairman who best fulfilled his stated mission .
For this , I will use the following very scientific criteria which I thought up while washing the dishes .
I will only include Fed governors who served at least two years .
I used two years because that seems like enough time for even a man of angelic intentions to really screw things up .
Second , we will bow to the wisdom of Hopper , Kevin Spacey 's character in A Bug 's Life , who tells the ant queen - to - be " first rule of leadership : everything is your fault " .
Since the Fed chairman is the guy who sits at the head of the table , " the buck erodes with him . "
Last , we 're going to use the CPI numbers as put out by the Bureau of Labor statistics .
I will grant to all the fact that the CPI numbers , vague and arbitrary to begin with , have also been massaged , hedonically adjusted , scrubbed , bent , and twisted , leaving their accuracy even more in doubt .
[ 8 ]
John Williams ' Shadow Government Statistics website claims that " changes made in CPI methodology … have understated inflation significantly , " and judging by the historical behavior of politicians and their well documented habit of lying , this claim holds much merit on its face .
So why am I using CPI ?
Because , even using it , the Fed 's " inflation fighting " reputation and the widely held belief that a central bank is designed to " maintain a stable price level " does not bear the light of day .
Fed officials " fight " inflation in the same manner that Ted Bundy " dated " women ; they pummel the dollar into a pulp , then do their best to avoid blame .
If you had hired the Fed to " maintain a stable price level " in 1913 , I believe that right now , circa 2006 , you could take them to court and sue them for violation of their fiduciary duty .
( And win . )
Since its creation , the Federal Reserve — our country 's fourth try at a central bank — has taken the dollar and reduced it to five cents . [ 9 ]
Which Fed chairman had the biggest hand in this fiasco ?
Since — as the huge post - Katrina budget hikes given to FEMA prove [ 10 ] — failure is the health of the state , the winner of the Greatest Central Banker of All Time goes to the man who destroyed the dollar 's value more than any other of his brethren .
So take a bow Marriner Eccles , Fed chairman from November 1934 to January 1948 .
Benjamin Anderson described him as an " extreme Keynesian , " and since , as W.H.
Hutt wrote " to consider the consequences of Keynesian policies , one can hardly avoid discussing the phenomenon of creeping inflation , " [ 11 ] this is hardly a surprisingly choice .
A Utah banker who never attended college or studied economics , [ 12 ] Mr. Eccles 's family banks , being run on a fractional reserve basis , suffered under the ever - present threat of bank runs during the Great Depression 's early years .
Once , after being barely saved by the timely arrival of a cash - laden armored car , he insisted his nervous depositors not worry because there was " plenty more where that came from . "
Once he ascended to the Fed chairmanship he made good on that promise .
By the time he was through printing " plenty more , " the dollar 's value had plummeted over 46 % .
Congratulations , Marriner Eccles , you win the gold .
The silver medal goes to current crowd favorite Alan Greenspan , who reduced the value of a dollar by 44 % during his tenure .
Unlike Mr. Eccles , who could at least point to the Great Depression , the New Deal , and a world war as excuses , Alan Greenspan 's massive " stimulation of aggregate demand " took place during a period of prosperity and good times .
Never one to stop spiking the punch bowl , Alan Greenspan will go down in history as the man who during his tenure increased the money supply greater than the sum of all his predecessors combined .
So while he must settle for the silver , it 's not for lack of effort .
Taking the bronze is poor , sad Arthur Burns , who was sacked by Jimmy Carter of all people .
A man widely despised within the Fed for a charmless combination of authoritarianism and arrogance , Mr. Burns engineered a 42 % destruction of the dollar 's value despite having less than half the tenure of Mr. Greenspan and Eccles — but sadly for him , time in office is not an element in our award decision . [ 13 ]
Mr. Burns introduced America to the fun times of " stagflation , " catching America 's economists — he included — completely flat - footed .
So how does newly minted Ben Bernanke look in his chances to crack the above , esteemed list ?
Judging by his book Inflation Targeting in which he states that " periods of very rapid inflation are clearly destructive .
But whether more moderate inflation ( below , say , 10 % per year ) is harmful , is more controversial , " I 'm fairly confident he has a decent shot .
Leave such a man at the helm of the giant printing press long enough , and I am sure that he can topple even the great Mr. Eccles .
So best of luck to Ben Bernanke in his quest for the gold ; when it comes to engineering inflation he certainly has the right attitude .
Let 's see what he does with it .
Freeze Frame
" I 'll stop the world and melt with you . "
– Modern English
Not that the good people of the Federal Reserve like inflation .
Their stated mission is to " maintain stable prices " , stable being defined by Webster 's as " not changing or fluctuating . " [ 14 ]
But why would anyone want to create an economic world where prices stay stable ?
As Benjamin Anderson wrote , " prices have a job to do . "
Prices are like the road signs we follow when driving in unfamiliar territory .
They tell us where to go in terms of production .
They come about naturally , they are what they are , and no grandstanding , moralizing , or wailing will change them .
Experience has shown us , repeatedly , that to set a price by decree will do no more than cause a scarcity or glut .
Arbitrarily decreeing a price for money and credit is as foolish and destructive as decreeing the price of any product .
Playing with prices , especially on such a massive scale as the central planning of short term interest rates entails , is tantamount to tampering with the safety valve on a boiler .
Prices and safety valves are there for a reason — we disrespect them at our peril .
Even measuring a " price level " to keep " stable " has proven an impossible task .
The inputs are far too numerous to track , and you must subtract all market goods which have joined the dodo bird , then add those which have blossomed anew , while making sure that you properly weight the basket to take into account every human being 's ever changing valuations , and then and only then can you go to the econometrician 's ball .
That has n't prevented armies of statisticians from trying , God bless their hearts , but no human being has yet been able to climb that statistical Everest .
And due to the endless , ever changing variables , accurately measuring a general level of prices using mathematics is about as likely to come about as measuring how insane a man is by mathematically tracking his various body movements .
We are not that smart . [ 15 ]
I freely admit I got this belief from a man of far greater reputation than I , John Maynard Keynes .
In his opus General Theory he writes of " the well known , but unavoidable , element of vagueness which admittedly attends the concept of the general price level " [ 16 ] and therefore any attempt to compare price levels from one period to the next is " unsuitable for differential calculus . " [ 17 ]
Furthermore , if we would like a stable price level , why then do we cheer and clap over rising productivity numbers ?
More goods produced by the same amount of input causes a fall in prices .
In addition , it frees up capital and labor to produce other useful , heretofore unavailable things for the consumer . [ 18 ]
It makes your dollar buy more stuff .
So everyone is right to cheer for rising productivity .
Yet at the same time the same people who are cheering rising productivity are explicitly calling for a monetary policy to " maintain a stable price level " — a policy that , should it succeed to perfection , would destroy the very gains that rising productivity gives to the working masses .
Why on earth would we want to deliberately squander a rising standard of living ?
No man refuses a raise at his job , yet we cheer on the very men who are deliberately stripping from us the benefits of productivity , God 's pay - raise for us mortals .
Why do we do this ?
The great historian Robert Conquest once wrote , " Reliance on reason alone is irrational .
It neglects the instinctual or deep - set elements of the real human being " .
So there you have it .
We do it because , deep down in our genetics , we 're all crazy as loons .
Lesson Never Learned
" Although the gold standard could hardly be portrayed as having produced a period of price tranquility , it was the case that the price level in 1929 was not much different , on net , from what it had been in 1800 . "
– Alan Greenspan , December 19 , 2002
Judging by the numbers ( the deliberate destruction of the dollar 's value by 95 % since 1913 ) and what history warns of fiat currency , it would seem only natural for our intellectuals in the field of economics to look at the central bank 's policy of inflation and re-examine its desirability .
At this moment , a policy of " stabilizing prices " by deliberately destroying any and all benefits from increased productivity ( or anything else for that matter ) is widely hailed as beneficial by everyone but me and a few guys in Auburn . [ 19 ]
I cannot agree with those who argue for higher prices , which are a reflection of scarcity .
I root for lower prices , which are a reflection of progress .
Inflation makes rational forecasts difficult if not impossible for the economy 's only engine of growth : the entrepreneur .
Thomas Jefferson once bemoaned the difficulty inflation was creating on his business decisions , writing to a friend " we have now no measure of value .
I do not know , therefore , whereabouts I stand in the scale of property , nor what to ask , nor what to give for it . " [ 20 ]
Ben Bernanke writes in his Inflation Targeting " making it difficult to assess both current relative prices and the future price level , inflation can also distort the decisions of firms about production and investment . "
So not only does inflation introduce the negative feature of higher prices tomorrow , it also introduces confusion and strife today .
This does n't strike me as an intelligent policy .
This is not progress ; progress entails making life easier , not harder .
Inflation spreads the latter condition throughout an entire economy for everyone .
The French economist and wise ass Bastiat divided all economists into " good " and " bad " judged solely on whether that economist judged policy with any view of its long - term effects .
Since no good economist , and no good parent , denies that any policy ( or choice of behavior ) must be judged on its long - term effects — because not thinking past tomorrow is the mark of a savage — inflation as a policy is distinctly anti-progressive and reactionary .
When it comes to inflation , we on Wall Street are not looking past what current stage of the business cycle we 're in .
We are dangerously short - term in our thinking .
We should not want a stable price level , but a stable currency . [ 21 ]
Prices will take care of themselves .
The cry that a currency needs to be " elastic " in order to stimulate aggregate demand is based on the fallacy of " overproduction , " this theory being commonly ascribed to Karl Marx .
Like most of Marxist dogma , Karl Marx never agreed with the theory , writing in his Theory of Surplus Value " the excess of commodities is always relative , that is , it is an excess at certain prices . " [ 22 ]
Allowing prices to freely adjust is what clears the market , not counterfeiting dollars .
While I understand that inflation brings certain short - term benefits , [ 23 ]
I can't see how that sum outweighs its long - term ( and short - term ) detriments , and only long - term considerations determine whether a policy is reactionary or progressive .
The hallmark of progressive man is that he looks past tomorrow , he thinks about the future .
Inflation is a heartless reactionary policy that says the future ( and all our children ) be damned . [ 24 ]
While many talk about the effects of inflation , none talk about the possibility that any group of men given the power to counterfeit money out of thin air would maybe , just maybe , be even a little bit tempted to abuse such power . [ 25 ]
Even Alexander Hamilton , who enthusiastically endorsed the idea of a central bank , warned against government printing paper money :
" Paper emissions … are of a nature so liable to abuse , and it may even be affirmed so certain of being abused , that the wisdom of the government will be shewn in never trusting itself with the use of so seducing and dangerous an expedient . " [ 26 ]
Some will say that I am too untrusting of our public servants , that the men who run the Fed are , without exception , first - class minds .
First - class minds in positions of power make me nervous .
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in Dalyrimple Goes Wrong " first class minds never believe anything until they 've experienced it " ; in other words , they ignore history and all its warnings because they 're smarter than all that .
It is always different this time because the best minds ( ever ! ) have descended from heaven to pave our smooth road ahead .
Arrogance and a willingness to heed advice rarely go together .
Experience is a harsh mistress , and I do n't want to date her .
With the Fed 's policy of deliberately manufacturing inflation we are playing with fire .
If all I 've read in history books about the horrors of a currency 's collapse is true , I hope that , should that day come , I can view the fireworks from a nice comfortable coffin .
I pray that Mr. Bernanke , and whoever follows him at the Fed , will be kind enough to give me six feet worth of time .

I 've notified Sun on 29 - Jul - 2007 .
My bug report has been evaluated and publicly disclosed by Sun yesterday ( 06 - Aug - 2007 ) as a request for enhancement .
Looks like responsibly filing a bug in the Sun 's bug tracker , religiously waiting one week for its classification by Sun engineers and having it finally published by Sun itself as a non-security - related RFE is not enough to go public .
I should have known that security reports should be submitted to security - alert at sun dot com to be properly handled .
When Maarten Van Horenbeeck ( SANS ISC ) did it , Sun requested him to request me " to keep the issue confidential , and hold the blog post , till Sun has completely fixed it and is ready to issue a Sun Alert to warn users " .
At that time , my post had been already out for some hours , read and commented by many " hackers " supporting full disclosure .
Therefore , I respectfully answered ( directly to security - alert at sun dot com , with SANS in CC ) explaining why retracting it would have been useless , but apologized for my mishandled report and offered any other help , including my promise to use security - alert at sun dot com instead of the regular bug tracker for future responsible disclosures .
I received no answer yet , but in the meanwhile my bug report has been reclassified and made inaccessible .
I still wonder why should I have known better than a Sun Bug Tracker employee what the proper channel for a security report was ...
Will this take more or less than ten days to be fixed ?
In the meanwhile , NoScript is your friend ;)
Update ( Oct-22-2007 )
Issue fixed .

The glass glows dull red , like a campfire ember , above the gas torch .
The young artist , sitting on a stool in front of a wooden bench with a metal top , works with confident , quick motions , creating a tube by fusing white glass sticks together around a one - inch - thick cylinder of graphite .
James Lynch , 27 , has an average build , short , light - brown hair and a goatee .
He 's wearing Birkenstocks , a black T - shirt , shorts , and sporty - looking didymium shades that mute the searing orange and blue light of the torch .
He soon moves on to a spherical glass shape , holding it over the flame by pencil - thin rods of glass , his fingers inches away from potential third - degree burns .
Gloves would n't allow him the kind of control he needs .
" My hands are always a little bit red and cooked by the end of the day , " he says .
One of the rods is hollow , and , at times , Lynch sends a puff of air through it to the sphere , expanding and shaping it .
His workspace is filled with rods of raw glass , forceps , large tweezers , an old butter knife , rubber tubes , and other equipment .
Glass is a strange and beautiful substance , and glass blowing is an ancient process , fascinating to watch .
Glass is what scientists call an amorphous solid , meaning the molecules that constitute it are n't stacked into neat , crystalline structures  they 're just sort of frozen in place .
The idea of windows flowing as some sort of liquid is just an urban myth , but misconceptions about glass only add to its mystique .
The way glass can be teased into any form and then become solid , clearer than ice , is like sorcery .
Aside from its beauty , glass has special properties sought by most buyers of Lynch 's products .
It does n't melt or give off toxic fumes under the flame of a Bic lighter , and it 's relatively easy to clean .
Lynch has a home studio in Chandler , but today , he 's doing contract work in a store called It 's All Goodz in Tempe , working behind a window that allows customers to watch him blow glass .
Lynch describes himself as a budding artist , saying nearly half his income last year came from sales of glass seascapes at the Tempe Festival of the Arts and other venues .
He 's also a senior instructor in the craft at the Mesa Arts Center .
What 's paid the bulk of the bills over the years , though , has been his custom glass pipes and bongs  products that most people would call dope paraphernalia .
The first time he saw someone making glass pipes , he was 17 .
He says he knew right then he had found his calling .
He paid the glass blower to teach him the basics , and then worked for a company in Colorado for a year before becoming self - employed , founding I Blew It Glassworks , a name his mother came up with in an attempt to embarrass him .
It 's not making him rich , but he does what he loves and it pays the bills .
Paraphernalia helped him buy a home and helps support his wife and 4 - year - old son .
" I thought , at one point , ' By the time my kid gets old enough to ask what I do for a living , I 'd be done making pipes , ' " Lynch says .
Now , he no longer worries about it .
" I can't say what other people do with them , " he says of his handmade smoking accessories .
" It 's nothing I 'm really ashamed of . "
It would be hard to argue , however , that the attraction behind the window at It 's All Goodz is wholesome family entertainment .
The glass creations made and sold at head shops like this represent lawlessness , rebellion , and sin to a significant portion of society .
To many people over 30  even those who may tolerate the pot -smoking of others or may toke a little themselves  head shops still carry an aura of embarrassing seediness .
Lynch opens the kiln on the workbench and removes one of his latest masterpieces , a finished product that needed a crack repaired before it could be sold .
The piece features a detailed white glass skull resting in a skeletal hand , with one cylindrical , hollow " bone " rising from the back .
It 's a comely little bong , about a foot tall .
To the uninitiated , its most astonishing feature is probably its price .
Mark Sayegh , the shop 's high - energy owner , says it will retail for $ 420 .
As in 420 , the international code for marijuana that refers to both the time on the clock and April 20 .
Legends vary on how 420 became a symbol for a great time and date to get high , but in this case , it represents a sales trend .
For growing numbers of marijuana users these days , upscale pot paraphernalia is where it 's at .
Lynch 's glass skull and claw  while it may seem absurdly expensive to aging hippies who remember when a lid of grass went for $ 30  is nowhere near the priciest bong in Sayegh 's shop .
That one , a curvaceous multisection bubbler named The Neutron Bomb , is priced at $ 2,500 .
Most of the bongs at the store are more practical  they 're essentially glass versions of the plastic tube bongs from the ' 80s , like the one Spicoli used in Fast Times at Ridgemont High .
Yet even the midrange bongs are much fancier than their old - school predecessors , employing the latest glass - working and coloring techniques .
Dozens of such bongs line the shelved walls , most with price tags of more than $ 150 .
Sayegh points to a monster bong , a nine - foot sectional glass tuber made in California , and brags that he 's sold two of that particular model in the past eight months , for $ 1,200 each .
Those in the know say the market for nice glassware for stoners has been growing since the mid-'90s , especially in California and the Northwest , and for a host of reasons , has taken off in recent years in the Valley .
Not every smoker uses expensive paraphernalia , of course , but the demand is enormous , judging from the number of stores in metro Phoenix that sell the stuff .
In Tempe , a college town that has long been the area 's ground zero for head shops , competition among bong sellers has never been higher .
At least five new head shops have opened in the college town in the past three years , with three specializing in high - end merchandise .
Veteran stores like Trails , Hippie Gypsy , the Headquarters , and the Graffiti Shop , meanwhile , do n't appear to be hurting .
It 's a business success story that 's making aspiring artists like Lynch  not to mention fashionable , well - to - do stoners  very happy , indeed .
" Most people [ in the business ] would agree this is a genuine American movement .
It 's a revolution , " Lynch says .
" We 've created an industry where there was n't one before . "
Selling bongs for hundreds of dollars apiece seems wrong on so many levels .
To begin with , there 's the image of wastoids stumbling among intricate , high - priced pieces of fragile glassware  disaster waiting to happen .
And unless the stoner who owns such a work of art is meticulous about cleaning it , the sticky , brown resin left from smoking will soon destroy any beauty it once had .
It 's a safe bet that there are more filthy expensive glass bongs in the Valley than clean ones .
From a practical standpoint , an expensive water pipe is about as logical as a Kate Spade handbag .
Bongs are little more than lonely hookahs , which also filter smoke through water , but hookahs  which have been used for centuries to smoke tobacco , hashish , and opium  have multiple mouthpieces that allow several people to inhale at the same time .
Bongs have just one .
They 're simple devices .
For just pennies , one can be built by using any small , plastic container .
And it will get the job done , arguably just as well as a something that costs $ 1,000 .
Then there 's the law .
Collectors of bongs , unlike collectors of , say , bronze cowboy sculptures , presumably have to be careful about how they show off their favorite pieces , and to whom .
Owning a pot pipe or bong , once it 's been used to smoke illegal drugs , is a felony in Arizona .
So is possession of any amount of marijuana , making Arizona one of the harshest anti-pot states in the country .
Whether used or not , bongs are illegal to sell under federal law , and violators can be punished with up to three years in prison .
Theoretically , head shops can be raided by federal agents at any time .
Thirty - seven years after the founding of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , or NORML , the way America approaches the issue of marijuana and the tools used to smoke it is still something of a paradox .
Each year , local , state , and federal authorities spend billions of dollars to arrest and jail marijuana offenders .
FBI statistics show that record numbers of people are getting busted for simple marijuana possession in the United States  nearly 700,000 in 2005 .
( The 2006 numbers come out next month ) .
All that enforcement , yet marijuana is embedded in our culture like never before .
More than 40 percent of Americans age 12 and up , including authority figures like the current governors of Arizona and California , have tried it .
Music laden with pro-pot lyrics is hardly edgy anymore .
Nor is it shocking these days in Phoenix to see a preteen wearing a T - shirt emblazoned with a giant pot leaf .
Television shows depict more characters than ever smoking pot casually , as if they were drinking a beer .
Bong hits are de rigueur for the characters on HBO 's Entourage .
One recent episode featured characters Drama and Turtle figuring out a way to score highly potent medical marijuana , which they fire up in a bubbler .
The word bong ( which allegedly comes from the Thai " baung , " meaning a short pipe cut from a piece of bamboo ) , may have become even more of a household word by now , thanks to a major freedom of speech case concluded in late June by the U.S. Supreme Court .
In a 5 - 4 decision , the justices decided that a school principal was within her rights to suspend a student for displaying a banner with the phrase " Bong Hits 4 Jesus , " even though the display was n't on school property .
For some of today 's marijuana smokers , an expensive , arty water pipe symbolizes a new , more open age .
The devices are a way of announcing : " I smoke pot , and I 'm proud of it . "
" I put mine on top of the entertainment center , " says an owner of a $ 280 bong .
" I like to show it off . "
On a macroeconomic level , stoners are doing the same thing as many other Americans  seeking an identity through luxury goods .
Academics have noted in the past few years that middle - class citizens , for a bunch of reasons , are indulging in more and more high - end purchases .
Everyone craves a taste of the good life these days , and stores are responding with more products over which people can obsess .
For some , it 's the occasional ultra - prime cut of steak or the latest digital doodad .
For others , it 's a triple - chambered , handmade - in - America ROOR glass water pipe .
But to really complete the dope fashion scene , stoners also need the high - quality pot that drug czar John Walters has been complaining about .
Government researchers say marijuana , in general , has grown stronger since the 1990s .
The University of Mississippi Marijuana Potency Project recently found that average levels of THC , the active ingredient in pot , are more than twice as high as in the late 1980s .
Users say even better weed  skunk , chronic , kind  with up to 15 percent THC , has been pouring into Arizona from California and Oregon , as well as from local indoor growers .
Users covet the better , more expensive pot , which they say tastes better and requires fewer puffs to achieve the desired effect , over crappy weed called schwag .
Cannabis connoisseurs seek out different strains of marijuana as if they were fine wines , paying $ 80 to $ 600 an ounce , according to sources like www.hightimes.com.
Putting skunk weed in a plastic bong , tasteful stoners explain , would be kind of like putting a pricey Cabernet in a Dixie cup .
Fancy bongs , then , are n't such a bad idea , after all .
As fashion accessories and symbols of status and freedom , they make perfect sense .
Or maybe well - to - do potheads are just getting too high .
Joy does n't call herself a stoner .
She 's just a person who likes to smoke pot every day .
And she likes to do it in style .
She 's got a collection of water pipes , and her most prized is a little pink - and - green glass " bubbler , " a small bong she bought about seven years ago .
It 's not her most expensive piece ( she got it on sale for $ 150 ) , but it 's a doozy  about a foot long with swirls , shimmers , a pot - leaf emblem , carefully crafted inner chambers , twists of glass , and delicate horns .
She describes the day when , three months after she bought it , she noticed a " perfect little alien head " inside the bong that was visible only under the right light .
Awesome .
Joy pulls out the bubbler only on special occasions , and when she does , " I lay down the rules .
Take off your rings .
You 're not going to be anywhere around tile or wood .
You have to be on carpet .
I 'll cry if I break this . "
Joy is n't her real name , of course .
She might get busted if her name was published , given that she admits she 's committing felonies .
It 's not hard to find stoners  it just takes a bit of chatting with the customers of Phoenix and Tempe head shops .
( To allow for candid discussion , New Times agreed to keep secret the names of several pot-smokers who talked for this story , including two head shop employees .
First and last names mean the person agreed to be quoted .
Just a first name means the person preferred to stay anonymous . )
A Phoenix real estate agent in her mid-20s , Joy grew up in a small Arizona town , the daughter of hippie parents who had many pot-smoking friends .
She also considers herself a hippie , but that describes more how she feels inside than it does her appearance .
Really , she 's more like a yuppie .
She owns a house and says she makes about $ 40,000 a year .
She tries not to be stoned when taking a work - related phone call , knowing she wo n't be on top of her game .
Usually , she sparks up at the end of the day , when she can " just chill , " and she uses a less - sentimental $ 60 bubbler .
Like other smokers interviewed for this article , Joy struggles to describe what it is about pricey paraphernalia that attracts her .
There 's no single reason .
Part of it is her view of herself as a " high - functioning " pothead .
Maybe it 's just her own prejudice  or maybe she 's been smoking the really good stuff  but she believes stoners who use bland metal pipes instead of quality glass are probably the same clumsy , lazy , and stupid types who give ganja smokers like her a bad name .
" They do n't go and buy stuff they want to take care of , " Joy says .
" They do n't care if it gets fucked - up . "
Joy is attuned to the art of bongs  those for which artisans " have put their blood and sweat in it . "
Quality glass instruments make the experience of smoking even better and make her pastime seem special .
She spent her late teens around pot smokers who'd " make [ arty bong ] pieces and take pride in them , " she says .
" That was somehow passed down to me . "
Joy used to own a four - foot - tall bong that set her back $ 320  but her friend broke it during a smoke session .
She likes to pop in the head shops around town to look at the latest creations , and hopes to build her collection .
" I 'd like to have a shelf area , " she says .
" Then I can put them away and know they are going to be okay . "
Tom , an employee of a local head shop , sits in his small Tempe apartment on a recent afternoon , inhaling marijuana smoke through one of his favorite bongs .
His living room is sparsely decorated :
He 's got a medium - sized television , an inexpensive couch , a coffee table and a few chairs .
When he pulls out his three very special bubblers , his priorities become clear .
He estimates the pieces cost him about $ 1,200 altogether .
They are the closest things to art he owns .
His friend Bill comes over , toting a tall bong in a carrying case .
He also works in a head shop and likes to chat about the benefits of glass over plastic , water filtration over raw smoke .
They 're both in their early 20s , and they say they 've been smoking for years , often daily .
" The fact that it 's illegal is the only thing keeping this from becoming a full - blown hobby for me , " Bill says .
But pot has its downsides .
Bill says it 's one reason his college plans are stalled ( he hopes to get back on track one way or another ) .
He 's having fun in the meantime .
Bill and Tom say they like to get buzzed and relax , play video games , or go to action movies .
" Did you see 300 ? " Bill asks
Tom with a knowing smile .
" I saw 300 , " Tom says , nodding happily , leaving the obvious part unspoken  they watched it waaaaasted .
Mike came to a Tempe head shop last month to pick up his $ 280 orange " chalice , " which was in for repairs .
He says he graduated a couple of years ago from Arizona State University with a degree in biology , and he admits to using marijuana for years .
He seems sober and well - spoken .
He 's a little weird .
He says he spends hours at home , sometimes , cleaning his collection of glass pipes .
He 's built about 30 little pipe reamers out of paper clips and coat hangers , each designed to clean a particular pipe .
He has n't used his chalice in months , and was excited to smoke out of it .
The top two feet of the glass bong 's main tube is curved to allow its user to sit back and relax while taking a hit .
Unique bongs like his are attention - grabbers and contribute to the more social side of marijuana use .
Mike says his chalice is part of his living room décor , which makes sense because it 's often in use .
" Everyone wants to see it and try it , " he says .
Mike says he has no illusions  he checks the peephole for cops before opening the front door .
But he claims the gaudy bong makes him feel like pot -smoking is more accepted by the wider world , that appreciation for good pot and good bongs is a respectable aspect of overall Valley culture  especially among his college friends .
" We 're not hiding , " he says .
Every few weeks , a head shop will get a phone call , or maybe some dorky dude will drop in .
That person will want to talk about bongs , and he will want to talk about smoking weed in them .
" There are two types of people who talk like that , " says one store 's employee .
" Cops and idiots . "
That 's why owners and employees of head shops are programmed to insist that the glass pipes and bongs sold at the dozens of head shops in the Valley are tobacco accessories .
They could be prosecuted if someone could prove they knew their products would be used for smoking marijuana or another illegal drug .
Yet , of course , that 's exactly what the products are used for .
Nobody uses a bong or a glass pipe to smoke tobacco , except maybe a bored stoner .
For years , head shops have walked a fine legal line , and for decades in Arizona , there 's been no real trouble .
In the head shop rumor mill , people believe the shops have had political protection .
That 's because the biggest chain of head shops in Arizona , Trails , is owned by Arthur Kruglick , whose father , Burt Kruglick , was once a big player in the state 's Republican Party .
But it 's debatable whether the elder Kruglick  a man in his 80s who , last year , left his post as the Arizona Racing Commissioner  ever had or used any such power .
Arthur Kruglick declined to comment for this article .
Another rumor says that , perhaps because of the growing indiscretion of head shops , some kind of law enforcement action may be on the horizon .
Robert Vaughn , a Tennessee lawyer considered a national expert on paraphernalia , compares the federal law on bongs to pornography statutes :
Bongs are illegal , but enforcement is based on community standards .
Bong manufacturers who ship their products out of state are at greater risk to be busted because the community standard where the products end up could be much different from that where they 're made .
Pennsylvania and Iowa , in particular , have a bent against bongs and helped orchestrate raids of paraphernalia - makers across the country in 2000 and 2003 .
Operation Pipe Dream in 2003 , the nation 's most recent major paraphernalia bust , swept up comedian Tommy Chong , who served nine months in federal prison for selling bongs on the Internet .
Fifty people were arrested , including three who ran a glass pipe - making shop in Phoenix called Stone Artworx .
At the time , local store owners worried they would be next .
But , you could say , business is really smokin ' again these days .
Operation Pipe Dream taught head shop owners and paraphernalia - makers to be more careful about sales on the Internet , where it 's difficult to enforce the over - 18 age requirement to buy smoking accessories .
The federal government likely wo n't do anything about head shops in the foreseeable future , says former Arizona U.S. Attorney Paul Charlton .
That does n't mean he and others who believe marijuana is harmful enjoy seeing bongs sitting unscathed on store shelves .
" Marijuana is becoming much more accepted , " he says .
" And it 's a shame , because there are studies that show the use of marijuana among young people had , at one point in time , decreased .
But if popular culture displays marijuana use as hip and cool , then I think you 're going to see those numbers go the other direction . "
While the shops probably do n't have to worry , buyers sure do .
It seems lots of folks are mistaking Tempe for the Southwest 's answer to Amsterdam 's Leidseplein district .
All that openness and freedom concerning marijuana . . .
Yeah , it 's an illusion .
So far this year , Tempe police alone have made more than 900 arrests for drug paraphernalia .
None of them was at a head shop .
Most of the people arrested were out and about in the pedestrian - friendly city , smoking marijuana in a public place , says Officer Brandon Banks , Tempe PD 's spokesman .
Usually , police are responding to a person calling about a suspected smoker , he says .
If that smoker is still there when the cops show up , it 's mug - shot time .
Happens about three times a day .
Almost always , the bust involves a small , portable glass pipe ; many cases involve dangerous drugs like meth or crack .
Banks says the numbers have been decreasing in the past three years because of street enforcement .
" People finally realize , ' Hey , we should n't be using drug paraphernalia , " Banks says .
If you are busted for paraphernalia , a cop will likely cite you for two potential felony charges : possession of both the pipe and the marijuana being smoked .
As long you plead guilty and agree to a state brainwashing program ( drug treatment includes pee tests and anti-drug classes ) , the charges will be dismissed and you wo n't have a record .
You wo n't go to prison unless you 're the kind who can't stay out of trouble .
In 1996 , voters banned the government from jailing someone for pot possession until a fourth arrest , provided that person stays clean while on probation .
The message is clear : Leave the pipes and bongs at home , where your chances of getting busted are next to nil .
Watching the dozen or so pipemakers hard at work at the Chameleon Glass factory in North Phoenix , it 's hard to believe a war on drugs was ever waged in this country .
Melissa DeNova , 25 , has worked in the shop for two years and is going through a glass - blowing apprenticeship .
Today , she 's wearing her didymium glasses and a purple kerchief as she prepares to make a glass pipe .
Holding a glass rod tipped with gold in front of a gas torch , she " fumes " the gold onto another piece of glass , which turns metallic pink .
She gives it a twist to make the colors spiral and carefully shapes the pipe 's bowl and handle .
Using one rod like a pencil , she melts a piece of molten glass into a tiny dragonfly shape .
Then she pops a hole in the side of the bowl that will be used for clearing smoke from the implement  one of the hallmarks of a pot pipe .
It 's a sweaty job , but it pays well , she says , declining to say exactly what she makes .
" I just love the craft  it's very fun , " DeNova says .
The glass factory , owned by Ken Kulow of Phoenix , cranks out hundreds of glass pipes each day , most of which are shipped out of state .
The majority of the pipes will retail for less than $ 50 , but they 're still nicer than the wood and metal pipes of old .
They change color when used  though , as mentioned before , they 're all destined to turn brown with resin unless cleaned .
In another nod to Operation Pipe Dream , Kulow says fancy hookahs are made at the shop  but no bongs .
Kulow also owns the two Blaze tobacco accessory stores ( you 'd call them head shops ) in Tempe and Phoenix .
He hires glass - blowers to make custom bongs at the stores , but he says those are never sold over state lines .
Kulow explains that , for years , U.S. pipemakers have been helped by restrictions on imports of glass pipes and bongs from India and China .
That 's slowly changing , but domestic glass blowers still have an edge in part because of demand for high quality , he says .
Glass blowers told New Times that techniques involving borosilicate glass ( the substance in Pyrex products ) really took off in the 1990s , helping fill a growing demand for nice - looking glass bongs that do n't break easily .
Bong - making as an art form grew in popularity , but many artists were scared out of the industry after the 2003 raids .
That ushered in a new breed of wanna - be scientists / glass blowers who wanted to make bongs work better .
New - style bongs that employ more inner chambers and perforated stems to cool and filter more of the smoke began to show up about three years ago .
Supposedly , they allow a user to take a hit that is larger but not as harsh on the lungs .
With the popularity of pharmaceuticals and drugs like Ecstasy on the rise , it 's a widespread notion that marijuana 's out of fashion among young adults  something old hippies use .
That could n't be further from the truth .
Kulow says college - age people are the biggest buyers of glass accessories , and he notes the local supply of fine paraphernalia has not coincidentally grown right along with ASU .
No doubt , the mainstreaming of marijuana culture is not part of ASU President Michael Crow 's plan to create a " New American University . "
But one result of a bigger college has been a major upturn in the number of Tempe head shops .
It 's not just Tempe .
Looking across the Valley , it 's obvious that head shop owners know their market .
Many have located within a mile or two of ASU West or one of the county 's community colleges .
Several new shops have sprouted in the Valley in the past few years  the trend is just more noticeable in Tempe because the city is so concentrated .
There 's Sayegh 's new shop near Gus 's Pizza and the Devil House .
Near Pita Jungle on Apache Boulevard , expensive bongs line the walls at a shop called Vishions .
Similar products can be found at Hippie Gypsy , the Graffiti Shop , Trails , and the Headquarters .
And that 's just downtown Tempe .
Farther south on Mill Avenue , you 'll find a few more 
Blaze and two smaller , less - fancy stores , the Coughing Canary and A&A Smoke Shop .
The swamped marketplace has put a damper on the more expensive products at High Society in south Sunnyslope , which also offers custom blown - glass bongs , says owner Jim Meyer .
" In Tempe , near ASU , they 've got daddy 's money , so they like the high end , " Meyer says .
Alex Sabino , manager of Coughing Canary , says the store stays in business by selling cigarettes , blunt wraps , and other small items , but he 's surprised at the big demand for glass bongs .
" Every week , we sell a piece that 's about $ 160 or so , " he says .
Though Sabino does n't allow the word " bong " uttered in his shop , anyone who walks in would know right away he 's selling drug paraphernalia , thanks to all the posters and T - shirts displaying marijuana leaves .
It 's All Goodz sells pants that feature a special pocket for illicit stash .
Vishions has a big neon " 420 " sign on its storefront window .
Trails sells case after case of nitrous oxide and the equipment to inhale it .
Blaze sells salvia for $ 45 a gram , a legal drug that reportedly produces a short , intense  and sometimes unpleasant  sensation when smoked .
The head shops ' niche is their bad - boy image , and it 's understandable why many folks  even some stoners  would n't be caught dead in such places .
But even the most strait - laced person would be impressed by some of the glass art in these stores .
It 's All Goodz looks something like an art gallery , with its most intricate pieces resting in prominent , freestanding glass cases .
The thousand - dollar bongs may take months or years to sell , but meanwhile , the stores advertise the abilities of the artists , not to mention the store 's focus on quality .
Karen Goldinov , owner of One With Glass Studio & Gallery in Scottsdale , says she waffles on the issue of marijuana 's legality .
However , sometimes she looks at the pictures artist send her of exquisitely made bongs and says , " Wow ! "
" It takes a lot of artistic vision , a lot of talent to create that , " she says .
" It 's not something that just anybody can sit down and do . "
She confirms that many skilled glass artists make bongs , but they do n't draw attention to those works in the larger glass art community for fear of losing credibility .
She says they should n't worry about it , that the finest bongs or pipes should be featured in galleries or art shows .
That may yet happen .
The demand for quality bongs is growing like the selectively bred , super - potent weed that users put in them .
If glass bongs became widely acceptable as art , marijuana culture would move further into the mainstream .
Propagandists like the U.S. drug czar would holler before TV cameras .
Most people would yawn .
Either because they 'd smoked too much pot that evening or because they consider marijuana a far more benign drug than alcohol .
That is , they do n't consider it a pressing problem .
An Iranian official on Sunday lashed out at the Hollywood movie " 300 " for insulting the Persian civilization , local Fars News Agency reported .
Javad Shamqadri , an art advisor to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , accused the new movie of being " part of a comprehensive U.S. psychological war aimed at Iranian culture " , said the report .
Shamqadri was quoted as saying " following the Islamic Revolution in Iran , Hollywood and cultural authorities in the U.S. initiated studies to figure out how to attack Iranian culture , " adding " certainly , the recent movie is a product of such studies . "
The movie 's effort wound be fruitless , because " values in Iranian culture and the Islamic Revolution are too strongly seated to be damaged by such plans " , said the Iranin official .
Shamqadri , who is also a filmmaker , said that production of more domestic and artistic films which portray Iranian achievements is a proper response to movies like " 300 " .
" 300 , " an ancient epic about the famous Battle of Thermopylae in Greek history , set a new record at the box office in North America this weekend .
The Warner Bros. adaptation of the 480 B.C. battle took an estimated 70 million U.S. dollars in its debut weekend , according to figures released on Sunday by Los Angeles - based box office track firm Media by Numbers .
The R- rated film , based on comic book writer Frank Miller 's graphic novel , tells the story that an army of 300 Spartan warriors led by their king Leonidas fought to the death to delay a massive Persian army 's invasion , so that the Greeks could reorganize a counterattack .

House Oversight Committee calls ex-Rove aide Taylor back to Hill Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday July 17 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) has asked Sara Taylor , the former top aide to Karl Rove in the White House , to return to Capitol Hill for a deposition next week .
Taylor complied with a Congressional subpoena and appeared last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify in the investigation of the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
Now , Waxman is suggesting that Taylor might be implicated in politicizing government programs that Waxman has called ' historically nonpartisan . '
Waxman , the Oversight Committee 's chair , was particularly critical of the White House appearing to deploy the nation 's ' drug control czar ' and his staff in the Office of National Drug Control Policy to Republican Congressional campaign events .
" As the nation 's drug czar , Director [ John ]
Walters has the responsibility to oversee the federal government 's domestic and international drug control efforts , " he wrote in the Tuesday letter .
" It is hard to understand how his ability to perform this essential function would be enhanced by extensive taxpayer - funded travel to ' god awful places ' to appear with vulnerable Republican members . "
Waxman 's reference to ' god awful places ' pointed to an e-mail written by Douglas Simon , the White House 's drug control liaison , who praised the ONDCP for helping out on Congressional campaigns .
The California Democrat went on to suggest that the trips might not be completely in keeping with existing laws .
" In the case of ONDCP , in particular , the politicization described in the documents appears inconsistent with the agency 's tradition of nonpartisanship , " he argued .
" In 1994 , Congress passed legislation to insulate the drug czar and the agency 's Senate - confirmed deputies from political pressures by prohibiting them from engaging in political activities even on their own time . "
In the letter , four Republican Congressmembers are identified as having received campaign - related visits from the ONDCP : Rep. Jim Gibbons of Nevada ; Senator Jim Talent of Missouri ; Jon Porter , also of Nevada ; and , Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona .
Talent was defeated in his 2006 re-election campaign .
Gibbons now serves as Nevada Governor , and is reportedly under federal investigation for bribery accusations .
The letter went on to suggest that the White House was attempting to use government machinery for purely political ends .
" Evidence is mounting that White House efforts to inject political considerations into official government business extend beyond the Department of Justice and the General Services Administration , " Waxman wrote to Taylor .
" Your memo to ONDCP details an extensive itinerary of pre-election travel , including 20 events with vulnerable Republican members .
It appears that even historically nonpartisan federal agencies like ONDCP were expected to use federal resources to assist endangered Republican members . "
Waxman asked Taylor to voluntarily appear before the committee 's staff for a July 24 deposition .
He also suggested that additional topics might be raised in the deposition .
" You may also be asked questions at the deposition about other subjects being investigated by the Committee , including the use of RNC e-mail accounts by White House officials and White House political briefings to federal agency officials , " he noted , adding that the committee was planning a July 30 hearing .

MADRID ( Reuters ) - A parasite common in Asian bees has spread to Europe and the Americas and is behind the mass disappearance of honeybees in many countries , says a Spanish scientist who has been studying the phenomenon for years .

A parasite common in Asian bees has spread to Europe and the Americas and is behind the mass disappearance of honeybees in many countries , says a Spanish scientist who has been studying the phenomenon for years .
REUTERS / Dave Stobbe
The culprit is a microscopic parasite called nosema ceranae said Mariano Higes , who leads a team of researchers at a government - funded apiculture centre in Guadalajara , the province east of Madrid that is the heartland of Spain ’s honey industry .
He and his colleagues have analyzed thousands of samples from stricken hives in many countries .
“ We started in 2000 with the hypothesis that it was pesticides , but soon ruled it out , ” he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday .
Pesticide traces were present only in a tiny proportion of samples and bee colonies were also dying in areas many miles from cultivated land , he said .
They then ruled out the varroa mite , which is easy to see and which was not present in most of the affected hives .
For a long time Higes and his colleagues thought a parasite called nosema apis , common in wet weather , was killing the bees .
“ We saw the spores , but the symptoms were very different and it was happening in dry weather too . ”
Then he decided to sequence the parasite ’s DNA and discovered it was an Asian variant , nosema ceranae .
Asian honeybees are less vulnerable to it , but it can kill European bees in a matter of days in laboratory conditions .
“ Nosema ceranae is far more dangerous and lives in heat and cold .
A hive can become infected in two months and the whole colony can collapse in six to 18 months , ” said Higes , whose team has published a number of papers on the subject .
“ We ’ve no doubt at all it ’s nosema ceranae and we think 50 percent of Spanish hives are infected , ” he said .
Spain , with 2.3 million hives , is home to a quarter of the European Union ’s bees .
His team have also identified this parasite in bees from Austria , Slovenia and other parts of Eastern Europe and assume it has invaded from Asia over a number of years .
Now it seems to have crossed the Atlantic and is present in Canada and Argentina , he said .
The Spanish researchers have not tested samples from the United States , where bees have also gone missing .
Treatment for nosema ceranae is effective and cheap -- 1 euro ( $ 1.4 ) a hive twice a year -- but beekeepers first have to be convinced the parasite is the problem .
Another theory points a finger at mobile phone aerials , but Higes notes bees use the angle of the sun to navigate and not electromagnetic frequencies .
Other elements , such as drought or misapplied treatments , may play a part in lowering bees ’ resistance , but Higes is convinced the Asian parasite is the chief assassin .
Ok , the title is a tad bit alarmist I ’ll admit , but I came upon an article about buying a house vs renting a house and at first I disagreed , then agreed , and then realized there is a tightrope that must be walked before picking a side to fall in .
I have a real estate license , or rather had one , as I believe it has expired by now , so I tend to use all my training and schooling in real estate to defend the “ It is always better to own a house than to rent one ” mantra .
I often do this without thinking .
It does n’t take a license though .
Many see owning a home as a sign of success in life .
Much like driving a Cadillac Escalade when you know you ’ll almost never fill more than one seat in the truck .
Buying does has it ’s advantages , but the place you are at in life , and the lifestyle you current live makes a GIGANTIC impact on whether you can realize those advantages .
For example , will it cost you more to live in the house you want to buy ?
Most people upgrade when they move into a home that they want to own .
I saw a sale on a billboard this weekend stating “ 2007 Mustangs from $ 14,000 ” – but when you add tax and options on , will it still be $ 14,000 ?
Americans are hardly realistic when it comes to purchases .
We live up to our means and then freak out when something like a car tire or A/C repair throws us over the top of our spending limit .
Let ’s take a quick look at some of the most highly touted benefits to owning a home :
Buying A Home Gives You Tax Deductions Benefit :
Most of the money paid in the first years of a mortgage , are interest , and interest is tax deductible .
Other items such as Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) can also be tax deductible .
Reality :
This is probably one of the biggest benefits to owning a house .
But first , what is the difference in payment between your mortgage payment and the cost to rent a similar house ?
In the 2007 market , this could be almost 200 % .
What might cost $ 1,200 a month to rent , may very easily cost $ 2,400 a month to own .
Especially once you consider items like property tax and HOA fees .
At the end of the year , if you would have saved $ 4,000 in taxes paid to the government , but paid $ 12,000 more .
You lost $ 8,000 dollars .
Owning a house did not save you any money on your taxes at all .
Appreciation – Real Estate Always Goes Up ! Benefit :
Historically , real estate does “ go up ” over time .
And if money is guaranteed to be secure and life changes such as disability and losing a job will not affect your cash flow , then you can pretty much count on this .
In 2005 , Arizona property appreciation reached a high of over thirty percent !
Reality :
When you ’re making over thirty percent return on your investment , life is great .
However when foreclosure notices start to go up almost 250 % , everyone starts selling and nobody is buying houses anymore , and when things get so bad the president has to deal with the idea of a federal bailout , the reality of life has a way of “ crashing ” down on you .
The reality of this benefit is that if your home is by no means a burden to you financially and you can weather periods of 10 to 20 years , you can be reasonably certain your home will be a decent investment .
However the lack of stability of the job market in the dot com boom , the real estate bubble , and other sectors has proven that most people ’s jobs are NOT safe .
Our rising poverty issues also show that financial freedom is not something the young American is born into either .
Equity – Owning A Home Allows You To Build The Equity That Accompanies Appreciation Benefit :
While the first decade of payments will merely chip away at the principle owed on the loan that finances the house you “ own ” with the bank ’s blessing , appreciation helps sweeten that “ free money ” .
If the home is appreciating at even a snail ’s pace and you are still making payments , it ’s a fact that you will build equity .
Reality :
But what happens when the market begins sloping down ?
We accept that a car loses a large portion of its worth when it ’s driven off the lot .
But we find it harder to accept it when the house we bought for $ 300,000 last year .. is now only worth $ 240,000 – and worse off , wo n’t even sell at $ 230,000 because the true “ price to sell ” is even lower .
If you are like most homeowners , you did n’t have $ 60,000 or $ 70,000 for a down payment .
If this was your first home , you probably went in with 100 % financing , or something very close to that .
And if I ’m addressing you in a nutshell , your next Google Search may very well be for “ adult diapers ” .
Negative equity in a house is a life shattering experience .
With a car , financed over a couple years , it ’s fairly easy to get out from under a bad purchase .
But when you ’ve wrapped up your entire life and married a piece of real estate , you begin to see what I mean by “ what you ‘ own ’ with the bank ’s blessing ” .
And the bank is a fickle mistress .
The reality is that equity goes both ways .
While it most normally accompanies upward trends , it most definitely can go down .
We ’re seeing this in the 2007 real estate market here in Arizona .
Owning Your Home Brings Security And Stability Benefit :
When you own your own home , you do n’t have to worry about those heavy - footed folks upstairs , or the loud apartment next to you .
Like most people you have 7,500 - 10,000 square feet of freedom !
You can paint , tear down , rebuild , and do just about anything so long as you follow your HOA guidelines and zoning rules .
With the added benefit of appreciation and equity growth , these feelings of security and stability from owning your own home increase even more .
You may never have to move again !
Reality :
And many buyers buy into this .
I know I have .
But the fact is that the freedom of ownership is only as real as the ability to sell in current market conditions .
Most homeowners , it is safe to say , are heavily tied to their homes .
They upgraded , maybe counted in the tax savings to justify the higher per month costs .
But your home ca n’t keep your income stable and secure and it ca n’t control the market , it just helps give you comfort that you know where you ’ll lay your head tonight .
When your financial situation becomes threatened , all this comfort , stability , and security flies right out of the window .
While you do get benefits from “ owning your home ” , you ’re still renting it from the bank until you own it outright .
Owners in the 2007 market are now abandoning their homes because they wo n’t sell .
What brought peace of mind is now the reason for more stress than ever .
So Are You Saying That Renting Is Better Than Buying ?
I ’m saying it ’s a very careful line you have to walk .
Can you afford to run into another 2007 market ?
What if things only get worse ?
Could you weather that ?
The truth is that most folks cannot .
While renting is not a guaranteed safe zone , it still prevents much less room for potential loss than ownership can .
Owning a house is indeed one of the biggest decisions you ’ll need to make in your life .
If you ’re hedging your bets that the market remains steady and up for a few years until you can rake in some hefty equity and appreciation , you probably should n’t be buying .
Rent and save the difference .

“ I HOPE to convince you that the time has come to take up consciousness as a strictly biological problem . ”
So rang out the opening address at the 1902 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) .
However Charles Sedgwick Minot , the anatomist who said those words , jumped the gun .
Consciousness is still an enigma .
That it is created within the brain , scientists agree .
That it is biology 's most intellectually glamorous problem , they also concur .
But what it is and how to find it remain unclear .
Which is why , despite Minot 's aspiration , its study has remained fodder for the rambling final chapters of cognitive - science textbooks and those at the dusky end of distinguished scientific careers .
Few have dared take it on without a tenured position under their belts and a Nobel - prize medal around their necks .
Recently , however , two youngish biologists without Nobel prizes have had a go .
Working independently , Henrik Ehrsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Olaf Blanke of Geneva University Hospital have been making inquiries into the notion of the bodily self — an important part of conscious experience .
A sense of self is what makes a person distinct from his environment and from other people in it .
It is also the thing upon which more complex layers of consciousness appear to rest .
Dr Ehrsson and Dr Blanke try to divorce this perceived self from the perceiver 's body — in other words to create that phenomenon so beloved of mystics , an out - of - body experience .
And in two papers published in this week 's edition of Science , the AAAS 's house journal , they report their latest results .
Reality is an illusion
Dr Ehrsson 's previous experiments have relied on an illusion called the rubber hand .
This shifts someone 's sense of owning his body away from his real hand to a prosthetic one .
It works by allowing him to view only the rubber hand while both it and his real hand are stroked in synchronicity with one another .
That coincidence is enough to fool the part of the brain that integrates inputs from different senses .
The result is to redirect the subject 's sense of self from his real hand to the rubber hand in a way analogous to the redirection employed by a ventriloquist when he makes his dummy “ speak ” .
Dr Blanke , by contrast , works with epileptics .
Occasionally , people who suffer from epilepsy report having standard out - of - body experiences — the ones in which an individual looks down on himself from above .
Five years ago Dr Blanke found he could induce such experiences at will in one such person by stimulating a particular part of her brain — the right angular gyrus — with an electric current .
A small current made her feel as though she was sinking into her bed ; a little more had her floating close to the ceiling or seeing her legs kicking towards her face .
Once again , the part of the brain in question seems to be involved in integrating inputs from different senses .
If this area is overstimulated during the electrical brainstorm that is an epileptic fit , the consequence is an out - of - body experience .
With these results in mind , both Dr Ehrsson and Dr Blanke wondered if they could design experiments that would induce complete out - of - body experiences in healthy volunteers .
The answer , in both cases , was that they could .
Dr Ehrsson did it by making his volunteers look at themselves from behind .
He sat them in a chair and asked them to wear virtual - reality goggles , which work by projecting a picture in front of each eye .
Behind the chair there were two video cameras adjusted so that they were at the level of the volunteer 's eyes .
The left - hand camera sent its picture to the left eye of the goggles ; the right - hand camera sent its picture to the right eye .
The subjects could thus see their own backs , in stereo , as though they were sitting behind themselves .
Dr Ehrsson then tested how touch is combined with vision to locate the self .
When he tapped his volunteers on their chests at the same time as he tapped the air at chest - height below the cameras , they reported feeling that the core of their identity inhabited the camera 's position .
They were , in other words , out of their own bodies , and they considered their real selves — seen through the goggles — as another person .
When , however , he prodded the chest and the air at different times , that illusion immediately dissolved .
To make sure his volunteers were telling the truth , Dr Ehrsson surprised them after two minutes of tapping by swinging a hammer towards the camera .
While he did this , his apparatus measured the level of sweat on the volunteer 's skin .
Since people sweat in response to a threat , that level is a good indication of what someone is really feeling .
The sweat levels confirmed that volunteers really did feel threatened when the place they perceived themselves to be — the site of the camera — was attacked .
Dr Blanke also asked his volunteers to wear virtual - reality goggles .
But in his case the volunteer was standing and what he saw was one of three things .
The first was a three - dimensional “ avatar ” of his own body — viewed from behind , as with Dr Ehrsson 's experiment .
The second was an avatar of a humanlike dummy , again viewed from behind .
The third was a human - sized cuboid .
Instead of tapping his volunteers , Dr Blanke stroked them with a paintbrush while , at the same time , the computer “ stroked ” the avatar with a virtual brush .
Sometimes the strokes were in synchronicity , sometimes they were n't .
After each viewing the goggles went dark , so that the volunteer could see nothing at all .
He was then pulled backwards a few steps and asked to return to his original position .
If the avatar he had been watching was a cuboid , that was easy .
It was also easy if the avatar had been humanlike ( whether representing the volunteer or not ) and the stroking had been asynchronous .
But if the avatar had been humanlike and the stroking synchronous , then the volunteer always walked to the place where the avatar would have been standing had it been real .
The volunteer , in other words , identified the avatar 's former location as having been his own .
Astral projection this is not .
But it is a demonstration that one aspect of consciousness can be modified in a reproducible way .
And that may be the key that unlocks the vault .
For , if the methods Dr Ehrsson and Dr Blanke have come up with can be reproduced on volunteers inside a brain - scanner , then it might be possible to study the neurological network involved .
Presumably this will include the right angular gyrus .
But other components , as yet unknown , must surely be involved .
That will help to bring the study of consciousness into a mainstream in which the non-tenured can study it without receiving funny looks from their colleagues .
And , who knows , it may one day lead Dr Ehrsson , Dr Blanke , or someone else whom they have inspired , to having one of those Nobel medals hung around his own neck .
Washington Post : Leahy hints at contempt charge against Bush

According to the Washington Post , Sen. Patrick Leahy , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , says that a contempt charge is not out of the question if the White House refuses to turn over subpoenaed documents .
" If they do n't cooperate , yes , I 'd go that far , " Sen .
Leahy said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press .
" This is very important to the American people . "
" Leahy 's comments raise the stakes in a growing conflict between the Democrat - controlled Congress and the Bush White House , suggesting the constitutional clash may end up in a court case that could last beyond Bush 's tenure as president , " Post reporter Lyndsey Layton writes .
" Congressional investigators want testimony , internal e-mails and other documents to clarify what role Bush 's senior staff played in the Justice Department 's removal of nine prosecutors last year , " she adds .
" The firings have triggered bipartisan calls for Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales to resign . "
The White House refused last week .
In exerting " executive privilege , " the Administration asserted the power of the presidency against other branches of government .
Leahy says he may also take the matter to court .

ExxonMobil has thrown in the towel , terminating its campaign to convince the public that global warming is a hoax concocted by some pointy - headed intellectuals .
All three major Democratic candidates for president , and some of the top Republican contenders as well , have promised serious action .
Leading members of Congress have introduced a half dozen bills that would impose some kind of carbon regulation , and even the president now concedes that climate change is important .
Using coal to make electricity accounts for about a third of America ’s carbon emissions .
As a result , tackling emissions from coal - fired power plants represents our best opportunity to make sharp reductions in greenhouse gases .
Fortunately , we already have the technology to do that .
Unfortunately , right now the United States is addicted to coal , a cheap , abundant power source .
Burning coal produces more than half the country ’s electricity , despite its immense human and environmental costs .
Particulates and other air pollutants from coal - fired power plants cause somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 premature deaths in the United States each year .
Fifty tons of mercury — one - third of all domestic mercury emissions — are pumped into the atmosphere annually from coal plants .
In addition , the extraction of coal , from West Virginia to Wyoming , devastates the physical environment , and its processing and combustion produce gigantic volumes of waste .
For the last decade , coal - burning utilities have been fighting a rearguard action , resisting costly antipollution measures required by environmental legislation .
At the same time , they have been holding out the prospect of “ clean coal ” — in which carbon is captured and stored as coal is burned .
But clean - coal technologies have yet to be demonstrated on a large scale commercially , and by the admission of even the president ’s own climate - technology task force , clean coal does n’t have any prospect of making a big dent in the climate problem in the next 15 to 20 years .
By comparison , nuclear and wind power are proven technologies that emit no carbon and whose environmental risks and costs are thoroughly understood and which can make an immediate difference for the better .
The first thing to be appreciated about reactors in the United States is that they are essentially immune to the type of accident that occurred at Chernobyl in April 1986 .
Put simply , because of fundamental design differences , U.S. reactors cannot experience a sudden and drastic power surge , as happened at Chernobyl ’s Unit Number 4 , causing it to explode and catch fire .
In addition , the reliability of U.S. nuclear plants has been constantly improving .
In 1980 , American nuclear power plants were generating electricity only 56 percent of the time because they frequently needed special maintenance or repair .
By 2004 , reactor performance had improved to the point of generating electricity over 90 percent of the time .
Our regulatory regime , which was enormously strengthened in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident ( during which no one was hurt , by the way ) , is indisputably much better than the Soviet system , which bred endemic incompetence .
Management of U.S. nuclear power plants has improved dramatically since Three Mile Island , and security has been tightened significantly since 9/11 ( though more remains to be done ) .
By comparison with other tempting terrorist targets like petrochemical complexes , reactors are well fortified .
What about the problem of storing radioactive waste ?
It is overrated from an engineering standpoint and pales in comparison with the challenges associated with the permanent sequestration of immense quantities of carbon , as required by clean - coal systems .
Though the wastes from nuclear power plants are highly toxic , their physical quantity is surprisingly small — barely more than 2,000 tons a year in the United States .
The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by our coal plants ?
Nearly 2 billion tons .
Let us say it plainly : today coal - fired power plants routinely kill tens of thousands of people in the United States each year by way of lung cancer , bronchitis and other ailments ; the U.S. nuclear economy kills virtually no one in a normal year .
Perhaps the most serious concern about increasing our reliance on nuclear power is whether it might lead to an international proliferation of atomic bombs .
Contrary to a stubborn myth , however , countries do not decide to build nuclear weapons because they happen to get nuclear reactors first ; they acquire nuclear reactors because they want to build nuclear weapons .
This was true of France and China in the 1950s , of Israel and India in the ’60s and ’ 70s , and it ’s true of Korea and Iran today .
Does anybody honestly think that whether Tehran or Pyongyang produces atomic bombs depends on how many reactors the United States decides to build in the next 10 to 20 years ?
Ultimately , the replacement of old , highly polluting coal - fired power plants by nuclear reactors is essentially no different from deciding , after putting sentimental considerations aside , to replace your inexpensive and reliable — but obsolete — 1983 Olds Omega with a 2007 Toyota Camry or BMW 3 Series sedan .
All that said , it ’s important to be clear about nuclear energy ’s limits .
It ’s likely that the construction of at least one new nuclear power plant will be initiated by the end of this year , ending a two - decade drought in new nuclear plant construction .
But by its own estimates , the U.S. nuclear industry can handle only about two new nuclear reactor projects annually at its present - day capacity .
Obviously , given these limits , a lot of new wind generation , conservation , and improvements in energy use will also be needed .
Wind is especially important because , despite the hopes of many , solar power just is n’t going to cut it on a large scale in the foreseeable future .
Right now , on a dollar per megawatt basis , solar installations are six or seven times as expensive as wind .
Wind turbines already generate electricity almost as inexpensively as fossil fuels .
Thanks to a two cents per kilowatt - hour production incentive from the U.S. government , they are being built at a rate that will increase the amount of wind - generated electricity by nearly three gigawatts a year .
Taking into account that wind turbines produce electricity only about a third of the time , that ’s roughly the equivalent of building one standard one - gigawatt nuclear power plant a year .
Currently , nuclear and wind energy ( as well as clean coal ) are between 25 and 75 percent more expensive than old - fashioned coal at current prices ( not including all the hidden health and environmental costs of coal ) , and so it will take a stiff charge on coal to induce rapid replacement of obsolete plants .
A tax or equivalent trading scheme that increases the cost of coal - generated electricity by , say , 50 percent would stimulate conservation and adoption of more efficient technologies throughout the economy and prompt replacement of coal by some combination of wind , nuclear , and natural gas .
Proceeds from the tax or auctioned credits could ( and should ) be used to compensate regions and individuals most adversely affected by the higher costs , like the poor .
For the last six years , the U.S. government , with well - orchestrated support from industry , has told the American people that we ca n’t afford to attack global warming aggressively .
That ’s nonsense .
We ’re the world ’s richest country , and we use energy about twice as extravagantly as Europe and Japan .
It ’s no surprise that we account for a quarter of the globe ’s greenhouse - gas emissions .
What the United States needs to do is get in step with the Kyoto Protocol , both to establish its bona fides with the other advanced industrial countries and to give countries like India and China an incentive to accept mandatory carbon limits .
That implies cutting U.S. carbon emissions by 25 percent as soon as possible .
The United States could do that by simply making the dirtiest and most inefficient coal plants prohibitively expensive by means of the carbon tax or trading systems mentioned above .
All we need to move decisively on carbon reduction is a different kind of political leadership at the very top .
Surprisingly , it ’s the muscle - bound action - movie star who runs California who has best captured the spirit of what ’s needed .
Last September , the day Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill committing his state to a program of sharp greenhouse - gas reductions , he told an ABC interviewer that climate change kind of “ creeps up on you .
And then all of a sudden it is too late to do something about it .
We do n’t want to go there . ”
You ’ve got a serious case of iPhone fever .
The one big problem ?
You ’re locked into a two - year contract with another carrier .
How do you jump ship without getting reamed with an early termination fee ?
Time to conjure up your inner Houdini and perform some clever escape tricks .
Check out our eight easy , tried - and - true tips for ditching the shackles of that nasty contract … so you can jump headfirst into another one .
Pawn it off
Do n’t want your contract anymore ?
Find someone who does .
Websites like Celltradeusa.com specialize in connecting thousands of people together for the express purpose of transferring the financial responsibilities of cell contracts from one person to another .
As long as the recipient meets the minimum qualifications ( credit check , etc. ) you can transfer the plan over without getting hit with the early termination fee .
Odds of success : 2 - to -

Get out while you still can
If you just signed up for service , you typically have 14 days to drop it – 30 days with some carriers .
A simple call to customer service cancels your plan .
All you may have to do is pay a prorated amount for the service you ’ve already used .
Odds of success : 3 - to -

Move to the boonies
It 's pretty simple to register a change of address with most carriers .
Change your address to an area your cell carrier does n't have service , then call and complain about not getting reception .
Contractually , if a service provider can’t offer access in a given area , the contract is null and void .
Odds of success : 5 - to - 2
Military service
If you ’re already in the armed forces , deployment overseas usually means you ’re free and clear to end your contract early – without any financial obligation .
Odds of success : 6 - to -

Read the fine print
The wee print in your bill ’s Terms of Service ?
Read it closely .
Providers frequently make small changes to you plan – an increase in the number of text messages here , a few more night and weekend minutes there .
It does n’t matter if these alterations benefit you – they automatically void the contract and give you as much as 30 days to get out .
Odds of success : 8 - to -3
Demand to see the paperwork
Did you sign a contract in the store ?
Ask the carrier to come up with a hard copy of this legally binding document .
If the provider ca n’t come up with a physical copy , then you ’re free to go .
Paper gets lost , you might have forgotten to sign and sales reps are often too busy or lazy to file the paperwork .
Odds of success : 10 - to -
1
Abuse the system
Cell - phone service providers usually have roaming agreements with other carriers where they do n’t offer reception .
Roaming areas can often be close , sometimes the next county over .
Chances are you have a friend with a house in one of these roaming areas .
Check a service map to find out .
Then take your phone over on Friday night and as soon your Unlimited Nights and Weekends start , call POPCORN , and leave the phone on .
Roaming is usually free to the customer but costs the carrier dough .
They ’ll practically beg you to leave when you call to cancel the contract .
Odds of success : 20 - to -
1
Fake your own death
Have a friend or colleague work up a good set of tears and call in on your behalf claiming that you ’ve shuffled from this mortal coil .
Report something feasible yet horrible , e.g. , " He … he was just ripped to shreds by that farm machinery . "
The contract will be terminated because you are .
Note :
This is wholly unethical and probably illegal .

Ars Technica sat down today to talk with KHTML developer and Trolltech employee , Lars Knoll .
We talked about his involvement in the project that ultimately became the HTML rendering engine for Apple 's Safari web browser , as well how Apple 's involvement has shaped the future of web browsing for browsers on just about every platform imaginable .
Lars started the KHTML project as we know it in the late 90s to provide an HTML rendering component for the ( then ) newly - released KDE 2.0 .
Over the years , work was done steadily to improve the project , and when Apple decided to create their own browser in 2002 and release it in 2003 , KHTML became the basis of their work .
As is somewhat well known , Apple 's initial involvement in the open - source project known at KHTML was tense .
KHTML developers like Lars were frustrated with Apple 's bare - bones commitment to contributing their changes back to the project .
" It was hard , and in some cases impossible to pick apart Apple 's changes and apply them back to KHTML , " he told us .
Lars went on to say , " This kind of development is really not what I wanted to do .
Developers want to spend their time implementing new features and solving problems , not cherry picking through giant heaps of code for hours at a time . "
Over time , Apple spend significant resources to retool their relationship with KHTML and the open - source community in general by making the Webkit project an open - source one .
It was complete with an anonymous CVS repository , a full history of changes from Apple 's very first involvement in the project , a comprehensive web site with Bugzilla bug tracking , blog , mailing lists , IRC channel , and information for developers if they would like to help the project in any capacity .
" The Webkit project is now is almost as near to a full - fledged open source as a project can be , " Lars told us .
At this point , there are multiple teams in addition to Apple , KDE , and Trolltech working on the rendering engine who all have a stake in its development , continued improvement , and success .
Over the past year , the Webkit team has reversed a lot of the Apple - specific changes that were initially made to the code base and implemented platform - specific abstraction layers to make committing the core rendering code to other platforms significantly easier .
Lars cited the WWDC 2007 announcement by Steve Jobs that Apple would be distributing a version of Safari for Windows XP and Windows Vista as a direct result of these changes .
Oddly enough , these very changes have led to the possibility that KDE will switch to the Webkit engine in its desktop software as opposed to a pure KHTML solution .
Lars said that essentially the saga of KHTML has come full circle , through Apple 's and others ' hands , and has arrived back at the KDE camp with a number of great improvements and enhancements .
As for the impact that Webkit will have on the future , we 've already seen Nokia create a web browser for their series 60 phones based on the project .
Lars , who is involved in the Qt project at Trolltech , told us that they 're looking at using Webkit as the basis of their embeddable web component in the Qt application framework which will bring Webkit to a whole host of platforms , including Trolltech 's Qtopia , an embeddable software stack for mobile devices running Linux .
We asked Lars , who sat in on his first WWDC this past Monday , what he saw that was most compelling .
" I really thought the backup solution was great , " he said .
Lars was also very interested in CoreAnimation , as TrollTech 's Qt framework has a similar project that they will be expanding over time .
" CoreAnimation will give us a lot of great ideas to help build our version of this technology in the future . "
Everyone is talking about Apollo , the platform from Adobe that puts rich web apps on the desktop .
But the tech - talk means very little to the average user who simply wants to see some cool stuff .
Luckily , there are developers out there working diligently on producing Apollo applications , some of which are already fully usable .
To try them out , you first need to download and install the Apollo runtime , which can be downloaded from the official Apollo site .
As far as the actual applications go , most of them are either a heavy beta or a proof - of - concept , but some are already fully usable and quite fun .
Without further ado , here are the ones we like , in no particular order :
1. Tweetr
For the Twitter addicts , the 1000th incarnation of Twitter , this time in Apollo .
It works on Mac , WinXP or Vista ; and it enables you to receive and send tweets , but it occasionally stops updating , which is not nice .
The novelty is mostly in a a cool 3D animation and the ability to change the font size .
www.tweet-r.com
2. The Mini Digg
Just like with Twitter , you can never have too many Digg - related gizmos .
The Mini Digg is actually very cool , because of its tracker feature , which lets you see the statistics for Digg stories you choose , including the number of diggs and comments over time .
The application has its limitations ; for example , you can't track popular items from a subcategory , but give it time , and it might become a great tool for all you Diggers out there .

3. DiggTop
While we 're on the subject of Digg , here 's another Apollo based Digg tool - DiggTop .
It works on Windows and OS X and it shows you a blended list of your favorite Digg topics or keyword feeds .
It also scrapes images from the linked article and displays a cute little slideshow .
It 's done really well and has a lot of options ; it may even be the best Apollo application we 've seen so far .

4. YourMinis
YourMinis , one of the most popular widget platforms , was also one of the first to announce Apollo support .
This means that you can now take any widget from YourMinis ' huge widget base and have it sit on your desktop .
The possibilities here are endless , and if you 're a widget lover , this one is an absolute must .
The installation is simple , once you have Apollo runtime installed , get the YourMinis air file at the link below .
After that , simply browse the YourMinis widget gallery and when you find one you like , click " Copy to Desktop " .

5. Fresh Reader
This one comes straight from Adobe .
It 's a skinnable RSS reader built in AJAX and running on Apollo .
A full featured RSS reader is not the simplest application to make , but this one fares quite well compared with similar web applications , although lack of options at this point will probably keep most users from becoming regulars .

6. DryerFox
From the completely - ridiculous department comes DryerFox , which is ( author 's words ) like Firefox , but inside a dryer .
There 's no sense in explaining it ; suffice to say that it 's absolutely useless , but we just had to mention it .
olddougnewtricks.blogspot.com/2007/04/dryerfox-its-like-firefox-but-inside.html
7. Admetus
Admetus is a simple tool for finding and downloading Flickr images in high resolution .
It has a simiple interface which lets you download images with one click , and it automatically highlights the photos that you already have .
The options are scarce ( read : they do n't exist ) , and you can't change the folder for saved images ( it defaults to Desktop / Admetus / SEARCH_TAG / ) .
However , despite the limitations , the actual application is quite useful .
www.uza.lt/applications/admetus/
8. FineTune Desktop
If you 're a FineTune user , you might want to check this cool tool from the developers of FineTune themselves : FineTune Desktop .
It 's a desktop player which lets you access your playlists and favorite artists without having FineTune open in your browser .
It 's one of the more polished Apollo applications , so if you 're into FineTune make sure to give it a try .
www.finetune.com/desktop/
9. Scout
Here 's one for the web developers , done by Adobe Labs .
Load any website in Scout , and it will let you quickly browse through the source code , the CSS , JavaScript objects , images , or cookies present on the site .
It 's basically a showcase of Apollo 's ability to inspect a page as it's rendered on the client , but it 's also quite useful .
labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Applications:Samples
10 . FlexTube
If for some reason you 'd like to watch YouTube videos without actually having a web browser opened , you can do it with FlexTube .
The application is in an early development stage ( you have to login using test / test as username and password ) and some of the options ( like adding videos to favorites ) do n't work , but the rest of it is fully functional .

Few Economist indicators are as often cited as our Big Mac index , which uses hamburger prices as an index of currency parity .
In the same spirit , we wondered how the globe looks when viewed through the bottom of a Coca - Cola bottle .
It turns out that fizzy mass - market stuff — ie capitalism — is good for you .
Oddly , a list of the top 12 Coke consumers shows no discernible pattern — unless you see what Iceland has in common with Aruba .
Probe a little deeper , however , and patterns emerge .
For one , there is a loose but clear positive relationship between Coke consumption and wealth — perhaps not surprisingly .
Even clearer is the relationship between cola and an index developed by the United Nations to show general quality of life ( as measured by wealth , education , health and literacy ) .
Coke consumption takes off at the upper end of the development scale .
Finally , democracy goes better with Coke .
Consumption rises with political freedom , as measured by Freedom House 's seven - point scale .
Have a cola , North Korea .
Welcome to Wikipedia for Schools !
This selection of articles from Wikipedia matches the UK National Curriculum and can be used by school children around the world .
6000 articles , 26 million words and 50,000 images make Wikipedia for Schools bigger than Harry Potter , the Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia put together !
Wikipedia is great , but it was n’t designed with the National Curriculum in mind .
And because anyone can edit it , articles sometimes get vandalised .
That ’s why we ’ve put together this special collection to make learning as easy and safe as it can be .
Here at SOS Children , we ’ve checked all the articles , tidied them up a bit , and put them together by school subject .
SOS Children ( www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk) is a charity which works around the world to help children in need .
As well as Wikipedia articles , we ’ve collected pages from the SOS Children website , so you can learn more about the work we do in 125 countries around the world .

We would like to say thank you to the Wikimedia Foundation , the people who made the Wikipedia site .
We would also like to thank the many people who have come together over the years to make Wikipedia what it is today .
You can download Wikipedia for Schools from www.sos-schools.org/wikipedia-for-schools.
You can also get a copy on USB memory stick .
Wikipedia for Schools is on the internet too , at schools - wikipedia.org .
The legal stuff : content is covered by disclaimers and licences .

You can find an article by clicking on the school subject on the left of the screen .
You can also choose from a list of all articles by clicking on Title Word Index .
Wikipedia for Schools also includes Portal Pages .
These pages give a summary of a topic and list important articles inside it , and you can find them by choosing Portals from the menu on the left .
You can use the indexes to find your way around but you might like to pick an article and click words in the text to other articles .
For example , good starting places are Africa , The Solar System , Tsunami or Apple .
How the content was selected and checked demo slots Topics we have selected include the very best of Wikipedia .
We chose them because they form part of the UK National Curriculum , and because we thought they would be of interest to children .
The selection is vast , but because we have prioritised subjects on the curriculum , not all topics are covered in the same level of detail .
For this reason , the Welsh town of Llandudno receives more detail on Wikipedia for Schools than places given a similar level of attention on the original Wikipedia site .

We chose articles from a list ranked by importance and quality which was drawn up by project members .
Then we sorted the articles based on relevance to children , and removed unsuitable topics .
With the help of volunteers like Paul and Zaheera , SOS staff checked the articles , choosing those versions of articles free from vandalism , and then removing unsuitable sections .
External links and references have been removed as it was n’t feasible to check all of these .
Wikipedia ’s policies state that content has to be verifiable and based on recognised and reliable sources .
We have n’t included references and sources in this selection , but you can check them on the original Wikipedia site if you ’d like to follow up on something you ’ve read .
This selection is part of a larger collection on the original Wikipedia site , which we recommend for older children in particular .
We have tried to remove links to material in articles outside Wikipedia for Schools , including images where we identified copyright issues .
However , occasional “ dead ends ” may remain , particularly on content boxes which are “ part of a series ” .
Staff and volunteers at SOS have done their very best checking through the collection , but if you do see something which should n't be there do please let us know for our benefit and that of the millions of people who use Wikipedia for Schools .
We ’ve fixed all the mistakes we came across , while retaining a sneaky “ easter egg ” for our own entertainment !
If you find pieces of foreign text which appear as a string of question marks ( “ ???? ” ) or in a similar format , it may be because you do not have that language font installed on your computer .
If this happens , please check the same article on the original Wikipedia site before getting in touch .

Red meat sent a message that she was “ unpretentious and down to earth and unneurotic , ” she said , “ that I ’m not obsessed with my weight even though I ’m thin , and I do n’t have any food issues . ”
She added , “ In terms of the burgers , it said I ’m a cheap date , low maintenance . ”
Salad , it seems , is out .
Gusto , medium rare , is in .
Restaurateurs and veterans of the dating scene say that for many women , meat is no longer murder .
Instead , meat is strategy .
“ I ’ve been shocked at the number of women actually ordering steak , ” said Michael Stillman , vice president of concept development for the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group , which opened the restaurant Quality Meats in April 2006 on West 58th Street .
He said Quality Meats ’ contemporary design and menu , including extensive seafood offerings , were designed to attract more women than a traditional steakhouse .
“ But the meat is appealing to them , much more than what I saw two or three years ago at our other restaurants , ” Mr. Stillman said .
“ They are going for our bone - in sirloin and our cowboy - cut rib steak . ”
In an earlier era , conventional dating wisdom for women was to eat something at home alone before a date , and then in company order a light dinner to portray oneself as dainty and ladylike .
For some women , that is still the practice .
“ It ’s better not to have a jalapeño fajita plate , especially on the first date , ” said Andrea Bey , 28 , who sells video surveillance equipment in Irving , Tex. , and describes herself as “ curvy . ”
“ You do n’t want to be labeled as ‘ princess gassy ’ on the first date . ”
But others , especially those who are thin , say ordering a salad displays an unappealing mousiness .
“ It seems wimpy , insipid , childish , ” said Michelle Heller , 34 , a copy editor at TV Guide .
“ I do n’t want to be considered vapid and uninteresting . ”
Ordering meat , on the other hand , is a declarative statement , something along the lines of “ I am woman , hear me chew . ”

雁・鴨・白鳥達の友人。里山( 里山林、谷津田、畑、沼)で糧を得る農家や林業など生活者の仲間。ITでの物つくり応援(,XML,WEBGIS )：日本のフルバッチシステムで著名なTEXについて [ blog.goo.ne.jp ] （長いな ）
最近、医学書等数式を取り扱う印刷会社間での、TEXをどうしたらよいかの議論が、あちこちで交わされています。
最大手 のS社ですら、特定大学のA、b教授の論文は扱えないと、パスを下との話も。どうしても出来ないことを要求されても、出来ないと申しあげ、新たな最適な環境を推奨しても、駄目だと固辞されています。
とうと うTEXでグラフを書き出したり……、と言う方々は、自分の環境に惚れ込んでしまい、その印刷を強要してくるとのことで、それらわがままな複数人は、印刷業界内では既に妖怪扱いです。
大学の先生がもう妖怪扱い！ 実際大学の教授の言うことなんて妖怪みたいなもんですけどね、今更気づいたの？っていうのは今回の話とは関係ないです。
今回は 、TEXで書かれたドキュメントを出力したくない印刷業界側の意見です。これについて、あんまり詳しくないけれども少し書いてみます。
まず 、TEX は PostScript 書き出せるので印刷屋さんに出せるよね、ていう、研究者側の意見がありますが、古き良き時代と違って、印刷屋さん側の
PS 処理系は異常進化を遂げてしまったので、実際には生 PS を取り扱うっていうケースは少なくて（ドラッグ＆ドロップしかしないね）、むしろ
PS はバックヤードに隠れて作業しているというのがほとんどの印刷屋さんでの扱いです。だから、研究者側が思っているように、GhostScript で出力できたから出るだろ、ていう次元の話ではないです。そういう意味で、あえて
TEX 原稿受け付けます、ていうのは貴重だし、見方によってはチャレンジャーなわけです。
次に 、TEX じゃない、別の組版システムにしろ、手いう印刷会社側の話ですが、御存知の通り、TEX
のインストールがめんどくさいという問題ありますがそもそも研究以外のこと覚えたくないんですよねー大学の先生って。ただでさえ本業以外の雑務が多いというのに云々。つうわけで、一度覚えてしまったあの表記は変えようがないです。ウン年前僕も数学系の研究室にいましたけれども、Windows
98が平気で使われている世の中で、教授は、PC-386Pで
TEX していました（アリスソフトの 256 色ゲーム動かせるかなーとか一瞬考えたものです）。
そんで、僕は思うのは、僕ら印刷屋さんも、かつて僕がそうであった研究側も、お互いの縄張りから出て対等の立場で問題点を話し合うってことしてきていなかったんだろうかって思うんだけれども、そういうのって東京書籍印刷あたりでなされていたんだろうなーて思うので、憶測にしかすぎません。
PS処理系（RIP）がフィルムセッタに直接つながっていて、単ページずつ出力されて、それを面付けしていけばよかった牧歌的な時代であればまだよかったんですけれども、それからかなり時間がたっているから、お互いの認識がかなーりずれてきていたのじゃないかと思うんですけれども、こういうのって、当事者の意見を聞いてみたいものですね。実際、Web 上には、TEX 入稿し続けてきた猛者がたくさんいるわけですし。一方の印刷屋さん側の論客は見あたらないのかもしれないですね。TEX
入稿やっていますっていう印刷屋さんの blog は見たことないもん。
最後に、僕の印刷屋さんとしての TEX 原稿の見方ですが、印刷屋さんとしては、教育訓練がしづらいという最大の欠点がある以上（担当者一人だけができるというのは業務としてはまずくて、24 時間運営していくためには、最低
3 人を同じスキルにそろえるようにしなくてはならないわけです）、常設で入稿可能な形式とはしたくない。せめて印刷に問題のない
PDF 形式で入稿する方向に収束して欲しいです。

TeX入稿についての誤解 | Okumura's Blog [ oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp ]
PDF にしてしまえばいいというのは誤解で、印刷会社側から「 印刷に問題ない
PDF 形式である」との検証結果を受けてから入稿するというプロセスが踏まれないといけませんので（プロプライエタリプロダクト以外では必須とも言える）、ある意味誤解を広げている結果になっていると思います。この件については別の機会で取り上げたいと思います。
LONDON , England ( Reuters ) -- Dozens of chanting , praying protesters faced off against local officials at a Hindu monastic community in Wales on Thursday as the saga of Shambo the sacred bullock appeared to be reaching a head .
Hindu worshippers say they cannot assist the killing of any life .
Officials from the Welsh Assembly had arrived to take away the six - year - old Friesian for slaughter after it had tested positive for bovine TB .
But their way was barred by the protesters who have built a special shrine for Shambo at the monastery and have vowed to save him from the slaughterhouse .
The assembly men were forced to retreat and content themselves with posting a warrant for the animal 's removal on the door to the reception area of the Skanda Vale temple near Carmarthen .
" Things are getting pretty crazy and tense , " said a spokesman for the community .
" The officials are still here , but they can not get to Shambo . "
Vanloads of police were stationed around the Community of the Many Names of God .
The standoff came at the end of months of legal wrangling over the fate of Shambo , which ended this month when the Appeal Court ruled the bullock must die in accordance with the current government policy of slaughtering TB - positive cattle .
The monks were still clinging to hope on Thursday , saying an Indian charity had agreed to take Shambo out of the country , but the chances of his being able to go looked slim .
" We are remaining hopeful , but a lot of people are distressed at what is happening , " said the spokesman .
" The Welsh government is ignoring any options to keep Shambo alive -- they are set on killing him .
We just do not understand that . "
He added : " Our religious laws prevent us from assisting in the killing of any life and so we will not help the inspectors remove Shambo .
He will remain in his enclosure and they will have to physically desecrate a temple and an act of worship to get him . "
Cows are sacred to Hindus and the spokesman said it would be " an appalling desecration of life " if the bullock were slaughtered .
More than 23,500 people have signed a protest petition .
The National Farmers Union says no bull should be exempt from the rules governing TB and that to spare Shambo would be unfair on all those farmers who have had to see their stock slaughtered .
A spokesman for the Welsh regional government said the option of allowing Shambo to go to India was not possible because it would put other animals and people at risk .
He added : " exporting the bullock to India would not provide for the post - mortem examination needed for the management of the disease in the rest of the community 's herd and the neighboring herds . "

Artist 's conception of what Adriosaurus microbrachis might have looked like nearly 100 million years ago .
Remains from a 95 - million - year - old marine creature with nubs for legs is clarifying how some lizards shed their limbs as they crept through evolutionary time and morphed into slinky snakes .
Described in the current issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology , the snake - like lizard had a small head and willowy body .
Extending 10 to 12 inches from snout to tail , the aquatic creature also sported a lengthy neck and relatively large rear limbs .
Missing were all the bones of its forearms , including the hands and digits found in modern lizards .
The oddball creature , Adriosaurus microbrachis , is a member of a lineage of lizards thought to be snakes ' closest relatives .
“ It adds to the picture we have of what was happening 100 million years ago , ” said lead researcher Michael Caldwell , a paleontologist at the University of Alberta , in Canada .
“ We now know that losing limbs is n't a new thing and that lizards were doing it much earlier than we originally thought . ”
The new fossil reveals the earliest record of this limb - shedding in a lizard and gives scientists a rare glimpse back to the time when terrestrial lizards evolved to be limbless and returned to their watery origins .
In fact , the ancestors of all animals lived in aquatic and marine environments .
Steps to limb loss
Body parts once used in an animal ’s evolutionary past but tossed aside or morphed via natural selection to provide another function are called vestigial limbs .
“ It has been clear for centuries that snakes are tetrapods ( four - legged vertebrates ) that lost their limbs , ” Caldwell told LiveScience .
“ The process and pattern of this limb - loss has remained a mystery for a long time . ”
Fossils of lizards in transitional states — as the four - legged critters begin to evolve into snakes — have been rare .
“ What we have not had to this point is a fossil record of vestigial limbs in lizards , ” Caldwell said .
“ This is the first . ”
Morphing lizard
Scientists initially collected the fossil during the 19th century from a limestone quarry in Slovenia .
For nearly 100 years , the little lizard remained in a collection bin at the Natural History Museum in Trieste , Italy , before Caldwell and a colleague found it in 1996 during a visit to Europe .
The scientists were surprised to find the lizard ’s forelimbs were too small to be useful for walking , while its hind limbs appeared to be functional .
" For some oddball reason , the forelimbs were lost before the rear limbs , when you would think it would be the opposite , " Caldwell said .
" The front limbs would be useful for holding onto dinner or digging a hole , but it must be developmentally easier to get rid of the forelimbs . "
Though the lizard find does not make for a “ missing link , ” Caldwell suggests it suffices as a critical data point for helping scientists understand the aquatic process of limb loss .
Jet Li has starred in Chinese martial arts films like Hero
Writing on his website , the star said his 2000 hit Romeo Must Die was banned by censors for featuring gangsters .
In 2001 , Kiss of the Dragon was banned because Li's character , a Chinese policeman , killed people abroad .
" Films do n't always have to be realistic , " said Li , who argued China 's film industry was suffering as a result of the restrictions placed on it .
" Typically , action films have good and bad characters , " the star said .
" If gangsters are n't appropriate and police officers are n't appropriate , then what type of character can there be that would n't start an argument ? "
" It leaves only the ancient Chinese stories to be produced . "
Strict rules
China carefully controls media content and only allows about 20 foreign movies to be officially screened each year .
And China 's Film Bureau has the power to request further editing of films which it considers to contain offensive scenes .
One such film was the Johnny Depp's Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End .
The Chinese news agency Xinhua said scenes with actor Chow Yun - fat were cut because his character - a bald and scarred pirate - was an insult to the country 's population .
Li , a former national kung fu champion , made his name in Hong Kong film with movies like the Once Upon a Time in China series before moving on to Hollywood .
He has appeared in several Western action films , including Lethal Weapon 4 , but continues to make Chinese - language films like Hero - which was nominated for the best foreign film Oscar in 2002 .
Li is currently shooting Hollywood movie The Forbidden Kingdom with fellow martial arts expert Jackie Chan .
When popular BitTorrent tracker sites were targeted last December , some wondered if the tracker logs and other data would fall into the hands of the Motion Picture Association of America .
The answer was revealed yesterday when the MPAA filed 286 lawsuits against US residents , and the information that led to the defendants ' identification was obtained from torrent site logs .
So did the torrent site operators give up the goods ?
It looks like that may be the case , depending on how you interpret a comment made by an MPAA executive .
" Internet movie thieves be warned :
You have no friends in the online community when you are engaging in copyright theft , " MPAA Senior Vice President John Malcom said in a statement .
When LokiTorrent was shut down in February , a Texas court ordered that its logs be turned over to the MPAA .
However , the MPAA states that the latest lawsuits did not stem from that particular enforcement action .
Do n't be surprised if there is another round of lawsuits in the next few months tied to the LokiTorrent takedown .
It has been a rough summer for the movie industry .
Ticket sales have been down as the moviegoing public has been turned off by the poor quality of Hollywood 's recent offerings along with high ticket prices , movies that do n't start at the advertised times , and outrageous concession prices .
In short , the movie industry is finding itself in the same boat that the music industry did a few years ago .
Although the MPAA will continue to attack file - sharing and likely continue down the same litigious road the RIAA has traveled , they 're not fooling anyone least of all , themselves if they think continued crackdowns on illicit downloads are going to help fix what 's wrong with the movie industry .
The problems go far deeper than that , and it's only through rethinking their whole business model , acknowledging and even embracing changing consumer preferences , and doing some things differently that they have any hope of reversing their fortunes .
Early last month , The North American Securities Administrators Association ( NASAA ) released a list of 10 financial traps that investors should avoid .
The article also provides advices on the right course of action when shopping for financial products .
Among the advices , I found this one “ If you do n’t understand an investment , do n’t invest , ” can in fact be applied to many situations that do n’t involve financial scams at all .
Before making any investment decisions , a thorough research should be done in order to get all the facts , pros and cons , of the product involved .
Without a full understanding of how it works , what actions are required , and possible consequences , your ill - advised investments will come back and bite you .
Groups File Lawsuit Charging DHS Rule Would Cause Widespread Discrimination and Harm U.S. Citizens and Other Authorized Workers
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
SAN FRANCISCO - The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations ( AFL - CIO ) , the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Immigration Law Center ( NILC ) and the Central Labor Council of Alameda County along with other local labor movements today filed a lawsuit charging that a new Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) rule will threaten jobs of U.S. citizens and other legally authorized workers simply because of errors in the government 's inaccurate social security earnings databases .
The rule violates workers ' rights and imposes burdensome obligations on employers who receive Social Security Administration ( SSA ) " no- match " letters that inform an employer of alleged discrepancies between employee records and the SSA database .
Under the new rule , many U.S. citizens and legally authorized workers could be required to be terminated if their erroneous SSA records are not fixed within 90 days of an SSA " no - match " letter being sent to an employer .
The rule is scheduled to go into effect on September 14 .
SSA intends to send out notices to employers enforcing the new rule beginning next Tuesday , September 4 .
The new notices will be sent to approximately 140,000 employers , affecting about eight million employees .
" This rule is a new tool to repress workers ' rights in the name of phony immigration enforcement , " said John Sweeney , President of the AFL - CIO .
" Employers have used SSA " no- match " letters to fire workers when workers try to organize , when they report a wage claim or workplace hazard , or when they get injured .
The new rule gives employers a stronger pretext for engaging in such unlawful conduct . "
Currently , under the Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) , employers must verify the immigration status of employees upon initial hire , using a process carefully crafted by Congress .
The new rule would upset the careful balance struck by Congress that does not impose continuing verification obligations or seek to hold employers liable based on SSA records .
The new DHS rule imposes liability based on failure to respond to an SSA " no- match " letter , even though SSA errors are caused by many innocent factors such as typographical errors and name changes due to marriage or divorce , and the use of multiple surnames , which is common in many parts of the world .
According to the Office of the Inspector General in SSA , 12.7 million of the 17.8 million discrepancies in SSA 's database – more than 70 % – belong to native - born U.S. citizens .
" The new rule turns the law on its head by using the notoriously incomplete and inaccurate social security databases to decide who is authorized to work .
This will wreak havoc with workers and businesses and will cause massive discrimination against anyone who looks or sounds ' foreign , ' " said Lucas Guttentag , Director of the ACLU 's Immigrants ' Rights Project .
" DHS is trying to hijack the social security system for improper immigration enforcement . "
Under the current system , employers submit records of employee earnings to SSA so that workers can receive credit for their earnings .
Sometimes an employee 's name and social security number do not match the information in SSA 's enormous and error - prone database .
In that case , a report is placed in SSA 's Earning Suspense File , which is protected by tax privacy laws .
The database currently contains more than 250 million unmatched records , a substantial portion of which belongs to U.S. citizens and lawfully working non-citizens .
When a database discrepancy occurs , SSA sends " no - match " letters to certain employers advising them of such .
In the past , the letters have been purely advisory , and clearly state that they do not " make any statement about an employee 's immigration status . "
Indeed , SSA has recognized in the past that the issuance of a " no- match " letter does not indicate that an employee is not authorized to work , and when SSA has been able to resolve mismatches , most turned out to involve U.S. citizens .
Under the new DHS rule , however , an employer who receives a " no- match " letter is required to give the employee 90 days to resolve the data discrepancy with the huge SSA bureaucracy , a formidable challenge .
If the employee is unable to do so , the employee must complete a new employment verification form , using identification documents with a different social security number .
If the worker insists the original number submitted is correct but can't resolve the discrepancy by the deadline , DHS requires the employer to take " reasonable steps " that might include firing the employee .
Rather than go through this burdensome process , some employers are likely to simply fire workers whose names appear on the letters — including U.S. citizens and other authorized workers — without giving employees a chance to correct the information , said the groups that filed the lawsuit .
Unscrupulous employers will simply ignore the letter and continue to employ undocumented workers .
" It is truly ironic that the DHS calls this rule a ' safe harbor , ' " said Marielena Hincapié , Staff Attorney and Director of Programs at NILC .
" Its real effect would be to create a devastating ' storm ' of bureaucratic challenges , increased discrimination , potential financial ruin for workers , and improper and burdensome obligations upon employers .
And we know from years of experience in dealing with 'no - match ' letters that unscrupulous employers will use the new rule to legitimize their adverse employment actions against workers exercising their labor rights . "
The lawsuit requests a court order preventing DHS and SSA from implementing the new DHS rule , including the initial mailing of ' no - match ' letter packets scheduled to go out to employers on September 4 , until a decision on the rule 's legality can be reached .
The lawsuit also requests a finding that the rule is invalid .
The lawsuit was filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California .
In addition to the AFL - CIO , which is represented by the law firm of Altshuler Berzon , LLP , other parties bringing the lawsuit include the Central Labor Council of Alameda County , represented by the ACLU , the ACLU of Northern California , and NILC , as well as the San Francisco Labor Council and the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council , represented by Weinberg , Roger and Rosenfeld .
In addition to Guttentag and Hincapié , lawyers on the case include Stephen Berzon , Scott Kronland , Jonathan Weissglass , Linda Lye and Danielle Leonard of Altshuler , Berzon ; Jonathan Hiatt , James Copess and Ana Avendaño of the AFL - CIO ; Jennifer Chang , Mόnica M. Ramírez , and Omar Jadwat of the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project ; Alan Schlosser and Julia Mass of the ACLU of Northern California ; Linton Joaquin and Monica Guizar of NILC ; and David Rosenfeld and Manjari Chawla of Weinberg , Roger and Rosenfeld .

How can you be the biggest company in a rapidly growing market segment and still see your profits and stock price plunge ?
Its easy to do if you forget your organization ’s purpose .
Whole Foods , a natural foods supermarket chain , has recently seen both its profits and its stock price plunge .
Since their business segment is growing rapidly , many are at a loss to explain what exactly is going on .
I am a long - time Whole Foods shopper and I believe their decline is likely to continue .
For many years my family spent around $ 200 a week at Whole Foods .
We now shop at the store only occasionally .
Have we abandoned natural and organic foods ?
Hardly !
Whole Foods has simply lost our business .
We still buy as many natural and organic foods , but other retailers such as our local natural food store , Trader Joe ’s and Wegman ’s have now earned our business .
At the heart as any success of any business is their ability to serve the consumer .
The great economist Ludwig Von Mises observed : “ The profit system makes those men prosper who have succeeded in filling the wants of the people in the best possible and cheapest way .
Wealth can be acquired only by serving the consumers . ”
At the core of an organization ’s ability to serve the consumer is their understanding of what their purpose is and their ability to adhere to their purpose .
To the extent that an organization understands its purpose and adheres to it , the organization builds trust with the consumer .
As trust grows profits grow , as trust declines profits must decline .
Although many companies forget it , there is no secret to that relationship .
A good example of an organization that remembers its purpose and builds trust is Southwest Airlines .
Southwest has a guiding purpose to provide travelers low fares and excellent service .
All of their decisions are based around that purpose .
Southwest has met their purpose very well and they have been rewarded by consumers .
Whole Foods claims as part of its mission that : “ We sell the highest quality natural and organic products available , and that we satisfy and delight our customers ” .
This was indeed once true of Whole Foods , but in the experience of my family it is no longer .
One example will suffice .
For years , we consumed Whole Foods premium Icelandic salmon .
Years ago we were stunned to find out that Whole Foods , like any other supermarket chain , was feeding their farm - raised salmon artificial colors .
I contacted Whole Foods several times and asked them to consider labeling their fish as containing artificial colors .
They initially refused .
It was not until Safeway began to label their salmon that Whole Foods began to label correctly their product .
That was the first betrayal of trust that my family experienced from Whole Foods .
Sadly , it was not the last .
As the years went on , we caught Whole Foods in more and more questionable practices .
These practices further eroded our trust .
Each time we brought these practices to their attention .
Each time our concerns were dismissed .
Why is Whole Foods stock price being hammered ?
The answer is simple .
They are no longer fulfilling their guiding purpose .
They no longer sell the “ highest quality ” products , and they no longer “ satisfy and delight ” their customers .
I take no pleasure in writing these words .
Whole Foods had served my family well for many years .
I hope they can find their way again .

This week , Bible Girl turns to Jared Binder , a graduate student at Dallas Theological Seminary and a Dallas Observer intern , for thoughts on the " deadly sin " no one ever talks about in church .
Bible Girl posts from Bible Girl will be sparse in the next few weeks ; I 'm working on something for the paper version of Unfair Park .
The Bible Belt may not be expanding , but the waistlines of its residents are .
It seems that the highest rates of obesity in the nation are in the East South Central part of the United States , according to ObesityinAmerica.org .
That would include Alabama , Kentucky , Mississippi and Tennessee .
A very close second to that is the West South Central states of Arkansas , Louisiana , Oklahoma and , you guessed it , Texas .
For those of us who live in the Bible Belt and actually believe the Bible , the news gets even worse .
A 1998 study by Purdue University titled American Changing Lives showed that some religious groups such as Baptists and fundamentalists were more likely to be overweight than nonreligious people .
“ The other thing that was very clear from the data is that there are certain religious practice issues that are very consequential , ” says Purdue sociology professor Kenneth Ferraro , citing a more recent study .
“ We found that people who consume lots of religious media , TV and radio were more likely to be obese and actually to develop obesity over the study period . ”
It sounds like a government conspiracy against Southern Baptists .
But the problem is not with the government .
The problem is with many of us Christians .
There ’s this thing in the Bible called gluttony .
The Bible says it ’s a sin .
But we do n’t like to talk about that particular sin .
We prefer to point a pudgy finger at others and decry the evils of drugs and alcohol , pornography , abortion and homosexuality .
Compared to those , gluttony is just a little sin .
" I think as a church we ’re pretty selective -- like for example , on the church sin list you ’ve got alcohol and tobacco , and those tend to make a lot of the popular sin lists , but you do n’t have caffeine .
I could deny the Trinity and keep my job easier than taking away all the coffee pots on Sunday morning , ” says Pastor Gary Brandenburg of Fellowship Bible Church Dallas .
“ Or how about church potlucks ?
There ’s the greatest array of artery - clogging food and cholesterol - producing food known to man at church potlucks .
That ’s OK as long as you do n’t smoke a cigarette outside the church . ”
This “ little ” sin of gluttony is killing people by the hundreds of thousands every year .
Obesity has now surpassed smoking as the No. 1 health threat in America .
It can be directly linked to high cholesterol , high blood pressure , Type II Diabetes , acid reflux , sleep apnea , heart disease and many forms of cancer .
So why are n’t more pastors and churches talking about it ?
One reason is pretty obvious .
We do n’t want to risk losing church members by offending anyone .
“ It is an issue that potentially could disaffiliate individuals , " Ferraro says .
" Remember that it is normal to be overweight in the U.S.
The majority of the adult U.S. population is overweight .
And so if you start speaking about that there is a potential risk that parishioners will not like that message . ”
Dr. Don Colbert , author of The Seven Pillars of Health and What Would Jesus Eat ? , points out that many Christians do n’t view overeating as sin because their pastors look past it or condone it .
In fact , many of Colbert ’s patients are obese pastors .
Colbert says that if parishioners see their minister eating junk food , sporting a bulging waistline and not exercising , they will often feel free to emulate his example .
As the head goes , so goes the body .
Christians do n’t talk about gluttony because we do n’t think we are gluttons .
Gluttony has been divorced from obesity in our minds so that it becomes merely a health issue rather than a spiritual and moral one .
We do n’t gain weight because we eat to excess .
We gain weight because of our glands and our genes .
Weight problems , we tell ourselves , are a result if living in a fast - food , high - pressure culture .
There ’s some truth to that , but instead of going against the culture and striving for a healthier lifestyle , we have embraced the culture .
There are some people out there with legitimate problems such as thyroid conditions , but for most of us “ the rapidly expanding man ” disease is a result of our greed and poor choices .
The Gnostics held the view that the material world was bad and that only spiritual things were good .
Many of us Christians appear to agree with this perspective by the way we give little or no value to the health and condition of our bodies .
They ’re just going to pass away some day , right ?
It ’s the spirit that really matters .
Yet the Bible clearly teaches that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit and as such deserve to be treated with care and reverence .
If we treated our church buildings the way many of us treat our bodies , no one would come near them .
I know that given the choice we would all choose fit , healthy bodies over sick , flabby ones .
But the truth is we want to overindulge more than we want to go through the hard work of losing weight and staying fit .
There are three major roadblocks that I see standing in the way of overweight believers .
One is that as long as we refuse to see our behavior as sin , there is no chance of our repenting of it and gaining God ’s help in our battle against it .
The second thing is that we seem to know only one way of dealing with temptation .
We abstain .
Alcohol may lead to drunkenness , so we avoid it completely .
Smoking often leads to cancer , so we do n’t smoke .
We abstain from sex until we 're married .
Abstinence works well with those kinds of things , but as we all know , we ca n’t abstain from food .
The Bible teaches us another way of fighting overindulgence .
It ’s called temperance or self - control .
The Bible calls temperance a fruit of the spirit .
When is the last time you heard a sermon about being self - controlled in your eating and disciplining your body through exercise ?
The third roadblock comes when we so abuse our bodies through excess that they enter a state of addiction .
Our hormones and insulin levels are all messed up , so they trigger a ravenous appetite and cravings for the wrong kinds of food .
Escaping this condition is a very difficult process .
People who are serious about changing their bad habits and adopting a more active lifestyle often experience withdrawal symptoms and depression .
Perhaps the saddest thing of all is that we are passing all of our bad habits on to our children .
They are not waiting until they grow up to get fat and lazy .
They are modeling our behavior , and because of it they are developing diseases such as Type II diabetes and heart disease at an extremely young age .
Jesus called us to be salt and light in the world .
That means we are supposed to be the standard of what is right and good .
This is one area where we as a church are failing miserably .
We need to get serious about the obesity epidemic and stop waiting on science to develop a miracle cure .
We need to take action before it is too late .
One week before his death , Jerry Falwell said in an interview with Christiane Amanpour of CNN that he was praying to God for 20 more years of life .
He wanted to see the rest of his vision for Liberty University come to pass .
Obviously , God did not grant his request .
Falwell died alone in his office of cardiac arrhythmia .
Before the hate mail starts flooding in , please understand that I am not pointing fingers at Falwell or saying that he died of overeating .
But I do know that he was very much overweight and that two years before this he’d had a stent implanted to treat a blockage in his coronary arteries .
Falwell died at 73 .
Reaching the age of 73 is optimistic for many who struggle with obesity .
“ I tell people , sure you can continue eating the way you do -- all the sugar and cake after meals and pies and cookies and Snickers bars and fried foods -- and you ’ll still go to heaven , ” Dr. Don Colbert says .
“ You ’ll just go there much sooner . ” -- Jared Binder
I ’ve worked for startups and stalwarts , small shops and large corporations , firms where software is the means to an end , and firms where it was an end in itself .
After years of exploring what I love about building software I ’ve realized that coding for a 17 - person dot com is a far cry from building enterprise software for a 300 - person credit card company .
It only took me eight years to figure out why .
There are a myriad of articles on interviewing , evaluating , and hiring software developers , but a topic that ’s rarely discussed is how to attract software developers that fit your company ’s environment .
With the current state of the software job market , it ’s critical as a hirer that you determine not only what type of developers will be happy in your environment ( your “ developer demographic ” ) , but how you can become more attractive to that particular slice of the market .
Your Developer Demographic
As an example , IndyMac and Countrywide are large financial institutions with development offices in Los Angeles .
They attract people looking for stable jobs with good benefits where they can code 9 to 5 and then go home and not think about it from 5 to 9 .
I envy people who do not grow bored with this environment ; I really do .
Life would be much , much simpler if I could handle it .
There are also tech startups that attract caffeine - junkies .
Long hours with potentially large reward , and the prospect of building something really cool in a short amount of time that could make a difference in peoples ’ lives .
Or , more likely , be relegated to the failed startup scrap heap .
These companies should be looking for people who love using new technology , are typically younger , willing to take risks , and willing to shoot from the hip .
These may be extreme cases , but they illustrate the point : certain attitudes and personality traits play nicely with certain environments .
Often , a developer who thrives in one environment will find that she slowly withers away in others .
The Three Dimensions
To get more specific , there are three dimensions to a company that most affect the internal environment for a software developer .
It ’s critical that you know which of these your company falls into , and not only market to , but ensure you can retain developers who fit that demographic .
The descriptions of the software developers who like to work at each corporate classification are generalized , but they serve as a guide to get you thinking about the personality of your ideal candidate .
Your company may not match exactly with one of the choices below each dimension , but do your best to categorize it .
Many companies start off as one thing and transition to something very different in the first year or two .
Size Small – Some small companies are startups , and some are 10 - year old , profitable , mature businesses that make money hand over fist with 9 employees .
Software developers who like small companies are typically social , they like the vibe of knowing everyone , going to lunch with the same people , and knowing that they contribute a great deal to the success or failure of the enterprise .

Software developers who like small companies are typically social , they like the vibe of knowing everyone , going to lunch with the same people , and knowing that they contribute a great deal to the success or failure of the enterprise .
Large –
The bulk of corporate development is for larger companies .
They tend to have big teams , lots of process , and decent - sized QA and Change Management teams .
Software developers who like large companies tend to enjoy more process , like working on larger teams where they can either lead or be led , and enjoy the possibility for growth that comes with a large organization .
Chaos Level Stable – Stable companies tend to be , um …stable .
They have good benefits , and employees can often get away with working 8 or 9 hour days .
Developers who prefer stable companies are likely a little further along in their career , may have a family , like the consistency of coming in to the same office each day , and enjoy their time out of the office when they do n’t have to think about software .

Startup – Startups tend to be more risky with the possibility of more reward .
The salary may not be as high as that of a stable company , but the stock options will be worth six - figures if you can get your bleeding - edge online calendar out the door before Google ’s .
Benefits tend to be spotty .
The hours are long , but it ’s more than worth it for developers who are passionate about technology ( read : bring books about ASP.
NET to the beach ) , love building software that matters , and enjoy the camaraderie of working on a team of people who share their interests .
Focus Software ( or a technology that relies on software ) –
These companies rely on software for their main source of revenue , whether they sell it ( Microsoft , Intuit ) , give it away ( Google , Craigslist ) , or offer it on some type of “ pay to play ” basis ( eBay , salesforce.com ) .
Technology firms that rely on software are companies like Palm , Apple , or the guys who make the fingerprint readers I keep seeing at data centers .
Software may not be their main source of income , but they are technology companies and software is critical to their product .
Software developers who prefer these types of companies enjoy being around other software people ; they like the idea that technology is at the core of their company , and they love that they work on real products that people use .
In addition , they relish the fact that software firms tend to live towards the cutting edge and are able to constantly upgrade their skills to the latest and greatest .

Everything Else –
These companies make up the majority of companies in the world ; their main source of revenue is something other than software – credit cards , lawn furniture – you name it .
“ Everything else ” companies use software to support their business : to track widgets , support their call center , and balance their books .
The majority of corporate software jobs are working for companies under this umbrella .
Software developers who enjoy this type of company like building applications to support accounting , management , and the people who produce or sell the company ’s main product , and they are either very content to know they can go home at night and not think about developing software , or they go home at night and all they think about is they day they can leave the company and work for someone like Google .
Your Company , Your Developer Demographic , Your Job Description
Before writing your job description think hard about where you fall in each of the dimensions .
Then think twice as hard about the kind of developer who will be happy at your company .
Do n’t kid yourself ; you can convince the 24 year - old tech hot - shot to work for your financial services company by offering him a huge salary , but he ’ll be gone in 9 months because you ’re using three - year old technology and developing boring ( from his perspective ) , back - office software .
Once you ’ve determined who will be happy at your company , write your job description with that person in mind .
You ’re a large company with great benefits ?
Spell it out in bullet points : plain , simple , and official .
Play up your stability .
You ’re a small startup with no benefits ?
Use a casual tone and create excitement .
Make that 24 - year old hot - shot be dying to work for you .
Even if he has to pay for his own health care

BBC News in Manchester , New Hampshire
Ron Paul :
One of the more ' authentic ' candidates ?
Of course the debates have to be realistic , but one should perhaps have some sympathy for those trying to get their voices heard .
So let 's hear it for the little guys , guys like the Republican candidate Ron Paul who told his grim - faced fellow debaters here in New Hampshire that the war in Iraq was a mistake and the troops should come home now .
And guys like the Democrat Dennis Kucinich , who dismissing his low showing in the polls said : " I do n't buy into their logic .
I sail by my ideals , those are my stars . "
There are two types of presidential candidate : " authentic " and " inauthentic " .
I think Hillary Clinton is inauthentic .
So is Mitt Romney .
By this I do not mean that they are insincere or untrustworthy , but that they have trouble communicating a sense of " what you see is what you get . "
They look schooled .
Get real
This is not a bar to winning , in fact far from it , but it does lead to occasional doubts in their respective parties about their gut attraction as candidates .
Two Congressmen have impressed me at the debates so far for their authenticity .
I think Mr Kucinich is completely authentic .
I sail by my ideals , those are my stars
Dennis Kucinich
Democrat candidate
Send us your comments
In the spin room after the debates he talks easily and frankly about his views .
He is not the slightest bit defensive about his vision of turning America into a nation of peaceniks or planning for the US medical system to be modelled on Britain 's or Canada's .
But it is Ron Paul , the congressman from Texas , who has really caught my attention .
He is similarly authentic .
No wobbles
Mr Paul got mugged by Rudy Giuliani in a recent debate : he pointed out that America 's global footprint ( which he would like to reduce ) was responsible for the conditions that led to the terror attacks of 2001 .
Key contenders McCain , Giuliani and Romney hog the limelight
He was not excusing the attacks , he was trying to explain them .
But Mr Giuliani spotted an opportunity and slapped the congressman down .
But while Mr Giuliani brings his abortion opinions in for a landing - they appear to have been solidified now after some initial fluidity - at least Mr Paul has never wavered on his core beliefs .
Mr Giuliani has said that while he is personally opposed to abortion , he believes women should be able to decide for themselves whether to terminate a pregnancy .
Mr Paul 's beliefs are out of favour with the modern Republican party but they represent a very important strand of American political thought : Mr Paul is a rational believer in freedom .
He is not , we may surmise , a social conservative , who wants the government to take an interest in what is going on in America 's bedrooms .
In fact he does not want the government to take an interest in anything much : he wants it gone from people 's lives .
He does not want American power to be projected around the world because he does not want American power to be vested in Washington .
He prefers the notion that local control , local democracy , local power , is the genius of the American way .
Mess with it and you get 9/11 .
Mr Paul speaks , at least in part , for many Republicans who feel their party has been hi-jacked in recent years by two groups who do not really speak for them : the religious conservatives and the neo-conservatives .
Follicle race
As I say , Mr Paul will not win and nor will Mr Kucinich but to describe them as mavericks is to miss the point of these men : they are keepers of the consciences of their respective parties .
In the never - ending battle of ideas that shapes all human affairs , these two politicians are at least taking part .
One of the minor candidates - not one of these two - remarked to me months ago that in the end the choice would be between people " with better hair . "
True enough .
But the big beasts with the expensive coiffures kid themselves if they , or we in the media , believe that only they are relevant .

An inexpensive detector developed by a NASA - led team can now see invisible infrared light in a range of " colors , " or wavelengths .
The detector , called a Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector ( QWIP ) array , was the world 's largest ( one million - pixel ) infrared array when the project was announced in March 2003 .
It was a low - cost alternative to conventional infrared detector technology for a wide range of scientific and commercial applications .
However , at the time it could only detect a narrow range of infrared colors , equivalent to making a conventional photograph in just black and white .
The new QWIP array is the same size but can now sense infrared over a broad range .
"
The ability to see a range of infrared wavelengths is an important advance that will greatly increase the potential uses of the QWIP technology , " said Dr. Murzy Jhabvala of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , Principal Investigator for the project .
Infrared light is invisible to the human eye , but some types are generated by and perceived as heat .
A conventional infrared detector has a number of cells ( pixels ) that interact with an incoming particle of infrared light ( an infrared photon ) and convert it to an electric current that can be measured and recorded .
They are similar in principle to the detectors that convert visible light in a digital camera .
The more pixels that can be placed on a detector of a given size , the greater the resolution , and NASA 's QWIP arrays are a significant advance over earlier 300,000 - pixel QWIP arrays , previously the largest available .
NASA 's QWIP detector is a Gallium Arsenide ( GaAs ) semiconductor chip with over 100 layers of detector material on top .
Each layer is extremely thin , ranging from 10 to 700 atoms thick , and the layers are designed to act as quantum wells .
Quantum wells employ the bizarre physics of the microscopic world , called quantum mechanics , to trap electrons , the fundamental particles that carry electric current , so that only light with a specific energy can release them .
If light with the correct energy hits one of the quantum wells in the array , the freed electron flows through a separate chip above the array , called the silicon readout , where it is recorded .
A computer uses this information to create an image of the infrared source .
NASA 's original QWIP array could detect infrared light with a wavelength between 8.4 and 9.0 micrometers .
The new version can see infrared between 8 to 12 micrometers .
The advance was possible because quantum wells can be designed to detect light with different energy levels by varying the composition and thickness of the detector material layers .
"
The broad response of this array , particularly in the far infrared -- 8 to12 micrometers -- is crucial for infrared spectroscopy , " said Jhabvala .
Spectroscopy is an analysis of the intensity of light at different colors from an object .
Unlike a simple photograph that just shows the appearance of an object , spectroscopy is used to gather more detailed information like the object 's chemical composition , speed , and direction of motion .
Spectroscopy is used in criminal investigations ; for example , to tell if a chemical found on a suspect 's clothing matches that at a crime scene , and it's how astronomers determine what stars are made of even though there 's no way to take a sample directly , with the stars many trillions of miles away .
Other applications for QWIP arrays are numerous .
At NASA Goddard , some of these applications include : studying troposphere and stratosphere temperatures and identifying trace chemicals ; tree canopy energy balance measurements ; measuring cloud layer emissivities , droplet / particle size , composition and height ; SO2 and aerosol emissions from volcanic eruptions ; tracking dust particles ( from the Sahara Desert , e.g. ) ; CO2 absorption ; coastal erosion ; ocean / river thermal gradients and pollution ; analyzing radiometers and other scientific equipment used in obtaining ground truthing and atmospheric data acquisition ; ground based astronomy ; and temperature sounding .
The potential commercial applications are quite diverse .
The utility of QWIP arrays in medical instrumentation is well documented ( OmniCorder , Inc. in N.Y. ) and may become one of the most significant QWIP technology drivers .
The success of OmniCorder Technologies use of 256 x 256 narrow band QWIP arrays for aiding in the detection of malignant tumors is quite remarkable .
Other potential commercial applications for QWIP arrays include : location of forest fires and residual warm spots ; location of unwanted vegetation encroachment ; monitoring crop health ; monitoring food processing contamination , ripeness , and spoilage ; locating power line transformer failures in remote areas ; monitoring effluents from industrial operations such as paper mills , mining sites , and power plants ; infrared microscopy ; searching for a wide variety of thermal leaks , and locating new sources of spring water .
The QWIP arrays are relatively inexpensive because they can be fabricated using standard semiconductor technology that produces the silicon chips used in computers everywhere .
They can also be made very large , because GaAs can be grown in large ingots , just like silicon .
The development effort was led by the Instrument Systems and Technology Center at NASA Goddard .
The Army Research Laboratory ( ARL ) , Adelphi , Md. , was instrumental in the theory , design , and fabrication of the QWIP array , and L3 / Cincinnati Electronics of Mason , Ohio , provided the silicon readout and hybridization .
This work was conceived for , and funded by , the Earth Science Technology Office as an Advanced Component Technology development project .
CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts –
At an MIT lecture hall on Saturday , a convocation of 50 researchers and investors gathered to discuss a phenomenon that allegedly does not exist .
Despite a backdrop of meager funding and career - killing derision from mainstream scientists and engineers , cold fusion is anything but a dead field of research .
Presenters at the MIT event estimated that 3,000 published studies from scientists around the world have contributed to the growing canon of evidence suggesting that small but promising amounts of energy can be generated using the infamous tabletop apparatus .
How reproducible the experiments might be , however , and how the mysterious phenomenon works are still very much open to interpretation .
Demonstrating recent results of energetic radiation streaming from a running cold - fusion experiment , Lawrence Forsley of JWK Technologies in Annandale , Virginia , passed around samples of his group 's experimental apparatus – all of which could be packed into a shoebox with room to spare .
The compact plastic and rubber tubing illustrate the intrinsic paradox of this field : Compared to the warehouses worth of billion - dollar gadgetry needed to run " hot fusion , " cold fusion research is cheap to fund .
And yet cash is the primary limiting factor holding the research back .
The scarcity of funding – and of young blood – may testify to the discredited nature of the field , but the " greybeards " ( as one presenter jokingly referred to his colleagues ) keep turning up new results .
Scientists at the U.S. Navy 's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center , or SPAWAR , in San Diego performed the work Forsley presented , which was published in June in the German journal Die Naturwissenschaften .
It joins a long list of cold - fusion research papers that many scientists now reflexively write off as junk .
Even some of cold fusion 's top proponents are cautious when talking about the science .
" Should people believe in cold fusion based on the SPAWAR experiments ( alone ) ?
Probably not , " said MIT 's Peter Hagelstein , a co-sponsor of the conference , in an interview .
" But ... that 's not how science works .
In the cold - fusion business , a very large number of experiments done by a large number of laboratories over a large number of years have contributed to a knowledge base .
And ( the SPAWAR ) experiments potentially tell you something about what 's going on inside , if we can get a confirmation that they 're right . "
The cold - fusion story began in March 1989 , when two scientists from the University of Utah reported they had integrated an isotope of hydrogen ( .pdf ) called " deuterium " into a palladium rod and , running electrical currents through it , produced nuclear fusion in a jar .
Several leading researchers around the United States , however , failed to replicate the results and soon pronounced cold fusion debunked , kicking the entire field to the sidelines of mainstream research .
Today 's understanding of nuclear fusion , which involves the synthesis of two hydrogens to make one helium in an energy - creating reaction , does n't allow for the type of reaction reported in 1989 .
The only proven recipe to make helium out of two deuteriums requires re-creating the conditions inside the nearest working fusion reactor : the sun .
Creating stellar temperatures and pressures inside a fusion reactor today requires more energy than the fusion reactions give back .
In striking contrast to the standard CF tabletop equipment , construction of the world 's most promising conventional fusion reactor , the $ 12.1 billion ITER in Cadarache , France , is expected to begin next year .
It will take eight years to complete , and with it scientists hope to see commercial fusion power by 2040 .
MIT 's Peter Hagelstein , on the other hand , said " cold fusion " reactions have yielded surplus energy from as far back as the initial experiments in 1989 .
Verification of these controversial results is not the problem – many labs around the world have reproduced parts of the results many times .
Instead , the damning element has been caprice .
" Excess energy comes in bursts in these experiments , " said Hagelstein .
" The effect has been observed in many other laboratories .
It 's also not been observed in other laboratories , especially in the early days . "
Hagelstein's co-host , physician and electrical engineer Mitchell Swartz , reported his continued refinement of his own cold - fusion experiments , which he publicly displayed in operation over seven days at MIT in 2003 .
" We have been running these ( experiments ) for so long , " Swartz told the audience , " that the question now is not just can we ( generate ) excess heat , it 's can we get a kilowatt ?
Can we get a small car moving on this stuff ? "
Robert Weber , managing director of the Watertown , Massachusetts - based consulting firm Strategy Kinetics , has worked with startup technologies and says cold fusion is in a bind in the United States today .
Researchers need at least $ 50 to $ 100 million in seed money , he said , to fully test its viability and commercial applications , if any .
With research budgets around the world primarily funding " hot fusion " research , the burden falls to angel investors , corporations ( such as Mitsubishi , which has funded cold fusion experiments ) and a few countries ( such as Japan , China , South Korea and Israel ) willing to venture into cold fusion 's murky waters .
" If you look at the long tail of innovation , new technologies from the first disclosure to commercialization , " Weber said , " it can take 20 years .
So we 're getting there . "
Johnanne Winchester , a member of the development committee for the United Nations ' International Year of Planet Earth , said she hopes to appeal to dot - com multi-millionaires and billionaires to help bridge the funding gap .
" I 'm interested in helping ( create ) a renaissance in cold fusion … in rebranding it and getting the word out that it 's alive and well and amazing things are happening , " she said .
The team all agreed that the chicken came after the egg
The experts looked at the evidence in the long - standing debate over which came first - the chicken or the egg - and opted for the egg .
Professor John Brookfield , a genetics expert from Nottingham University , said the first chicken must have started out as an embryo in an egg .
This means the organism in the eggshell would have the same DNA as the chicken .
He explained that the reason was due to the fact that genetic material does not change during an animal 's life .
Professor Brookfield said : " The first living thing which we could say unequivocally was a member of the species would be this first egg , so I would conclude that the egg came first . "
Kangaroo eggs
Professor David Papineau , an expert in the philosophy of science at King 's College , London agreed that the first chicken came from an egg and this proves there were chicken eggs before chickens .
" I would argue it is a chicken egg if it has a chicken in it , " said Prof Papineau .
" If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched , that would surely be an ostrich egg , not a kangaroo egg , " he added .
Charles Bournes , chairman of trade body Great British Chicken , said " Eggs were around long before the first chicken arrived .
" Of course they may not have been chicken eggs as we see them today but they were eggs , " he said .
Professor Brooke added the debate could finally be laid to rest .
He said an Iranian Revolutionary Guard gunboat moved close by and its armed personnel made " very overt gestures " .
The boarding party commander ordered the Australians to re-board the cargo ship .
" He got his boarding party back on to the ship and established a very credible and appropriate defensive position , " Commodore Gilmore told reporters in Canberra .
" ( They ) began what I think is very unique in the Australian way and that 's the capacity to negotiate , to introduce extra weighpoints if you like , in the continuum of force , " he said .
' Tense period '
Another four Iranian military boats carrying rocket - propelled grenade launchers arrived to reinforce their colleagues in the next 45 minutes , Commodore Gilmore said .
" Over a tense period of four hours the boarding party was eventually successfully extracted by helicopter back to the ( HMAS ) Adelaide .
The Australians had originally boarded the MV Sham from two inflatable boats launched from the HMAS Adelaide while a Seahawk helicopter carried out surveillance .
No shots were fired during the encounter .
" We were able to keep that as the case by the very deliberate , well - considered and well - executed negotiation process that the Australian boarding officer undertook .
" The determined approach , the no-nonsense approach of the Australian boarding party , was able to effectively manage that situation . "
The Australians ' handling of the stand - off was today being compared to that of British sailors captured by Iranian forces in March this year during a similar operation and accused of straying into Iranian waters .
The Britons were paraded on Iranian television and eventually released amid a diplomatic storm .
Commodore Gilmore said there were similarities and differences between the two incidents .
" It 's very difficult to predict the ( British ) outcome should have been the same as the Australian outcome because it was n't the same circumstances . "
Commodore Gilmore said the intentions of the Iranians had not been clear .
" It was certainly quite overt and they were attempting to establish what the Australians were doing , there 's no doubt about that . "
Colourful language
A BBC reporter , quoting sources , said the Australian sailors used colourful language to help hold off the Iranians .
Commodore Gilmore said : " As Australians I think we all know our capacity to engage , to defuse by discussion and they indeed did that .
" We might imagine what ( language ) was there - I have n't delved into that .
" The important thing to note is that it worked . "
The commodore , who commanded the joint task maritime task force in the Gulf shortly after the incident , said the Australian sailors had handled themselves superbly .
" Those values that I think were displayed really do highlight what is unique about the Australian soldier - the courage that was shown in demanding circumstance , the loyalty , the teamwork were there throughout . "
Two members of the team were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their conduct during the incident .
Commodore Gilmore said it was not reported at the time because while unique in some ways it was representative of operations in the Gulf at the time .
" From an operation circumstance I do n't believe there was any recognition there was a need to highlight that particular activity . "
AAP , with staff reporter
That bowl of Kellogg 's Cornflakes on the breakfast table , or the portion of pasta or corn tortillas , cheese or meat on the table is going to rise in price over the coming months as sure as the sun rises in the East .
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the new world food price shock , conveniently timed to accompany our current world oil price shock .
Curiously it 's ominously similar in many respects to the early 1970's when prices for oil and food both exploded by several hundred percent in a matter of months .
That mid-1970 's price explosion led President Nixon to ask his old pal , Arthur Burns , then Chairman of the Fed , to find a way to alter the CPI inflation data to take attention away from the rising prices .
The result then was the now - commonplace publication of the absurd " core inflation " CPI numbers -- sans oil and food .
Stephen Roche was the young Fed economist who was assigned the statistical manipulation job by Burns .
The late American satirist , Mark Twain once quipped , " Buy land : They 've stopped making it " Today we can say almost the same about corn or all grains worldwide .
The world is in the early months of the greatest sustained rise in grain prices , for all major grains including maize , wheat , rice that we have seen in three decades .
Those three crops constitute almost 90 per cent of all grains cultivated in the world .
What 's driving this extraordinary change ?
Here things get pretty interesting .
The Bush Administration is making a major public relations push to convince the world it has turned into a " better steward of the environment . "
The problem is that many have fallen for the hype .
The center of his program , announced in his January State of the Union Address is called ' 20 in 10 ' , cutting US gasoline use 20 per cent by 2010 .
The official reason is to " reduce dependency on imported oil , " as well as cutting unwanted " greenhouse gas " emissions .
That is n't the case , but it makes good PR .
Repeat it often enough and maybe most people will believe it .
Maybe they wo n't realize their taxpayer subsidies to grow ethanol corn instead of feed corn are also driving the price of their daily bread through the roof .
The heart of the plan is a huge , taxpayer subsidized expansion of use of bio-ethanol for transport fuel .
The President 's plan requires production of 35 billion gallons ( about 133 billion liters ) of ethanol a year by 2017 .
Congress already mandated with the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 that corn ethanol for fuel must rise from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 7.5 billion in 2012 .
To make certain it will happen , farmers and big agribusiness giants like ADM or David Rockefeller get generous taxpayer subsidies to grow corn for fuel instead of food .
Currently ethanol producers get a subsidy in the US of 51 cents per gallon ethanol paid to the blender , usually an oil company that blends it with gasoline for sale .
As a result of the beautiful US Government subsidies to produce bio- ethanol fuels , and the new legislative mandate , the US refinery industry is investing big time in building new special ethanol distilleries , similar to oil refineries , except they produce ethanol fuel .
The number currently under construction exceeds the total number of oil refineries built in the US over the past 25 years .
When finished in the next 2 - 3 years the demand for corn and other grain to make ethanol for car fuel will double from present levels .
Not just USA bio-ethanol .
In March Bush met with Brazil 's President to sign a bilateral " Ethanol Pact " to cooperate in R&D of " next generation " bio - fuel technologies like cellulosic ethanol from wood , and joint cooperation in " stimulating " expansion of bio-fuels ' use in developing countries , especially in Central America , and creating a " bio-fuels OPEC - like " cartel market with rules that allows formation of a Western Hemisphere ethanol market .
In short , the use of farmland worldwide for bio-ethanol and other bio- fuels_burning the food product rather than using it for human or animal food_is being treated in Washington , Brazil and other major centers , including the EU , as a major new growth industry .
Phony green arguments
Bio -fuel -- gasoline or fuel produced from refining food products -- is being hyped as a solution to the controversial Global Warming problem .
Leaving aside the faked science and the political interests behind the sudden hype about dangers of global warming , bio - fuels offer no net positive benefits over oil even under best conditions .
Its advocates claim that present first generation bio-fuels " save up to 60 per cent of carbon emission . "
As well , amid rising oil prices at $ 75 per barrel for Brent marker grades , governments such as Brazil 's are frantic to substitute homegrown bio-fuels for imported gasoline .
In Brazil today 70 per cent of all cars have " flexi - fuel " engines able to switch from conventional gasoline to 100 per cent bio - fuel or any mix .
Bio - fuel production has become one of Brazil 's major export industries as well .
The green claims for bio - fuel as a friendly and better fuel than gasoline are at best dubious , if not outright fraudulent .
Depending on who runs the tests , ethanol has little if any effect on exhaust - pipe emissions in current car models .
It has significant emission , however , of some toxins including formaldehyde and acetaldehyde , a suspected neurotoxin which has been banned as carcinogenic in California .
Ethanol is not some benign substance as we are led to think from the industry propaganda .
It is highly corrosive to pipelines as well as to seals and fuel systems of existing car or other gasoline engines .
It requires special new gas pumps .
All that conversion costs money .
But the killer - diller about ethanol is that it holds at least 30 per cent less energy per gallon than normal gasoline , translating into a loss in fuel economy per gallon of at least 25 per cent over gasoline for an Ethanol E - 85 per cent blend .
No advocate of the ethanol boondoggle addresses the huge social cost which is beginning to hit the dining room tables across the US , Europe and the rest of the world .
Food prices are exploding as corn , soybeans and all cereal grain prices are going through the roof because of the astronomical -- Congress - driven -- demand for corn to burn for bio -fuel .
This year the Massachusetts Institute of Technology issued a report concluding that using corn - based ethanol instead of gasoline will have no impact on greenhouse gas emissions , and would even expand fossil fuel use due to increased demand for fertilizer and irrigation to expand acreage of ethanol crops .
And according to MIT " natural gas consumption is 66 per cent of total corn ethanol production energy , " meaning huge new strains on natural gas supply , pushing prices there higher .
The idea that the world can " grow " out of oil dependency with bio- fuels is the PR hype being used to sell what is shaping up to be the mist dangerous threat to the planet 's food supply since creation of patented genetically manipulated corn and crops .
US farms become bio - fuel factories
The main reason US and world grain prices are soaring in the past two years and now pre-programmed to continue rising at a major pace , is the conversion of US farmland to become de facto bio - fuel factories .
In 2006 US farmland devoted to bio - fuel crops increased by 48 per cent .
None of that land was replaced for food crop cultivation .
The tax subsidies make it far too profitable to produce ethanol fuel .
Since 2001 the amount of maize used to produce bio-ethanol in the USA has risen 300 per cent , with the trend increasingly going forward .
In fact , in 2006 US maize or corn crops for bio - fuel equaled the tonnage of corn used for export .
In 2007 it is estimated it will exceed the corn for export by a hefty amount .
The US is the world 's leading corn exporter , most going for animal feed to EU and other countries .
The traditional USDA statistics on acreage planted to corn is no longer a useful metric of food prices as all marginal acreage is going for bio - fuel growing .
The amount available for animal and human feed is actually declining .
Brazil and China are similarly switching from food to bio-fuels with large swatches of land .
A result of the bio - fuel revolution in agriculture is that world carryover or reserve stocks of grains have been plunging for six of the past seven years .
Carryover reserve stocks of all grains fell at the end of 2006 to 57 days of consumption , the lowest level since 1972 .
Little wonder that world grain prices rose 100 per cent over the past 12 months .
This is just the start .
That decline in grain reserves , the measure of food security in event of drought or harvest failure -- an increasingly common event in recent years -- is pre-programmed to continue going as far ahead as the eye can see .
Assuming modest world population increase annually of some 70 million people over the coming decade , especially in the Indian subcontinent and Africa , the stagnation or even decline in the tonnages of feed corn or other feed grains including rice that is harvested annually as growing amounts of bio-ethanol and other bio-fuels displaces food grain , in fact means we are just getting started on the greatest transformation of global agriculture since the introduction of the agribusiness revolution with fertilizers and mechanized farming after World War II .
The difference is that this revolution is at the expense of food production .
That preprograms exploding global grain prices , increased poverty and malnutrition .
And the effect on gasoline import demand will be minimal .
Prof. M.A. Altieri of Berkeley University estimates that dedicating all USA corn and soybean production acreage to bio-fuels would only meet 12 per cent of gasoline and 6 per cent of diesel needs .
He notes that though one - fifth of last year 's corn harvest went to bio-ethanol , it met a mere 3 per cent of energy needs .
But the farmland is converting at a record pace .
In 2006 more than 50 per cent of Iowa and South Dakota corn went to ethanol refineries .
Farmers across the Midwest , desperate for more income after years of depressed corn prices , are abandoning traditional crop rotation to grow exclusively soybeans or corn with dramatic added impact on soil erosion and needs for added chemical pesticides .
In the US some 41 per cent of all herbicides used are already applied to corn .
Monsanto and other makers of glyphosate herbicides like Roundup are smiling on the way to the bank .
Going global with bio- fuels
The Bush - Lula pact is just the start of a growing global rush to plant crops for bio -fuel .
Huge sugarcane , palm oil and soy plantations for bio - fuel refining are taking over forests and grasslands in Brazil , Argentina , Colombia , Ecuador and Paraguay .
Soy cultivation has already caused the deforestation of 21 million hectares in Brazil and 14 million hectares in Argentina , with no end in sight , as world grain prices continue to rise .
Soya is used for bio- diesel fuel .
China , desperate for energy sources , is a major player in bio - fuel cultivation , reducing food crop acreage there as well .
In the EU most bio - diesel fuel is produced using rapeseed plants , a popular animal feed .
The result ?
Meat prices around the globe are rising and set to continue rising as far ahead as the eye can see .
The EU has a target requiring minimum bio - fuel content of 10 per cent , a foolish demand that will set aside 18 per cent of EU farmland to cultivate crops to be burned as bio-fuel .
Big oil is also driving the bio-fuels bandwagon .
Prof. David Pimentel of Cornell University and other scientists claim that net energy output from bio-ethanol fuel is less than the fossil fuel energy used to produce the ethanol .
Measuring all energy inputs to produce ethanol from production of nitrogen fertilizer to energy needed to clean the considerable waste from bio - fuel refineries , Pimintel 's research showed a net energy loss of 22 per cent for bio - fuel -- they use more energy than they produce .
That translates into little threat to oil demand and huge profit for clever oil giants that re-profile themselves as " green energy " producers .
So it 's little wonder that ExxonMobil , Chevron and BP are all into bio-fuels .
This past May , BP announced the largest ever R&D grant to a university , $ 500 million to the University of California - Berkeley to fund BP - dictated R&D into alternative energy including bio-fuels .
Stanford 's Global Climate and Energy Program got $ 100 million from ExxonMobil ; University of California - Davis got $ 25 million from Chevron for its Bio-energy Research Group .
Princeton University 's Carbon Mitigation Initiative takes $ 15 million from BP .
Lord Browne , the disgraced former CEO of BP declared in 2006 , " The world needs new technologies to maintain adequate supplies of energy for the future .
We believe bioscience can bring immense benefits to the energy sector . "
The bio - fuel market is booming like few others today .
This all is a paradise for global agribusiness industrial companies like Cargill , ADM and Monsanto , Syngenta .
All this , combined with severe weather problems in China , Australia , Ukraine and large parts of the EU growing areas this harvest season , guarantee that grain prices are set to explode further in coming months and years .
Some are gleefully reporting the end of the era of " cheap food . "
With disappearing food security reserves and disappearing acreage going to plant corn and grains for food , the bio- fuel transformation will impact global food prices massively in coming years .
Another agenda behind Ethanol ?
Uh Huh .
The dramatic embrace of bio-fuels by the Bush Administration since 2005 has clearly been the global driver for soaring grain and food prices in the past 18 months .
The evidence suggests this is no accident of sloppy legislative preparation .
The US Government has been researching and developing bio-fuels since the 1970's .
The bio-ethanol architects did their homework we can be assured .
It 's increasingly clear that the same people who brought us oil price inflation are now deliberately creating parallel food price inflation .
We have had a rise in average oil prices of some 300 per cent since the end of 2000 when George W. Bush and Dick Halliburton Cheney made oil the central preoccupation of US foreign policy .
Last year , as bio-ethanol production first became a major market factor , corn prices rose by some 130 per cent on the Chicago commodities in 14 months .
It was more than known when Congress and the Bush Administration made their heavy push for bio-ethanol in 2005 that world grain reserves had been declining at alarming levels for several years at a time when global demand , driven especially by growing wealth And increasing meat consumption in China , was rising .
As a result of the diversion of record acreages of US and Brazilian corn and soybeans to bio - fuel production , food reserves are disappearing .
Global food security , according to FAO data , is at its lowest since 1972 .
Curiously that was just the time that Henry Kissinger and the Nixon Administration engineered , in cahoots with Cargill and ADM _ the major backers of the ethanol scam today_what was called The Great Grain Robbery , sale of huge volumes of US grain to the Soviet Union in exchange for sales of record volumes of Russian oil to the West .
Both oil and corn prices rose by 1975 some 300 - 400 per cent as a result .
Just how that worked , I treated in detail in : A Century of War : Anglo - American Oil Politics .
Today a new element has replaced USSR grain demand and harvest shortfalls .
Bio - fuel demand , fed by US government subsidies is literally linking food prices to oil prices .
The scale of the subsidized bio - fuel consumption has exploded so dramatically since the beginning of 2006 when the US Energy Policy
Act of 2005 first began to impact crop planting decisions , not only in the USA , that there is emerging a de facto competition between people and cars for the same grains .
Lester Brown recently noted , " We 're looking at competition in the global market between 800 million automobiles and the world 's two billion poorest people for the same commodity , the same grains .
We are now in a new economic era where oil and food are interchangeable commodities because we can convert grain , sugar cane , soybeans_anything _into fuel for cars .
In effect the price of oil is beginning to set the price of food . "
In the mid-1970 's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , a protégé of the Rockefeller family and of its institutions stated , " Control the oil and you control entire nations ; control the food and you control the people . "
The same cast of characters who brought the world the Iraq war , the global scramble to control oil , who brought us patented genetically manipulated seeds and now Terminator suicide seeds , and who cry about the " problem of world over - population , " are now backing conversion of global grain production to burn as fuel at a time of declining global grain reserves .
That alone should give pause for thought .
As the popular saying goes , " Just because you 're paranoid does n't mean they are n't out to get you . "

The Cassini spacecraft has moved into a new orbit around Saturn , soaring to ever higher latitudes and greater distances from the planet .
The result is that the craft has been able to capture some truly unusual new pictures of the ringed planet .
" Finally , here are the views that we 've waited years for , " said Dr Carolyn Porco , Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute .
" Sailing high above Saturn and seeing the rings spread out beneath us like a giant , copper medallion is like exploring an alien world we 've never seen before .
It just does n't look like the same place .
It 's so utterly breath - taking it almost gives you vertigo . "
In the picture shown above , the planet was deliberately overexposed , and later cut from the picture altogether .
This meant the details of the rings could be caught in all their glory , with the missing planet casting its shadow across them .
The image is made of 27 separate exposures - nine each in red , blue and green - that were snapped over a 45 minute period .
Because of the gaps between the exposures , clumps of material in some of the rings had moved in between shots .
Cassini scientists say this adds to a sense of movement in the image .
Over the next few months , Cassini 's incline will be gradually lowered so that by June it will be orbiting in line with the plane of the rings once again . ®

The world changing technology / art project / prank known as Orbo has taken a rain check .
The demonstration of the magnetic free energy machine was due to start a couple days ago , but various delays caused by " hot lights " meant that nobody has seen either the exhibit or the live , streaming video feeds .
Steorn , the people behind Orbo , have packed up and gone back home to Ireland .
From the press release :
Attempts to replace those parts affected by the heat led to further failures and as a result we have to postpone the public demonstration until a future date .
We apologise for the inconvenience caused to all the people who had made arrangements to visit the demonstration or were planning on viewing the demonstration online .
Some of our fine readers took me to task for being too cynical in our previous coverage .
Not cynical , just skeptical .
And this latest incident does n't add to my confidence .

" Blender 2.44 was intended to be an upgrade release , mainly for plenty of bug fixes , but the developers took the effort of adding at least a few interesting new features . "
Now there 's an understatement .
They 've done it again !
Let 's get right to the details :
This version now is fully 64 - bits compatible , new modifers were added , a couple of composite nodes were added , and a revamp of the old mesh primitives was done .
But most relevant to mention is Blender 2.44 's new long - awaited but unexpected feature : subsurface scattering ( SSS ) support !
FFMPEG is now included in the Windows builds
Sculpt and MultiRes bug fixes and improvements
Subsurface Scattering is a new material option
There have been a large number of python script additions and updates , as well as API improvements
Two new Composite nodes have been added : Gamma and Bright / Contrast
Two new Modifiers : Smooth and Cast
The Action and NLA editors have now better control over visible channels .
A new constraint was added , and a " preview range " option was added .
Blender now is 64 - bits safe again .
That safety is on two different levels .
The Bullet physics engine has had some changes which should give better reproducibility and precision / quality for physics simulations .
The mesh primitives have been revisited , improving their usability and pushing them a little beyond their previous state .
This includes the addition of a new Torus primitive !
3D Window Animated view option ( User preset ) allows interpolation of view changes , set the " Smooth View " milliseconds above zero to enable .
Fly Mode : Holding
Shift decreases mouse wheel and panning influence to a 10th .
Fly mode now respects the objects location axis locking , so you can fly over land and look down without flying into it .
Snapping : Editmode snapping now works to snap to vertices in another selected object as well .
Hide and Unhide can be done in Object Mode by pressing H to hide , Alt + H to unhide and Shift + H to hide unselected .
This was only accessible in the outliner for version 2.43 .
Hook menu ( Object Mode ) to recenter or center cursor for all hooks used by a mesh , This is the same as accessing from the modifier panel but useful when making adjustments with menu hooks .
SubSurf can be enable / disable in linked Library data .
The subsurf setting will not be saved but changing the setting is useful for previews .
Transform properties panel now shows Parent bone ( Object to Bone ) User Interface Running Blender in debug mode now prints the subversion of . blend files .
" File " menu : Option " Load Factory Settings " added .
This shows the original .

Looking to get a jump on the lucrative back - to - school shopping season , Wal - Mart has begun selling a sub - $ 300 PC .
The Everex IMPACT GC3502 comes with Windows Vista Home Basic and OpenOffice.org 2.2 installed on a system that includes a 1.5GHz VIA C7 CPU , 1GB of DDR - 2 SDRAM , an 80 GB hard drive , a DVD burner , and integrated graphics , as well as a keyboard , mouse , and speakers .
The Everex machine will be competing for Wal - Mart shelf space with the low - cost Dells recently introduced to the world of brick - and - mortar sales .
The retail giant currently sells the Dell Dimension E521 for $ 498 alone or bundled with a 19 " LCD monitor and slightly faster Athlon 64 X2 CPU for $ 200 more .
Cost aside , the two centerpieces of the Everex offering are the inclusion of OpenOffice.org 2.2 and the absence of crapware typically bundled with low - cost PCs .
Including OO.org instead of Microsoft Office or even Microsoft Works allowed the PC manufacturer to shave a few additional dollars off of the PC 's price , and according to OO.org marketing project lead John McCreesh , the open - source office suite passed all of Everex 's tests " with flying colors . "
Users accustomed to being bombarded with trialware offers and seeing their would - be pristine Windows desktops littered with shortcuts to AOL and other applications will likely be pleased at their absence from the GC3502 .
" In creating the eco-friendly GC3602 , our main focus was to build a no - compromise , back - to - school PC with all the software applications a typical student would require , without resorting to bundling frivolous trial versions or increasing prices 30 percent , " said Everex product manager Eugene Chang .
While the price may be right for budget - conscious shoppers , the replacement of familiar brands like Intel , AMD , and Microsoft with VIA and OpenOffice.org may give some would - be buyers pause .
And as the price and specs indicate , the machine is going to find itself on the very low end of the performance spectrum .
That said , for basic word processing , e-mailing , listening to music , watching video , and web surfing , the machine should be adequate , and Windows Vista Home Basic does n't have the graphical overhead of the other versions .
Paper : How Rove directed federal assets for GOP gains RAW STORY
Published : Sunday August 19 , 2007
Print This Email This Sunday 's Washington Post reports on how presidential adviser Karl Rove directed federal assets for GOP gains , calling his efforts " unprecedented in its reach . "
" Thirteen months before President Bush was reelected , chief strategist Karl Rove summoned political appointees from around the government to the Old Executive Office Building , " John Solomon , Alec MacGillis and Sarah Cohen write for the paper .
" The subject of the Oct. 1 , 2003 , meeting was ' asset deployment , ' and the message was clear :
The staging of official announcements , high - visibility trips and declarations of federal grants had to be carefully coordinated with the White House political affairs office to ensure the maximum promotion of Bush 's reelection agenda and the Republicans in Congress who supported him , according to documents and some of those involved in the effort . "
An internal email about the " previously undisclosed Rove ' deployment ' team " stated , " The White House determines which members need visits and where we need to be strategically placing our assets . "
The ' asset deployment team ' " comprised the chief White House liaison official at each Cabinet agency , " and its " team members met -- sometimes as often as once a month -- to coordinate the travel of Cabinet secretaries and senior agency officials , the announcement of grant money , and personnel and policy decisions .
Occasionally , the attendees got updates on election strategies , " according to the paper .
Excerpts from article : # Many administrations have sought to maximize their control of the machinery of government for political gain , dispatching Cabinet secretaries bearing government largess to battleground states in the days before elections .
The Clinton White House routinely rewarded big donors with stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and private coffees with senior federal officials , and held some political briefings for top Cabinet officials during the 1996 election .
But Rove , who announced last week that he is resigning from the White House at the end of August , pursued the goal far more systematically than his predecessors , according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Post , enlisting political appointees at every level of government in a permanent campaign that was an integral part of his strategy to establish Republican electoral dominance .
Under Rove 's direction , this highly coordinated effort to leverage the government for political marketing started as soon as Bush took office in 2001 and continued through last year 's congressional elections , when it played out in its most quintessential form in the coastal Connecticut district of Rep. Christopher Shays , an endangered Republican incumbent .
Seven times , senior administration officials visited Shays 's district in the six months before the election -- once for an announcement as minor as a single $ 23 government weather alert radio presented to an elementary school .
On Election Day , Shays was the only Republican House member in New England to survive the Democratic victory .
" He did n't do these things half - baked .
It was total commitment , " said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III ( Va. ) , who in 2002 ran the House Republicans ' successful reelection campaign in close coordination with Rove .
" We knew history was against us , and he helped coordinate all of the accoutrements of the executive branch to help with the campaign , within the legal limits . "

A Rabbit is not to be wasted on the tentative or weak .
Only the worthy are invited , and then only at your own risk .
If you have even a modicum of hesitation , DO NOT buy one of these cars .
Instead , leave it for a worthy soul who has already matriculated to the sublime ecstasy of what those in the know refer to as a " MK1 "
During a conference call with investors and analysts , Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that despite all of the interest expressed by users , Google has no plans to develop its own web browser .
Instead , the company will continue to pursue deals with computer manufacturers and software companies , much like the recently announced deal with Dell .
" The industry is obsessed with this browser question ...
It looks like people have some good browsers choices already , " Schmidt said .
Schmidt reportedly extolled the goodness of Firefox and Opera , among others , but Internet Explorer was not mentioned .
" The way Google operates , we would not build a browser for the fun of building a browser and creating another choice ...
We would only do something along the lines you 're describing if there was a real end - user benefit .
So far , we 've seen the end - user benefit has been to augment or expand both AJAX and JavaScript , which is available on all the browsers .
We 're working closely with Firefox , we have a good partnership with Safari and with Opera and a couple of others as well .
That seems like a good answer for us right now , strategically , " Schmidt added .
While Schmidt 's statements are clear , there 's little reason to suspect that the death of Google Browser rumors is imminent .
The famed Gbrowser rumor has a life of its own , and in some circles this denial will only spur further speculation .
But alas , those who are waiting for the grand revelation of Google 's own browser , OS , and cure for world hunger will have to wait .
Nevertheless ,
Google spreads its love around , supporting Firefox and working deals with Opera .
They also have inked a pact with Apple for Safari .
For the time being , search deals are Google 's focus , and we expect the company to continue favoring Firefox in its own projects ( such as Google Pack ) .
Shocking as it may be , we agree with Schmidt : there 's plenty of good browsers out there already .

Filmmaker Michael Moore appeared on MSNBC's Countdown to talk about the need in the United States for a universal health care system .
" Do you realize that nobody in Canada , or Britain , or France , or any of the other twenty - four top twenty - five industrialized countries , nobody ever goes bankrupt because of medical bills ? " asked Moore .
" Nobody ever loses their home .
No one is ever denied because of a preexisting condition ...
We 've got something very wrong , and very immoral , about our system and I 'm hoping that it 's going to change . "
Host Keith Olbermann asked how change could happen politically if Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) is the only presidential candidate who is for a " non-profit , single payer system . "
" It 's only going to happen when the people demand it , " replied Moore .
Turning to the war in Iraq , Moore was asked if he had a response to President Bush 's contention that the " surge " is at least partially working .
" The entire nation is totally befuddled by [ Bush ] , " said Moore .
" Republicans , and Democrats , and Independents all together are sick and tired of the job he 's doing and they want this war to end .
And I 'm hoping the Democratic Congress hears that message ...
I really hope that the Democrats can find their spine . "
Like health care , Moore said that the people can force the Democrats to act .
" The only way they 're going to understand it , is if people write their members of Congress , call them , go and visit their local offices , make your voices heard . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on July 12 .
What is a PAL ?
A PAL–a " Permissive Action Link " –is the box that is supposed to prevent unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon .
" Unauthorized " covers a wide range of sin , from terrorists who have stolen bombs to insane American military officers to our allies who may have some of their own uses for bombs that are covered by joint use agreements .
It 's supposed to be impossible to " hot - wire " a nuclear weapon .
Is it ?
There is little in the public record that discusses just how Permissive Action Links ( PALs ) work .
This is n't surprising , of course ; remarkably little has been published about most technical details of nuclear weapons design .
Even so , much more has been published about the so - called " physics package " than about the control aspects .
This may be because something that goes bang is sexier , of course .
But it may also be because fission and fusion are natural processes that can be studied in the abstract .
Someone can reinvent the atom bomb ( as , indeed , many have done ) .
A PAL is an engineering artifice , with many possible design choices .
Furthermore , the design of a PAL is based on cryptography , and cryptography has always had the aura of the forbidden .
My Motivation
History
I used to worry about General Power .
I used to worry that General Power was not stable .
I used to worry about the fact that he had control over so many weapons and weapon systems and could , under certain conditions , launch the force .
Back in the days before we had real positive control [ i.e. , PAL locks ] , SAC had the power to do a lot of things , and it was in his hands , and he knew it [ R95 ] .
The exact details are hazy , but the broad contours are clear : the inspection team found the control of the forward - based nuclear weapons inadequate and possibly illegal .
In Germany and Turkey they viewed scenes that were particularly distressing .
On the runway stood a German ( or Turkish ) quick - reaction alert airplane ( QRA ) loaded with nuclear weapons and with a foreign pilot in the cockpit .
The QRA airplane was ready to take off at the earliest warning , and the nuclear weapons were fully operational .
The only evidence of U.S. control was a lonely 18 - year - old sentry armed with a carbine and standing on the tarmac .
When the sentry at the German airfield was asked how he intended to maintain control of the nuclear weapons should the pilot suddenly decide to scramble ( either through personal caprice or through an order from the German command circumventing U.S. command ) , the sentry replied that he would shoot the pilot ;
Agnew directed him to shoot the bomb .
France 's history has not been characterized by the same orderliness of political succession and civil - military relations as Great Britain's .
Indeed , there have even been moments of instability in the nuclear age .
During the revolt of the generals against De Gaulle in 1960 , for example , the government ordered the detonation of a nuclear device in Algeria so that it would not fall into the hands of the military .
I 've occasionally been asked why I compiled this page .
It stemmed from my interest in the history of cryptography ( see Prehistory of Public Key Cryptography for details ) , and for the implications of PAL design for tamper - resistant devices in general .
I claim no expertise in nuclear weapons design .
PALs evolved from the need to exert greater negative control over nuclear weapons .
Contrary to popular belief , the original motivation was not to guard against unauthorized actions by rogue American military officers .
To be sure , this was not a negligible threat .
More than one Strategic Air Command head was interested in starting World War III ; one was later described this way by another general who reported to him :
A more pressing concern was foreign access .
Under the auspices of NATO , assorted nuclear weapons were at least partially controlled by other nations .
This was worrisome , especially to Congress , and in violation of U.S. law .
Worse yet , some of our allies were seen as potentially unstable [ SF87 ] ; there was considerable fear that the military in one of these countries might override even their own civilian leadership .
Stein and Feaver cite France as one possible example , and possibly Germany and Turkey : After this incident , Harold Agnew came up with the idea of the PAL [ A05 ] .
In a discussion of the French need for PALs on their own weapons , Stein and Feaver say this :
For these reasons , I suspect that the " sanitized " Alternative I of NSAM 160 almost certainly calls for PAL protection only for weapons in a few specific countries , and may even cite them by name .
( Another point here is that weapons that might be captured by an enemy need more protection .
It would n't be politic to disclose that the U.S. expected certain countries to be overrun early in a war–though of course that is to some extent obvious , especially for parts of Germany . )
The U.S. military resisted PALs for a long time .
Eventually , they were persuaded because of the greater freedom it gave them : in times of tension , they could disperse nuclear weapons to block easy destruction or capture , while still retaining control over their use .
Despite that , they did n't deploy PALs that quickly .
In 1974 , when an armed quarrel broke out between two members of NATO ( presumably Greece and Turkey , though the reference does n't say ) , the Secretary of Defense learned that many tactical nukes were not equipped with PALS [ R04 ] .
Worse yet , he learned that some military commanders of these nations wanted those nukes ....
It took two more years before PALs were completely deployed .
Even then , the Pentagon dithered ; at ICBM silos within the U.S. , the " secret unlock code " was set to 00000000 .
On the other hand , some PALs were deployed by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis [ GS94 ] , though the deployments did not yet include the Jupiter missiles in Turkey .
This fact was of some concern at the time ; under President Kennedy 's orders , the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the U.S. commander in Turkey to destroy the missiles –which , unlike their nuclear warheads , were under Turkish control–rather than let them be launched without his explicit permission .
( This might suggest that Alternative I–presumably the highest - priority deployment –specified Germany and / or France . )
PALs are supplemented by " coded switch systems " .
These are devices that prevent the release or launch of an armed nuclear weapon .
For example , when B - 1 bombers are on alert , the PALs in their weapons are unlocked before takeoff .
But the crew can't use those weapons until they receive an authorization code .
( In some planes , the crew can communicate with the PALs from the cockpit .
This feature was omitted in the B - 1 , apparently as a cost - saving measure . )
Given this , it is not surprising that Navy weapons are not protected by PALs .
In their normal environment , there is relatively little risk of capture , no foreign nationals have custody , and communications with ( especially ) submarines is somewhat problematic .
Only when the weapons are brought ashore is a PAL activated , and then only for things like nuclear depth charges [ B93 , SF87 ] .
In place of PALs , an elaborate set of procedures , involving the PA system , several different keys , and the participation of most of the crew is necessary for a nuclear submarine to launch its missiles [ C87c ] .
All that notwithstanding , a use control system , apparently similar to the coded switch systems , has recently been added to the submarine fleet .
For that matter , by the early 1970s the insider threat was realized ; this was the motivation for the installation of use control systems on the bombers and on the strategic missiles by 1976 / 7 [ B04 ] .
Several different mechanisms are used to prevent accidental detonation .
First , there is the " strong link / weak link " principle .
Critical elements of the detonator system are deliberately " weak " , in that they will irreversibly fail if exposed to certain kinds of abnormal environments .
A commonly - used example is a capacitor whose components will melt at reasonably low temperatures .
The " strong " link provides electrical isolation of the detonation system ; it only responds to very particular inputs .
Naturally , this entire subsystem is physically packaged in such a way as to shield critical parts of the weapon from any unwanted electrical energy .
A very detailed description of strong and weak links can be found in [ PG98 ] .
Bombs are also engineered to fail gracefully .
For example , the high - explosive shell is closely matched to the characteristics of the fissile materials in the pit ; if anything but the exact proper detonation occurs , there should be no nuclear reaction .
The design goal for the safety mechanisms is a probability of less than 10 - 6 that an accidental detonation at one point in the explosives surrounding the core can cause a detonation equivalent to more than four pounds of TNT , and the probability of an accidental nuclear detonation due to component malfunction be less than 10 - 9 for normal conditions , and 10 - 6 for abnormal conditions [ H90a ] [ H90 b ] [ D93 ] .
Advances in computers have permitted the use of three - dimensional models of bomb components .
These have shown that earlier two - dimensional models were dangerously misleading .
Apparently , the danger was greater than had been appreciated that an accidental explosion could cause dispersal of radioactive materials or even a nuclear yield [ H90a ] [ H90 b ] [ D93 ] .
Coupling between at least some different stages of the detonation system is by means of a moderately complex digital signal , and not a simple contact closure [ C87c ] .
Again , the intent is to prevent accidents .
It is possible that PALs function by decrypting this signal , though that by itself would not achieve the no-bypass design goal .
Bombs are also protected against accidental ( and some unauthorized ) detonations by " Environmental Sensing Devices " ( ESDs ) [ SF87 ] .
ESDs detect the normal physical environment expected for that weapon .
For example , a nuclear warhead in a missile would experience high acceleration , a period of free fall , and then some deceleration .
Its ESD is designed to detect those conditions ; the warhead is not armed until they occur .
Someone who stole the warhead could not detonate it unless the launch system was stolen as well .
Of course , in some situations that is a risk , too .
In at least one incident , a nuclear weapon did come very close to accidental detonation .
In 1961 , a B - 52 with two large warheads crashed near Goldsboro , North Carolina ; the impact set off the conventional explosives in one of the bombs , and triggered all but one of the safety mechanisms in the other [ C87 b ] .
PALs are powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators [ A94 ] .
An RTG provides for very long lifetime with little maintenance required .
They work by alpha decay of plutonium - 238 , a non-fissile isotope .
The limiting factor on the lifetime of an RTG is helium buildup .
Types of PALs
Combination lock
The earliest control mechanism was a three - digit combination lock .
Later versions were four - digit locks designed to accommodate split - knowledge , where two different individuals could each have half the key .
The combination lock can do different things .
Some block the volume into which firing components must be inserted , others block electrical circuits , while still others prevent access to the fuzing and arming mechanisms .
These locks were in use at least as recently as 1987 .
In 1981 -- almost 20 years after PALs were invented –about half of the U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe were still protected by mechanical locks [ SF87 ] .
CAT A CAT A PALs , intended for use on missiles , were electromechanical switches .
The arming input was a 4 - digit decimal number .
( Some sources say it was a 5 - digit number . )
Crews used a portable electronic device that plugged into the weapon to arm it .
CAT B
The CAT B PAL , used on bombs , was similar in spirit to the CAT A , but used fewer wires .
This permitted remote control of the PAL from an airplane cockpit .
With the CAT B , it is also possible to check the code , relock the weapon , or rekey it .
Later models of the CAT B included a limited - try feature , rekeying , and a code - controlled lock .
CAT C The CAT C PAL accepts 6 - digit keys .
A limited - try feature disables the bomb if too many incorrect keys are entered .
Most references omit the CAT C .
It may just be a later model of the CAT B. CAT D The CAT D PAL accepts 6 - digit keys .
A given PAL can accept a number of different keys , permitting different groups of weapons to be unlocked with one transmission .
Some keys are used for training ; others are used to disarm the weapon or to disable it .
One source [ CAH84 ] suggests that PAL codes can also be used to vary the yield on some weapons .
There are a number of selectable mechanisms to disable the bomb .
In addition , there are " violent or nonviolent methods for destroying the warhead or making it irreparably nonfunctional " [ C87c ] .
( One report , which I have not yet seen confirmed in the literature , is that the violent option involves a shaped charge which destroys the symmetry of the pit .
It is thus no longer able to fission until it has been remachined -- and machining plutonium is non-trivial . )
One reference suggests that there is a remote disable option on some PALs .
CAT F
The CAT F PAL appears to be similar to the CAT D , but it accepts a 12 - digit key .
There have been a number of different types of PALs used over the years .
The 1984 price for a CAT D PAL was $ 50,000 [ CAH84 ]
I have n't yet found anything about setting C.R.M. - 114 discriminators to " FGD 135 " , let alone " OPE " ...
Cryptography and PALs
Given all this , what cryptographic mechanisms are used for PALs ?
I have not been able to find any public material on the subject .
It is known that PALs work on cryptographic principles .
A common supposition is that the arm code is in fact a key that is used to decrypt some of the timing data .
Phil Karn made the following suggestion :
Precise timing –that 's the key to my idea for a highly effective PAL .
First , design the weapon to make the firing sequence as inherently complex and critical as possible .
Vary the chemical composition and detonation velocities of the various pieces of high explosive so they have to be detonated non-simultaneously .
Then store all of the required timing data in encrypted form in the weapon 's memory .
Better yet , encrypt everything ( program and data ) except for a small bootstrap that accepts an external key and decrypts everything for firing .
Include this decryption key in the " nuclear weapons release " message from the " National Command Authority " ( I 've always loved that military terminology ! )
I 've suggested similar ideas in the past , including the use of somewhat different shapes for each piece of the lens .
That way , each individual detonator must fire at a different time .
It is n't clear that that works .
Apart from the possible ease of determining the types of the different explosives , the goal of the implosion is as near - perfect a spherical shock wave as possible .
Traditionally , this has been done by covering the sphere of explosives with equally - spaced detonators and triggering them simultaneously .
There would not appear to be much room for variation , especially since the tolerance is only about 100 nanoseconds .
A timing - based PAL is much more logical if a non-spherical explosive shell is used .
If some of the explosives were thicker , they would have to be fired slightly sooner .
This may be desirable even with a spherical arrangement , to achieve higher yield .
It is mathematically impossible to have both detonators that are exactly equally spaced and an adequate number of them .
Timing variation may compensate for that .
Similarly , an asymmetric fissile core would require non-simultaneous detonations .
Such a variant is not at all inconceivable .
Hansen [ H88 ] reports early experiments with such things .
Furthermore , at least one model of a nuclear artillery shell imploded a cylindrical core .
( The motivation for such shapes is the geometry plus size constraints on the warhead .
The B61 bomb , for example , is only 12 " ( 30 cm ) in diameter .
This does not leave much room for a sphere of high explosive surrounding a pusher , a tamper , an air gap , and a fissile core . )
During the investigation into alleged Chinese espionage against the U.S. nuclear weapons programs [ H99 ] , it was disclosed that modern U.S. hydrogen bombs do , in fact , use a non-spherical core [ NYT99 ] .
This is apparently a key technique in building miniaturized warheads .
[ SH01 ] states that two - point detonation is used on warheads like the W88 .
It does not appear to be feasible to build detonators that have their own delay elements .
In fact , the problem all along has been to build detonators that would fire at a predictable time after triggering .
Known designs require high current and high voltage ; switching this is non-trivial .
Modern bombs use complex electronics .
An early attempt by India to test their bomb is rumored to have failed because of an electronics malfunction .
Some newer U.S. bombs use microprocessor - based controllers and sequencers , an design choice that would not have been taken without pressing need .
Another possible design principle –this is speculation ; no authoritative sources have said this –would be scrambling the wires [ CZ89 ] .
Suppose that a group of wires led into a scrambling unit .
The scrambling unit would have a set of Enigma - like rotors ; only if they were all in the proper position would the proper connections be made .
If it were not obvious how the wires should be connected–and if , perhaps , they were embedded in epoxy as they entered and left the unit–it would be very hard to analyze them and hence bypass them .
At the very least , there would be a delay of several hours while the circuitry was analyzed .
The simplistic encryption idea does n't fit the newer CAT D and CAT F devices .
As noted , those models use multiple codes that can arm different sets of devices .
Some PALs have a " training key " –a code that gives a useful response during an exercise , but does not actually unlock the device .
At the least , these imply a level of indirection in the key structure .
Furthermore , there must be a command channel to allow for changes to the group structure .
At least one source suggests that the actuating mechanism is mechanical , not purely electronic .
This would also tend to contradict the design hypothesis given above .
The course on PALs does n't seem to explain such details , either ...
Feaver [ F92 ] suggests that a possible PAL design principle involves physically moving assorted parts into the proper positions .
There is precedent for that –not only were the very first nuclear weapons partially assembled on board the plane , an " automatic insertion " device was later used to mechanize that step [ H90a ] .
( Another early mechanical safety mechanism was a boron - cadmium wire in the center of the pit .
The boron and cadmium would , in theory , absorb enough neutrons to damp the chain reaction .
To arm the bomb , the wire was withdrawn .
This turned out to be problematic on the W47 warhead .
When the device had been in storage for a while , the wire tended to break during withdrawal .
For a time , much of the U.S. nuclear submarine fleet was armed with defective warheads [ H88 ] , until the bomb was redesigned . ) .
PALs seem to rely on cryptographic principles and tamper - proof design :
There are two basic means of foiling any lock , from an automobile ignition switch to a PAL : the first is to pick it , and the second is to bypass it .
From the very beginning of the development of PAL technology , it was recognized that the real challenge was to build a system that afforded protection against the latter threat .
Rather than attempting to build an indestructible lock , scientists at Livermore Laboratory in 1961 directed their efforts towards constructing a system that would render a weapon unusable if an attempt was made to interfere with its PAL .
By 1964 , it had been demonstrated that this approach would work .
The design was perfected and incorporated into weapons that utilize CAT D and CAT F PALs .
With this system , the insertion of too many false codes or an attempt to bypass the PAL will render the weapon permanently inoperative , and the weapon must then be returned to the weapons plant for reassembly .
The protective system is designed to foil the probes of the most sophisticated unauthorized user .
It is currently believed that even someone who gained possession of such a weapon , had a set of drawings , and enjoyed the technical capability of one of the national laboratories would be unable to successfully cause a detonation without knowing the code . [ SF87 ] .
The requirement for safety in the face of an enemy with full knowledge is eerily similar to the requirements for the security of a cipher system .
An admiral was less convinced of their absolute safety , though this was 10 years earlier :
All nuclear weapons have some type of command and control mechanism which is designed to preclude unauthorized use , and all nuclear weapons are equipped with safety devices that meet rigid standards ....
With regard to enemy capture of a nuclear weapon , similar safety and security devices thwart the arming , fuzing , and firing of the weapon , particularly if the enemy has little or no knowledge of the mechanical or electro - mechanical operation of the protective device .
It is possible , however , that these mechanisms can be defeated by a sophisticated enemy over a period of time .
Thus , emergency destruction devices and procedures have been developed so that nuclear weapons may be destroyed without producing a nuclear yield in the event that enemy capture is threatened .
The Permissive Action Link ( PAL ) Program consists of a code system and a family of devices integral or attached to nuclear weapons which have been developed to reduce the probability of an unauthorized nuclear detonation ... [ M76 ] .
A technical solution to the issues raised by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was jointly worked out by the Sandia and Los Alamos Laboratories .
The concept was to embed a mechanical or electromechanical code switch in the warhead in a location such that it could not be bypassed reasily .
To foil any attempt to bypass the device , the switch 's appearance and markings were disguised to make its function unclear unless the weapon 's manual were also available . [ J89 ]
Initially , PAL were simply attached to the electrical circuitry of nuclear weapons .
Weapons designers recognized that it would be relatively easy to " wire around " these early PAL and they subsequently " buried " the PAL devices deep inside the weapon , making them virtually inaccessible to anyone trying to arm a weapon without authorization .
In addition , weapons designers of more recent PAL have encapsulated the entire nuclear weapon or the PAL with a protective skin .
Any penetration of this covering results in automatic , irreparable damage to the weapon , making it impossible to detonate [ C87 b ] .
It was almost certainly possible to bypass early PALs : PALs are physically integrated with the bombs : [ C87c ] has a diagram ( taken from [ WR708 ] ) that implies that PALs rely on both the tamper - resistant encapsulation and encryption of the digital signal path mentioned earlier .
A picture shows three inputs to a " control / isolation " processor : the arming and fuzing sensors , the flight environment sensors as passed through a signal processor , and a " human intent " signal passed through a box labeled " unique signal ( UQS ) generator " .
( Earlier , I had suspected that the " generator " is at least in part a stream cipher keyed by the PAL code .
This now strikes me as improbable . )
We must distinguish between a safety mechanism and a security system .
The former is designed to prevent accidental detonations ; the latter is designed to resist a determined adversary .
Unique signals are safety mechanisms .
The High Energy Weapons Archive says that the current unique signal uses " digital communications and codes " .
Earlier unique signal generators used a signal of a type that did not occur elsewhere in the weapon , and was unlikely to arise by accident .
For example , [ S72 ] describes a train of square waves generated by a wind - up device .
[ MSC92 ] describes the unique signal concept in great detail , including the very detailed analyses that went into modern designs .
( You can find a mathematical analysis at [ C01 ] . )
Among the ( surprising ) conclusions of this analysis are that keyboard input does not meet the safety and reliability requirements–using , say , hexadecimal digits is unsafe ; asking the user to type 24 bits is unreliable .
( Modern unique signal generators use a 24 - bit input , and lock up if an erroneous bit is entered .
Some older designs have a " reset " signal , and hence permit multiple tries ; these use 47 - bit input sequences . )
Remarkably , the unique signal is usually considered unclassified [ MSC92 ] , which is pretty good evidence that it 's not part of a security mechanism .
If a keyboard is n't used , what is ?
The suggested mechanisms rely on an operator physically inserting something–a ROM key , a bar code , etc. –into a reader .
The safety mechanisms are shown in the following schematic :
( Diagram adapted from [ C87 c ] . )
[ S72 ] suggests an alternative scheme , where the human intent signal is passed in series through the environmental sensor .
However , the unique signal itself is generated immediately before the strong link .
Drell [ D93 ] strongly supports the notion that PALs protect the digital signal path :
The Enhanced Nuclear Detonation Safety System ( ENDS ) is designed to prevent arming of nuclear weapons subjected to abnormal environments .
The basic idea of ENDS is the isolation of electrical elements critical to detonation of the warhead into an exclusion region , which is physically definied by structural cases and barriers that isolate the region from all sources of unintended energy .
The only access point into the exclusion region for electrical power for normal arming and firing is through special devices called strong links , which cover small openings in the exclusion barrier .
The strong links are designed so that there is an acceptably small probability that they will be activated by stimuli from an abnormal environment .
Detailed analyses and tests give confidence over a very broad range of abnormal environments that a single strong link can provide isolation for the warhead to better than one part in a thousand .
Therefore , the stated safety requirement of a probability of less than one in a million requires two independent strong links in the arming set , and that is the way the ENDS system is designed .
Both strong links must be closed electrically -- one by specific operator - coded input and one by environmental input corresponding to an appropriate flight trajectory –in order for the weapon to be armed .
( A good modern summary of ENDS is at [ W12 ] . )
There are several powerful principles here .
First and foremost , a bomb will not detonate unless sufficient electricity reaches the detonators .
If you can block that –and there are two strong links , either one of which can do so–you 've rendered the bomb harmless .
Consequently , a good design principle for a PAL is one that blocks the current flow .
It is also reasonable to suspect that the switches are mechanical in operation , rather than electrical .
An electrical switch could more easily be closed by accident , if a stray piece of metal were to short - circuit a pair of wires .
Furthermore , if the PAL does indeed operate the switch , a rotor - like configuration is ideal .
There are many possible settings , and no simple contact closure will produce a current path .
In fact , given that Drell notes that each gate has one chance in 103 of failing , it is tempting to conclude that three digits of the PAL code are used to arm each gate .
( The environmental sensor gate , then , would be operated by a combination of PAL input and trajectory data . )
That is clearly an oversimplification , though ; the gates have to resist accidents , including fires and impacts , as well .
The simplicity of the design carries with it a corresponding price , however : it implies a lot of reliance on the protective barrier .
Someone who could breach the barrier without activating the safety mechanisms could indeed bypass both the PAL and the environmental sensors .
Furthermore , this barrier must also be resistant to enemy attempts to induce bomb failures .
To give just one example , X - rays , which could be used in an attempt to probe the barrier , are one form of threat that the protective structure senses [ C87c ] , and hence one that could presumably lead to a self - destruct sequence .
But X - rays have also been considered as a defensive measure against nuclear weapon attacks .
Indeed , bombs release much of their energy as X - rays [ R95 ] .
If this guess at a design is correct , the rotor settings are the actual cryptographic key .
Presumably , these are rarely changed –one would have to open the sealed environment to do so .
But the settings could be encrypted in an external PAL key ; this in turn could easily be changed by a microcomputer embedded inside the bomb 's protective skin .
Other Design Ideas
There are many other possible approaches to a PAL design .
For example , in modern bombs the pit is " levitated " inside the ball of high explosives [ H88 ] [ R95 ] .
Perhaps the placement of the pit can be varied in three dimensions .
A seriously off - center pit wo n't detonate properly .
On the other hand , a " fizzle yield " or plutonium dispersal are still serious matters ; this approach may not offer enough safety .
Another possibility is changing the timing of the " initiator " .
The initiator supplies the initial neutrons to start the chain reaction ; in a modern bomb , this is done by an electronic device .
Hansen [ H88 ] notes that this is a critical parameter , and can act as a failsafe device .
But it is n't clear that this is reliable enough to be use for PALs ; there is a moderately high probability of of neutrons being present from spontaneous fission , especially of Pu-240 .
A chain reaction started by stray neutrons would n't have nearly as high a yield , but it would still be significant .
( In a related vein , Hansen also notes that the timing of the injection of a deuterium - tritium " booster " into the center of the pit is critical to the yield of the weapon .
If this timing is controlled by the PAL , the enabling code can vary the damage done by the weapon , as mentioned earlier . )
Given that earlier PALs seem to work by interrupting the high voltage supply , it is tempting to try to build on this principle but with stronger cryptographic backing .
Bombs get their high voltage detonation current from a bank of capacitors ; these in turn are charged from batteries .
A typical battery - driven charging circuit–as is incorporated into ordinary electronic flash units–works by pulsing the battery 's DC output and feeding that into a transformer .
The output of the transformer is fed to the capacitors .
Suppose that the frequency of the pulses is controlled by a microprocessor , with a narrow bandpass filter between its output and the transformer .
The pulse frequency would have to be just right for the charging circuit to work .
Better yet , have several filters switched in and out of the circuit by the microprocessor , which of course would switch the pulse frequency accordingly .
If the timing and frequency information were encrypted using the PAL as a key , it would be improbable that the capacitor would be charged .
One could add a few more wrinkles , such as a computer - controlled drain circuit and closely matching the battery 's maximum output to the necessary charge values .
It is quite unclear if this scheme can be made to work .
If nothing else , the circuit is quite involved , and would require careful analysis .
Furthermore , the high - voltage circuit components are of necessity outside the tamper - resistant barrier ; it might be too easy to wire around them .
Finally , building a high - voltage power supply is a relatively easy task ; an enemy who gained possession of a nuclear weapon might be able to replace those circuits entirely .
Finally , actual sections of microprocessor code could be encrypted .
If the essential detonation sequence is complex enough , and in particular if it relies on decisions made by the microprocessor in response to actual conditions in the bomb , this would be a powerful defense .
The unknown question , of course , is whether or not an adequate yield could be obtained by a much simpler control mechanism .
Also note that the decryption key would have to be present in the actual code .
Suitable reverse engineering of the code would reveal this key .
PALs and Key Management
A reference [ J89 ] and an Air Force Document suggest that PALs are rekeyed periodically .
Furthermore , at least some Air Force bases regularly have PAL keys on hand , albeit ( apparently ) in encrypted form ; these are among the highest priority items that must be destroyed in event of an emergency .
It is reasonably probable that public key cryptography is not used directly .
No known public key cryptosystem uses keys as short as 6 or 12 digits .
( Of course , the lack of any visible plaintext or ciphertext might thwart most cryptanalysts ... )
Feaver [ F92 ] repeatedly points out the difference between the enabling message – the PAL unlock code–and the authorization message –the message from the National Command Authority authorizing the use of nuclear weapons .
[ WR708 ] says that a protoype PAL based on public key cryptography has been built , but that it has not been deployed .
No further details are given in the non-redacted portion .
Public key cryptography might be used in the overall command and control system .
The code values carried by the President are identification and authentication information , not PAL codes themselves [ B93 ] .
( There have been accidents with the custody of these , too .
Carter 's codes were left in some clothing that was sent to the dry cleaners ; Reagan 's were inadvertently taken by the FBI ( with his clothing ) when he was in the hospital following the assassination attempt [ F92 ] . )
There is a reasonably clear statement about the basic design principles of these codes in a Congressional hearing :
Now , I recall reading a few weeks ago that someone in our armed services who is in the nuclear chain of operation raised the question at an orientation session as to how they could be sure that the order to launch a nuclear strike in point of fact came from the President .
After that , the person was removed from the program completely ....
How do the people down the chain of command , who are the recipients of the Presidential order , know that the order , in fact , has come from the President , rather than an impostor ?
Admiral Miller :
We have incorporated in the release process not only the order to do the job , but an elaborate , highly secure , coded authentication system , where you not only get the order , but you get an authentication that the order is valid .
That prevails all the way down the line , actually almost to the weapon itself .
In some instances , that technique exists right at the weapon [ M76 ] .
That 's as good a requirements statement for digital signatures as you 're going to get , especially from an admiral talking to a Congressional committee in 1976 , when public key cryptography had not yet been reinvented by the civilian community .
( Clearly , there are other cryptographic techniques that could be used , most notably one - way hashing of passwords–an idea that was publicly known at the time .
But most of these are vulnerable to replay attacks , especially given the offline nature of an authorization order . )
A counter - argument against use of digital signatures for such purposes is their length .
Some of the radio systems used or contemplated for Emergency Action Messages ( EAMs ) are extremely low bandwidth .
Extremely Low Frequency ( ELF ) radio is restricted to about one bit per minute after error correction ; Very Low Frequency ( VLF ) operates at " slow teletype speeds " [ C87a ] .
The actual PAL codes are in fact fairly widely disseminated , though not to the level of individual weapons commanders .
The authorization codes are much more tightly held , though the extent of the delegation is classified .
Recently declassified documents confirm that the president has in fact delegated such authority .
There is clearly a place here for sophisticated key management techniques .
Cotter suggests that such are used [ C87 c ] :
Distributing codes too widely could compromise control .
Holding the codes at too few locations could compromise survivability under enemy attack .
Force survivability was given high priority .
The management scheme , devised by Defense Department communications security experts , allows great flexibility in code passing and in recall of control during and after a crisis subsides .
The Bottom Line–How do PALs Work ?
From the open literature , it is impossible to come to any definite conclusions .
It seems clear , though , that there is no single mechanism in use .
PALs that one could build today would be vastly different than those deployed in 1962 .
My guess is that the CAT A , B , C , and D PALs were , in effect , electromechanically - operated devices similar to the rotor mechanism described earlier .
Most likely , they interrupted the high voltage path .
They were definitely electromechanical , and I doubt very much that mid-60's technology would have permitted an electronic encryption - based design .
CAT F is at least partially electronic .
( [ H88 ] says that modern PALs are microelectronic in nature . )
The design principle appears to be control of the detonator current , coupled with the tamper - resistant barrier .
I have found no evidence to support any of the hypotheses involving encrypted code or timing information .
These remain the best bet for an inherently safe PAL design , however , and Cotter [ C87c ] does hint that CAT F–unlike earlier models –is inherently impossible to bypass .
He also says " electronic information processing based on cryptological techniques was incorporated in the coded switch and controller circuitry . "
It seems plausible that control of the D - T pump timing and the initiator are encrypted timing signals ; doing so would be very straight - forward , and would provide a strong control over total yield of a stolen bomb , if not necessarily over actual detonation .
Was I Right ?
I recently acquired a copy of a 1961 memo [ A61 ] by Harold Agnew on the need for PALs .
An appendix describes the design principles for a prototype .
It had two parts , connected by a cable .
The accessible part was , of course , for entering the arming code .
The inaccessible part accepted the code and controlled whether or not the X - unit could charge .
The X - unit is the trigger for an implosion bomb .
It appears to be a capacitor bank , similar to those used in camera flash units .
It 's charged during arming time ; krytrons are used to discharge the capacitors to feed current to the detonators .
Security in the prototype was provided by inaccessibility ; the new box is buried deep inside the bomb , so you 'd have to disassemble and reassemble the bomb to bypass it .
Here 's the crucial text from the memo :
A small electronic or electromechanical coded receiver ( decoder ) would be installed in the weapon in a relatively inaccessible location .
This decoder would be connected by a cable to a connector in an accessible part of the weapon , such as on the warhead protective cover or near one of the access doors .
A particular , resettable coded signal would be required through this connector to operate the decoder .
The output switch of the decoder would interrupt critical arming circuits at any time prior to operation , and would complete these circuits only upon receipt of the proper coded signals .
...
The critical arming circuits to be interrupted would be the inverter to converter circuits and the nuclear arming circuits in capsule type weapons , the high voltage safety switch circuits in high voltage thermal battery type weapons , and the converter input circuits in chopper - converter type weapons .
This makes more sense than my notion of interrupting the current from the high voltage source to the detonators , for several reasons .
First , in older bombs there were many detonators — the Mk - 5 bomb , for example , used 92 - point detonation .
Interrupting the detonation via a PAL would thus require 92 controlled switches .
This is impractical .
It might work for a modern two - point bomb , though ; you interrupt one detonator wire , and rely on the one - point safety property to prevent any nuclear yield .
Still , if there 's still an X - unit it has a very undesirable property : it 's possible to arm the bomb without the PAL .
That 's a dangerous state ; a bomb is much safer if unarmed .
One section of The Swords of Armageddon , available online , notes that environmental sensing devices also interrupt the arming path .
( It also notes the existence of " motor - driven rotary safing switches which isolate power sources in a weapon from the firing components " , perhaps partially confirming another speculation of mine . )
Why are PALs Classified ?
As noted , it is hard to find authoritative technical descriptions of how PALs work .
Admiral Miller repeatedly declined to be more precise in his testimony , citing the " highly classified " nature of the material [ M76 ] .
But from whom are the secrets being kept ?
There is ample evidence [ SF87 ] [ B93 ] that the U.S. offered design details on PALs to other nuclear powers .
The rationale , of course , was to help these countries control their own nuclear weapons .
The first approach to the Soviet Union was as early as 1971 ( they were n't interested , though they never had PALs of their own ; they relied on ``people watching people who watched still other people ' ' [ R04 ] .
On the other hand , a former Soviet general implies that at some point , the Soviets did have technical control measures of some sort [ GS94 ] ) .
This suggests one of two possibilities .
First , and most intriguing , the design of PALs may be so closely tied to the design of nuclear weapons that revealing the former gives hints on the latter .
Nothing I 've seen supports this theory , but it is possible .
Second , the incremental risk if a U.S. nuclear weapon is compromised by another nuclear power is comparatively small .
But a non-nuclear power–or group–would benefit greatly from anything that improved their odds of using someone else 's bombs .
If , however , my guesses about the design are correct , PALs per se have little that is sensitive .
But the tamper - resistant skin is another matter .

まあ、実際に何か間違った定理が証明されてしまったわけではないようですが（わざと作った反例以外）。しかし、古いアーカイブの日付やスレッドの表示が壊れてるなあ…。De Bruijn indexの話で盛り上がっていますが、この頃から自分がOCamlメーリングリストを荒らしていたことは秘密です。
Francois Azambourg ’s Brindilles Lights taper downward in twig - like twirl , mimicing the broken straws and curling stems of a brushwood plant .
The luminous strands are made from a combination of LEDs and fibre optic cables , arranged randomly they light up like exposed filaments , burning brightest at the tips , or tumbleweeds catching the sun of the desert and the tincture of white sand .
The Brindilles Chandelier is available fromk Ligne Roset and costs € 3336 .
Every once in a while , we see an article in the news about a woman giving birth at age 65 or 66 .
We do n’t hear as much about older fathers , although 80 - year - old Hugh Hefner made news earlier this year when he announced that he and his girlfriend were considering having a baby .
What special challenges and rewards await these mid-life parents ?
Every once in a while , we see an article in the news about a woman giving birth at age 65 or 66 .
We do n’t hear as much about older fathers , although 80 - year - old Hugh Hefner made news earlier this year when he announced that he and his girlfriend were considering having a baby .
While new parents over age 60 are rare , the fact is that more and more people in their forties and fifties are having children .
20 % of women now wait until age 35 to have their first babies and a 2005 study showed that the birth rate for women in their early to mid-40s had grown 5 % in the last decade .
What special challenges and rewards await these mid-life parents ?
For older parents , the worries can begin even before pregnancy .
Women over 40 years of age are at greater risk of complications during pregnancy .
Rates of pre-eclampsia , gestational diabetes , and miscarriage all rise , as do the rates of Down syndrome in the child .
Paternal age can make a difference too : studies have shown a link between advanced paternal age and Down syndrome and schizophrenia in their children .
Because of these greater risks , women who are pregnant after 40 need to be even more vigilant about seeking prenatal care and taking care of themselves during pregnancy .
In fact , they should visit their doctor before they become pregnant , in order to get as healthy as possible before the pregnancy begins .
On a more positive note , the American College of Obstetricians and [ tag - tec ] Gynecologists [ / tag- tec ] have concluded that the current interest in health and fitness is greatly benefiting older women , who “ may find themselves in better shape than they were at a younger age . ”
This greater health and fitness is also useful for parents after their children are born .
One great challenge of parenting is simply the physical demands of keeping up with an active child .
Because a decline in energy is a natural part of aging , this can be a special concern for older parents .
Fortunately , having children can keep you feeling young .
As author Pamela Shires Sneddon , who had three children after age 40 , explains , “ The reality is , as an older parent , regardless of how I might feel , I ’m kept from focusing on age - related aches and pains by the demands of those who assume I have limitless energy . ”
It also helps to follow the guidelines for healthy living we all know – eat right , get enough sleep , [ tag - ice ] exercise [ / tag- ice ] , and do n’t smoke .
In addition , older parents should see their doctors regularly for physicals and preventive care .
By taking special care of themselves , they can increase the odds they will be around for years to come .
[ tag - cat ] Parenting [ / tag- cat ] after 40 can also come with emotional and financial challenges .
Older parents do not enjoy being mistaken for their child ’s grandparent or worrying about teething when all their friends are worrying about broken curfews .
They also do n’t enjoy putting money into a college fund when their retirement fund lies empty .
However , as many challenges as there are for older parents , there are just as many rewards — for parents and children alike .
Older parents tend to spend more time with their children and to be more patient .
Their life experiences have given them a wiser perspective , so they do n’t worry as much about spilled juice or scraped knees .
Instead , they are able to revel in the joys of parenting .
As Susan Segal , who had her first child at age 41 , writes , “ We would like to be younger – who would n’t .
But then we would n’t have the kids we have , or the experiences we ’re having now .
With all the aches and pains and exhaustion and embarrassment and headaches , we ’d do it all again in a heartbeat . ”

CBS : Iraqi PM does n't trust his military , says coup possible David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday May 31 , 2007 Print This Email This Iraqi PM al - Maliki told Lara Logan of CBS Evening News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday that he has a real fear of a coup by the Iraqi army .
Al - Maliki said that some of the officer corps have been creating problems and even violating the security of military operations .
He stated , " I 'm not afraid , but I have to watch the army , because those still loyal to the previous regime may start planning coups .
Those people do n't believe in democracy , and for that reason we are monitoring the status of the army very closely . "
Al - Maliki also insisted that his government is not ordered around by the Americans , saying , " The Americans do n't order us to do this or not to do that .
On the contrary , we 're the ones who tell them to do this and do n't do that . "
The following video clip is from CBS Evening News .
VALID POINT : George Orwell
In the name of cultural diversity , Labour attacks anything that smacks of Englishness .
The mainstream public are treated with contempt , their rights ignored , their history trashed .
In their own land , the English are being turned into second - class citizens .
This trend was highlighted this week by the case of Abigail Howarth , a bright teenager who applied for a training position with the Environment Agency in East Anglia but was turned down because she was too white and English .
The post , which carries a £ 13,000 grant , was open only to ethnic minorities , including the Scots , Welsh and Irish .
Such social engineering was justified by the Agency on the grounds that minorities were under - represented in its workforce , the parrot cry used by bureaucrats throughout the public sector to justify bias against the English .
Almost every interaction with any public service now leads to a detailed analysis of one ’s ethnic status
Though Abigail ’s case rightly caused outrage , it was not unique .
This kind of reverse discrimination is now rife across the state machine , underwritten by the very English tax­payers who are the targets of institutional prejudice .
Although it is technically illegal to restrict jobs to certain ethnic groups , the racially fixated commissars have found a way round that problem by developing training schemes open only to minorities .
Under the 1976 Race Relations
Act it is permissible to use racial considerations in recruitment to trainee positions such as the one to which Abigail applied .
Such practices are dressed up as “ positive action ” to widen diversity and , in the words of one Labour council , “ to overcome past discrimination ” .
So HM Revenue and Customs offers work experience jobs , worth up to £ 15,900 a year pro-rata , to ethnic minority graduates , while the Museums Association has two - year ethnic minority apprenticeships .
Similarly , Birmingham City Council gives £ 16,000 a year to “ black and minority ethnic individuals ” in its “ Positive Action Traineeship Scheme ” , and a £ 10,000 allowance to clerical trainees from “ the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities ” .
Discriminatory training schemes can also be found in ITV , the civil service and the NHS , which boasts “ a management development programme specifically designed and tail­ored to the needs of black and minority ethnic midwives ” .
It was revealed last year that Avon and Somerset Constab - ulary rejected 186 applications from white men on the grounds that they were already “ over - represented ” in the force .
In the same way , London Mayor Ken Livingstone last month refused to endorse a series of nominations for the London Fire Authority because they were dominated by whites .
And whole towns are beginning to suffer state disapproval .
Eighty administrative jobs in the Prison Service have recently been transferred from Corby in Northamptonshire to Leicester because , as the Home Office admitted , Corby ’s population is predominantly “ white British ” , a terrible sin in our multicultural society .
It is a bitter irony that the Labour Government , which works itself into such a synthetic rage over racial prejudice , should practise overt discrimination on an epic scale .
The remorseless focus on supporting minorities has led to a perverted ideology of anti-white racism .
Almost every interaction with any public service now leads to a detailed analysis of one ’s ethnic status .
A vast race equality industry has been built up , filled with overpaid paper shufflers , consultants and advisers with little to do except invent new grievances .
There is an air of the Maoist permanent revolution about their activities .
Since immigration now runs at probably one million people a year , the make - up of society is changing dramatically .
So , in this climate of endless demographic upheaval , the race relations brigade will always be able to invent more work for itself .
Yet anti-English discrimination undermines the central plank of the propaganda for mass immigration .
We are constantly told we need vast influxes of foreigners to boost our economy and fill vacancies but unem­ployment levels in immigrant communities are so high and skills so lacking that we need to reserve parts of our economy for them .
So if we have to spend a fortune on training schemes , why are we inviting hundreds of thousands of arrivals from the Third World and Eastern Europe here every year ?
Economics have little to do with the issue .
The Left in Britain have seized on mass immigration and multiculturalism as a battering ram to destroy the society they despise .
They once sought to change our country through economic revolution .
That failed with the Winter of Discontent and the downfall of communism .
But demographic change through migration has proved far more damaging .
Once again , a fair warning to all , this might be offensive as hell to some .
Just try and understand that even though I think religion may be crazy or irrational , that does n't mean I universally dislike religious people or that I think everything they do outside of religion is worthless .
Point of Fact :
This two - part series came about last evening during a friendly e-mail exchange with a Kossack friend who isa believer and s/he happens to be someone whose integrity , character , and compassion , I greatly admire .
Now a foreword and a suggested code of conduct since the post got so distended :
Take some time to decide if something is really worth your time to respond to , there will be trolls on both sides looking to agitate you anyway they can .
Your religion may be inspiring to you .
It may have stories that are inspiring to me .
It may have mnemonic value ; critically important value at that .
It may be rich in tradition and culture , it may encapsulate important events in human history .
It may offer hope to people who have no hope left .
It may serve as a useful insight into human nature .
Humans may indeed have a preexisting facility to acquire belief systems similar to the one for language .
It may provide a valuable ethical and behavioral framework .
It may spread like a virus and mutate like bird flu .
I do n't necessarily think you are weak minded for buying it , I think enculturation and peer pressure is some powerful gumbo .
But this diary is n't about any of that .
This is about why I am an atheist , not why you should be one .
And by atheist I mean that I strongly suspect that the core , underlying , supernatural claims of religion are nonsense .
If you want me to not be an atheist and share your particular flavor of supernatural belief , you need to be able to perform the magic or produce the supernatural being you claim exists and subject that creature to a battery of tests under controlled conditions .
That 's it folks .
That 's the criteria if you want me to believe that your underlying supernatural being or beings are for real .
Spare me / us word games , meaning try and avoid twisting words into unrecognizable states of vague meaningless mush .
EG :
The assumption that Cap'n Crunch exists and the assumption that dogs exist are not on the same rung in the ladder of ' faith ' .
One requires extraordinary faith and the mind of a child or a ' tard , the other only requires a trip to my backyard .
Same for redefining atheism as a religion .
You can call atheism anything you want , but you may just confuse people if you do so .
Because if atheism is a religion , then not collecting stamps is a hobby and baldness is a hair color .
And please , try and limit any long - winded philosophical explanations of why your particular deity or supernatural claim is untestable or perfectly resembles one that does not exist ; if it cannot be tested and happens to perfectly imitate one that does not exist , skeptics are not going to buy it .
Same for excuses that the magic does n't work when a skeptic is present with a camcorder .
It does n't matter , even if it 's written in a book that it worked once upon a time .
Same for demanding I prove your magic wizard / dragon / powers / sea monster / pantheon does n't exist or ' you win' .
This is for your own good :
You do n't win anything outside of exposing yourself as logically clueless .
Speaking of which here 's an exhaustive list of Logical Fallacies many of which were known to even the ancients and most of which are required topics for a degree in philosophy .
If you regale us in comments with your philosophical prowess or try to snow anyone in that regard , and go onto commit even one of them , you will probably be laughed at and ridiculed by people who have real training in philosophy or formal debate .
Why am I an Atheist ?
In my Santa Claus analogy I mentioned near the end to imagine why it is you do n't literally believe in Santa and his North Pole factory .
I bet for most of you , it 's not because you hate Santa , I mean who would ?
It 's probably not because you hate Christmas or despise giving or receiving gifts .
I doubt it 's because you detest having days off or eating kickass food with your family and friends .
You probably can't prove there is no Santa and even if you try , I assure you from long experience in dealing with creationists *
I can offer a counter argument .
No , none of that is the reason : Your disbelief in a literal Santa Claus , flying reindeer , nocturnal visits , toy factories , elves , etc. , likely centers on three concrete objections :
" It " makes no sense
There is no evidence for " it " We 're adults who can get by fine at Christmas time and enjoy ourselves without " it " having to be true
Evidence by far is the key .
Something might not make sense , like Quantum Mechanics , but we accept it because of the evidence .
OTOH something might make sense , like the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe , but we do n't accept it as valid , yet , because we have no evidence .
The reason for this asymmetry is , as the late Carl Sagan said :
Combine a bunch of bundled extraordinary claims that have no evidence to support them , not even mediocre evidence , with the fact that the set of claims do n't make any sense at all kinds of levels , and that 's a real problem for someone like me to get past .
Simply substitute " it " for religion in the above three points and you understand the framework of why I 'm an atheist .
Since most of the people who ask me about this are Christians and that 's the religion I know the most about , I 'll address that particular tradition under the three qualifiers I mentioned above .
With the understanding that I do n't think your religion is any sillier than any other as it can easily be extended to cover other supernatural cosmogonies .
It makes no sense
There is so much in the Bible ( And the Quron and everything else ) that makes no sense , it 's pretty hard to pick a place to begin .
I suppose a good enough place would be the beginning of the book :
It makes no sense to create some kind of paradise in which man and woman have no inkling of right and wrong , and then hold them responsible for doing something wrong .
It makes no sense to hold their descendants for all time responsible for them doing something wrong even if they did in fact have some mysterious way of determining right and wrong prior to being taught how to distinguish right from wrong .
It makes no sense for YVHW to kill off every living thing on earth with a flood or any other psychotic method of genocide if he can do whatever he wants and his goal is to engender love for His masterful and benevolent rule .
It is in fact an act far , far , to the right of Hitler and Ghangas Kahn combined ; it makes those two pikers look like candy - stripers .
And the flood is just one of many monstrous acts .
It makes no sense to talk about an immortal being dying , because by definition immortal beings cannot die .
It 's like talking about a square circle , or an even number that is not divisible by two ; it 's nonsensical words strung together in a transparently vacuous parody of meaning .
Speaking of which , what generally makes dying such a big sacrifice in the first place is that you stay dead , forever .
Another thing that makes torture and execution such an unpleasant experience is that you 're utterly helpless throughout the ordeal .
Being the omnipotent Creator of all space and time kind of takes the edge of that , and it makes no sense that someone would try to pitch it as a big sacrifice .
This example of what I feel is nonsense bears special emphasis by graphic comparison : Casey Sheehan was sacrificed ; Pat Tillman was sacrificed ; People in New Orleans were sacrificed ;
Every fireman that ran into the WTC was sacrificed .
What makes those tragedies a sacrifice is not just that we know they happened or the cause they died for , but that it meant they were gone forever .
OTOH , being unconscious for three days and then coming to as the Immortal Ruler of the Universe is not a sacrifice , it 's a stunt .
And the consequences for the stunt man are the sweetest deal in the history of mankind .
It makes no sense that God would disguise himself as a human , fake his death , and expect us to drop to our knees in abject awe at his ' sacrifice ' , because it pales in comparison to the ones we mere mortals face .
In my view , it 's frankly a grotesque insult to humanity to try and pass that off as anything close to the fear , horror , and pain that real people have to deal with under torture and execution .
And it makes little sense to me that a being which creates Quasars and butterflies would come up with such an empty and downright bizarre stunt as a solution to problems they intentionally created in the first place and expect us to whimper in admiration at their sense of compassion .
Especially since by all accounts they could have remedied it with the snap of their supernatural fingers , or just not let the problem happen in the first place .
This is how sense works imo , using the Bible itself : Either Jesus died and stayed that way in which case he did not rise and Christianity is built on an erroneous premise , or he did rise in which case he did not die and there was no sacrifice , and Christianity is built on an erroneous premise .
It really is that simple .
It makes no sense that an omnipotent being who wishes so much to be recognized and loved would conceal its existence with a sustained vigor well beyond the designation of paranoid .
It does makes sense that if H & R Block can open up a branch office in every small town , that a motivated , omnipotent being could do the same , and personally man it himself 24/7 with angels out front serving food and drink .
It makes no sense that a perfect being would need to create the universe or mankind , because by definition a perfect beings needs or wants for nothing .
Hell , even their own beliefs do n't make sense as purely cultural precepts : Morality under God is absolute , never relative -->
It 's immoral to destroy children at any stage after conception because it is an absolute , regardless of what good may come of it for individual people or the society they live in , except it 's perfectly moral we 're told by wingnuts , to drop bombs on children in Iraq , precisely because of the good that may come of it for the individual or the culture ; this is ' absolute morality ' ?
Well , It Makes No Sense .
In general , and this one applies to all Abrahamic Faiths and most others :
It makes no sense that the oral histories of a few bands of rival roaming shepherds during the bronze age would harbor the one and only true secret of how the Cosmos came to be .
It 's far , far , more likely that they made this shit up over many generations , and we can tell that is probably exactly the case , because again , it makes no sense at all , and there is a long line of historical antecedents in ANE Mythology leading right up to the early Christian version .
We can literally read old scrolls and accounts and see the various components of the God of the OT come together from other deities .
And even if the entire universe turns out to be an artificially manufactured object made by Intelligent Agency , as fascinating as that would be , it makes no sense to automatically assume the entire 10^36 cubic light - year Cosmos was made exclusively for us .
It makes no sense to me that I have this indestructible , undefined , supernatural attachment called a ' soul ' which gets reincarnated or goes to a vague ' afterlife ' .
And if that soul existed before I did , has little or no recollection of my life while I 'm alive , does not interact with me in any discernible way , and retains little or none of what makes me ' me ' after I 'm gone , I have news for you :
The soul and have very different agendas to say the least !
It does n't make any sense to me that I 'd give a hoot what happens to it , it 's an unsubstantiated supernatural parasite as far as I 'm concerned and its future welfare is about as important to me as an imaginary tapeworm .
Lastly , no matter how sophisticated one 's apologetics are , it makes no sense that a being can be simultaneously omnipotent , omnibenevolent , omniscient , while evil and pain exists and still provide us with free will while at the same time expecting us to choose door number two or be condemned to eternal torture .
All those qualities and conditionals taken together are mutually exclusive in more ways than I can count .
If you argue otherwise , no matter how slick and polished your arguments , you 're arguing that circles can be squares .
And it makes no sense to me that such convoluted apologetics would be required in the first place to reconcile all these crazy inconsistent claims , or explain why these supernatural creatures happen to exactly imitate ones that were made up , if all this stuff was The One Truth of the Universe .
That 's just a handful Biblical claims that make little or no sense to me .
I 'm not saying they did n't happen or that they 're impossible , only that they make little or no sense To Me .
I 'm sure others can provide other exemplars that make no sense to them in comments .
There is no evidence for it
I do n't know how the Bible , or the Quron , or a Native American Creation Fable , could mean anything else other than literally happened ... when it states clearly that something literally happened .
Make sense ?
With that literal interpretation in mind for the OT then , there is no evidence the universe is a few thousand years old and a shitload of evidence that it is much older .
There is no evidence that there was ever a Garden of Eden and there is a mountain of evidence that neither humans or many other species descend from a single mating pair in the geologically recent past .
As would be predicted by both the Garden Story and the Ark Story .
And without that Garden and the whole bit of blaming Eve for disobeying before she knew what disobeying was , which remember makes no sense to start with , and blaming us for all eternity , which again recall makes no sense , there is no original sin and thus no need for salvation from it , which means your entire religion is built on something for which there is no evidence for .
( And no I did n't invent this , Young Earth Creationists have used it for years as part of their spiel )
There is no evidence for a global flood involving trillions of cubic kilometers of water which somehow completely disappeared without a trace in the recent past , or in the distant past for that matter .
And there is massive evidence against it .
No matter what kind of tests I propose for the existence of supernatural critters , the respective adherents always shoot it down as unworkable .
But that 's where you 're stuck imo .
Because there is no testable , reasonably clear evidence for fairies or invisible dragons or Zeus or any of the Gods , Godesses , Godlets , demi-Gods of any kind , and those are all extraordinary claims which therefore require ___ __ ?
I 'm an adult
And just as a child must abandon comfortable fantasy , like Santa , if they 're going to be a productive member of society and deal with real life , we as a species must abandon comforting fantasy , like YVWH , and face the cold hard truth if we 're going to deal with it .
The truth is , by every measure we can make , we 're fragile , ephemeral sacks of meat just like every other animal species .
The truth is , by every measure we can make , our minds , our sensation of love , hate , taste , sight , morality , science , sense of consciousness , everything , are all utterly dependent on the proper functioning of a mass of neurons housed in our skull weighing less than four pounds .
And , if any significant portion of that mass gets heavily traumatized , it 's bye - bye birdie for the owner .
Asking where you ' go ' when that structure ceases to exist , is like asking where your files on your hard drive ' go ' when you melt it into slag .
They do n't ' go ' anywhere , they no longer exist .
Yes , it would be nice if there was a magic invisible sky wizard who took care of us when we die and redress injustices committed against you while alive by others .
It would be nice if your kid or your mom or your loved one who was cruelly cut down by painful lingering cancer was still ' out there ' somewhere .
It would be nice if there was a Santa Claus , and I do n't mean that to sound flippant ;
Who would n't want there to be a Santa Claus ?
For that matter who would n't like to be able to think themselves into the air and fly like a bird at will ?
Well , it does n't matter how nice the idea of Santa is , there is n't a real Santa , and you can concentrate for all your worth and flap your arms for days , you will not fly .
It does n't make sense , there is no evidence for it , and I 'm an adult .
I deal in reality as it is , not as I wish it would be , so that I can perhaps change that reality .
And that 's important .
Because if I could be said to ' believe in ' anything , it 's that I believe in the human potential for progress , problem solving , and flexibility .
That 's how we 've managed to solve problems in the past .
If we put that proven methodology to work , I think probably , one by one , diseases will fall or be engineered out of existence .
I think using that methodology we can get a handle on hunger , poverty , war , greed , natural disasters , and on and on .
One day it may happen that we will conquer aging , that we can record and share our minds .
Maybe , sooner or later , we will even eliminate death itself ; or at least postpone for practical eternity .
This " we " I 'm talking about is no doubt a very different we than exists now , this is our remote descendants .
They may have linked minds , be cybernetic , meld machine and biology , design themselves at the molecular level .
Their consciousness may be carried by silicon , nanodevices , ensconced in exotic dark matter , or housed in something we cannot even conceive of .
These descendants might ply the ocean of space time as easily as you drive to the store , make planets , create stars , build black - holes and farm them for gravity waves .
They , our children 's children , might learn to reconfigure the entire universe .
But a spark of us will still burn in them , all down the ages , just as a vestige of the first hominid , the first tetrapod , the first cell , is part of us .
And unless there is some kind of serious disruption in record keeping , they 'll probably know that they came from a single planet orbiting a small yellow star , where generations of their ancestors busted their asses so that they could be free , truly free .
If so , they 'll probably be able to retrieve data on the 21st century , know there was a thing called the Internet , that on it there were blogs , maybe even know about the Daily Kos :
They might be able to pull up this very post .
For the last few paragraphs I 've left the world of the known and engaged in some pretty far out speculation , but I see no reason why it cannot be that way , or close to it , in the distant future ... IF .
IF we want it , if we make it happen .
The quicker we accept that no one is likely to just hand us these wonderful abilities and gifts , the quicker we 'll get to work developing it for real , on our own .
Because ultimately , we are responsible for us .
What becomes of us is not in the mythical hands of invisible Gods -- as best we can tell and for better or worse .
It 's in our hands ; and it's high time we all started accepting that wonderful gift of self determination .
Hell , we should be dancing on the rooftops that we get the chance to determine our destiny as a species , because we 're the only one on earth that can !
We owe it to try , to shoot for the stars , for all the people who came before us and helped pull us out of the pit of animal savagery .
We owe it to the wonderful diversity of life on earth of which we are a part and which gave birth to our species ; an unbroken lineage stretching back four billion years of which we are the managing agent .
Is there anyone who does n't feel that 's special enough ?
We owe it to ourselves to keep that flame burning , keep pushing the boundaries , so that each and every generation will more and more inherit the promise of what can be , while leaving the grimmer world of what was behind .
I may reject the deities that human intellects have cooked up , but I do n't doubt the potential of that intellect .
That 's what I ' believe in ' if I could be said to ' believe in ' anything ; I believe in our future , because I believe in us .
I believe in you .
And that 's why I 'm an atheist .
I occasionally get requests to join private social networking sites , like LinkedIn or Facebook .
I always politely decline .
I understand the appeal of private social networking , and I mean no disrespect to the people who send invites .
But it 's just not for me .
I feel very strongly that we already have the world 's best public social networking tool right in front of us : it 's called the internet .
Public services on the web , such as blogs , twitter , flickr , and so forth , are what we should invest our time in .
And because it 's public , we can leverage the immense power of internet search to tie it all -- and each other -- together .
In comparison , adding content to a private , walled garden on the internet smacks of the old - world America Online ideology :
While at Sony in 1994 , I was sent to Virginia to learn how to build a Sony " app " on AOL ( the # 3 online service , behind Compuserve & Prodigy at the time ) using AOL 's proprietary " rainman " platform .
Fast forward to Facebook 2007 and see similarities :
If you want access to their big base of users , develop something in their proprietary language for their people who live in their walled garden .
It was so clear to me back in 1999 that AOL was doomed .
But at the time , any criticism of AOL was heresy .
For a lot of companies , AOL was the internet .
You had to accommodate AOL users in your web design and business decisions because of their immense user base and perceived power .
Ten years later , is AOL is even relevant ?
Does anyone care ?
The lesson I take from this is that no matter how wonderful your walled garden is , it can't compete with the public , open internet .
Jason Kottke explains :
As it happens , we already have a platform on which anyone can communicate and collaborate with anyone else , individuals and companies can develop applications which can interoperate with one another through open and freely available tools , protocols , and interfaces .
It 's called the internet and it's more compelling than AOL was in 1994 and Facebook in 2007 .
Eventually , someone will come along and turn Facebook inside - out , so that instead of custom applications running on a platform in a walled garden , applications run on the internet , out in the open , and people can tie their social network into it if they want , with privacy controls , access levels , and alter - egos galore .
Jason Kottke 's equating of Facebook to AOL is intended to provoke .
You might even say it 's incendiary .
But it 's absolutely true , and a much - needed wakeup call .
Have we really forgotten the lesson of AOL 's walled garden so soon ?
Faced with competition from this open web , AOL lost .
Running a closed service with custom content and interfaces was no match for the wild frontier of the web .
Maybe if they 'd done some things differently , they would have fared better , but they still would have lost .
In competitive markets , open and messy trumps closed and controlled in the long run .
Everything you can do on Facebook is possible using a loose coalition of blogging software , IM clients , email , Twitter , Flickr , Google Reader , etc .
Sure , it 's not as automatic or easy , but anyone can participate .
The number of things to see and do on the web outnumbers the number of things you can see and do on Facebook by several orders of magnitude -- and always will .
Facebook is an intranet for you and your friends that just happens to be accessible without a VPN .
If you 're not a Facebook user , you can't do anything with the site .
Nearly everything published by their users is private .
Google does n't index any user - created information on Facebook .
All of the significant information and , more importantly , interaction still happens in private .
Maybe we should n't be so excited about the web 's future moving onto an intranet .
If you want to join my friends list , let 's do it in public .

There 's no future in it .
In the 40 years that humans have been traveling into space , the suits they wear have changed very little .
The bulky , gas - pressurized outfits give astronauts a bubble of protection , but their significant mass and the pressure itself severely limit mobility .
Dava Newman , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering systems at MIT , wants to change that .
Newman is working on a sleek , advanced suit designed to allow superior mobility when humans eventually reach Mars or return to the moon .
Her spandex and nylon BioSuit is not your grandfather 's spacesuit -- think more Spiderman , less John Glenn .
Dava Newman models her Biosuit - - a sleek spacesuit that relies on mechanical counter - pressure instead of using gas pressurization -- on Henry Moore 's sculpture " Reclining Figure " on the MIT campus .

Traditional bulky spacesuits " do not afford the mobility and locomotion capability that astronauts need for partial gravity exploration missions .
We really must design for greater mobility and enhanced human and robotic capability , " Newman says .
Newman , her colleague Jeff Hoffman , her students and a local design firm , Trotti and Associates , have been working on the project for about seven years .
Their prototypes are not yet ready for space travel , but demonstrate what they 're trying to achieve -- a lightweight , skintight suit that will allow astronauts to become truly mobile lunar and Mars explorers .
Newman anticipates that the BioSuit could be ready by the time humans are ready to launch an expedition to Mars , possibly in about 10 years .
Current spacesuits could not handle the challenges of such an exploratory mission , Newman says .
A New Approach
Newman 's prototype suit is a revolutionary departure from the traditional model .
Instead of using gas pressurization , which exerts a force on the astronaut 's body to protect it from the vacuum of space , the suit relies on mechanical counter - pressure , which involves wrapping tight layers of material around the body .
The trick is to make a suit that is skintight but stretches with the body , allowing freedom of movement .
Over the past 40 years , spacesuits have gotten progressively heavier , and they now weigh in at about 300 pounds .
That bulk -- much of which is due to multiple layers and the life support system coupled with the gas - pressurization -- severely constrains astronauts ' movements .
About 70 to 80 percent of the energy they exert while wearing the suit goes towards simply working against the suit to bend it .
" You can't do much bending of the arms or legs in that type of suit , " Newman says .
When an astronaut is in a micro-gravity environment ( for example , doing a spacewalk outside the International Space Station ) , working in such a massive suit is manageable , but , as Newman says , " It 's a whole different ballgame when we go to the moon or Mars , and we have to go back to walking and running , or loping . "
Another advantage to her BioSuit is safety : if a traditional spacesuit is punctured by a tiny meteorite or other object , the astronaut must return to the space station or home base immediately , before life - threatening decompression occurs .
With the BioSuit , a small , isolated puncture can be wrapped much like a bandage , and the rest of the suit will be unaffected .
Newman says the finished BioSuit may be a hybrid that incorporates some elements of the traditional suits , including a gas - pressured torso section and helmet .
An oxygen tank can be attached to the back .
The MIT researchers are focusing on the legs and arms , which are challenging parts to design .
In the Man -Vehicle Lab at MIT , students test various wrapping techniques , based on 3D models they 've created of the human in motion and how the skin stretches during locomotion , bending , climbing or driving a rover .
Key to their design is the pattern of lines on the suit , which correspond to lines of non-extension ( lines on the skin that do n't extend when you move your leg ) .
Those lines provide a stiff " skeleton " of structural support , while providing maximal mobility .
To be worn in space , the BioSuit must deliver close to one - third the pressure exerted by Earth 's atmosphere , or about 30 kPa ( kilopascals ) .
The current prototype suit exerts about 20 KPa consistently , and the researchers have gotten new models up to 25 to 30 KPa .
Staying in Shape
The suits could also help astronauts stay fit during the six - month journey to Mars .
Studies have shown that astronauts lose up to 40 percent of their muscle strength in space , but the new outfits could be designed to offer varying resistance levels , allowing the astronauts to exercise against the suits during a long flight to Mars .
Although getting the suits into space is the ultimate goal , Newman is also focusing on Earth - bound applications in the short term , such as athletic training or helping people walk .
The new BioSuit builds on ideas developed in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Webb , who first came up with the concept for a " space activity suit , " and Saul Iberall , who postulated the lines of non-extension .
However , neither the technology nor the materials were available then .
" Dr. Webb had a great idea , before its time .
We 're building on that work to try to make it feasible , " says Newman .
The project was initially funded by the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts .

I really wish I was less of a thinking man and more of a fool not afraid of rejection .
— Billy Joel
You are n’t attractive enough .
You are n’t smart enough .
You are n’t cool enough .
You are n’t man enough .
Your idea wo n’t work .
You ’re too short .
You ’re too tall .
You ’re too chunky .
You do n’t have enough money .
I already have a boyfriend .
I ’m not looking for a relationship right now .
I ’m really busy this week .
But we should totally hang out some time !
Rejection sucks .
It ’s like being told you just are n’t up to snuff — better luck next time .
But does it have to be this way ?
Why are we so afraid of rejection ?
Is our fear rational ?
How different would your life be if you could learn to not only tolerate rejection , but embrace it ?
It turns out you can .
In fact , if you are willing to experience rejection on a massive scale , you will give yourself the opportunity to do more fulfilling work , make a lot more money , and have much greater choice in your social and love life .
Why We Fear Rejection
Have you ever watched the way a three - year - old interacts with the world ?
I was talking to a gorgeous redhead in the park the other day , and this little kid walked up to her right in the middle of our conversation and started talking to her .
He was completely enamoured with her .
He started rolling around on the ground and impressing her with toddler gymnastics .
He took a swig of her water bottle .
He had her smiling and laughing .
He was amusing himself .
And he did n’t give a fuck that I was there .
We are not born with a fear of rejection .
We are taught it .
It emerges from that collection of rationalizations that we develop about ourselves called the ego .
“ Ego ” is a Latin word meaning “ I ” .
When we refer to our “ identity ” , what we ’re really referring to is our ego .
It ’s the part of our brain where our labels are stored : “ hard - working ” , “ dependable ” , “ honest ” , “ trustworthy ” , “ intelligent ” , “ attractive ” , “ overachiever ” , and so on .
The ego is also the mediator between our primal instincts , our moral standards , and the outside world .
It helps us relate to one another and stay out of trouble .
But while the ego keeps us out of jail , it can become a prison of its own .
The downside of being labelled “ intelligent ” or “ attractive ” or “ hard - working ” is that our ego requires constant reinforcement of this identity .
But how can you be “ intelligent ” if your boss just shot down what you thought was the most original idea you had all year ?
How can you be “ attractive ” if you just got blown out by that girl ?
And surely you ca n’t call yourself “ good at what you do ” when you just sent out 20 CVs and did n’t even get a single response !
To the ego , rejection is the ultimate menace .
How Fear of Rejection Affects You
Take a moment to consider how much you ’re being held back by fear of rejection .
How many times have you simply given up looking for a certain type of work because you got so discouraged by the lack of response ?
How many times have you seen a beautiful girl , that you wished you had the guts to talk to , but just could n’t because you were afraid of being snubbed ?
How often do you avoid striking up conversation with people — guys or girls — out of concern that they might not like you ?
I recently went through a period of a few months where I felt like I was living in a “ self - induced repression ” .
I was so afraid of rejection that I just could n’t bring myself to talk to strangers .
I was blocking my own path .
My fear of rejection resulted in a self - imposed celibacy .
And every guy with a high - speed internet connection knows what that means .
How to Overcome Fear of Rejection
The way to overcome fear of rejection is :
Do n’t try to overcome it .
Instead , condition yourself to take action in spite of the fear .
If you ’re afraid to say hi to the girl , just say hi to her anyway .
If you ’re worried that your idea might not fly with management , and you might look like an idiot , just say what you need to say .
Stand up for your own truth .
This kind of exposure therapy is useful for at least three reasons .
First , it teaches you that rejection is just not that bad .
If the girl ignores you , who cares ?
If you send 20 CVs and get no response , so what ?
Second , it helps desensitize you to what is an entirely imagined problem anyway .
And third , it creates opportunities .
Just because you say hi to some girl does n’t mean you ’ll end up spending the evening together in lustful embrace .
But if you do nothing , you ’ll definitely be going home alone .
To give you some perspective , the ratio of girls I approach to girls I ultimately go on a date with is about 25:1 .
And , when I was doing software consulting , my ratio of CVs sent to signing a contract — for a good rate , doing work that interested me — was about 40:1 .
Embracing Rejection vs. Giving Up Easily
Of course , “ embracing rejection ” does n’t mean “ giving up easily ” .
It just means fully accepting and acting congruently with the idea that you decide your worth .
It means getting out of your own way , and giving yourself permission to live life on your own terms , instead of being controlled by other people ’s responses .
Sometimes “ No ” just means you have n’t yet given the other person enough reasons to say “ Yes ” .
But other times , no really means no .
You have to rely on your intuition to sort out which is which .
So , take Billy Joel ’s advice and be “ more of a fool ” .
Embracing rejection will improve your quality of life .
And Finally …
I ’d like to end this article by saying thank you to all the “ early adopters ” of this blog .
In the last two weeks , this blog has been read by almost 20,000 people from 115 countries .
The primary purpose of this blog is to help others grow , and to give me a place to share what I ’ve learned about life so far , in the hopes that others may benefit .
It ’s encouraging to have this kind of reach this early on .
I know these numbers are small potatoes for some , but for me it ’s a sign that I ’m off to a good start .
GAINESVILLE , Fla . --
Reduce , recycle and rebuild is as important to the most basic component of the human body , the cell , as it is to the environment .
And a University of Florida study shows just how much the body benefits when it " goes green , " at least if you 're a rat : Cutting calories helps rodents live longer by boosting cells ' ability to recycle damaged parts so they can maintain efficient energy production .
" Caloric restriction is a way to extend life in animals .
If you give them less food , the stress of this healthy habit actually makes them live longer , " said Christiaan Leeuwenburgh , Ph.D. , chief of the division of biology of aging in UF 's Institute on Aging .
Understanding how the process works at the cellular level in rodents could help scientists develop drugs that mimic the process in humans , Leeuwenburgh added .
How does it work ?
During the aging process , free radicals -- highly reactive byproducts of our cells ' respiration -- wreak havoc on our cellular machinery .
Mitochondria , the tiny power plants that keep a cell functioning , are especially vulnerable to this type of damage .
The effects can be disastrous -- if malfunctioning mitochondria are n't removed , they begin to spew out suicidal proteins that prompt the entire cell to die .
Cell death , on a whole - body scale , is what aging is all about .
Fortunately , younger cells are adept at reducing , recycling and rebuilding .
In this process , damaged mitochondria are quickly swallowed up and degraded .
The broken down pieces are then recycled and used to build new mitochondria .
However , older cells are less adept at this process , so damaged mitochondria tend to accumulate and contribute to aging .
" Cell survival is dependent upon the ability of the cell to reduce and recycle by a mechanism called autophagy , " said William Dunn Jr. , Ph.D. , a professor of anatomy and cell biology in UF 's College of Medicine and senior author of the study , which was published online this month in the journal Rejuvenation Research .
" When a cell is under stress , autophagy is turned on to clean up the cell by removing damaged cellular components , while recycling building blocks necessary to rebuild the cell .
It 's there to protect the cell .
But in aged cells , they 're basically not able to adjust to stress as well . "
UF scientists studied 22 young and old rats , comparing those allowed to eat freely with those fed a low - calorie , nutritious diet .
The stress of a low - calorie diet was enough to boost cellular cleaning in the hearts of older rats by 120 percent over levels seen in rats that were allowed to eat what they wanted .
The diet had little or no effect on younger rats .
" Autophagy is a housekeeping mechanism that keeps cells free of damaged and thereby detrimental mitochondria and other toxic materials while recycling their building blocks -- nutrients needed by the cell , " said Stephanie Wohlgemuth , Ph.D. , a lecturer in UF 's department of aging and geriatrics and the study 's lead author .
" So if that process is maintained with age - or even increased - that can only be beneficial . "
To determine how dietary restriction boosted cells ' ability to reduce the toxic trash , the scientists studied how the amount of certain proteins changed with the rats ' age and diet .
They found that some proteins responsible for degrading the damaged parts of the cell by autophagy were more abundant in older , calorie - restricted mice .
Boosting autophagy is especially important in the heart , a vital organ packed with mitochondria , Wohlgemuth said .
Swift disposal of damaged cellular components is essential to maintaining an abundance of healthy heart cells as we age .
" Cardiac cells have lost the capability to divide readily to replace dying cells .
So the maintenance of the cells ' survival mechanisms is crucial for the heart , " said Wohlgemuth .
Now that some of these proteins have been identified , UF researchers say the next step is to figure out how the proteins can be activated without inflicting dietary stress .
" What if we bypass the caloric restriction and find a way of increasing autophagy " " asked Dunn .
" That is , instead of starving yourself you can find another way of enhancing autophagy that will allow the enhanced removal of various damaged organelles that accumulate in aged cells . "
Ulf Brunk , M.D. , Ph.D. , a professor emeritus of experimental pathology at Linköping University in Sweden , said the study builds on past research showing that removal of toxic mitochondria may extend life in a variety of mammals .
" The paper is a further step in the direction of showing that the stimulation of autophagy may be beneficial , " Brunk said .

In an article in Esquire in 1971 , the writer Ron Rosenbaum called Joybubbles the catalyst uniting disparate phreaks .
Particularly after news accounts of his suspension from college in 1968 and conviction in 1971 for phone violations , he became a nerve center of the movement .
“ Every night he sits like a sightless spider in his little apartment receiving messages from every tendril of its web , ” Mr. Rosenbaum wrote .
Josef Carl Engressia Jr. was born May 25 , 1949 , and moved often because his father was a school - picture photographer .
At 4 or 5 , he learned to dial by using the hookswitch like a telegraph key .
Four years later , he discovered that he could disconnect a call by whistling .
He found this out when he imitated a sound in the background on a long - distance call and the line cut off .
It turned out that his whistle precisely replicated a crucial phone company signal , a 2,600 - cycles - per - second tone .
Joybubbles ’s parents had no phone for five years because of their son ’s obsession .
Later , his mother encouraged it by reading him technical books .
His high school yearbook photo showed him in a phone booth .
By the time he was a student at the University of South Florida , Joybubbles was dialing toll - free or nonworking numbers to reach a distant switching point .
Unbeknownst to telephone operators , he could use sounds to dial another number , free .
He could then jump anywhere in the phone system .
He was disconnected from college after being caught making calls for friends at $ 1 a call .
In 1971 , he moved to Memphis , where he was convicted of phone fraud .
In Millington , Tenn. , he was hired to clean phones , a job he hated .
In 1975 , he moved to Denver to ferret out problems in Mountain Bell ’s network .
He tired of that and moved to Minneapolis on June 12 , 1982 , partly because that date ’s numerical representation of 6 - 12 is the same as the city ’s area code .
He advertised for people yearning to discuss things telephonic and weaved a web of phone lines to accommodate them .
He lived on Social Security disability payments and part - time jobs like letting university agriculture researchers use his superb sense of smell to investigate how to control the odor of hog excrement .
Joybubbles is survived by his mother , Esther Engressia , and his sister , Toni Engressia , both of Homestead , Fla .
His second life as a youngster included becoming a minister in his own Church of Eternal Childhood and collecting tapes of every “ Mr. Rogers ” episode .
When asked why Mr. Rogers mattered , he said : “ When you ’re playing and you ’re just you , powerful things happen . ”

LIVEBLOGGING THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS - JULY 4 , 1776
Faithful readers of The House will recall that in previous years , my “ Liveblogging the Battle of Gettysburg ” occupied this site at around this time .
Sadly , I have taken that project about as far as possible and declined to involve myself with it this year .
But over the last months , several of you have urged me to “ liveblog ” an historical event using a similar premise – that the internet existed at the time and that I could then link to and comment on the event from the perspective that we were all living it rather than viewing it from afar .
You asked for it .
You got it .
Let ’s go to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on July 4 , 1776 and the background on how the final version of the Declaration of Independence came about .
( I liveblogged the vote on independence here .
And here is my post from yesterday . )
Scroll for updates below .
It ’s 10:00 AM on Bloggers Row here in Carpenter Hall and for once , I find myself virtually alone .
My blog friends have finally realized that just because Congress says that they will start deliberations at 10:00 AM every day does n’t mean anything .
Our Great Men enjoy long , leisurely breakfasts and have little interest in adhering to the dictates of good government by hurrying themselves along .
The city could be on fire or worse , the British could be marching down Chestnut Street and I fear many members of Congress would tarry at their tables lest their digestion suffer .
I do n’t really mind the delay that much .
It gives me a chance to reflect on what has been accomplished these last momentous weeks here in Philadelphia and try and make sense of what the future might bring .
I had a long conversation with Tom Paine last night at City Tavern – well , in truth , Mr. Paine did most of the talking , lubricated as he was by several glasses of ale .
Anyone who has read Common Sense knows the measure of this brilliant , erratic man .
For in truth , I found that his speaking is much the same as his writing .
He touched on familiar themes ; the inevitability of our separation from England as well as the certainty of our triumph .
I tried to argue the Tory side but he cut me off peremptorily and quoted from his treatise , destroying my arguments in the process :
I have heard it asserted by some , that as America has flourished under her former connection with Great Britain , the same connection is necessary towards her future happiness , and will always have the same effect .
Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind of argument .
We may as well assert that because a child has thrived upon milk , that it is never to have meat , or that the first twenty years of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty .
But even this is admitting more than is true ; for I answer roundly that America would have flourished as much , and probably much more , had no European power taken any notice of her .
The commerce by which she hath enriched herself are the necessaries of life , and will always have a market while eating is the custom of Europe .
Mr. Paine makes an interesting point , one that I ’ve heard some patriot merchants make on several occasions .
Our connection to Great Britain with her restrictive trade practices and heavy duties on necessities has stifled the American commercial character .
Might independence loose a torrent of business activity that will enrich our citizens from all levels of society ?
Paine is adamant that this is so .
The man is too much a “ leveler ” for my taste but it ’s hard to argue with his logic .
Besides , it ’s a little intimidating for this lowly blogger to be interviewing the man credited by many with moving the entire nation toward independence !
I received some disturbing news from my landlady this morning about a disturbance at the Shippen House late last evening .
Evidently some drunken dock workers were shouting insults at the Tory family and went so far as to throw a few rocks at the windows .
No one was hurt but it raises some troubling questions ; what to do with the loyalists ?
Philadelphia has thousands of Tories .
As I mentioned yesterday , I saw several loyalist families making preparations to abandon the city now that independence has been declared .
But many more will no doubt stay – especially the families that own the great commercial houses that carry on with most of the business in the city .
Should we place them under arrest ?
Should we force them to leave ?
What is to be done ?
I never thought of this before but , in a way , this conflict will also take on the character of a civil war because there are so many among us who are still loyal to England .
I have no doubt that my loyalist friend Thomas would fight for England if given the chance .
Might we meet on a distant battlefield in the future , two friends who have known each other all our lives trying to kill each other ?
A sobering thought , that .
And that ’s not the half of it .
Thomas ’s brother Joseph is a patriot and has already joined the Continental Army .
Might the two brothers …?
Perish the thought .
Some things we cannot dwell on lest the uncertainty of the future affect our present deliberations .
And what we must concentrate on now is shouting from the mountaintops our determination to resist tyranny so that other nations can join us in our quest for liberty and independence .
But that wo n’t happen until we get Mr. Jefferson ’s declaration passed in reasonably good order .
I am told that Congress is determined to finish the task today so stay tuned for an update around 2:00 PM .
We ’ll see how far they ’ve gotten .
UPDATE : 3:30 PM
The Congress is winding up its perusal of Mr. Jefferson ’s declaration and from what I understand , the Virginian has been moping around the State House bemoaning the fact that his masterpiece of writing has been butchered .
As a writer myself , I can certainly understand Jefferson ’s lament but frankly , he ’s a little off base here .
First of all , my take on his draft was that he was verbose and emotionally overwrought in some places .
And if the Congress wants to exclude passages that are critical of the English people or that highlight the slave trade , that is their right as representatives of the people .
I happen to think their judgment is sound on both points .
For instance , just a few minutes ago , Congress changed this passage from Jefferson ’s draft :
A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free .
Future ages will scarce believe that the hardiness of one man , adventured within the short compass of twelve years only , on so many acts of tyranny without a mask , over a people fostered & fixed in principles of liberty .
To this cleaner , clearer , less emotionally charged sentence :
A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
I ’m sure you can see where Congress , by condensing and clarifying Jefferson ’s thoughts on King George , have improved the character of the piece .
So Jefferson ’s complaints , while understandable , are nevertheless not germane to the object of the matter .
Right now , there is an interesting discussion about the curious lack of references to “ God ” in Mr. Jefferson ’s draft .
Congress is looking at the closing paragraph to the declaration .
Here is Jefferson ’s version :
We , therefore , the representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled do , in the name and by authority of the good people of these states , reject and renounce all allegiance and subjection to the kings of Great Britain and all others who may hereafter claim by , through , or under them ; we utterly dissolve and break off all political connection which may have heretofore subsisted between us and the people or parliament of Great Britain ; and finally we do assert and declare these colonies to be free and independent states they shall hereafter have full power to levy war , conclude peace , contract alliances , establish commerce , and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do .
And for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honour .
Here is the altered final paragraph Congress wishes to insert :
We , therefore , the Representatives of the United States of America , in General Congress , Assembled , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the Name , and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies , solemnly publish and declare .
That these United Colonies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States ; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown , and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved ; and that as Free and Independent States , they have full Power to levy War , conclude Peace , contract Alliances , establish Commerce , and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do .
And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor .
The first major change Congress wants to make would substitute “ in the name and by authority of the good people of these states ” ... and place in its stead “ appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions ” ...
The issue of religion has not been raised in discussion of the draft but there is apparently a feeling that by calling upon
The Almighty to bless the endeavor , it would have a salutary affect on our own people who are quite the religious lot .
For myself , my mother ’s family are Quakers where my father ’s side do n’t believe much of anything .
I went to the Meeting House when I was younger but my mother ( much to my grandmother ’s horror ) allowed me to make my own decisions about religion once I reached the age of 18 .
Most of these Great Men make a show of attending religious services but as far as their personal beliefs , I ’m not sure .
I find it interesting that they do n’t mention “ God ” per se in the draft but rather refer to “ The Supreme Judge ” or , as in this other change from Jefferson ’s draft , “ Divine Providence . ”
Jefferson ’s draft :
And for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honour .
Revision by Congress :
And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor .
Still no mention of God but everyone knows who they are referring to .
Or do they ?
There is a current of thought abroad in Europe that sees not some Supreme Being watching over our lives but rather a great force of nature that rules the universe .
“ Providence ” refers to this idea that our lives are governed by this force and that America is destined to succeed as a result of what has been set in motion already .
It ’s a little beyond my understanding .
But most people will see “ Providence ” as a code word for “ God ” which is the whole point of the exercise , I gather .
All told , by my count it appears that Congress has made 39 changes to Jefferson ’s draft including striking out the passage on slavery .
They are preparing for the vote on adopting the declaration – a pro forma action .
And then the deed will be done .
I will have one more update shortly .
UPDATE : 4:30 PM
The declaration of American independence was approved unanimously in Congress just a few minutes ago .
All in all , a cracking good piece of writing and thinking .
While Mr. Jefferson should get the lion ’s share of the credit , there were many hands that improved upon his work who should also receive the favor of history .
Adams and Franklin , definitely .
And several members of Congress – including the President of Congress John Hancock who was supposed to have muttered while signing his name in huge script to authenticate the document , “ I guess King George should be able to read that well enough ! ”
( I have it on excellent authority – a Mr. Charles Thomson , Secretary of Congress , that this story is utter nonsense .
Congress had already adjourned and , after making a few minor changes to the draft , Hancock signed it in the presence of Mr. Thomson without saying a word . )
Now it ’s off to the printer where we assume , Congress assembled will sign it at a later date .
“ The favor of history ” – that , ultimately , is what this document ’s about .
Jefferson obviously wrote this declaration with one eye on history and one eye across the ocean .
If it ever becomes unclear in the distant future why we colonists rose up to throw off the yoke of British tyranny , all our great - great - grandchildren will have to do is dust off Mr. Jefferson ’s handiwork and read it .
But will we be able to transmit to those distant generations what was in our hearts , our minds ?
Will we be able to make them understand how precious our freedoms are to us , how many of us would willingly die rather than lose them ?
The British did n’t just want to tax us .
They wanted to take our property without our consent – a clear definition of tyranny and arbitrary government .
What will those future Americans – and I feel certain there will be Americans in the future – think of our taking up arms and fighting for a new nation ?
Will they understand how we see ourselves as “ new men ” set down here by God in a new place , enjoying a bounty from the land gleaned by the sweat of our own brows on our own land ?
Will that be important to them ?
I hope so .
I have no idea what the future will hold .
But I know we will never stop fighting until this new nation can take its place among the old ones as an equal .
Empires come and go , nations rise and fall , but America – an idea more than a place – will always be with us .
Bloggers row is empty now .
They are striking the tables and chairs and the workers are giving me “ the eye , ” telling me it is time to go .
I ’m off to enlist in the Continental Army , to share the dangers and privations of this war with my friends and neighbors .
And one more reason to go off to war …
I have my own country to fight for .
Mr Mancini , my high school science teacher , grew a mustache when he began to dye his grey hair black .
The dye job progressed by degrees .
He was a little grey , then less grey .
Nobody noticed ; his mustache mesmerized us .
On the day Mr Mancini went all black , he shaved his mustache .
All we noticed when he bounced into the classroom was his big , smooth - shaven face .
He had to tell us that he ’d changed his hair .
As a man , he wanted to protect the secret of his vanity , but as a science teacher he felt morally obliged to explain the psychological trick he ’d played on us .
Good redesigns work like my teacher ’s hair .
They are always an opportunity to fix or change a lot of things that are n’t obvious on the pretty new surface .
Happy Cog has just redesigned .
It started with a sentence
The new version of Happy Cog ’s website had to better convey how our agency ’s business has diversified .
We are first and always designers for hire .
We are also publishers , whose micro-empire is expanding .
And we have lately co-founded a high - profile event series .
The old site told the “ design for hire ” story .
The redesign had to tell all three stories .
Usually this would be done by creating a navigation bar with labels like “ We design , ” “ We publish , ” and “ We present . ”
But labels do n’t connect ; they separate .
Navigation labels could point to three separate story - lines , but they would not make the case that ours was a holistic enterprise — that our conference , our publications , and our client services business were one .
For some time , I ’ve been thinking about the primacy of words in the user interface .
A sentence , I felt , could present our three businesses , and by its very nature , connect them in the reader ’s mind .
The primary navigation interface had to be a sentence .
And so it is .
The drawing board
One sentence led to another .
I found it easy to write the new Happy Cog and easy to spin an organic architecture out of the opening sentence .
But hell if I could design the thing .
I ’d always designed Happy Cog ; it was my baby ; but every time I opened Photoshop or took crayon to paper , the results were a muddle .
Maybe it was because my brain was barreling along on architecture and copy .
Or maybe there are only so many times a single designer can take a new look at the same site .
I tapped Jason Santa Maria ( or maybe he tapped me ) .
Jason has one of the keenest minds and two of the freshest eyes in the business .
He makes legibility beautiful .
What the Ramones did with three chords , he does with two system fonts .
His designs always spring from the user and the brand proposition .
His first effort sucked .
( I was secretly relieved . )
A month later , Jason came back with pretty much the design you now see at happycog.com .
( I rejoiced . )
The painting at the top , which makes the design , is by A List Apart illustrator Kevin Cornell .
The group
We fleshed out all the pages in Photoshop or as “ copy wireframes ” and then called on Happy Cog ’s Daniel Mall to create lean , semantic markup , beautifully optimized style sheets , and all required PHP and JavaScript contraptions .
Dan also set up the WordPress blog .
Dan is as good as anyone I ’ve worked with .
He is super - fast yet also deeply thoughtful .
We spent many a mini-session debating such things as whether the About page and its subsidiaries should include microformats .
We decided not .
Mark
Huot migrated the new site , a job that involved considerable strategy as well as expertise .
Rob Weychert contributed additional art direction and Jon Aldinger offered additional programming .
The redesign tells our story and gives us room to breathe and grow .
It is also ( I think ) quite pretty and thoroughly appropriate .
We hope you like it , and we invite you to subscribe to Happy Cog ’s RSS feed to stay abreast of all matters Coggish .
Other perspectives
Jason Santa Maria and Daniel Mall have written their perspectives on the Happy Cog redesign .
They ’re swell !
Jason ’s writeup includes information about the Happy Cog Philadelphia Open House , featuring the live music of Comhaltas .

Almost every US patent contains at least one mistake , according to new research .
The vast majority are trivial errors , most of them the fault of the USPTO ; but two per cent of the patents examined were found to contain serious mistakes that weakened the core claims .
The findings come from Intellevate , a firm that offers support services to intellectual property lawyers , such as prior art searching and patent proofreading , from facilities in Minneapolis and India .
Proofreading is an important last step in the process of obtaining a patent because it can identify errors that can affect the patent ’s enforceability .
Intellevate announced last Friday that its Indian office has just proofread its 5,000th issued patent .
According to Leon Steinberg , Intellevate ’s CEO : " We find errors in every issued patent we review .
Many of the errors are unimportant , but others , such as missing claim , can impair the enforceability of the patent .
We identify the errors so that our clients can decide if they want to file a Certificate of Correction . "
Intellevate reported that Certificates of Correction were filed for an estimated 34 per cent of the proofread patents .
Most law firms consider proofreading as a necessary step to reduce their malpractice exposure .
Sophisticated corporations view proofreading as the final step in controlling the quality of their patents and ensuring enforceability .
However , proofreading is time - consuming and can be expensive .
It involves checking the issued patent , which can be hundreds of pages long , against the filed application and all amendments .
In addition to being time consuming and usually costly , it is often a lacklustre task that many law firms and legal departments would rather not have to take on .
For this reason , Intellevate says proofreading is the perfect activity to perform off - shore .
" Intellevate has developed proprietary tools that automate part of the proofreading process and has built a team of legal assistants in India who are thoroughly trained and specialise in proofreading services , " said Steinberg .
" These capabilities , combined with the lower wage rates in India , allow Intellevate to provide clients a vastly superior work product at a fraction of the cost of proofreading on - shore . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Undercover investigators , working for a fake firm , obtained a license to buy enough radioactive material to build a “ dirty bomb , ” amid little scrutiny from federal regulators , according to a government report obtained on Wednesday .

Undercover investigators , working for a fake firm , obtained a license to buy enough radioactive material to build a " dirty bomb , " amid little scrutiny from federal regulators , according to a government report obtained on Wednesday .

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued the license to the dummy company in just 28 days with only a cursory review , the Government Accountability Office said in a report to be released on Thursday .
The GAO , which set up the sting , said the NRC approved the license after a couple of faxes and phones calls and then mailed it to the phony company ’s headquarters -- a drop box at a United Parcel Service location .
“ From the date of application to the issuance of the license , the entire process lasted 28 days , ” the GAO said .
“ GAO investigators essentially obtained a valid materials license from the NRC without ever leaving their desks . ”
The NRC oversees the U.S. nuclear industry and nuclear material safety issues .
The GAO report said its undercover agents made counterfeit copies of the license , changed the wording to remove restrictions on how much they were allowed to buy and then ordered enough radiological materials to build a dirty bomb .
The GAO , a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress , said its investigators did not take possession of the radiological materials .
U.S. officials have warned that militant groups , including al Qaeda , could use conventional explosives and material from sources as common as hospital X - ray departments to build so - called dirty bombs that could spread radioactive waste across urban centers .
The GAO sting was requested by a Senate panel that has been exploring post - September 11 security gaps in the U.S. government ’s regulation of radioactive material .
The senior Republican on the panel , Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota , said the panel found the NRC was issuing licenses for “ dangerous ” level materials before visiting facilities making the applications .
“ The NRC ’s first visit to the facilities could be up to one year after the license was issued .
That ’s like handing out a gun license and waiting a year to do the background check , ” Coleman said in a statement .
The GAO recommended the NRC improve its process for examining license applications for radioactive materials and explore ways to prevent the counterfeiting of licenses .
A short story
A man piloting a hot air balloon discovers he has wandered off course and is hopelessly lost .
He descends to a lower altitude and locates a man down on the ground .
He lowers the balloon further and shouts “ Excuse me , can you tell me where I am ? ”
The man below says : “ Yes , you ’re in a hot air balloon , about 30 feet above this field . ”
“ You must work in Information Technology , ” says the balloonist .
“ Yes I do , ” replies the man .
“ And how did you know that ? ”
“ Well , ” says the balloonist , “ what you told me is technically correct , but of no use to anyone . ”
The man below says , “ You must work in management . ”
“ I do , ” replies the balloonist , “ how did you know ? ”
“ Well , ” says the man , “ you do n’t know where you are , or where you ’re going , but you expect my immediate help .
You ’re in the same position you were before we met , but now it ’s my fault ! ”
Simon Caulkin writes a management column in the Observer , a UK - based paper , and has written a couple columns that draw on ideas from Hard Facts .
His first one , back in March , has the kind charming title that you do n’t get in the states “ Bosses in Love with Claptrap and Blinded by Ideologies . ”
Caulkin recently wrote a column called “ You Could be a Genius - If Only You had a Good System , ” which draws a bit on our chapter on talent in Hard Facts .
He uses recent examples of failures by British sporting teams to show how coaches and critics focus on “ naming and shaming ” individual athletes , rather than on problems with the system .
This tendency to look for individual goats – and heroes – is n’t just a problem that permeates the world of sports .
It is reflected in many misguided ideologies and management practices , which focus excessive energy on hiring stars and weeding - out mediocre and poor performers , and insufficient energy on building a great system that enables most competent people to succeed .
I agree – and can show you evidence – that there are huge differences in individual skill and ability in every occupation .
BUT we ’ve also got a lot of evidence that ordinary people can perform at top levels in a well - designed system , and even a superstar is doomed to fail in a bad system .
Unfortunately , HR and too many other executives believe the advice in books like The War For Talent .
( In fact , one of the authors is now head of HR at eBay .. perhaps another reason to short the stock ) .
This is one of the worst management books ever written in my opinion :
There is bad evidence from the authors ’ own research , no mention of a massive body of research that contradicts many of their claims , and excessive claims are made that if leaders follow the authors ’ advice , they can expect “ expect a huge impact in a year . ”
I will focus on just one claim from this bad book .
I quote the authors , “ We call it the Rule of Crappy People : Bad managers hire very , very bad employees , because they are threatened by anyone who is anywhere near as good as they are . ”
This claim is bold , but ca n’t be supported by any systematic research that I can find .
There is evidence that people hire others like themselves , so a reasonable inference is that crappy people will hire equally crappy people -- but there is no direct evidence on that hypothesis .
I spent weeks and weeks trying to find even a hint that a single article in a peer reviewed journal supported the belief that bad performers systematically hire even worse performers .
It is one of those management myths that do n’t appear to have any empirical basis .
The worst part about focusing on keeping out crappy people , however , is that it reflects a belief system that “ the people make the place . ”
The implication is that , once you hire great people and get rid of the bad ones , your work is pretty much done .
Yet if you look at large scale studies in everything from automobile industry to the airline industry , or look at Diane Vaughn ’s fantastic book on the space shuttle Challenger explosion and the well - crafted report written by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board , the evidence is clear :
The “ rule of law crappy systems ” trumps the “ rule of crappy people . ”
Sure , people matter a lot , but as my colleague Jeff Pfeffer puts it , some systems are so badly designed that when smart people with a great track record join them , it seems as if a “ brain vacuum ” is applied , and they turn incompetent .
Jeff often jokes that this is what happens to many business school deans , and indeed , these jobs have so many competing and conflicting demands that they are often impossible to do well .
If you want to see a more chilling and systematic analysis , read the chapter by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that compares the Challenger explosion with the Columbia accident .
Sally Ride , the first American woman in space , comments about the “ remarkable echoes ” of the Challenger accident that can be seen in the Columbia fiasco .
Indeed , there was close to 100 % turnover at NASA between the two accidents , but the system was largely unchanged .
According to the report ( which is more useful and better written than most management books ) , NASA remained a dysfunctional bureaucracy where , rather than deferring to people with the greatest expertise , administrators believed that “ an allegiance to hierarchy , procedure , and following the chain of command ” decreased the odds of failure .
People with greater power ignored and stifled , and overturned recommendations people with more expertise but less power .
As a result , the Board warned “ NASA ’s problems cannot be solved simply by retirements , resignations , or transferring personnel . ”
As we discuss in Hard Facts , an interesting contrast is The U.S. civil aviation system .
It is one the safest in the world and has become even safer over time , partly because of its accident and incident reporting system .
This system permits pilots ( and others ) to report incidents to the Federal Aviation Administration such as near misses and equipment problems .
The agency follows up on these reports and takes action to repair root causes of problems .
There are smart people in both the FAA and NASA ( in fact , people from NASA run key parts of the accident reporting system ) , but one system is difficult to succeed in because it is crappy .
And the other is comparatively easy to succeed in because it is well designed .
Again , I still believe that people matter .
The very best organizations have both smart people and well - designed systems – Google seem to qualify and so does Cisco .
Unintentionally sexual comic book covers : part 1
I was going through a stash of old comic books the other day , when I came across several that seemed a bit odd ; not in the sense that the comics were strange or unique , but rather , because beneath the seemingly innocent veil of child - like artwork was a subtle nod towards debauchery .
The artists who created these covers probably never meant for them to to be used as spank fodder , but being the mean - spirited , immature , asshole that I am , I 've decided to do the only thing that a grown adult would do : point out juvenile observations of unintentionally sexual acts on comic book covers .
1 . Moon Pilot
The caption on the cover suggests that the comic is about an astronaut who crash lands his rocket into a spongy yield of hot alien vagina .
The picture , however , suggests a completely different story .
Now , I 'm no expert on primate facial expressions , but I think the look on the monkey 's face can best be described as : concerned .
Of course , I too would be concerned if a moon - bound astronaut mistook me for being a girl from outer space and wanted to make sweet love to my monkey butt .
And maybe I 'm reading too much into this , but you can only see one of the astronaut 's arms on the cover .
I 'll let you connect the dots , but I can say this much : I 've only seen a grin like that on a man 's face one other time , and my parents made sure to lock the door from that day on .
2 . Blek le Roc
This is a French comic that comes from an artist whose work first appeared in a magazine called " Pim , Pam , Poum , Pipo " ( a name considered pompous even by French standards ) .
The cover depicts a jubilant young male wielding a giant , burgeoning , meat staff , beating some poor schlub senseless over the head .
I shudder to think how the story would unfold from this point , but I think one could safely assume that it would involve : lubrication , limping , and the humiliation associated with being raped by a giant slab of salami ( if any ) .
3 . Superboy
When I came across this comic , I was surprised to find not one , but two covers depicting Superboy as a whipped - ass bondage slave :
Of course , the spanking on the cover implies that Superboy has indeed done something to earn the title of a " bad boy ; " perhaps in between brief stints of preventing robbers from burglarizing booty , Superboy was caught robbing booty from burglars .
Whatever the misdeed , his father has taken it upon himself to spank Superboy 's pasty white ass raw , in what can only be concluded as an attempt to debase the puritan moral code of its time with depraved sadomasochism .
4 . The Rifleman
You could arrange a boy holding a pile of wood , and a cowboy staring knowingly into his eyes all day long and not get a more suggestive pose than this .
For the sake of critical analysis , I 've decided to make a silhouette of just the cowboy and the logs shown here :
It 's every man 's dream to have a penis so large that he must hire a small boy to carry it .
5 . Tarzan
I can only imagine the condition of a society in which a comic featuring wet , well - trimmed , virile young man gazing romantically in a monkey 's eyes could be published without raising some serious red flags .
A closer inspection of the monkey 's face tells an unspoken story of forceful , untamed monkey love :
The monkey is seen here massaging its neck , perhaps in duress from the pain caused by having blood vessels ruptured in the back of its throat , undoubtedly from eating a banana too quickly ; either that or wang .
That 's it for part 1 .
I just bought a new keyboard , so if you 're wondering when part 2 will be posted , feel free to email me so I can break in my delete key .
5,438,198 comic book covers were engineered with the intent to subvert the innocence of children .

Last Friday , the impossible happened and a lifelong dream came true :
The 4 - Hour Workweek hit # 1 on the New York Times bestseller list !
Thank you all for your incredible encouragement and support .
More unbelievable , this week 4HWW is simultaneously # 1 on the NY Times and # 1 on the Wall Street Journal business bestseller lists .
How is this possible ?
How could a book from a first - time author — with no offline advertising or PR — hit both of these lists and stick for three months and counting ?
The book was turned down by 13 of 14 editors , and the president of one large book wholesaler even sent me PDFs on historical stats to “ reset my expectations ” –it could never be a bestseller .
The odds seem impossible : there are more than 200,000 books published each year in the US , and less than 5 % ever sell more than 5,000 copies .
On a given bestseller list , more than 5 spots could be occupied by unbeatable bestsellers like Good to Great or The Tipping Point , which have been on the lists for years .
On a related note , how could a blog that did n’t exist six months ago now be # 2,835 on Technorati with 874 incoming links and an Alexa ranking of 9,615 ?
Is it all luck ?
I do n’t think so .
Luck and timing play a ( sometimes big ) part , but it seems to me that one can still analyze the game and tilt the odds in their favor .
I do n’t claim to have all of the answers –I still know very little about publishing –but I ’ve done enough micro-testing in the last year to fill a lifetime .
The conclusion , in retrospect , is simple …
It all came down to learning how to spread a “ meme “ , an idea virus that captures imaginations and takes on a life of its own .
First , let ’s looks at how the bestseller status unfolded .
Here are the stats and timing for all of the bestseller lists the 4HWW has hit since release date on April 24 , 2007 .

Those of you who have been here for a while know that I ’m fanatical about analytics and imitating good models ( in the business sense , not the Naomi Campbell sense ) .
Before I began writing 4HWW ( I sold it before I wrote it , which I explain here ) , I cold - contacted and interviewed close to a dozen best - writing authors about their writing processes , followed by close to a dozen best - selling authors about their marketing and PR campaigns .
I asked several questions of the latter group , but one of the assumption - busting homeruns was :
“ What were the 1 - 3 biggest wastes of time and money ? ”
This led me to create a “ not - to - do ” list .
Number one was no book touring or bookstore signings whatsoever .
Not a one .
All of the best - selling authors warned against this author rite of passage .
I instead focused on the most efficient word - of - mouth networks in the world at the time–blogs .
The path to seeding the ideas of 4HWW was then straight - forward :
* Go where bloggers go
* Be there with a message and a story that will appeal to their interests , not yours
* Build and maintain those relationships through your own blog too
These three observations are from PR pundit Steve Rubel ’s excellent summary of the 4HWW launch on Micro - Persuasion , titled “ The 4 - Hour Workweek – Behind the Meme . ”
Interested to know which events I chose and what the Amazon and Technorati numbers looked like at each step ?
Check it all out here .
For a good take on my blogging approaches , both as a book author and blog writer , see my multi-part interviews with Darren Rowse over at Problogger .
net :
Part 1 – from the day prior to the official publication date ( good for seeing how I prepped the market )
Part 2 – from about one weeks ago , after hitting the big lists ( good for learning how I ’ve built traffic )
4HWW created enough noise online that it was then picked up by offline media ranging from Wired and Outside magazines to Martha Stewart radio and The Today Show .
To create a fast - acting meme , I ’ve come to believe that you need to do a few things well .
Here are the highlights , ordered to recreate the familiar acronym PPC with a certain Don King - esque flavor :
1. Phenomenize :
Identify and name a legitimate societal shift or new phenomenon .
To best spread a message or product , sell around it by discussing larger issues surrounding its creation : the person ( me in this case ) , the changing social landscape , and emerging trends .
No one cares about your new software , but the reasons it needs to exist might make for a great TV segment on 20/20 .
Naturally , the software would be mentioned .
Mission accomplished without the hard sell .
2. Polarize :
Good stories and trend - spotting , told unapologetically , will create both supporters ( “ That ’s the solution ! ” ) and attackers ( “ It ’s a fraud ! ” ) .
The battle and ongoing debate this generates is the fuel needed for word - of - mouth wildfire .
Do n’t piss people off for the sake of offending , but do n’t sacrifice the edge of your message to avoid offending .
My discussion of personal outsourcing , as one example , gets people hot and bothered .
Good .
I just want as many people as possible asking the important questions I believe can change the world .
Love me or hate me , I just want a strong unadulterated response .
3. Communitize :
Help create base camps for believers .
Organic communities grow fastest when natural leaders are identified and encouraged to become leaders .
I fostered reader - only communities on the forums of the official book site , but I also encouraged readers ( see the bottom of the post here ) to create their own tribes on the social networking site Ning .
This is how more than 22 demographic tribes ( I call them “ demotribes ” ) came to be , including “ 4HWW for Programmers , ” “ 4HWW for Families , ” and “ 4HWW for Students . ”
Do you want to create your own bestseller , whether a book or a product ?
Here are a few closing thoughts :
1 . To make a bestseller , there are more customers than just your customers :
Selling to the end - user is just one piece of the puzzle .
In my case , I needed to first sell myself to the publisher to get marketing support and national retail distribution .
I then learned that a mention from an A - list blogger might sell thrice as much on Amazon as a national TV appearance , but the latter is what drives book chains to purchase more books and give better placement .
2. Distribution can make you a juggernaut … or it can kill the best product :
The more books there are on shelves , the more will be sold .
Once you get to the level of The Secret and have 40 - 100 copies in many stores , managers have almost no choice but to put them in prime real estate like front - of - store , end caps , or front window .
If the top chains increase prime placement of 4HWW this month , I can virtually guarantee that sales will at least double in the next 3 months ( especially with some of the crazier things I have planned ) .
No exaggeration .
For my next book , if I write one , I ’ll spend much more time strategizing distribution and placement upfront .
Could you offer an exclusive to the 800 - lb. gorilla distributor in your industry in exchange for favorable payment terms , prime placement nationwide , and in - store merchandising ?
3. Marketing can grab customers , but product multiplies them :
Clever marketing and PR stunts can get customers … but only for so long .
It ’s the product that will create long - term word - of - mouth and the groundswell needed for a global phenomenon .
Do n’t save your best for volume two .
I asked myself the following while writing the 4HWW : “ If I were hit by a bus the day after I turned in the manuscript , would I be happy with this as my legacy ? ” I held nothing back and spared no details .
I ’m no Tolstoy , but I did my best .
The manuscript was cut from about 420 pages to the 300 in the final product .
One editor who turned the book down looked at the planned table of contents and said “ You have five books here .
Why not split it up ? ” Because of the bus .
Have a focus , but do n’t save the best for later .
There is only one chance to make a publishing first impression .
Remember : marketing might be important , but product is ultimately king .
###
Last but not least , remember : Just because they say it ca n’t be done does n’t make it so .
Just because it ’s labeled “ impossible ” does n’t make it even remotely impossible .
Do your homework , micro-test like a mother , and trust your conclusions .
You could be wrong , and you often will be , but … what if you ’re right ?
But what if you ’re right ?

The clash we are witnessing around the world is not a clash of religions , or a clash of civilizations .
It is a clash between two opposites , between two eras .
It is a clash between a mentality that belongs to the Middle Ages and another mentality that belongs to the 21st century .
It is a clash between civilization and backwardness , between the civilized and the primitive , between barbarity and rationality .
The Prophet of Islam said : " I was ordered to fight the people until they believe in Allah and His Messenger . "
When the Muslims divided the people into Muslims and non-Muslims , and called to fight the others until they believe in what they themselves believe , they started this clash , and began this war .
In order to start this war , they must re-examine their Islamic books and curricula , which are full of calls for takfir and fighting the infidels .
What civilization on the face of this earth allows him to call other people by names that they did not choose for themselves ?
Once , he calls them Ahl Al - Dhimma , another time he calls them the " People of the Book , " and yet another time he compares them to apes and pigs , or he calls the Christians " those who incur Allah 's wrath . "
Who told you that they are " People of the Book " ?
They are not the People of the Book , they are people of many books .
All the useful scientific books that you have today are theirs , the fruit of their free and creative thinking .
The Jews have come from the tragedy ( of the Holocaust ) , and forced the world to respect them , with their knowledge , not with their terror , with their work , not their crying and yelling .
Humanity owes most of the discoveries and science of the 19th and 20th centuries to Jewish scientists .
15 million people , scattered throughout the world , united and won their rights through work and knowledge .
We have not seen a single Jew blow himself up in a German restaurant .
We have not seen a single Jew destroy a church .
We have not seen a single Jew protest by killing people .
The Muslims have turned three Buddha statues into rubble .
We have not seen a single Buddhist burn down a Mosque , kill a Muslim , or burn down an embassy .
Only the Muslims defend their beliefs by burning down churches , killing people , and destroying embassies .
This path will not yield any results .
The Muslims must ask themselves what they can do for humankind , before they demand that humankind respect them .
Hmm , how is she a hero ?
to those that will bother to learn :
i WATCHED this clip on Al Jazeera itself , and guess what , EVERY point she said was replied to , and after a certain point , she changed her tone ... do n't take memri seriously cause it 's biased EVEN in words translated .
anywho , here are some points to those that 'll bother to read :
1- This clip is incomplete , there 's a HUGE part that 's NOT in there , where SHE ended up looking like an idiot and changing her tone because she knew what she was saying was wrong .
memri is VERY selective , notice the cuts in the video .
2- If you think stuff like this does n't come on Al jazeera and other arab channels all the time , you 're kidding me ... you need to follow arab tv more before you critize it ... believe it or not , Al - Jazeera was Bush 's pal before they broadcasted something bush did n't like .
Yay .
3- secondly mistranslations from memri such as " woman as a beast , no , woman as a mule " " are you a heretic , no , are you an Atheist " " secular , no , science believer " " i'm a secular person that does not believe in spirtual things , no , i am a science beleving woman that does not believe in anything paranormal " memri is VERY selective in translations to invoke even more anger .
especially the heretic point , since he was n't insulting her , he was asking her if she was an atheist or not .
( and additon i'm just adding , he was saying that if she was an atheist , then there is no blame on her of committing blasphemy , which actually SHOWS civility )
4- other than her points , which mostly DON " T make sense and which SHE HERSELF retracted afterwards ( in the part you do n't see ) it 's obvious by anyone that knows arabic is that her Arabic is NOT native , it 's TAUGHT as a second or third language .
any phonetics expert could tell that .
5- it 's obvious she has n't been in most of the muslim countries lately if she thinks we 're backwards and living in some sort of " repression and ignorance " do yourself a favor , do a search on Melody tv and / or singers such as the egyptain " ruby " the lebanese " nancy agram " and a zillion others , or do a search for arabic movies from even the 1950's and before .
6 - she opposes that muslims refer to non-muslims with names they have n't chosen , well then she should be offended by the term ' goy ' , ' gentiles ' , ' unenlightened ' and whatever term christians use or used to denote non christians ... and do n't even CLAIM they did n't exist , because guess what , christians thought non christians were barbarians and savages and that 's why there were missionaries , you know who else thought they needed to bring enlightment to others ?
the japanese when they invaded and buthchered china .
anywho , for the terms she opposes ;
a- " Ahl el Beit " directly means " people of the house " meaning wise means : people of the house of God .
b- " ahl el kotob " directly means " people of the book " meaning wise means : people of the books of God , i.e people who believe in one of the holy books ( torah , Enjeel , Qu'ran ) .
c- " ahl el Dhimma " directly means " people of Concience " meaning wise means : people who have concience .
d- " el nasara " directly means " the victory helpers " meaning wise : " those who saved the Muslims " or " those that stood by the muslims " in islamic history , when the Prophet Mohammed and his followers were being attacked and killed in Mecca , they left for Madina , Madina was a Christian City , and the people of Madina helped the Prophet and the muslims , and they shared their houses and Bread , el Nasara is a term used to show how much islam LOVES these people .
so far , the above three names AREN " T in any way offensive ... now let 's see what she says that SEEMS offensive :
a- " El Maghdoob 3alehom " ( 3 denotes a sound unavalible in english ) : directly means :" those that are angered upon " meaning wise : " those that God frowns upon , or God is angry at " HOWEVER , this word is NOT used to refer to christians or jews , or even ANYONE in particular , it is used to refer to those that have gone astray and God is angry at , it 's part of a prayer that basically is asking God not to be one of those Gone astray ... not so evil sounding now is it ?
b- " el khanzeer we 'll Korooud " : " the monkeys and pigs " ( both translations ) : Everyone attacks this point for existing ...
HOWEVER what they do n't understand , YES it exists in the Qu'ran but it 's telling part of a story .
In the story , Some people angered God so God turned them to Pigs and Monkeys .
and yes these people WERE jews .
however this story is a story that PREDATES Islam by eons , and it's not used to riducle or attack jews , it 's used to show that EVEN followers of God can anger God if they disobey him .
in this vein i guess everyone should attack both the bible and the Qu'ran for having mass genocide ( Noah 's Flood ) .
are these words used in a bad way ?
Yes , sometimes by some people THEY ARE USED , but then again , so is the term Sand Nigger .
i can't recall what other names she was " angry at "
7- in NO part of Islam does it call to " Fight non muslims until they believe " in fact , in Part of the Qu'ran , The Prophet was sad that he could n't get everyone to believe in God , and God told him " I ordered you to Preach to them , NOT to force or convert them , if you can go into the deepest earths or highest heavens , to find something that would make them believe , then do so , If i willed , i would make everyone a believer . "
YAY FOR MISINFORMATION !
i hope the above passage cleared up the view of " FORCING " someone into a religon , which DOESN " T EXIST in islam .
and umais already said , it 's spreading in europe and the usa and other western cultures ... is anyone FORCING them to convert ?
8- Muslims started a culture clash or a clash of civilizations ?
really ?
hmm , that 's odd ... i thought people were doing that for centuries and ages and ages .... even before the existance of muslims .... hmm ... anyone care to clarify to me how this is even possible ?
is it a time paradox of some sort ?
did some muslim guy invent a time machine or something ?
9 - as for saying " they 're people of all scientific books " yeah , go ahead and ignore all the arab and muslim influences on science ... in fact go ahead and ignore the MUSLIM egyptain scientist called " Ahmed Zoweil " who 's researches have more or less changed physics for the past few years .
yeah .
10 - As for her point that no jews burn embassies or kill germans ... some probably did , but other than that , did she point out that they 've killed and bombed arabs and their holy places ?
Maybe she is secular , but she is misinformed in her suggestions that The arabic and muslim world has n't added anything to the worlds of science .
Perhaps not so much in the modern world but they paved the way , pretty much all modern maths ( algebra and further concepts of greek geometry ) originated in the mid east .
Now on her statement that other peoples ( christians , buddhists and jews were what she mentioned ) do n't commit attrocities for their religions and specifically the Jews who have achieved everything with hardwork and perserverence rather than complaining and murder ;
The creation of Israel is the bloodiest blackest event in Jewish history .
Not only did they conduct an incredibly violent hostile takeover in 1948 after they were eventually awarded a state , before that time they committed acts of terrorism both in the mid east and on the King David Hotel ( a British fortress in Jerusalem ) to muscle their way into Palestine .
Another main pivotal argument for the creation of Israel , the rights and respect attained by jews as the speaker suggested , was the holocaust .
It is known that the Zionist movement used the holocaust as leverage and continue to defend their actions and label anyone who questions them as antisemetic .
If 50 years ago is too long ago to consider Jewish terrorism as significant then consider everyday of the time since then .
Israelis broke into [ ' Israelis ' is wrong , I believe he 's referring to Baruch Goldstein ] a mosque not too long ago and sprayed hundreds of bullets into the place murdering many not so long ago is just one such example of terror comitted in the name of Israel .
Christians are n't much better , from the Crusades where they roasted babies up to the conflict in Ireland and one can even argue American foreign policy today is Christian aggression .
also be sure not to ignore the recent attack on a church by 3 israeli's ( one jewish ) ( there 's an article i posted about it on shoutwire ) , the attack on people PRAYING at the Aqsa mosque , the uss liberty , the borrowing that 's threatening to make the Aqsa mosque collapse and a million other such attacks ...
Yes i know not all jews have done this , but hey , since she 's generlizing i might as well do the same !
11 - Islam says Judgement lies with God only ... which is why there is a story in the Qu'ran about a brother that was constently praying , and another that was n't ... the one that was praying went to his brother and told him that he 's going to go to hell , in the end it was the brother that was praying all the time that went to hell because he had done more evil even though he was praying at the same time .
12 - she is not an atheist , she is a Coptic Christian .
[ She 's defended Copts publicly but is a Syrian of Muslim background ]
She 's well known in egypt .
13 - in the videoclip , in arabic , she ATTACKED ALL MUSLIMS , and supported ALL Jews , she did NOT single out extremists in islam .
One message said : " Oh , you are still alive ?
Wait and see . "
She received an e-mail message the other day , in Arabic , that said , " If someone were to kill you , it would be me . "
Dr. Sultan said her mother , who still lives in Syria , is afraid to contact her directly , speaking only through a sister who lives in Qatar .
She said she worried more about the safety of family members here and in Syria than she did for her own .
" I have no fear , " she said .
" I believe in my message .
It is like a million - mile journey , and I believe I have walked the first and hardest 10 miles . "
The clash we are witnessing around the world is not a clash of religions , or a clash of civilizations .
It is a clash between two opposites , between two eras .
It is a clash between a mentality that belongs to the Middle Ages and another mentality that belongs to the 21st century .
It is a clash between civilization and backwardness , between the civilized and the primitive , between barbarity and rationality .
It is a clash between freedom and oppression , between democracy and dictatorship .
It is a clash between human rights , on the one hand , and the violation of these rights , on other hand .
It is a clash between those who treat women like beasts , and those who treat them like human beings .
What we see today is not a clash of civilizations .
Civilizations do not clash , but compete .
This is the first installment in a new series on Blovi - blog .
Every couple of weeks I 'll be featuring a new .
The militants and fundamentalists steal all the limelight , while the challengers of the orthodoxy usually only garner attention when someone is trying to kill them .
In that light , the R.A.H. will be dedicated to highlighting all the Muslim dissenters and critics out there .
Some of these people are quite articulate and perceptive , some are n't .
But the all of them deserve some respect for promoting open debate about religion in the Muslim world .
My first profile is a rising star in the arena of critical debate on Islam , Wafa Sultan .
In the last week or so , the video of her controversial interview on Al - Jazeera has been spending a lot of time zipping around the fiber - optic arteries of cyberspace .
You can find Wafa Sultan 's famous Al - Jazeera appearance here .
Here is a link to the transcript of her Al - Jazeera appearance on the M.E.M.R.I. website .
Here 's are some of the more interesting remarks she made in the debate : Wafa apparently chose her words to be as provocative as possible for the Al - Jazeera audience .
She passionately states her case and it's pretty obvious there 's a great deal of anger behind what she says .
If nothing else , you have to admire this woman 's courage to assert her taboo opinions so openly .
By openly stating such controversial views she is sure to have generated some debate in the Arab world .
She does raise some valid points about the barbarity of religiously - motivated violence , it 's prevalence in Islam today , and the orthodox ideas that perpetuate them .
In traditional Muslim societies where this sort of debate is forbidden , this may be the first time they 've heard an Arab woman openly make such arguments .
However , much of what she says is overblown rhetoric , and of course it 's completely one - sided .
I came across this interesting rebuttal to the M.E.M.R.I video and transcript of her appearance on a Desicritics discussion thread ( scroll to the bottom of the page , comment # 18 ) .
I do n't agree with all of the points , the posts author occassionaly resorts to Wafa - style rhetorical tactics at points and makes a spurious claim about her being a Coptic Christian .
Nonentheless , I found the points about the translation and editing of the debate by M.E.M.R.I , and the misrepresentation of the Quranic passages Wafa makes reference to in the debate to support her claims to be very valid points .
The point about M.E.M.R.I. being biased has been reiterated by Juan Cole and Dr. Bhaskar Dasgupta .
M.E.M.R.I. has a very strong presence on the internet but undeniably has a strong pro-Israel agenda .
Not exactly the most balanced source of information on the Arab media .
The NYTimes wrote a somewhat sympathetic piece on Wafa .
In it we learn that the killing of one her professors during a vicious anti-Baathist uprising by Muslim militants is the key event that precipitated her questioning of Islam .
By the way , this was a vicious uprising on both sides in which Syria 's dictator at the time Hafez Al - Assad killed some 10000 - 40000 dissidents .
You can find a somewhat more critical article about Wafa in the LA Times .
According to the NYTimes piece she 's already received some death threats .
While she 's certainly captured a great deal of attention with her provocative statements , will her message have much resonance in the Muslim world ?
She 's won a lot of admirers in the West .
One of the many Western blogs bravely ' standing on guard for the free world against Islamofascism ' has proclaimed her to be the first Muslim Voltaire .
Maybe just a tad premature ? ;-)
After all Voltaire was a highly regarded intellectual before he ever took on the Christian establishment , was an outstanding scholar of Christianity , and wrote an enormous amount - he wrote over 20000 letters alone not to mention books , pamplets , novels etc .
( he would have been a kick - ass blogger ) .
Given that Wafa was born in the middle - east and is fluent in Arabic , she certainly has more credibility than some other ' Westernized ' critics of orthodox Islam such as Irshad Manji .
She has also won some praise from a few secular Muslims .
However , I 'm quite certain the majority of Muslims would interpret her message as nothing more than a full frontal assault on their fortress of faith .
In their eyes she probably comes across more as dangerously unbalanced , and a ' brainwashed sell - out ' , rather than rational and brave .
In the LA Times article she 's quoted as saying " I do n't believe you can reform Islam " .
Her message obviously is n't a constructive reformist one , nor is it truly one of religious tolerance .
It 's a strong athiest message , it is clear Wafa hopes to tear down the walls of a faith she 's come to despise .
Sometimes hearing this sort of message can be a good thing , it can help wake the great mass of slumbering and complascent believers .
On the other hand , this approach can backfire and end up provoking a vicious backlash .
Not to mention it helps to bolster some of the most unfair and one - sided anti-Islamic rhetoriticians that currently flourish in the West .
While she does raise very important points about the intolerance and rigidity plaguing contemporary Islam , in my view her repudiation of all things Muslim is driven as much by anger and hatred as it is by reason .
The website she started her career as a critic on Annaqed ( The Critic ) , is full of similar enraged anti-Muslim and pro-US rhetoric .
I 'm partial to a more cold - blooded and synthetic approach to debating the issues - I think it produces a lot more meaningful progress in the long run and less destructive backlash .
Even though I wished she toned down the rhetoric and took a more balanced approach , one has to admit her uber - confrontational style has stirred up some discussion among Muslims .
Unfortunately , since much of what she says is unbalanced and totally lacking in nuance , it will be easy for critics to pick apart her arguments and ultimately ignore what she has to say .
One of the things this interview clearly demonstrates is that Al - Jazeera is a genuine forum for democractic and open debate .
The accusation that they 're a mouthpiece for extremists is misleading at best .
They allow free debate like no other media outlet in the Arab world .
Occassionaly free debate is going to bring up some voices that people wo n't want to hear but that comes with territory .
Open Source recently had a very informative show on Al - Jazeera , you can find it here .
The debates were aired on the Al Jazeera show Al - Itijah Al - Mu'akis , Opposite Directions , a very provocative debate program hosted and put together by Dr. Faisal al - Qassim .
The show is notorious for getting extreme voices on different sides of very devisive issues .
Apparently this show is hugely popular and has a reputation for debating any issue , no subject or opinion is taboo- as demonstrated by the Sultan video .
Ironically , Opposite Directions has been the source of much of the ' unacceptable comments ' which have led to government censorship of Al Jazeera .
Not only in Iraq but in the West as well .
If the West is serious about encouraging free speech in the Muslim world it has to learn to tolerate shows like this .
Of course there 's going to be some people who espouse a militant Islamist perspective because it exists in the region , but at the same time there will be plenty of voices to argue a pro-Western and reformist ideas .
In the end , censorship ends up cutting off debate .
Religious status : Apostate , Secular humanistLocation : Syrian - born , Currently living in Los Angeles .
Raging Against the Mullahs Since : July , 2005 What Got Her R.A.H. Ball Rolling : Watching one of her professors being killed by militants from the Muslim Brotherhood .
Exposure Rating ( 0 - 10 ) : In the Muslim world - 5 In the West - 8 Likelihood of Influencing Muslim Reform ( 0 - 10 ) : 2 , she 's declared herself to be non-Muslim .
It 's not going to win her much influence among the devout majority .
Special Abilities : Talent for delivering a sustained , eloquent , and forceful rant in hostile territory .
Weaknesses : Too much hate behind her words .
One - sided , totally lacking in any nuance .
Possibly emotionally unstable and probably will allow the anti-Islamists fawning get to her head .
Most provocative quote to date :
Two ventures were taken up recently and both got a lot of attention .
They were very fascinating to me because of the results they brought about and the underlying implications .
They were similar in some ways and starkly contrasting in others .
The first venture was the one undertaken by Joel Spolsky , founder of a startup in the form of Project Aardvark .
He recruited a bunch of college interns , gave them a business idea and left them to create a complete software product from scratch .
The other venture was the Summer Founders Program by Paul Graham , startup founder and popular essayist .
His company , YCombinator invited business proposals from college grads and provided seed - funding to jumpstart their businesses .
Joel and Paul announced the results of their ventures recently and both were huge successes .
They had both proven that college kids , when given enough focus and support could produce industry - strength products .
But there was a lot of difference between their ventures .
Joel recruited kids with good grades from great schools .
He gave them a detailed specification of what was required and hosted them in his company 's office .
The project was promoted thru Joel 's blog .
The interns got paid a good stipend and one of them joined Fog Creek fulltime .
Compared to this , the Summer Founders Program was completely different .
The applicants were nothing like interns .
Anyone could apply , all they had to do was to come up with a business idea and convince an investor that it would work .
If selected , they were given some money and advice but nothing else .
They had to find their own office space and figure out their strategies .
Their stakes were much higher because the product they built was for their business , not for some company someone else owned .
I think this is the significant difference .
Working for oneself is the biggest motivator and an intern can never feel that way .
Though loosening of control can actually produce good products ( like in Project Aardvark ) , there is limited success to be achieved within companies .
Joel 's interns are either back at school or working in his company whereas Paul 's founders are receiving venture capital or recruiting employees for themselves .
For the interns , it must be a feeling of a job well done but for the founders , the work is only starting .
The other end sees the difference too .
Joel might feel good about the completed product , but will find it difficult to repeat the magic with another business idea .
Even office space cannot scale each summer .
Paul has already launched the winter founder 's program and is planning the next one too .
Paul 's multiple investments cover the risk of failed projects , has better promises in terms of startup equity while he would have spent lesser in seed capital than Joel did in intern stipend .
No wonder Joel is jealous :-)
It seems to be that Paul 's hypothesis on hiring is true after all .
Who would want to work for a company when they can start one ?
And it does n't seem like you need a lot of money to start a company .
Maybe this is the next big thing - nifty startups founded by bored employees .
Back in the day , Kevin Poulsen was one of my favorite investigative reporters .
He 's still got the chops , as this story in today 's Wired News proves .
Here 's a snip ; read the whole thing .
FBI agents trying to track the source of e-mailed bomb threats against a Washington high school last month sent the suspect a secret surveillance program designed to surreptitiously monitor him and report back to a government server , according to an FBI affidavit obtained by
Wired News .
*
* The court filing offers the first public glimpse into the bureau 's long - suspected spyware capability , in which the FBI adopts techniques more common to online criminals . *
The software was sent to the owner of an anonymous MySpace profile linked to bomb threats against Timberline High School near Seattle .
The code led the FBI to 15 - year - old Josh Glazebrook , a student at the school , who on Monday pleaded guilty to making bomb threats , identity theft and felony harassment .
*
* In an affidavit seeking a search warrant to use the software , filed last month in U.S. District Court in the Western District of
Washington , FBI agent Norman Sanders describes the software as a
" computer and internet protocol address verifier , " or CIPAV .
*
Sanders wrote that the spyware program gathers a wide range of information , including the computer 's IP address ; MAC address ; open ports ; a list of running programs ; the operating system type , version and serial number ; preferred internet browser and version ; the computer 's registered owner and registered company name ; the current logged - in user name and the last - visited URL . *
The CIPAV then settles into a silent " pen register " mode , in which it lurks on the target computer and monitors its internet use , logging the
IP address of every computer to which the machine connects for up to 60
days .
*
Under a ruling this month by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , such surveillance – which does not capture the content of the communications – can be conducted without a wiretap warrant , because internet users have no " reasonable expectation of privacy " in the data when using the internet .*
You ’ve built a product .
You think it ’s ready for real users .
How do you find out ?
You do usability testing .
This is a specialized discipline , and there are specialists out there who know what they are doing .
You should hire one of them to do usability tests on your product .
They will do a much better job than you can , and you will get much better results .
But if you can ’t , here ’s how to do it yourself .
Disclaimer : I ’m not a usability engineer , I ’m a software engineer .
But I ’ve been through a fair amount of usability testing , on both sides of the one - way mirrors .
I ’ve learned from some real usability gurus , like Kara Coyne .
So I know a little bit about how it is done .
As I said , you should really hire an expert to do this stuff for you .
There ’s lots of subtlety to doing it right .
Usability testing
Usability testing consists of having sample users use your product , and watching carefully what happens .
That ’s it .
It sounds simple , but there are right ways and wrong ways to go about it .
Why do you need usability testing ?
Your engineers ( or you ) may say , “ I do n’t need a usability test , I ’ve been using the software for months .
I know exactly what it does . ”
Your engineers are wrong .
Yes , they know what it does .
But they have no idea what a typical user will make of it .
Precisely because they ’ve been using the software for months , they ca n’t see it as a brand - new user would .
Features that seem to be straightforward and obvious can be exposed as confusing user traps with a little usability testing .
You need to know about the problems and fix them , and the best way to do it is with usability testing .
Planning
The first step in doing usability testing is planning .
It ’s easy to think that you can send your drinking buddies a URL to try the product , and then ask them what they thought .
You wo n’t get good feedback from them .
Much better is to take usability testing seriously and plan ahead .
Goals
The typical goal of usability testing is to find out what real users will find easy and hard in using your product .
The emphasis is on finding the hard stuff , since that is what you will have to fix .
Here ’s the mindset you need to have : imagine a real user of your product .
They are trying to use it to accomplish some task .
You wo n’t be there to help them with it .
If they ca n’t do what they want to do , they wo n’t use your product .
It ’s that simple .
The goal of usability testing is to simulate that user with you watching , so you can identify the bottlenecks and stumbling blocks in your product , and fix them .
Designing the test
The test itself consists of putting a user in front of your product .
But what are they going to actually do with it ?
They ’ll be unfamiliar with the product , and in an artificial setting .
Do n’t make them improvise .
When the test starts , your user wo n’t know what to do .
You need to give them a scenario ( why are they looking at your product ) , and a task ( what is it they are trying to do ) .
Then they ’ll feel directed and have something specific to do .
Let ’s say you ’re testing a word processor .
Rather than sitting them in front of a blank screen , give them a setting and a task .
Saying , “ Here ’s a document , reproduce it in this word processor ” is much better than “ OK , go ” .
Not only will creating a scenario put your user at ease , it gives you two advantages :
You can direct them to area of the product you specifically want tested .
This is especially true if you are testing a specific feature rather than the entire product .
You get a much more realistic test .
If the user types “ asdlk aslk aslk asldk ” into your word processor , they wo n’t have an interesting document to work on .
It wo n’t act like a real document of theirs , and they wo n’t feel like they ’re working on something real .
Finding users
Before you can find users for your tests , you need a model of who your real users are .
Who is your aimed at ?
High school students ?
Business executives ?
Engineers ?
Whoever it is , you want your test subjects need to be as close to those real users as possible .
Narrowing it down even further , what sort of problems do your real users have that you are going to help them solve ?
High school students who are struggling with foreign languages ?
Business executives looking for their next job ?
Engineers who ca n’t figure out if their product is usable ?
Ideally , your test subjects would have those problems too , but that ’s a bit much to ask for .
You can simulate the problems in the test scenario by asking your users to pretend that they have those problems , or think back to the last time they had them .
Anyone who closely models your target users will do for a test .
Natural candidates are friends , since you can ask favors of them .
Friends can be problematic , though :
They may be too polite to tell you what they really think .
They may also be software engineers , so they may overthink their responses .
On the other hand , you may be good enough friends that you can read their reactions more closely than a stranger’s .
Friends can be good subjects in spite of these factors , and they may be the only people at hand .
For any subject , you need to take into account how they are and are not like your target user .
Running the Test
The main thing to do during the test is listen and observe .
This is the hardest thing for engineers to do right .
The urge to help the user , and to show off your product , is huge .
But it is essential to shut up and listen in order to get good results .
The goal of the session is not to teach this one user how to use the product .
The goal is to find out how a typical user will fare when encountering your product for the first time .
You are n’t there to teach , you are there to learn .
This relationship seems backwards : you are an expert on the product , and the user has never seen it before , they know nothing about it !
That is their valuable commodity : innocence .
You need to learn how they see your creation without being tainted by your knowledge of it .
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes open .
Put the user at ease
When running the test be sure to let your subject know that they are not being tested .
People have a natural tendency to think that if they can’t figure out a piece of software , then they are stupid .
Not so , especially when the software is unfinished and undergoing usability testing .
So be sure to let them know up front that they can do no wrong and that they are not being tested , the software is .
Be nice to your subjects .
You are the host , and your user is a guest .
They are in an unfamiliar environment looking at an unfamiliar and probably confusing product .
Be as charming as you can be .
Being nice can be especially difficult when the test is n’t going well .
The user keeps getting stuck on the simplest things .
He misreads your carefully crafted prose , misinterprets your beautifully iconic gizmos .
He may even laugh when some particularly egregious bug rears its head .
Take a deep breath , and be nice .
They are doing you a huge favor .
Not only are they donating a significant chunk of time to your product ’s development , but they are showing you things you could n’t have found any other way .
What the user does
The user has two things to do during the test .
The first is pretty clear : use the product as you have directed them .
The second comes less naturally : let you know what they are thinking .
The ideal test subject will narrate their thoughts as they work through the tasks .
This is not a comfortable thing for users to do , especially when it comes to the most important parts of the test : the parts where they do n’t know how to do what they want , or where they get confused .
Try to make them comfortable with the idea of talking as they work .
Let them know again that they are n’t being tested .
You ’ll have to help the user to keep the stream of consciousness flowing .
Questions like , “ what are you working on , ” “ what do you see on the screen , ” or “ what are you looking for , ” can help get them talking again .
Observing
The most important thing for you to do is pay attention and know what the user is thinking .
As I described above , ask them what they are thinking , what they are looking at .
Watch their face when you can : eyebrows express a lot , surprise , consternation , and so on .
Listen to them talk .
When do they hesitate ?
Do n’t be afraid to ask follow - up questions .
If they are surprised , ask them what they thought would happen .
Ask them why they thought that ?
It may seem like too much probing , but users interpreting UIs will make lots of mental leaps that they wo n’t tell you about , even when they are trying to tell you everything going on in their heads .
And sometimes a small thing , probed further , can lead to an insight about what you ’ve built .
Recording
After observing , the most important thing for you to do is to record .
Ideally , you ’d have a video camera for the whole session .
Even better is what the professionals do : they record the screen and the user ’s face , so you can see exactly what the user was doing , and how they were reacting to it .
If you ca n’t video tape , at least take lots of notes .
Take down the user ’s exact words when you can .
Taking notes is hard because there ’s no way you ’ll be able to get everything down , and you ’ll end up asking the user to stop so you can catch up .
With video , you never have to worry about missing a step or losing something interesting .
Try to write down everything .
Seemingly uninteresting tangents can end at interesting points .
Getting stuck
If the user gets stuck , it ’s very tempting to tell them what to do .
Not only can you see the solution clearly ( “ it ’s right there ! ” ) , but you do n’t want them to feel frustrated , and you want to get on with more testing .
But it ’s important to find out more about their difficulty .
Ask them what they see on the screen .
Ask them to tell you what they ’re thinking as they look for the solution .
An ideal monologue goes something like ,
Well , I want to find a way to turn this chunk of text into a quote , but I do n’t see anything that looks right .
I see a button labeled “ B ” , maybe that ’s for blockquote , no that usually means “ bold ” .
I ’m looking over the toolbar , but everything there seems to be about colors and fonts .
I want the font italicized because it ’s a quote , but I need a quote - maker to do that , I do n’t want to italicize it myself ...
As the user describes the details of their thought process , you ’ll learn a lot about how your UI is being interpreted .
When designing the UI , you ’ll have made lots of guesses as to how users will attach semantics to everything on the screen .
Now you get to hear the mapping being worked out live , in detail .
Listen as hard as you can , and let the user work at it for a while , until they find the answer , or they are n’t saying anything interesting any more .
Even once they are completely out of ideas , do n’t tell them , “ Pull down the Format menu , and select Quote ” .
Instead , ask them , “ did you look in the menus ?
What did you see there ? ” or , “ I saw you opened the Format menu , what did you find there ?
Can you tell me about that ? ”
These are compromise questions : you are n’t giving the answer , but you ’re directing their attention in the right direction .
This lets you get a few more of their thoughts out into the open .
Eventually , you may have to help them out of a dead end .
This is OK .
You need to understand the situation they ’ve created well enough for your needs , and then move on so that you can cover other aspects of the product with your users .
You ’ll have to strike your own balance between wringing the most out of a situation , and making progress through the test you planned .
Questions
At times , the user will turn to you with a direct question .
Do n’t answer them .
Turn the question to your advantage .
For example , they may ask , “ Will it make a two - column table of contents ? ” Instead of responding , “ Sure , you just go here and here ” , you can ask , “ Do you want it to ? ” , or , “ How would you think you ’d go about doing that ? ”
The user wants information about the product in front of them , but resist the urge to start selling them on how wonderful it is .
Remember you are listening , not talking .
Afterwards
After the test is over , you still have more work to do .
Write up the test sesson as soon as possible .
Go over your notes , putting in the bits you remember that you could n’t scribble down .
Fix up the shorthand you resorted to in order to keep up .
Clarify the sequences that do n’t seem to make sense .
Do this as soon as you can , while it is all still fresh in your mind .
Then comes the hard part : interpretation .
Once you have done a few sessions , you ’ll have some data points .
You need to decide what to do with the data .
Some of what you discover in the tests will be easily translatable into product changes that are clear improvements .
Some will be so obvious , you ’ll wonder how you could have missed them .
Others will not be so clear , for a few reasons :
Some users will have difficulty with your product , but you still do n’t understand why , or what you could do to make their life easier .
Some problems can be difficult or even impossible to fix .
You can try to mitigate the problem somewhat , but you may have to live with a bumpy road .
You may have differing user profiles with conflicting goals .
One user may find the interface too complex , and want it simpler .
Another may not have as much control as they would like .
How can you satisfy both at once ?
Maybe in this release of the product you can’t .
It ’s hard to decide which camp to favor .
You may not have a clear sense from your session notes what the user wanted .
The best thing you can do with the test results is to write up recommendations .
The session notes are interesting , but it is hard to pick out specific changes from them .
Do that work , and make a list that your team can work from .
Keep in mind : most of your test results have to be taken with ( at least one ) grain of salt .
Usability tests are designed to simulate real users using your product , but there are many inaccuracies :
The users were in an artificial setting , with you watching over their shoulders .
The users were working under your instructions , rather than solving their own problems .
You only had a handful of users , five to model 50,000 .
Who knows if you got the right five ?
Maybe they were too smart , maybe they were too dumb ?
But these are unavoidable limitations .
Do what you can in spite of them .
What next
As I mentioned above , I ’m not a usability expert , I ’m a software engineer .
This is how I ’ve tested for usability problems on my own projects , and I ’ve found it valuable .
My using this approach in a disciplined realistic way , you can find problems and fix them .

Congressman Denied Access To Post - Attack Continuity Plans
By JEFF KOSSEFF – Newhouse News Service
WASHINGTON — Constituents called Rep. Peter DeFazio ’s office , worried there was a conspiracy buried in the classified portion of a White House plan for operating the government after a terrorist attack .
As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security , DeFazio , D - Ore. , is permitted to enter a secure “ bubbleroom ' ” in the Capitol and examine classified material .
So he asked the White House to see the secret documents .
On Wednesday , DeFazio got his answer : DENIED .
( Original Article )
When it comes to judging programming languages , there are three main factors that we need to consider : programmer productivity , the application feature set that can be implemented , and the runtime performance of the developed applications .
There are , of course , many others , including memory usage , portability , and implementation cost .
However , memory is plentiful these days , most languages have cross- platform implementations , and many of these implementations are free or have a low cost .
So the three factors mentioned in the title become the most important ones .
I ’d like to focus on the programming language transitions of the past few decades , in terms of those three factors , and in the domain of PCs and workstations .
The first one we ’ll consider is the transition from assembly to C .
This trasition brought a significant increase in all of those factors .
The use of C meant that it was easier for developers to rapidly create larger programs , while still running at nearly the speed of an equivalent hand - coded assembly program .
We witnessed a very similar transition slightly later on , when C++ often became favoured over C .
We saw significant developer productivity gains due to the OO features of C++ , which allowed for far more complex and featureful applications to be developed .
While in some cases there was a slight performance drop relative to C , most C++ compilers emitted code that was very performant .
But then in the 1990s , things started to change .
We had Java arrive on the scene in the middle of the 1990s .
Compared to C++ , Java did bring productivity gains , mainly due to its automated memory management .
But unlike the previous transitions , it did n’t really bring anything inherent that allowed for more complicated or advanced appliation features to be developed .
Most of its OO - related capabilities were already found in C++ , or were otherwise easily emulated .
Before the recent addition of generics to Java , the C++ STL also offered a much superior collections framework .
Furthermore , we are all aware of the severe performance drop that Java brought in most cases .
It ’s only now , after a decade of research into Java - based JIT compilation ( not to mention massive hardware improvements ) , that we ’re beginning to find that it offers reasonable performance for desktop applications .
I think this trend is getting significantly worse with the rise of JavaScript - based Web applications .
We really have n’t seen any significant developer productivity increases .
Nor have we seen any real ability to create more advanced or extensive application features .
These days , JavaScript developers spend a lot of time just replicating features that applications written in C , C++ or Java have offered for years .
An example of this is all of the Web - based word processors and spreadsheet applications that we ’ve seen developed .
Even today , they are quite inferior to similar applications from the late 1980s and early 1990s .
But perhaps worst of all , we ’ve suffered enormous runtime performance losses .
JavaScript applications often perform horribly , even on very modern hardware .
The lack of significant gains in those three areas really worries me .
They ’re key areas when it comes to developing viable , innovative , and quality software .
What we ’re seeing are actually several steps backwards , rather than one or more steps forward .
Productivity is down , no new or innovative features are being developed , and application runtimes are suffering .
At this point , the only hope appears to be functional programming .
Languages like Haskell and Erlang bring environments that encourage programmers to develop software in a far more efficient and productive manner .
Likewise , they bring the language support necessary to develop new and innovative application features .
Erlang , for instance , better allows developers to harness the power of multicore and multiprocessor systems , which also often leads to vastly improved runtime performance .
And then there ’s a language like Ocaml , which can be compiled to native binaries that offer excellent runtime performance .
The path of Web - based applications written in JavaScript is obviously one of failure .
In terms of the key area of developer productivity , application feature innovation and runtime performance , it is clearly insufficient .
And it ’s doubtful that it will be able to overcome these problems without radical changes .
So the only practical alternative at this point would appear to be functional languages like Haskell , Scheme , Common Lisp , Erlang , and Ocaml .
Each 8 - by - 10 - foot cell had a mat and a sleeping bag but no bed .
Most had a simple wooden chair and perhaps a small desk and a lamp .
The white walls were bare except for a plain wooden crucifix and a window .
Leaving their sandals by the door , the men silently filed barefoot into the sparsely furnished second - floor chapel , many kneeling to kiss the ground as they entered .
A breeze drifted in through an open window , bringing with it the twitter of birds and the racket of car horns .
At 5:30 , a postulant named Andy Barrie summoned the men to their knees for morning prayer .
The men chanted and prayed the Liturgy of the Hours , a collection of hymns , psalms , readings and intercessions that is prayed five times a day by priests , brothers and nuns around the world .
At 5:50 , the men broke for an hour of silent meditation .
By 6:45 they were back in their seats to pray the next selection from the Liturgy of the Hours .
This was followed by the daily celebration of Mass at dawn .
The brothers ’ prayer life structures their entire day .
They would pray again at noon , observe a holy hour in front of the Eucharist before dinner , and end their day with evening prayer and a rosary .
Every Friday is set aside for quiet prayer at the friary .
Once a month , each friar spends a day of silent prayer at the order ’s hermitage in Monticello , N.Y. , and once a year he goes on a weeklong silent retreat .
The brothers appreciate these hours away from the city .
“ Trying to pray in our chapel at 142nd Street , ” Postulant Andy explained , “ you ’re hearing car alarms and people pumping music .
So to get up there where we can have complete silence and we can really pray , it ’s pretty refreshing . ”
After Mass , the brothers headed to the refectory for a breakfast of cold cereal , bread , oranges and coffee .
The Rev. Luke Fletcher , vocations director for the friars , poured cornflakes into a bowl and found a seat at the long wooden table .
As he ate , he explained that every item the order uses , from cars to buildings to dishwashing soap , is donated or purchased with donations .
The friars rely particularly on asking for expired food at local supermarkets and on the generosity of a network of donors who call themselves the “ friar suppliers , ” to whom they are appropriately grateful .

Now how exactly could Hitler , a man who was a strong supporter of social welfare programs , gun control , animal rights , government funding for the arts and bans against smoking in public get away with being called a " conservative " ?
-- From " Hitler Was a Liberal , " Christian Hartsock , March 1 , 2006
One of the more surprising myths that has sprung up on the Internet in recent years is the premise that National Socialism was a leftist rather than a right - wing political movement .
Itâ€™s a form of historical revisionism , rooted in cultural illiteracy , thatâ€™s been spreading like a rash through the worldwide web , popping up in comments pages , surfacing in the occasional blogger essay , and triumphantly being presented as an argument on online forums .
Following the pattern of many such myths , it seems to be on the verge of breaking into the print media .
Jonah Goldberg has a book coming out this December , LIBERAL FASCISM , that apparently offers a similar argument .
Anyone familiar with the history of Hitlerâ€™s National Socialist Party knows that the word â€ œSocialismâ€ in the party name was less an honest reflection of Nazi policies than a cynical attempt by party leadership to lure working class Germans into its ranks .
As William Shirer points out :
The party had to play both sides of the tracks .
It had to allow Strasser , Goebbels , and the crank Feder to beguile the masses with the cry that the National Socialists were truly â€œsocialistsâ€ and against the money barons .
On the other hand , money to keep the party going had to be wheedled out of those who had an ample supply of it .
( â€ œTriumph and Consolidation , â€  THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH , William Shirer )
Among these suppliers were Emil Kirdorf , an industrialist â€œso reactionary that he called the policies of the Imperial government â€˜dangerously radicalâ€™â€  because it â€œhad allowed Bismarckâ€™s antisocialist law to lapse , â€  ( WHO FINANCED HITLER , James Pool and Suzanne Pool , Dial Press , First paperback edition , Pg 139 ) Fritz Thyssen , a fabulously wealthy steel heir whose experiences as a prisoner of the revolutionaries during the uprisings of 1918 - 19 had left him a firm anti-Communist , and , of course , Henry Ford , the American auto - maker who cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as a leftist .
The faith these men put in Hitler as a firm opponent of socialism was vindicated shortly after Hitler took power when , on May 2 , 1933 , trade union headquarters throughout Germany were occupied , the unions dissolved and their leaders arrested .
For an educated and rational conservative , these facts should not present a serious problem .
They simply indicate the complexity of the political landscape , particularly in the early 20th century , and the dangers of aligning oneself with a political leader simply because of his anti-communism .
For many on the far right , however , Hitlerâ€™s right - wing affiliation is a direct challenge to their left - wing / socialist / bad , right - wing / free - market / good dichotomy .
Not only has Hitlerâ€™s right - wing Third Reich gone down in history as the embodiment of state - sponsored evil , but a detailed and factual discussion of it involves describing communists , socialists , feminists and liberals as victims , something that might confuse the home - schooled kids being taught this right - wing / good , left - wing / bad dichotomy .
The answer the right has hit on is not to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazis .
Itâ€™s to rebrand them .
Significant Omissions
Conservapedia corrections to â€œvandalismâ€ of entries about the Nazis :
The origin of the Nazi Party itself was a small group called The German Workers ' Party , founded by a locksmith named Anton Drexler who , in 1918 , had set up a â€œCommittee of Independent Workmenâ€ in reaction to the Marxism of the free trade unions .
A year later The German Workers Party was formed when this merged with another right wing group , the Political Workers ' Circle .
The Third Reich was the name given to the German government by the Nazis an extremist right wing political party formed as a reaction to the Versailles Treaty and the liberal policies of the Weimar Republic .
In Conservapedia articles , this rebranding campaign rarely takes the form of stating outright in an actual article , â€ œThe Nazis were leftists .â€ Conservapedia editors simply refuse to allow the term â€œright wingâ€ to be associated with the Nazis and carefully avoid any mention of Communists , or leftists , or even liberals as victims of Nazism .
â€ œJewish Communistsâ€ and â€ œJewish liberal intellectualsâ€ are mentioned in the article on National Socialism , and thereâ€™s a reference or two of Hitler rounding up his â€œpolitical opponents , â€  but few direct acknowledgements that leftists were targeted by the Nazis , simply for being leftists , are allowed to remain .
One exception to this can be found in the article on the Third Reich ( the original version of which I wrote ) , which describes the round up of Communists in the wake of the fire of the Reichstag â€ “ an act of arson that Conservapedia is intent on blaming , not just on the man who confessed to it , Marinus van der Lubbe ( a half - blind Dutch Communist who had a history of setting fires , but also a history of confessing to crimes heâ€™d probably not committed ) , but on the international Communist conspiracy , as the following edits in the Adolf Hitler article show :
While the exact events surrounding this event ( The Reichstag fire ) are still contended , it was blamed on a communist comintern conspiracy .
Georgi Dimitrov , who later became General Secretary of the Comintern , was one of those arrested in the plot .
A Conservapedia editor objected to these changes , complaining on the talk page that â€ œSaying something like â€ ˜Comintern activistsâ€™ seems to suggest that there was some sort of international Communist participation .â€ 
The response from the editor who had made the changes was :
Well , that is exactly what it was .
Note , according to this article , the guy who burned down the Riechstag was not a German Communist , rather a Dutch Communists .
Both KPD and the Dutch Commie Party ( whatever it was ) were Comintern organizations .
Thus the hapless Marinus van der Lubbe is elevated by virtue of his Dutch citizenship from a rather low level and inexperienced communist whom few took very seriously , to an international conspirator .
The fact that Dimitrov was acquitted by the German court , along with all the other communists who didnâ€™t confess , is not included .
These deceptively minor edits , substituting the word â€ œcominternâ€  for â€œcommunist , â€ leaving out a fact here , erasing the word â€œright wingâ€  there , seem intended to support a drastic revision of history , one that would require rewriting the Niemoller Statement , which opens with â€ œFirst they came for the Communists â€¦â€ .
The Nazis , according to Conservapedia , were right about the Reichstag fire being an example of international communist terrorism , and were therefore , itâ€™s implied , also right to round up Communists ( and socialists and liberals ) afterwards .
The Nazis were therefore not â€œpersecutingâ€  Communists , but reacting to a genuine threat .
A Conspiracy of Historians
â€ œHitler was seeking in MEIN KAMPF to establish sole and undisputed claim to the leadership of the volkisch Right.â€ -- Ian Kershaw , HITLER , ( 1999 )
â€ œIn little more than a year the party had become a respected force in Bavarian right - wing politics , largely because of Hitlerâ€™s magnetic personality and obsessive drive.
â€ -- John Toland , ADOLF HITLER , ( 1976 )
â€ œBut the heaviest responsibility of all rests on the German Right , who not only failed to combine with the other parties in defense of the Republic , but made Hitler their partner in a coalition government .
â€ -- Alan Bullock , HITLER , A STUDY IN TYRANNY , 1952 .
To support the premise that Nazis were leftists , an even more dramatic rejection of history is required than accepting as truth the unsupported Nazi claims about an impending Communist revolution in Germany .
A serious hurdle faced by right - wing Third Reich revisionists is the modern vintage of their claims .
During the Nazi era and through the five decades that followed it , the consensus among observers , journalists , diarists , historians , biographers and writers of memoirs , whether conservative or liberal , sympathetic or unsympathetic to the Nazis , was and is that the Nazis were on the right side of the political spectrum -- not the left .
So how to explain this ?
On the talk page of the Conservapedia article â€ œPolitical Spectrum , â€ one editor makes the attempt :
Calling the Nazis right - wing was a contrivance of the left .
A pejorative idea , to diminish Conservatives , the right wing .
This renders pretty much every journalist , historian , diarist , letter writer , every contemporary observer of Nazi Germany , and every respected historian whoâ€™s written about it since , part of â€ œthe left .â€ 
Pointing this out to the editor on that same talk page got the following reaction :
Yeah , like suspecting all the above is a bad thing ?
Not in my world !
" Respected " writers are like nattering nabobs of dissent .
" Conventional Wisdom " is neither . ;-)
In short , believing that the Nazis were leftists requires you to also believe that the entire body of work written on the Nazis before , during , and after they took power , is a massive , left - wing conspiracy to make the right wing look bad .
An illustration of just how silly and how blithely unconnected to reality this conspiracy theory is can be found on the talk page when , confronted with the fact that this â€œcontrivance of the leftâ€ would include writers for TIME magazine , that same editor declares that â€ œHenry Luce would have fired most of ' em ..â€ 
The problem , of course , is that it was under conservative Henry Luceâ€™s tenure that passages like this were written :
" There will be 607 Deputies in the new Reichstag , largest , in German history .
Simplifying the returns , it means that the Nazis and other Right Wing Parties will have a total of 277 seats . "
-- From Time Magazine ( August 8 , 1932 )
Impossible Things
Alice laughed .
" There 's no use trying , ' she said `one can't believe impossible things . "
" I daresay you have n't had much practice , " said the Queen .
" When I was your age , I always did it for half - an - hour a day .
Why , sometimes I 've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast . " -- From THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS , by Lewis Carroll
Another problem faced by Conservapedia revisionists is the embarrassing fact that the rise of Nazism was , to a great extent , a reaction to the liberal policies of the Weimar Republic .
The emancipation of women , the shedding of the last legal restrictions on Jews , the rise of avant - garde art , literature and theater , all of these were an anathema to Hitler .
Including this information interferes with Conservapediaâ€™s mission of teaching its students that Hitler was a leftist .
Therefore , all references to Hitlerâ€™s hatred of such liberal policies must be excised from Conservapedia :
The Weimar Republic that preceded the Third Reich was a remarkable and exciting time for the arts , with painters like Paul Klee , Wassily Kandinsky , and Max Beckman , writers like Berthold Breacht and Kurt Weil , filmmakers like F.W. Murnau working and becoming established in their fields .
The rise of such avant - garde artists , especially in the visual arts , was an anathema to the Hitler and therefore to the Nazis , who regarded such art as â€œdegenerateâ€  and a symptom of the â€œdegradingâ€ influence of Jews and Marxists on German culture .
When the Nazis came into power , they immediately took steps ...
Removed from the article on The Third Reich and dismissed as â€œvandalismâ€ are such well - known landmarks in the history of the Third Reich as the notorious 1937 degenerate art exhibit , the May 10 , 1933 book burnings , the purging of â€œpacifist literatureâ€  and â€ œLiterature with liberal , democratic tendencies and attitudes , and writing supporting the Weimar Republicâ€ from Third Reich libraries , and the exclusion of women from professions , higher education , and government , areas in which women had made significant gains in the years before Hitler took over .
But leaving out this information is plainly not enough .
Students reading other sources may still stumble upon references to the Weimar Republic at odds with the picture of the Third Reich that Conservapedia wishes to paint .
Once again , a discussion page , this time the discussion page for the article on Nazism , provides a look at the â€œimpossible thingsâ€ one is required to believe to justify the â€œHitler was no right - wingerâ€ claim .
According to a Conservapedia editor :
There is a large divergence between American historians and Germans in discussing Wiemar Germany .
Germans regard what is called " Wiemar Germany " , or " the Wiemar period " as extending from 1919 to 1939 .
Americans assume Wiemar Germany ended in 1933 with the rise of Hitler & Nazism .
This is what I call " the Hollywood view " while popular and prevelent , nonetheless over fictionalized .
The sheer ambition of the above lie is almost breathtaking .
The writer is not just trying to convince readers that the Weimar Republic ended in 1939 instead of 1933 .
Heâ€™s trying to depict this claim as widely accepted among Germans and himself as a knowledgeable scholar too wise and well - informed to accept the American , leftist - Hollywood promoted myth that the Weimar Republic ended in 1933 .
The editor is blurring the difference between the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich , evidently so that the liberal policies of the Republic can be ascribed to the Nazis , as the following passage from the talk page indicates :
hmmm ... let 's see .... which country , the US or Germany , displayed it 's social progressivity by electing a Catholic to it 's highest office ?
Was it the US & JFK , or Wiemar Republic and Hitler ?
Then , which country introduced affirmative action into the military after the Treaty of Versailles which allowed poor common scum , like Rommel , to rise to the position of General based upon merit rather than Social class ?
Which country displayed its social progressivity by allowing gays in the military first , the US or Nazi Germany ?
Itâ€™s interesting to note that for all the breezy confidence projected about the Weimar Republic ending in 1939 , that same editor is oddly unwilling to â€œcorrectâ€ 
Conservapedia 's own short entry on the Weimar Republic which , as of this writing , still states that â€ œThe Weimar Republic is the republic which governed Germany from 1919 to 1933.â€ 
Tucking a whopper like â€ œThe Weimar Republic governed Germany from 1919 to 1939â€ into a discussion on the talk pages is one thing .
Putting it in the first sentence of an article , on the other hand , might focus an unpleasant amount of attention on just how dishonest is the entire effort by 21st Century right wingers to disassociate Nazism from the right .
Not only are the verities of history altered in the effort to associate the horrors of the Third Reich with the left -- space and time must actually be spindled and bent to that end .
The Conservapedia entry on â€ œConcentration Camp , â€ written by the same editor begins :
Concentration camps were camps the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany set up for persons deemed to be opponents or threats to the regime .
The term concentration camp was coined by Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Vladimir Lenin in a letter of 9 August 1918 ...
Most people who have bothered to check the etymology of the term â€ œconcentration campâ€ are aware that its origins are in the Second Boer War -- not the Communist revolution in Russia .
The Oxford English Dictionary cites a March , 1901 passage that refers to â€ œthe policy of placing the women and children confined in the concentration camps of South Africa.â€ 
The editorâ€™s reaction to having this pointed out to him on his talk page is to denounce the OED cite as " simply an effort to detract from the historical fact that VI Lenin invented the term ' concentration camp ' , and Hitler just mimed it , " and that " the cite is invalid , it is non-contemporaneous and ex post facto . "
He does not explain exactly how citing the use of the term " concentration camp " in 1901 -- seventeen years before Lenin is claimed to have â€œcoined it , â€ qualifies as an ex post facto cite .
The article , as of this writing , still claims that Lenin coined the term â€œconcentration camp.â€ 
Why It Matters
Liberals and moderates often react to right - wing attempts to paint Hitler as a leftist with an amused shrug and the question , â€ œso what ? â€ 
After all , does it really matter whether or not the Nazis were leftist ?
Isnâ€™t what matters the inhuman brutality of the Nazis , their genocidal policies , their deliberate destruction of peoples and cultures ?
Wouldnâ€™t those things be just as terrible under a leftist regime ?
Of course they would .
But the truth about the Nazis and their place on the political spectrum still matters .
The truth always matters .
One of the important lessons we were supposed to have derived from the twentieth century is that the right and the left , the godly and the godless , are all capable of murderous crimes .
The right has Adolf Hitler to look back on .
The left has Stalin .
Pinochetâ€™s Chile , Monttâ€™s Guatemala , Red China , the â€œdirty warâ€ in Argentina , Pol Potâ€™s Cambodia , the death squads in El Salvador , the Red Brigade in Europe , the Klan in the United States , the Taliban , Saddam Hussein , Osama bin laden , Deir Yassin , the Munich Olympics , Sabra and Shatila -- all of these and many others have shown that being neither Christian , nor Jewish , nor Moslem , nor atheist , nor Communist , nor free - market capitalist are guarantees against the commission of atrocities .
In recent years some on the right have grown restive about this lesson and eager to discard it .
The demise of the Soviet Union coupled with the fact that the Third Reich is rapidly falling from living memory has provided an opportunity for the far right to discard the notion that brutality is unacceptable no matter who commits it and who is victimized by it .
Reframe the Third Reich as a leftist rather than a right - wing regime and the resulting body count ascribed to the left can then be used as justification for brutal tactics against Communists or anyone perceived as Communist sympathizers .
Repression can be rationalized as a necessary and just response to an exceptional danger .
Which brings us to the subject of two figures who , not coincidentally , are currently being extolled by many on the right as anti-Communist heroes -- Joseph McCarthy and General Augusto Pinochet .
