Cupertino , CA - Apple announced that the upcoming version 9 of Apple 's iTunes software for the Mac finally incorporates a feature that many Mac users have been asking for : only play music approved by Steve Jobs .
The program will match all songs on a user 's computer with a database of Jobs - approved songs .
Nothing will change for songs already on the list , but songs not on the list will be disabled and cannot be played by iTunes or on any iPod or iPhone .
" I challenged our software developers to make an iTunes that only played music I approved of , and they did it , " said Jobs on a conference call with tech reporters .
" It adds the ' wow ' factor that Apple customers have come to expect from us .
You 'll be listening to your iPod and you 'll think , wow , Steve Jobs approves of this song .
How awesome is that ? "
" The Windows version of iTunes wo n't have this feature , because we can't expect those uncultured cavemen to appreciate such a great feature , " said Jobs .
Many Mac users had conflicting feelings about the move , like Dale Worstman of Omaha .
" I do n't want Steve Jobs telling me what I can listen too , but on the other hand I want Steve Jobs telling me what I can listen to .
Can anybody tell me if he likes Coldplay ?
He has to like Coldplay does n't he ? "

Not everyone was conflicted though .
" I want to know that I 'm only playing music that Jobs himself would like , " said Mac user Shane Epperson .
" Before I had to guess , but iTunes 9 will take the guesswork out of it for me . "
Apple representatives did not reveal specific songs in the Jobs - approved song database , but said music ranged from Indian folk tunes to new age classics and the number of songs included was over 9,000 .
Apple 's stock was down on the news .

Dragon Age Origins ( Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , Windows ) signals Bioware 's grand return to fantasy role - playing , a genre it 's been conspicuously absent from since Neverwinter Nights in 2002 .
It 's Bioware 's third shot at drafting an entire world from scratch , an unidealized fantasy preserve the company 's described as " dark heroic fantasy " inspired by realistic fantasy fiction writers like George R.R. Martin , whose widely acclaimed Song of Ice and Fire series many consider the yardstick for the genre .
It 's also one of the few ( and perhaps only ) RPGs to offer multiple ways in as well as ways out .
Instead of drafting a character whose abilities or occupational choices only receive cursory mention during the narrative , players in Dragon
Age choose from any of six detailed origin stories , stories -- according to BioWare - - designed to echo throughout the experience and alter it in fundamental ways .
But can the company pull it off without leaning on fantasy clichés ?
I 've suggested storytelling in fantasy role - playing games " sucks . "
In the following interview , Dragon Age lead designer Mike Laidlaw explains why the story in Dragon Age Origins wo n't .
This is Part One ( Part Two , Part Three )
Game On : Tell me about David Gaider .
He 's your lead writer on Dragon Age Origins , but he 's also written a prequel book set in the Dragon Age universe .
Mike Laidlaw : Dave is a world - builder at heart .
He loves creating a space that feels very real and has a density beyond just " Okay , we need these answers for the game . "
He created a space in Dragon Age that I think goes well beyond that , and by creating the world in advance , it let him write the novel with the history in mind .
He was n't cutting it from whole cloth when he was doing the novel , in other words , so it let him explore the characters and their relationships on a level he might not have been able to if he'd had to do all the heavy lifting from scratch .
GO : You have a pen and paper version of the Dragon Age world coming out somewhere down the road by the guys who landed George R.R. Martin 's Song of Ice and Fire license .
Does Gaider have anything to do with that ?
ML : No , Green Ronin 's been spearheading that , and they 've been working off a lot of our source materials and grabbing from our lore because we have extensive documentation for the entire Dragon Age property .
But Dave 's not been directly involved in that .
I 've been working on an approvals level with the Green Ronin guys myself , and they 're really excited to see how much source material Dragon
Age offers them , but Dave 's been focused on the novels and of course Origins itself .
GO : Will Green Ronin 's system be similar to the one you developed for the video game ?
Or are they taking your system and doing something different with it ?
ML : They 're basically translating the rules set and design that drives Origins into a pen and paper format .
It 's a custom system , similar to what we produced when we sat down to develop the rules .
GO : You 've called Dragon Age Origins " the HBO of RPGs , " implying that you 're after something much more nuanced and reality - grounded than your prior work with Baldur 's Gate and Neverwinter Nights .
Talk about some of the fantasy genre tropes you 'd like to upend .
ML : HBO obviously targets a more mature type of storytelling .
They 've moved away from the sitcom models and the more tried - and - true ... what you think of as the mainstream network thing .
The safe stuff .
So to my mind , Dragon
Age does a couple of things to break away from what we think of as classic fantasy , and I think some of these are similar to what George R.R. Martin 's doing in his books .
Specifically , we wanted to remove the sense that the fantastic is casual , and to present the fantastic as something that for the common man , for the everyman is still very much fantastic .
Almost terrifying , in fact .
One of the key tropes we 're trying to upend is that lightweight lack of consequences feel that can happen in fantasy .
It 's like " Oh , he 's dead …
But it 's okay !
Because we resurrected him ! "
No one ever talks about the near death experience or the tunnel of light or like in real life , the survivors going " Oh my god ! "
You know , we 're talking an inconceivably intense experience .
While we were defining the world and game , then , we said " What are some of the things we take for granted ? " and " How do we do them differently ? "
How do we do a darker , realistic approach ?
That 's what we mean when we say " dark heroic fantasy " and a more mature experience as what we 're after .
What if we did something different with elves , for instance ?
Elves are always nature dwelling , kind of ethereal , usually regarded as this pinnacle and maybe fading race .
You can even go to Games Workshop 's Warhammer 40 k universe and the Eldar are top tier technology and stuff , but they 're still a dying race .
Elves seem to be elves no matter what .
We said , how could we change that ?
How could we do that but still maintain the fact that they 're elves ?
So with our elves , the casualness of immortality and the idea that they live a thousand years was something we wanted to move away from , though it did n't mean it had to be stripped out of the lore .
Similarly elves as these powerful , wizardly beings that control great , ancient magic did n't have to go away , but it did n't feel right for the now , for the time period we wanted to set Dragon Age in with its darker tone .
As a result , our elves had an empire , but it 's fallen , and they 've actually been enslaved .
They 've only just gotten out of that situation .
They 're a good three generations into being emancipated , and they live in ghettoes in the cities for the most part , except for the few that live out in the wilderness , are very xenophobic , and enraged about the crimes committed against them .
They have a history of violence and betrayal that goes back , event after event after event , where the elves are almost persecuted for something no one remembers .
And of course that 's one of the great mysteries of the game , what exactly happened there .
That gives them an edge .
It gives them something fresh .
You still recognize them as elves , of course .
Pointy - ears , lithe , you know , fairly dexterous , good with magic .
But the fundamentals of it are such that once you get past that initial " Okay , it 's an elf , " you start seeing the differences .
And we present them very clearly using the origin stories .
That 's where the game succeeds at becoming more than just typical fantasy .
It 's by giving you the expected , then chipping off the edges .
GO : You let players choose from any of six origin stories , stories you 've suggested resonate throughout the play experience .
How pliable or reflective is Dragon
Age 's game world respective of those choices ?
Do they change the way the entire game plays out , or just invoke the occasional narrative nod ?
ML : Origins for us are such a key element of the game that we appended the word to the title .
We knew we wanted to do these right and make them a hallmark of the game .
We could have done a cursory approach , certainly , but instead we thought , " Okay , what 's gratifying about having an origin that 's playable ? "
That 's where I think it starts -- knowing that you get to experience a focused start to the game that gives you perspective and a different flavor when you 're finally starting into things .
With that in mind , we made a concerted effort throughout the rest of the game to call out the different elements of your origin , the important part being that we do it at appropriate points .
If the game constantly flogs it , it 'd lose any sense of being special .
Instead , we made sure there were moments in the game that not only point back to " Oh , you 're of this origin , " but actually reintroduce characters from that origin and have them iterating realistically based on how you acted during it .
It echoes forward as well , in terms of the larger plot points you 're dealing with .
If you come out of the mage origin story , when you eventually return to the mage tower , which is one of the things you 'll be doing as a Grey Warden later in the game , characters there will remember you .
They 'll remember the way you acted on your way out .
They 'll remember the kind of decisions you made during your initial testing and react accordingly .
Where the origins system really shines , I think , is that a character who goes to the mage tower , say a human noble , can encounter these very same characters and they 'll react differently .
They wo n't recognize you .
Your character wo n't have any interplay .
So there 's a level of depth and granularity that 's added in when you have these secondary encounters , which occur in more than one place .
It 's called out multiple times .
As a result , you get the feeling that your origin's not just something people occasionally mention , but also something people are reacting to accordingly , based on the way you acted and the choices you made .
It 's the pay off of , " Gosh , it 's been 20 hours , I 've finally managed to return to this place , and people are still pissed at me , " or " People are incredibly happy to see me . "
It 's not just a cursory mention , but a very specific callback to the way you forged your character in those early days .

Several former employees , who insisted on anonymity , confirmed that they were eager to talk with the shareholder group and said they might have valuable information .
“ I would say more , but I do n’t want somebody knocking on my door and asking for $ 50,000 back , ” said one former employee who worked on Freddie Mac ’s internal financial controls .
“ It ’s almost like bribery ; I felt that I was supposed to sign the agreement , take the money and keep all their secrets . ”
The severance deals were so strict , according to former employees , that they prohibited those who accepted them from saying almost anything about their old jobs or even about the secrecy pledges themselves .
“ I was told that in volunteering to take a buyout , I could n’t even talk about the agreement or it would be off the table , ” said an 18 - year veteran of Freddie Mac , who insisted on anonymity because of the restrictions .
“ I was told that you do n’t talk about the terms of agreement , you do n’t talk to the news media and you do n’t talk to attorneys involved in lawsuits against the company . ”
Lawyers for pension funds that have filed a class - action lawsuit against the company say the secrecy provisions have already muzzled at least two dozen former employees with potentially important information .
Spokesmen for both Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Finance Agency said they could not comment on the case because it is in litigation .
In a legal brief filed in August , the Federal Housing Finance Agency refused to confirm that the secrecy pacts even existed , saying their existence was “ hypothetical . ”
But if the restrictions did exist , the agency continued , neither shareholders nor the courts had any authority to interfere with them .
Humans , as a whole , are very competitive by nature .
So , when we get board with the “ normal ” competitions , like sports , out there we can come up with some very weird ones to occupy our time .
1. International Women ’s Day
In China , they celebrate International Women ’s Day .
Throughout the day men compete in races where they have to run in high heels .
There are other competitions where they can compete with their loved ones .
There are also bars that will offer them free drinks if they come in dressed as a woman .
Link
2. Midget Throwing Contest
This is normally held in bars .
It consists of a dwarf , midget , or little person putting on a suit made of special padded clothing or a suit made of Velcro .
Then , the patrons of the bar will toss one of them onto a mattress or a Velcro coated wall .
The winner is the one who tosses the dwarf the furthest .
This competition has been banned in a few parts of the world , but does continue on today .

3. SPAMarama
This competition was held for 31yrs in Texas .
It was always held close to April Fool ’s Day .
The competition included cooking entries with SPAM flavored ice cream , Moo Goo Gai SPAM , guacaSPAMoles , chicken - fried SPAM , SPAMuini , and SPAMalama Ding Dong .
Other events throughout the festival included a SPAM carving contest , a SPAM calling contest , the SPAM toss , a SPAM facial , and a tug of war across a pit filled with SPAM jelly .
Link
4. Supermarket Clerk Championships
The Japanese want to keep improving on their customer service abilities , so the hold a competition to see who the best supermarket clerk is .
Each person competing is judged on customer service , technical skill , and speed with bonus points for smiling .
Some of these competitors will practice for the entire year to improve their abilities .
Link
5. Redneck Games
This series of competitions are held Olympic style over one day .
The games include the hubcap hurl , bobbin ’ for pig ’s feet fest , and redneck horseshoes , which are toilet seats .
All the proceeds that are collected from these games are giving to local charities .
Link
6. Air Guitar Championships
Who knew that the one thing that everyone does during some of the best guitar riffs in your favorite songs is actually a competition ?
Each competitor is scored on a 6.0 score system and there are rules .
There are two rounds , each lasting a minute .
In round one the person gets to play a selection of their choice .
In round two the selection is chosen by a competitor or one of the organizers , so knowing how to improvise is important .
Each competitor is judged on technical merit , stage presence , and airness .
Link
7. Ugliest Dog Competition
This contest happens once a year .
It is held in California and televised on the Animal Planet channel .
In this competition the contestants enter their dogs to win a thousand dollar prize .
The uglier your dog the better chance you have at winning .
Link
8. Worm Charming Championships
During this competition you have to be able to charm worms out of the ground .
Each competitor gets a square plot and has thirty minutes to get as many worms to the surface as possible by using their charming method .
Any type of vibrations to encourage the worms to come out of the ground can be used , but you are not allowed to dig them up .
Link
9. World Beard and Mustache Competition
This competition goes on every two years .
The categories that the contestants compete in are full beard , partial beard , and mustache .
The toughest category is the natural full beard and a fan and media favorite is the freestyle category .
Link
10 . World Black Pudding Throwing Competition
This competition is to celebrate a rivalry between Lancashire and Yorkshire .
The object is to knock the Lancashire pudding off of the pub wall with the Black Pudding that is being held together by a pair of women ’s stockings .
You can only throw underhand , so it makes it more difficult to complete the task .

W ith the strike over and Toronto returning to normal , it 's time to get back to more important matters , namely the civilizing of the city .
Pundits and politicians remain fixated on the lowest common denominator , of course , but they can be safely ignored .
The mouth - breathers have had their moment in the spotlight , let us now thank them and move on .
And so the Case Ooteses , Denzil Minnan - Wongs and Karen Stintzes can stop blinking and crawl back into the shadows from which they came .
If Toronto hopes to remain competitive in a world increasingly dominated by city and regional economies , it must learn new ways of thinking and doing .
However tempting it may be as a strategy , parochialism is not enough .
The world no longer ends at the border of Etobicoke , Toronto or even Canada , for that matter .
But if the planet has grown smaller than ever , the stage has never been bigger .
Why this city ?
That 's the question we must ask ourselves .
What can we offer that any other mid-level burg here or the U.S. or Europe can't ?
It has become clear , however , that we are rooted in the mindset of the 1970s , blissfully unaware that a new reality has dawned .
Let 's look instead to cities that lead , cities that are reinventing themselves as places where people live because they want to not because they must , places that are remaking themselves in the image of a human being , not a car , places that offer quality of life not just low taxes .
Cities as disparate as New York , London , Stockholm , Copenhagen and now Sydney , Australia , are moving to reclaim their public realm for people .
Historic squares that were turned into parking lots in the years after World War II are now being returned to pedestrians .
Café life in Copenhagen , for instance , which did n't exist 40 years ago , now flourishes .
And , yes , they know what winter is .
Whole precincts in these communities and others have been set aside as pedestrian zones .
And local merchants notwithstanding , business prospers in these designated areas .
Toronto , meanwhile , has been too scared to do anything more than close off a street here and there for a day or two .
By contrast , in New York , Times Square itself has been closed to vehicular traffic , and the response has been overwhelmingly positive .
Is it any wonder tourism in Toronto is in a state of slow but steady decline ?
When city council voted to close the fifth lane of Jarvis St. recently , the howls of outrage were deafening – and pathetic .
It 's time Torontonians woke up and smelled the exhaust .
It does n't help that we have fallen 25 years behind the rest of the world in public transit , which alone has seriously harmed the GTA 's ability to keep pace .
Now we are desperately trying to catch up , but many fear the ( high - speed ) train has already left the station .
How ironic that as we become more like the U.S. , the U.S. wants to become more like us .
For Toronto , however , the message is clear : we make it as a city - region or we do n't make it at all .
This point was reiterated most recently by the Greater Toronto Region Economic Summit , which recommended the formation of a " war cabinet " to oversee growth in the 416 and 905 .
The analogy was apt , implying as it does that we must put aside the things that divide us and act in concert to deal with some higher threat .
That threat is real , but it does n't come from away .
It is everywhere we turn .
The enemy is us .
Christopher Hume can be reached at chume@thestar.ca .
The author with a group of Romani people ( also known as gypsies ) in front of a pile of scrap iron , collected for recycling .
That pile has been there for more than a year .
The recycling activity carried out by the Romani in Italy has been halted , in large part because the government forbade it and forced the recycling cooperatives to close down ( governments do n't like things they can't fully control ) .
But , also , recycling stopped because of the collapse of market prices of scrap iron .
This may be a symptom that the " second wave of mining " , recovering mineral resources from waste , is late in coming .
Will it ever arrive ?
Human civilization started when humans learned how to exploit those concentrated mineral sources that we call " ores " .
After centuries of mining , most of these ores have been badly dented or even completely exhausted .
The first wave of mining in human history will be over at some moment in the future .
Will there be a second one in which we learn how to reuse the minerals that we have discarded ?
The problem is felt everywhere and waste recycling is often presented as the miracle solution : it frees citizens from costs and bad smells , it saves the environment , it provides the economy with raw materials and people with jobs .
But is it possible to " close the cycle of production " ( the " cradle to cradle " ( C2C ) strategy ) ?
If it were so , we would solve once for all the problem of depletion .
Unfortunately , recycling remains a cumbersome task that keeps going only by means of government subsidies and a set of laws that force citizens and companies to do it .
Recycling is especially difficult if it is necessary to restore the initial quality of the materials being recycled .
In practice , recycled materials that can compete in a free market are often of poor quality and suitable only for some specific processes .
Recycled plastics , for instance , can be used only for some low price applications ; such as fruit crates .
Recycled steel contains plenty of contamination in the form of different metals and can be used only for some specific tasks .
Because of these problems , closing the cycle by recycling alone seems to be impossible .
We simply do n't recycle enough .
Common metals are recycled at an average of around 50 % of the total produced ( Papp 2005 ) .
Some cases are especially favorable , such as lead which is recycled at the level of 74 % .
But , even if we recycle something at 75 % we are far from closing the cycle : even in that case , after ten cycles , we are left with less than 0.1 % of the initial amount .
Surely , we can devise better recycling strategies , but there are limits in terms of monetary costs and energy needed .
So , we can't avoid to start thinking of recovering all that material that we have so foolishly thrown away when we thought that abundance would last forever .
In large part , this material has ended up dispersed in the environment as dust or ashes .
But a good fraction of it is buried in landfills .
Can it be recovered ?
A conference held in London in 2008 examined the feasibility of landfill mining .
The results have not been very encouraging .
Even when the prices of mineral commodities is high , as it was in 2008 , recovery from landfills has at best a marginally positive economic return .
With the collapse of commodity prices that took place in late 2008 , the second conference on landfill mining , originally planned for October 2009 , had to be canceled .
Landfill mining turns out to be a very different task in comparison to conventional mining .
Ores are normally formed of homogeneous mineral species that contain just a few chemical species .
A landfill , instead , contains a large number of metals mixed together at various scales - from the micro ( incinerator ashes ) to the macro ( undifferentiated urban waste ) .
In addition , the composition of a landfill varies with depth : people would throw away different kind of materials depending on the technology of the time , on how rich they were , and on how efficiently recycling was implemented .
Typically , old layers of landfills are richer in metals than the more recent ones .
Even though landfills are often rich in metals , recovery is very difficult .
Recovering single metals out of incineration ashes is pretty impossible ( Shen and Fossberg 2003 ) .
Something better can be done when waste remains unprocessed .
For instance , iron items can be extracted by means of magnets .
Light density materials ( e.g. aluminum cans ) can be separated by methods based on friction and gravity .
Usually , however , these processes remain too expensive to be usable in practice on existing landfills .
So , mining landfills remains a chimera , at least by industrial methods .
It is not so in poor countries , where landfills often provide the means of survival for large numbers of people .
It is not something to be happy about ; often , these people are extremely poor and their way of living is dangerous and unhealthy .
Nevertheless , they have found a way of mining landfills that works and they are performing a useful task for the whole community .
These considerations have led to revisit the concept of waste recycling performed by individuals or by cooperatives : a concept that is called participatory sustainable waste management .
The idea is that of a different paradigm in mining : not the heavily mechanized method that are typical of the mining industry , but low cost methods based , mainly , on the work of human beings .
If this work is performed with appropriate precautions for the health of the workers , and if they are paid enough , then it is a win - win strategy : it recovers precious materials for society and it provides a way of living to people who , otherwise , would have none .
In the figure , here , you can see Jutta Gutberlet , of the University of Victoria , Canada , working with the catadores of a landfill of Sao Paulo , Brazil .
So , perhaps , the second way of mining is coming , after all .
But it will be nothing like the first .
Whereas , once , finding a rich ore was a good way of making a lot of money , not many people are going to strike it rich by mining landfills .
It will be hard work and little pay , yet , it may be a way to face our uncertain future .
News of last week is that the Romani succeeded in selling the pile of scrap iron that you see in the picture at the beginning of this text .
They made 450 Euros out of it .
Not a way of becoming rich for them but , at least , that iron is back in the industrial cycle .

Seriously , think about it :
The MC9500 has all the hardware you need , with a 3.5G cellular radio , a 3.7 - inch VGA touchscreen , and 806MHz Marvell processor , GPS , Wi-Fi , a 3.2 - megapixel camera , stereo Bluetooth , and even an accelerometer .
You can even swap out the keypad with another configuration , or a lump of lead , probably , to maximize the kinetic force when you inevitably use this thing as a bludgeon .

A slim majority of Americans ( 53 % ) know the Muslim name for God is Allah , and a similar number ( 52 % ) can correctly name the Koran as the Islamic sacred text .
Overall , 41 % of the public is able to answer both questions correctly , 23 % can answer one but not the other and 36 % of Americans are unfamiliar with either term .
Men are generally more knowledgeable about Islam than women ; 47 % know the Muslim name for God and name the holy book correctly , compared with 35 % of women .
This knowledge is also higher among whites than among Hispanics , and Americans under age 65 are much more likely than seniors to know these facts about Islam .
Still , as with knowing a Muslim personally , education makes the greatest difference : Almost two - thirds of college graduates ( 64 % ) answered both questions about Islam correctly , compared with less than half of those with some college ( 48 % ) and 24 % of those who have not attended college .
Knowledge of Islam is fairly equal across religious groups , though it is highest among the unaffiliated ( 44 % answered both questions correctly ) and lowest among Catholics ( 35 % answered both correctly ) .
More Americans can correctly identify both the Koran and Allah today ( 41 % ) than could do so in 2002 or 2003 ( 33 % and 31 % respectively ) , though there has been only a marginal increase in Americans ’ knowledge about Islam since 2005 , when 38 % were familiar with both Allah and the Koran .

Aspartame is widely used in many food products Scientists are to assess whether the artificial sweetener aspartame causes health problems in people unusually sensitive to it .
Expert advice is that aspartame - found in more than 4,000 products - is safe to consume .
However , a number of people have reported sensitivity to the product including headaches , dizziness , vomiting , diarrhoea and fatigue .
The University of Hull study is funded by the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) .
Aspartame , 150 times sweeter than sugar , is found in products such as diet soft drinks , cereal bars , yogurts and chewing gum .
There have long been concerns that the sweetener is linked to a raft of health problems , including a greater risk of cancer , fertility issues , nausea , double vision and an effect on appetite .
However , after reviewing the available scientific literature , both the FSA and the European Food Safety Authority decided there was no firm evidence of any impact on health , and ruled that aspartame was safe to consume .
Professor Stephen Atkin , who will lead the new research , said : " This study is not to determine whether aspartame can be consumed safely ; this has already been established , but rather to see whether certain people are sensitive to it . "
The Hull team hope their work will lead to a larger international study to pin down the issue once and for all .
Body chemistry Professor Atkin also hopes to secure funding to analyse the chemical breakdown of aspartame in the body .
The sweetener can be broken down to produce methanol and formaldehyde , both of which have been previously linked to cancer .
However , it is not clear whether this process takes place in the body , or , if it does , whether the metabolites are absorbed into the blood in sufficient quantity to produce any biological effect .
Andrew Wadge , Chief Scientist at the Food Standards Agency said : " The study will address consumer concerns , including anecdotal reports that have linked a range of conditions to aspartame .
' The Agency 's view remains that aspartame can be consumed safely and we are not recommending any changes to its current use .
" However , we know that some people consider that they react badly to consuming this sweetener so we think it is important to increase our knowledge about what is happening . "
One hundred people will take part in the Hull study , half of who have complained of side effects from aspartame .
The study is expected to take 18 months .
At present the Acceptable Daily Intake ( ADI ) for aspartame is set by the European Commission 's Scientific Committee on Food ( SCF ) at 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight .
An adult would have to drink about 14 cans a day of diet soft drink , or consume about 80 sachets of sweetener to reach this amount .

Slashing executive salaries , bonuses and perks at the seven bailed - out companies that gorged most gluttonously at the public trough is emotionally satisfying , but it should n’t be .
It ’s like arresting jaywalkers while ignoring the bank robbery that ’s happening in broad daylight down the block .
Do n’t get me wrong .
The Obama administration ’s “ pay czar , ” Kenneth Feinberg , is right to put a lid on compensation at the Not - So - Magnificent Seven : Citigroup , Bank of America , General Motors , Chrysler , GMAC , Chrysler Financial , and the unforgettable AIG .
Twenty - five of the biggest earners at each of those firms will see their overall pay cut roughly by half , and most of that compensation will come as restricted company stock , not cash .
This means that what they ultimately reap , when they are eventually allowed to sell the stock , will depend on how well the company performs — which will depend on how well the executives do their jobs .
Tying pay to performance :
What a concept .
Feinberg even muscled outgoing Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis into accepting no pay or bonus for his work this year .
But Lewis will still have an estimated $ 70 million retirement package to keep him warm at night , so hold your tears .
It ’s nice to know that there must be some pooh - bah at B of A , Citigroup or AIG who will have to live without the new $ 90,000 Porsche Panamera he was planning to buy .
But Feinberg ’s writ of imperial decree does n’t extend beyond those seven companies , and the rest of Wall Street gives no indication of remotely understanding what the big deal is about compensation .
Goldman Sachs , for example , has a bonus pool this year of at least $ 16 billion and perhaps as much as $ 23 billion .
But all this is just a sideshow .
The main event is the limited , far - too - modest attempt by the Obama administration and Congress to curb the irresponsible Wall Street practices that led to the financial meltdown — and , if unaddressed , will lead inexorably to the next crisis .
Deregulation allowed the Wall Street financial marketplace to evolve from an institution that served the overall economy — by allocating capital most efficiently to the companies that could put it to best use — into an institution whose primary mission was to serve itself .
The vast over - the - counter trade in instruments known as derivatives , nominally worth a staggering $ 500 trillion worldwide , is largely an exercise in make - believe .
Firms make highly leveraged investments in exotic securities whose true value is opaque .
Then they hedge these investments by buying insurance against potential losses , although the insurer does n’t have a fraction of the money it would need to make good on all its promises .
All this investing and hedging generates huge transaction fees and big profits , which can be skimmed off the top each year .
Everything ’s fine , until there ’s some disruption in the real economy — a downturn in the housing market , say .
If the disruption is severe enough , the whole web of make - believe deals starts to unravel .
At which point the government steps in and bails everybody out .
The White House and Treasury have proposed reforms that would ameliorate , but not eliminate , this ridiculous cycle .
What the administration wo n’t do is outlaw some kinds of derivative products or transactions ; officials say that if they went down that road , they would always be one step behind Wall Street ’s inventiveness and greed .
I think it would be worth a try .
The administration did propose that derivatives transactions go through clearinghouses and be conducted on transparent , regulated exchanges .
But as reform legislation begins to work its way through Congress , Wall Street firms — including companies that received bailout funds — have boosted their spending on lobbying and political donations .
As a result , legislation approved Wednesday by the House Agriculture Committee — which has jurisdiction over the futures markets — would exempt up to 30 percent of derivatives transactions from new regulations .
A bill approved Thursday by the House Financial Services Committee that would create a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency , strongly opposed by most luminaries on Wall Street , was amended in the committee to exclude mortgage insurers , title insurers , accountants , lawyers and others .
Banks , meanwhile , are jacking up overdraft charges and instituting new kinds of credit card fees before any new limits kick in .
Hey , get it while you can .
Capping salaries and bonuses is fine .
But we need to pay attention to the guys in ski masks with bulging bags of money slung over their shoulders .
They ’re about to jump into the getaway car .

Love it or hate it , every programmer typically wets their feet by writing a “ hello world ” program in their new programming environment .
Since unlike with the type of code I ’m used to writing the Arduino board does n’t come with a CRT or LCD screen to output this text , we have to find a more creative way to do this .
There are many options , such as LEDs , peizo buzzers , small LCD pannels and speakers that could be used to output a message .
The Hello World sketchbook found in the examples outputs the text “ Hello World ” to the serial port monitor , we will be building upon this example and using an LED to output this same message .
The Duemilanove comes with an LED build into the board and is attached to PIN 13 .
This is very convenient as the experimentation kit did not come with even a single LED to play with .
I did , however , order a couple different types of LEDs with my order as I knew I wanted them to play around with .
For this example we will use the onboard LED as it requires no wiring and gives you a good way to get comfortable with uploading your program to the board and the basic structure of the code .
Start off by loading the Arduino development environment and on the main menu select File -> Examples -> Stubs ->HelloWorld .
The following project will be loaded into your sketchbook :
void setup ( ) { Serial.begin( 9600 ) ; } void loop ( ) { Serial.println ( " Hello World ! " ) ; }
This is the basic structure of all Ardino programs .
These two functions are the heart of every program you will write , so it does n’t hurt to take a moment and discuss them .
Both functions must be declared outside of the scope of all other functions .
They are declared as void so they are not expected to return any value and they do not require any parameters .
The setup funciton is called once when your board first powers up , and is used to initialize any devices or pins that are going to be used in your program .
After the setup function executes the loop function begins to run , and it will continue to run endlessly until you power off your board .
When first beginning to work with microcontrollers it takes a bit of time to wrap your head around the way the execute code , in an infinite loop , as this is somewhat different from the way any programs would run on your desktop or server computer .
In the setup function you will see that the board is configured for serial communications with the command Serial. begin( 9600 ) ; .
It is set to communicate at 9600 baud and it is important to note that even though we are using an emulated serial port over USB that pins 0 ( Rx ) and 1 ( Tx ) are wired to the FTDI USB - to - TTL Serial chip so they will be unavailable whenever you are performing serial communication over USB .
In the loop function Serial. println ( “ Hello World ! ” ) ; is used to echo Hello World back to the computer over the serial connection .
In order to see this message you will have to hit the Serial Monitor button on your toolbar .
The serial monitor provides us with one of our only ways to debug our code , by echoing debug information back to our computer .
And of course the serial communication ports on the Arduino can be used for more advanced purposes .
So how can we make this example a little more interesting ?
How about programming the onboard LED to flash Hello World in morse code ?
If you have a pack of LEDs and transistors you could also set up an array of LEDs to spell it out in binary .
Since the Experiementation Kit did not include these , I will stick with using the LED connected to pin 13 .
The first step was to find a reference for morse code , a quick trip to Wikipedia gave me everything I needed .
After that you will need a quick intro to working with LEDs , the best way to do that is to select File -> Examples -> Digital ->
Blink from the menu and take a look at the code there .
/* Blink Turns on an LED on for one second , then off for one second , repeatedly .
The circuit : * LED connected from digital pin 13 to ground .
* Note :
On most Arduino boards , there is already an LED on the board connected to pin 13 , so you do n't need any extra components for this example .
Created 1 June 2005 By David Cuartielles
http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink based on an orginal by H. Barragan for the Wiring i/o board */ int led Pin = 13 ; // LED connected to digital pin 13 void setup ( ) { // initialize the digital pin as an output : pinMode( ledPin , OUTPUT ) ; } // the loop ( ) method runs over and over again , // as long as the Arduino has power void loop ( ) { digital Write ( ledPin , HIGH ) ; // set the LED on delay ( 1000 ) ; // wait for a second digital Write ( ledPin , LOW ) ; // set the LED off delay ( 1000 ) ; // wait for a second }
The command pinMode in the setup function is used to tell the micro that pin 13 is going to be used for output .
In your main loop you are simply telling it to turn on ( HIGH ) and off ( LOW ) by passing the pin number and mode to the digitalWrite command .
You could also use the analogWrite command but since pin 13 does not support PWM you would only be able to set it to on or off , rather than adjust the brightness .
Pins 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 , and 11 on the Duemilanove support PWM and if you need to create a pulsing effect with your LEDs you will have to to hook up an LED and 1 K Ohm resistor to one of those pins .
At this point , stick with pin 13 , and hit the upload button again and watch what happens .
From there I would suggest tweaking the delays to create different blinking patterns if you feel you need to get a bit more comfortable with LEDs before moving on .
When you ’re ready , we ’ll begin splicing these two examples together and creating our morse code flasher .
If you have an extra LED sitting around feel free to plug the long leg into pin 13 and the short leg into the ground ( GND ) beside it .
Since pin 13 has a resistor built in we to not need to do anything more than that .
At the top of your project declare some new variables .
We ’re going to do this before any of the core functions as they need to be accissible by all of them .
int delayDot = 200 ; int delayDash = 500 ; int delayLetter = 250 ; int delayWord = 500 ;
These variables store the delay time in milliseconds for the two different “ characters ” and the spacing between them .
These can be tweaked to your liking , I personally do n’t know Morse Code so I ’m not sure how acturate the timings are .
Next you will be adding some code to the setup ( ) and loop ( ) functions .
void setup ( ) { Serial.begin( 9600 ) ; pinMode ( led Pin , OUTPUT ) ; } void loop ( ) { print_morse_code ( " h " ) ; print_morse_code ( " e " ) ; print_morse_code ( " l " ) ; print_morse_code ( " l " ) ; print_morse_code ( " o " ) ; print_space ( 1 ) ; print_morse_code ( " w " ) ; print_morse_code ( " o " ) ; print_morse_code ( " r " ) ; print_morse_code ( " l " ) ; print_morse_code ( " d " ) ; delay ( 1000 ) ; }
The setup ( ) function tells the board it will be outputting over the FTDI bus and prepares Pin 13 for output .
The loop calls a function called print_morse_code ( ) which is a very basic character map for the differenet pulses , it simply masses the character passed in with its list of options and outputs the proper sequence for each .
At the end of the main loop is a 1 second delay before it starts over from the beginning .
Before we look at the print_morse_code ( ) function lets look at the functions that create the characters .
void print_dot ( ) { digital Write ( ledPin , HIGH ) ; // set the LED on delay ( delayDot ) ; // wait for a second } void print_dash ( ) { digital Write ( ledPin , HIGH ) ; // set the LED on delay ( delayDot ) ; // wait for a second } // Turn off LED // 0 = Letter // 1 = Word void print_space ( byte len ) { digital Write ( ledPin , LOW ) ; // set LED off if ( len ) { delay ( delayWord ) ; } else { delay ( delayLetter ) ; } }
They ’re quite simple functions .
The LED is set to HIGH and the module waits 250 ms for a dot and 500 ms for a dash before it moves on to the next digit .
The next function , print_space ( ) , is a bit more intricate .
It requires a parameter to be passed in to determine which delay is going to be used after turning the LED off .
We want a 200 ms space between each letter and a 500 ms space between each word .
The last function we need is print_more_code ( ) which ties it all together .
It ’s not pretty , but it works .
// Convert letters to to morse code via LED and Serial echos void print_morse_code ( char* letter ) { // Hello // **** * *-** *-** --- //
World // *-- --- *-* *-** -** if( letter== " h " ) { Serial.println ( "**** " ) ; print_dot ( ) ; print_dot ( ) ; print_dot ( ) ; print_dot ( ) ; } else if ( letter== " e " ) { Serial.println ( " * " ) ; print_dot ( ) ; } else if ( letter== " l " ) { Serial.println ( "*-** " ) ; print_dot ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; } else if ( letter== " o " ) { Serial.println ( " ---" ) ; print_dash ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; } else if ( letter== " w " ) { Serial.println ( " *--" ) ; print_dot ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; } else if ( letter== " r " ) { Serial.println ( " *-* " ) ; print_dot ( ) ; print_dash ( ) ; print_dot ( ) ; } else if ( letter== " d " ) { Serial.println ( " -** " ) ; print_dash ( ) ; print_dot ( ) ; print_dot ( ) ; } print_space ( 0 ) ; }
A character is passed in and matched to a sequence of calls to print_dot ( ) and print_dash ( ) to create the desired letter .
At the end a letter space is added for padding making it easier to understand the transmission .
And just to help out with decrypting the message I output the currect character to the serial port so you can follow along on your computer .
The code for this entire project is available on Google Code for reference .
I encourage anyone to build off of it or optimize it .
Just keep in mind I ’m not a C programmer 😉
Words have obvious meanings to most users , and even when knowledge fails , there 's an obvious method to compensate : look it up .
Numbers also have semantic values , but they 're a lot harder to work with .
Most of us can probably recognize 3.14159 and the conceptual baggage it carries , but how many of us would recognize 58.44 ?
( That 's a mole of sodium chloride , in grams , for the curious . )
And the response that would work for words — look it up — does n't work so conveniently for numbers .
Only one of the top - 10 hits in Google refers to salt , and Bing fails entirely ( though it does offer " Women 's Sexy Mini Skirts by VENUS " ) .
Clearly , we have n't figured out how to make the Web work for numbers in the same way it does for words .
Allen Razdow , who got his start developing MathCad , wants to change that , and he talked to Ars about his attempt , True #.
Radzow said he was inspired by all the effort put into the semantic Web , which provides a variety of annotation and data exchange formats for information .
The new company is providing a service that allows users to create HTML snippets that link back to a full description of the number ; these can be embedded in various document formats , like Word and PDF , and the company is offering plugins for embedding numbers from within Word , Acrobat , Eclipse , and Visual Studio .
There will be a public database of numbers made available for free , or firms can pay to host a server for internal figures .
The service is currently in beta , but anyone can sign up for a free account that allows them to add numerical information to the system .
The system has a real - time parser that tries to interpret your information as you type .
This is n't a full natural language parser , as the differences in the interpretation between the two images shown below clearly indicates .
Still , the immediate feedback provides some indication of how well you 're following the parser 's expectations .
Typing an " & " brings up a character picker that allows the entry of a wide variety of common mathematical and scientific symbols .
For the text parser , what you get depends strongly on how you phrase it .
Finding a number turned out to be problematic , as the browsing and search functions do n't work at all on a Mac .
The default view into what the service calls the " numberspace " is a zoomable tree , with related concepts ( like all the atomic weights , for example ) grouped together on neighboring branches .
This structure may work well during the developmental stages , but the tree is likely to get very crowded in short order .
It is possible to zoom by plugging in various values , but to do that , you need to know how the service defines things like " context " and " property . "
Assuming you can find the number of your choice , the site will happily place an HTML snippet on your clipboard , which can be pasted into most applications ( although the process is a bit baroque in Word ) .
In addition to a link back to the number 's page on the True # site , the HTML contains some basic information about its context .
So , in one example we viewed , the number " 150 mi " was tagged with " Subject : Nissan EV - 11 " and " Property : approximate driving range ( length ) . "
This information should appear when you hover over a link embedded in a document ; obviously , going to the site would provide more details , including the source of the figure .
Embedded numbers pop up basic details when hovered over with the mouse .
Right now , this particular service is tough to evaluate , given its extremely preliminary nature .
But it 's worth considering whether this type of service could be valuable .
As Razdow put it , " creative engineering is a social process , " meaning people generally need to exchange information within groups ( and the same is generally true of science ) .
However , in any organization , you do n't always have access to the person who generated the information , who may have assumed knowledge that you do n't have .
As such , being able to provide the context for various information in equations or tables could provide a real benefit ; sometimes it's hard to remember what a figure represents that was introduced a page earlier .
This would be especially valuable for larger organizations , which may have to organize their documents across multiple sites .
That said , there seem to be a few limitations of the True # system when it comes to acting as a repository for the context that gives numbers meaning .
For one , the community aspect of number contribution would suffer from the reliability issues that strike places like Wikipedia .
Radzow said that he 's hoping that a community of experts will start using the service and fill it with useful values .
But he also told us that there wo n't be any limits to entering a value for the same thing .
So , for example , we could wind up with 18 different values for the atomic mass of sodium , leaving users to sort out which one 's right .
Radzow also pointed out that a given number might evolve over the course of a project .
So , take the example above , the range of the Nissan electric vehicle ; there may have been the initial estimates from the engineering crew , the promises from marketing , different numbers depending on the battery configuration , etc .
True # can hold them all , which has a certain value .
But it also means that anyone looking for the current number will have to wade through a bunch of other items to find it , since there does n't seem to be any sort way to organize related figures in a historical or hierarchal manner .
Overall , this is one of those services where the basic premise looks fantastic .
But the actual implementation , at least in its beta incarnation , makes it hard to tell how well the service actually works , and the design of the system may have some serious limitations .
All of these problems may be worked out in the end , but for now , it 's a great premise in search of a better implementation .
Das fragile " Vertrauensverhältnis " der Arbeitgeber zu ihren Angestellten Florian Rötzer
Eine Altenpflegerin wurde nach 17 Jahren Betriebszugehörigkeit wegen 6 Maultaschen , die ansonsten im Müll gelandet wären , gekündigt , das Arbeitsgericht gab dem Arbeitgeber recht
Es sind immer nur einzelne Fälle , wenn Arbeitnehmern wegen Bagatelldelikten auch nach Jahrzehnten der Beschäftigung fristlos gekündigt wird , heißt es auf der Arbeitgeber freundlichen Seite - wie gestern in der Sendung von Maybrit Illner von Michael Fuchs ( CDU ) oder dem ehemaligen BDI - Vorsitzenden Hans - Olaf Henkel .
Während Fuchs nach Merkel - Richtlinie nicht am Kündigungsschutz rütteln will , fordert Henkel schnelle Erleichterungen von der Regierungskoalition .
Christina Frank , ver.di-Sekretärin im Bezirk Baden - Württemberg , und Günter Wallraff zeichneten ein anderes Bild .
Schon jetzt sei der Kündigungsschutz erodiert , steige die Angst der Arbeitnehmer vor willkürlichen Kündigungen , die oft mit fiesen Methoden durchgesetzt werden , und nehme die Zahl der ungerechtfertigten Kündigungen zu .
Besonders gerne trifft es Arbeitnehmer , die sich gewerkschaftlich betätigen .
Ein Beispiel dafür ist der jüngste Fall einer 58 - Jährigen Altenpflegerin , die im April nach 17 Jahren der Betriebszugehörigkeit von ihrem Arbeitgeber fristlos gekündigt wurde .
Der Grund scheint wieder einmal lächerlich zu sein .
Die in Teilzeit beschäftigte Altenpflegerin hatte angeblich sechs – und " nicht nur 3 - 4 " , wie das Gericht sagt - übrig gebliebene Maultaschen in einer Tasche versteckt mit nach Hause nehmen wollen , die ansonsten im Müll gelandet wären .
Das Arbeitsgericht Radolfzell stellte sich auf die Seite des Arbeitgebers und wies die Klage auf Wiedereinstellung zurück .
Eine Abmahnung wäre trotz des langen Beschäftigungsverhältnisses und des Alters der Angestellten nicht ausreichend gewesen , befand das Gericht .
Die Arbeitnehmerin habe gegen ein ausdrückliches Verbot verstoßen , Essen der Heimbewohner zu nehmen .
" Sie hat damit in das Eigentum des Arbeitgebers rechtswidrig eingegriffen und ohne entlastende Begründung gegen ein bestehendes Verbot des Arbeitgebers in seiner Einrichtung verstoßen " , so das Gericht : " Es handelt sich auch bei 6 Maultaschen noch um eine geringwertige Sache ; der materielle Wert liegt zwischen 3,00 und 4,00 Euro .
Dennoch bestimmt allein der Arbeitgeber darüber , wie mit seinem Eigentum verfahren wird und zwar selbst dann , wenn er die Reste der Entsorgung zuführt .
Der einzelne Arbeitnehmer kann nicht seinen Willen nach Gutdünken und gegen ein bestehendes Verbot über denjenigen des Arbeitgebers stellen . "
Die Altenpflegerin hingegen sagte , dass es oft vorkomme , dass das Personal Übriggebliebenes mitnehme .
Sie habe 4 Maultaschen im Heim aufwärmen wollen , um nach der Arbeit und vor der Fortbildung noch etwas zu sich zu nehmen .
Der Arbeitgeber hatte der Gekündigten eine Abfindung von 18.000 Euro angeboten .
Das hatte diese ebenso wie dem vom Gericht vorgeschlagenen Vergleich in Höhe von 25.000 abgelehnt , weil sie ihren Job behalten will .
Erst vor kurzem war der Fall einer Sekretärin bekannt geworden , der nach vielen Jahren wegen des Verzehrs einer offenbar auch übriggebliebenen Frikadelle fristlos gekündigt wurde .
Zur Begründung heißt es dann stets , dass das " Vertrauensverhältnis " zerstört sei , wozu anscheinend schon der geringfügigste Verdacht ausreicht .

The cost of caring for patients who are near death accounts for a big piece of the government 's medical spending .
But a furor over a provision for government - paid counseling to plan for end - of - life care is steering lawmakers away from the issue .
Tucked inside a sweeping House bill to overhaul the health system is a provision that would require Medicare to pay physicians to counsel patients once every five years .
During those sessions , doctors could discuss how patients can plan for such end - of - life decisions as setting up ...

Speaker Bio :
This talk titled " 30 k Feet Look at WiFi " was given by Luiz " effffn " Eduardo at Defcon 17 .
Although inflight wee - fee service is really nothing new ... ( some airlines have had it for a while , some even already gave - up on the service ) , in the past year it 's got some traction again with the release of the service by some airlines in the US and some other countries .
The talk will cover things like wi-fi infrastructure , auth stuff , spectrum analysis , protection mechanisms ( if any ) , general usage , user device types and uplink technology that actually makes the user hit the " tubes " .
Data collected a few years ago in flights using older technologies , as well as data collected in newer ones and the possible use of tools available will be discussed .
Luiz " effffn " Eduardo has been working with infosec for a while , mostly dedicated to wireless security , protocol fuzzing and computer incident response in the past few years .
He is somewhat known in the scene for planning , implementing and supporting wireless networks in some of your favorite hacker conferences .
He 's one of DefCon networking team goons and has spoken previously at Shmoocon , DefCon , Toorcon , Hack in the Box Malaysia and other cons .
Luiz currently holds the following certifications : CISSP , CWNE , CEH , GCIH and GISP , and has probably being able to get them due to long flights around the globe and flight delays in airports .
LE is one of the organizers of the Brazilian infosec conference " you sh0t the sheriff " .
Rabble.ca , an alternative news source in Canada , recently posted a podcast that was originally broadcast on Co - Op Radio in Vancouver , on their show “ The F Word , ” which looks at feminist issues .
Entitled “ Islam , women and feminisms , ” this segment features interviews with two Canadian Muslim women , Itrath Syed and Farzana Doctor .
The host of the show talking about the prevalence of images of Muslims in media and popular culture , especially post - 9/11 , and the need to look critically at these .
She spoke with particular suspicion about the “ so - called ‘ survivor stories ’ about Muslim women escaping to the freedom of the West [ that ] have become international bestsellers of late . ”
The host explained the motivation for the show as originating in a feeling that “ we must encourage a less judgmental and more open dialogue between Muslim and non-Muslim feminists . ”
The first interview was with Itrath Syed* ( shown left ) , a long - time social justice activist in Vancouver , who is also a university and college lecturer , and has taught , among others , a course on “ Contemporary debates in Muslim women ’s feminisms ” at Simon Fraser University .
This interview was a great overview of some of the major issues that Muslim feminists deal with , both from within and from outside of Muslim communities .
One of the first questions was about the role of Syed ’s family and community in her identity as a Muslim woman .
Although she acknowledged that family and community play a role , Syed emphasized that :
“ It ’s beyond an identity politics .
It ’s what I believe , it ’s who I am …
For me , my feminist politics comes out of that space where I engage in a relationship with the Divine , which I believe requires believers to strive towards justice , and definitely gender justice is a key portion of that . ”
I loved this acknowledgment that , for her , as for so many Muslim women , being Muslim is so much more than an identity label .
I ’ve found myself in way too many spaces lately where “ Muslim ” has turned into a political identity above all else ( and I think this is pretty common , especially given current political contexts where “ Muslim ” ends up as such a politicized and racialized term ) , and Syed ’s affirmation of the centrality of Islam in her life “ beyond identity politics ” is an important way to begin a discussion about Muslim women ’s feminism .
So is her statement that it is Islam that motivates her feminist politics , and that the two need not be seen as two separate ideologies ( or as two contradictory identities , as they are so often portrayed . )
The interviewer asked Syed about the reactions to Muslim feminism within mainstream Muslim communities .
Syed responded that there are at least two issues at play : one is the re-engagement with scripture , which involves its own debates , and the second is the challenging of sexist practices within the community , which , as she said , “ does n’t really go well in any community . ”
In other words , while Muslim communities may have our specific battlegrounds where sexism is being challenged , resistance to these challenges of the status quo is far from unique to Muslims .
Syed also made a point of separating the label of “ feminist ” from politics relating to gender justice , arguing that the word is often too narrow , and that many communities have worked against sexism in different ways without necessarily identifying as feminist .
She mentioned that , although she herself identifies as feminist , many women of her mother ’s generation , and even of her own , may not use the term , but that their lived experience may still reflect struggles for equality based on gender ( and other categories . )
The common images within much of feminist history of Muslim women as “ the space against which white Western women measure the distance they ’ve traveled ” was also raised by Syed in a critique of dominant feminist narratives .
Shockingly , the topic of hijab came up ( yeah , I know you ’re all surprised too .
* yawn *.)
The interviewer referred to an obsession over the veil among non-Muslims , and Syed agreed that “ it is clearly [ a ] mad , crazy obsession , ” but clarified that the obsession manifests itself among Muslims too .
Like many of us , Syed expressed how tired she was of all of the discussions about covering , and described it as an “ inherent need to see ideological struggles play out over women ’s bodies , and to control women ’s bodies as sites of representation . ”
Within many non-Muslim communities , she said , hijab is seen as “ an absolute symbol of oppression and a marker of pre-modernity , ” but she also talked about the problems with it being seen within many Muslim circles “ as the only marker of Muslim identity for women . ”
Syed described these as two facets of the same problem – or , to use her lovely expression , “ same shit , different piles ” – and argued that “ either way , it ’s about controlling women ’s bodies and removing women ’s autonomy over their bodies . ”
It was kind of refreshing to hear people on both sides get called out for being way too hijab - obsessed .
One aspect of the interviewer ’s questions that I particularly appreciated was her recognition of her own lack of knowledge .
She asked Syed for recommendations of books or writers to read ;
Syed recommended staying away from the “ survivor stories ” mentioned at the beginning of the show , and instead suggested work by people such as Asifa Quraishi , Jasmin Zine , Amina Wadud and Mohja Kahf , as well as an anthology entitled Windows of Faith .
As a final thought , Syed emphasized the multiplicity of identities and beliefs of Muslim women , and reminded us that “ Muslim women , above all things , are also human , and tend to have a wide diversity of experience . ”
The second part of the interview was with Farzana Doctor , a psychotherapist , social worker , and writer , who lives in Toronto .
Much of the interview focused on Doctor ’s first novel , Stealing Nasreen ( shown below right ) , which is about the relationship between a couple who have recently moved to Canada from India , and a a queer South Asian - Canadian woman .
Doctor described the book as one that looks at the intersectionality of South Asian , Muslim , and queer identities , a perspective that she felt was missing in the world of literature when she herself came out as queer * .
Doctor described her own religious identity as more of a political and cultural one , based on the relatively secular household in which she was raised , although she said that she felt a need to engage more critically with her Muslim identity when she began to identify as queer , especially given the lack of examples she could find of others who were struggling with similar conflicts .
She stated that her book has been very well - received among South Asian circles and within queer Muslim groups , by people excited to find a story that reflects parts of their own experiences .
Asked about the reactions within the mainstream Muslim community to her book and to her own identity , Doctor echoed Syed ’s reminder that there is no one “ Muslim community , ” and that the diversity of Canada ’s Muslim communities is reflected in the wide range of reactions , from those who simply state that it is impossible to be both Muslim and queer , to those who are searching for alternate ways to understand how these identities can coexist .
Overall , although at times I wished the interviewer could have gone into a bit more depth on some issues , I thought she raised some important questions , and did a good job with allowing her guests to speak for themselves , rather than assuming that she knew how they should feel .
I ’m also really glad that she acknowledged the problems with all the “ survivor stories ” out there , and that she included on the show women who have had their struggles with Muslim communities and yet continue to see themselves as working from within a Muslim framework , rather than needing to escape from Islam .
* Full disclosure : Itrath is also a friend of mine , and someone I really admire , so I might be just a little biased .
But that ’s only because she ’s so awesome .
* “ Queer ” is the term that Farzana used to describe herself , and thus we have used it here .
The term is often used by LGBT communities in order to reclaim it .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
When the FDIC closed Chicago 's Corus Bank last month , it may have signaled the beginning of the next shock to the banking system : commercial real estate defaults .
Corus , whose balance sheet was larded with bad construction loans , is just one of many banks that have a slew of this debt on their books .
Refinancing the $ 2 trillion in commercial mortgages will be tough , as property values decline .
And in this new age of cautious lending , few banks are willing to refinance loans .
" There is a lack of new debt , " says Michael Haas , a real estate attorney at Jones Day .
" There is a hesitancy to extend credit when there is a real possibility that the real estate may be worth less than it was a few years ago . "
Now , in a situation eerily similar to the subprime crisis , the result is likely to be a wave of foreclosures and loan defaults that could , in turn , trigger a collapse in the market of the structured bonds backed by commercial real estate and construction debt .
But when , and how bad will it be ?
Here are three indicators to watch .
1. Special Servicers
Firms such as LNR Property , CW Capital , and Centerline are tasked with unraveling the most troubled loans in a last ditch attempt to keep them from default .
An uptick in business at these companies means more borrowers under duress .
Between April and August of this year , the value of commercial loans in special servicing doubled to about $ 50 billion , according to Trepp , a firm that tracks the commercial real estate market .
2. Big Projects
When rents and property values fall , apartment complexes , malls , hotels , and major projects financed during the bubble become more likely to default on their debt .
Fitch Ratings has identified several stressed loans that have been sliced and diced into billions of dollars in commercial mortgage - backed securities , including Tishman Speyer 's $ 3 billion loan for its Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper apartment complex in Manhattan and a $ 4.1 billion loan secured by Extended Stay 's hotels .
3. Regional Banks
Watch to see how banks such as Fidelity Southern and United Community Banks -- identified in a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey report as having a high proportion of noncurrent construction loans -- hold up over the next few months .
Community banks were especially aggressive in originating commercial real estate loans , but they could still manage to avoid big problems .
" Medium and small banks have a lot of exposure to local building projects , " says Chris Whalen , a bank analyst and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics .
" They 're forbearing or getting involved in their customers ' business rather than taking losses .
They 're hoping they can hold out until values come back . "
US : Government study finds widespread mercury contamination
By Dan Brennan
3 September 2009
Mercury is polluting streams across the country with alarming frequency , according to a study published last month by US Geological Survey .
More than two - thirds of fish samples in nearly 300 water bodies exceeded levels of concern for the environment , and a quarter exceeded levels safe for human consumption .
Every single fish sampled was contaminated with some level of mercury .
Widespread mercury in the environment is not new .
In fact , 48 states have mercury fish advisories in place , warning residents to avoid consuming local fish .
Nonetheless , the study helps scientists gain a more complete picture of the extent of mercury pollution .
According to USGS Scientist Barbara Scudder , “ This study improves our understanding of where mercury ends up in fish in freshwater streams .
The findings are critical for decision - makers to effectively manage mercury sources and to better anticipate concentrations of mercury and methylmercury in unstudied streams in comparable environmental settings . ”
Methylmercury is the most significant mercury pollutant because of its propensity to accumulate in animal tissue and its severe impacts on human health .
A USGS fact sheet sums up these threats : “ It affects the immune system , alters genetic and enzyme systems , and damages the nervous system , including coordination and the senses of touch , taste , and sight .
Methylmercury is particularly damaging to developing embryos , which are five to ten times more sensitive than adults . ”
Broad layers of the population are exposed to dangerous levels of methylmercury , especially in the critical years of early development .
The National Research Council estimated in a 2000 study that each year over 60,000 children are born at risk for adverse neurological development due to mercury exposure .
Another study by the Centers for Disease Control showed that 8 percent of women of childbearing age had mercury concentrations in the blood and hair exceeding the level considered safe by the federal government .
Human exposure to methylmercury comes primarily through ingestion of fish .
Concentrations accumulate in fish faster than their bodies are able to eliminate methylmercury , leading to a magnification of contamination in species at the top of the aquatic food chain .
Once eaten by humans , methylmercury is readily absorbed from the digestive tract and enters the blood stream , with potentially severe consequences .
However protecting human health it is not simply a matter of avoiding fish consumption .
Fish provide essential proteins and fatty acids not readily found elsewhere .
Methylmercury is typically not emitted into the environment directly .
Rather , elemental mercury is emitted to the air , is deposited in soils or waterways and is subsequently converted by microbes into methylmercury .
The elemental mercury emissions come mostly from anthropogenic sources , though some natural sources such as volcanic activity play a role .
Researchers estimate that mercury levels in the atmosphere are three to six times the pre-industrial level .
In the US , coal combustion in power plants and industrial boilers account for the bulk of human - induced emissions .
Other sources , including incineration of medical waste and other mercury - containing products , make a lesser though still meaningful contribution .
Many of the major emitters of mercury have exerted their influence to escape meaningful nationwide regulation for decades , despite the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990 , which imposed mercury regulations .
Cement kilns , coal - fired power plants and other sources continue to emit approximately 115 tons of mercury each year .
Although new federal regulation is on the horizon for cement kilns and power plants , it is uncertain whether widespread human exposure to mercury will decline .
Andy O’Hare of the Portland Cement Association , in his comments on the proposed rules for cement kilns , pointed to some potential unintended consequences of national regulation .
According to Reed Business Information , he stated , “ If this rule is adopted , domestic cement supply will be constrained and investments in cement capacity expansion avoided … .
Pushing cement production to other countries would ‘ OPEC ’ the industry and make the US dependent on cement imports .
In addition , because these countries have fewer regulations global emissions of mercury and carbon dioxide could actually increase . ”
This claim , though overstated and self - serving given that the cost of the technology in some cases is quite small compared to the cost of pollution control equipment already used , nonetheless points to the inability to protect the environment solely on a national basis .
Cuts in US emissions alone would not necessarily reduce exposure of Americans to mercury .
Mercury pollution can be carried large distances in the atmosphere .
One study has determined that mercury can travel 2500 kilometers in the atmosphere prior to deposition .
The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that over half of the mercury deposited in the US originates elsewhere .
Ocean currents can also transport mercury long distances after deposition .
To make matters worse , soil and water surfaces can re-emit mercury , greatly enhancing the residence time in the environment .
Furthermore , world trade in fish has grown rapidly in the past 30 years , increasing more than sevenfold from 1976 to 2002 .
China has emerged as the largest single exporter of fish products .
A significant and growing portion of fish consumed domestically is caught elsewhere .
These issues highlight the necessity of coordinated global action to address environmental issues .
But the need for such coordination is stymied by the division of the world into rival nation - states , increasingly at odds with each other as a result of the economic crisis .
National ruling elites around the world are jealously guarding any competitive advantage , even if it means poisoning masses of people .
Relatively cheap technology is now available to greatly reduce mercury pollution .
A Government Accountability
Office study of 14 coal - fired plants found that , on average , end - of - pipe technology could reduce 90 percent of mercury emissions at a cost of 0.12 cents per kilowatt hour , equivalent to less than a dollar a month on a typical consumer ’s electricity bill .
Even larger reductions can be achieved by switching to materials and fuels that do n’t contain mercury , for example switching from coal - based power generation to alternative sources .
However what would seem completely rational measures to protect humanity from a devastating poison remain elusive under a capitalist system that subjugates all else to the accumulation of profit .

does this chromosome come in a bigger size ?
A human DNA strand has 3 billion base pairs .
Your cell nucleus is 0.1 cubic millimeter .
How does your genome fit ?
Here ’s a challenge for you in your spare time .
Take a molecule about two meters long , break it up into no less than 46 sections and fit it inside a cell about a trillion times .
And do n’t just cram it in there because that huge molecule still has to be able to zip and unzip to relay its commands to some of the cells ’ organelles .
Speaking of which , there has to be some room in the cells themselves so they can carry on with their normal functions .
You ’ll have to fit it in the nucleus which is about 0.01 mm across .
What ’s that you say ?
Just not possible ?
It will never work ?
Who could ’ve come up with such a ridiculous idea ?
Nature .
And interestingly enough , not only did this problem come up during the evolution of DNA , it was obviously solved too .
But the big question is how …
Well , researchers at the Broad Institute used a new DNA sequencing tool which can detect which genes were bunched in the same area of the genome and which ones were further apart to get an idea of how the entire molecule is arranged in the nucleus , and think they have an answer .
It turns out that inactive genes are being separated from active ones and the entire structure of the genome is compressed into a fractal globule .
Due to the irregular but self - similar nature of fractals , these shapes allow for an amazing density and do n’t require the molecule to tie itself into knots , which means that the DNA is still flexible .
It ’s not surprising that the DNA ’s overall shape would be a fractal since these patterns occur in nature pretty much all the time , from a lightning bolt to snowflakes , and allow for a sort of organization in an otherwise chaotic collection of matter .
We should also keep in mind that a great deal of the genome does n’t carry a code for a protein .
Some of this non-coding DNA once encoded something and can even provide information for modern , active genes , while a notable but still unknown amount of it is junk left over from evolutionary processes or retroviral codes from the ancient past that stuck around for no particular reason other than that they were n’t malignant .
A good portion of these fractal globules might never need to unwind , which make them an elegant solution for managing where and how a huge molecule gets stored in a very small space .
And should an inactive gene deep inside one of the dense regions suddenly spring into action , the molecule will unwind enough to let it migrate closer to the active areas for improved efficiency .
Unfortunately , you just know that opportunistic creationists will want to use this new discovery as “ even more evidence of design in DNA ” since a molecule that encodes vital information for organisms is one of their most cherished arguments for some sort of designer or creator .
Now , since it appears that DNA is also organizing itself , expect them to ask how could that happen without an intervention from above .
The answer ?
Quite easily , actually .
DNA as we know today is the result of several billion years of constant change and over all that time , it would ’ve evolved a wide variety of ways to fit inside the small spaces it was given .
Eventually , it began settling into a fractal globule and this useful method stuck around , passing on from organism to organism to this day when we can actually map how its arranged .
And this is just the first step for studies that will aim to get a high resolution , three - dimensional map of an entire genome at work .

Senate Bill 572 , which proclaims May 22 Harvey Milk Day , is now enroute to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger after passing 45 - 27 in the California Assembly .
“ I am pleased my colleagues in the Assembly recognize and honor Harvey Milk´s contributions to our state , ” said Senator Leno ( D - San Francisco ) .
“ He is an inspiration to people worldwide who believe in fairness and equality and he fought for many of the issues we value today , including access to education , public transportation , affordable housing and protecting the environment .
“ Although he vetoed a similar bill last year with the message that Harvey Milk should be recognized only at the local level , I am confident Governor Schwarzenegger now understands the historic and international nature of Harvey´s legacy , ” said Senator Leno .
“ Last week the Governor contradicted his 2008 veto message when he and the First Lady announced that Harvey will be inducted into the California Hall of Fame , acknowledging that Harvey and the other inductees touched the ´lives of millions of people – not just in this state , but around the world . ´”
SB 572 recognizes Harvey Milk´s life and contributions to the state with a day of special significance .
Given California´s fiscal crisis , the bill has no cost to the state and state workers and school employees do not receive the day off work .
The legislation is sponsored by Equality California and co-authored by 22 members of the Legislature , including members of the LGBT Legislative Caucus , Senator Christine Kehoe and Assemblymembers Tom Ammiano and John A. Pérez .
Latah is a curious mental state seemingly localised to Malaysia and Indonesia where a person gets wound - up to such a degree that they show an exaggerated startle response , are highly suggestible , and may produce unintentional tic - like behaviour sequences when prompted by others .
It has been discussed as rare exotica in the medical literature but owing to the wonders of the internet , there are now many videos of it on YouTube ( welcome to the age of armchair anthropology ) .
The name is also used to refer to people who have a tendency to get into latah states , and other people may deliberately trigger latah behaviours in the person as a sort of usually good natured social teasing .
For example , this video has some friends indulging in some good natured joshing by getting one of their latah companions to do a whole range of daft actions through demonstration or suggestion .
The latah seems compelled to comply , occasionally snapping out of it to implore them to ‘ stop it !’.
There are many other examples online .
Although the specific triggered behaviours vary , almost all have the element of good - natured group teasing .
The condition is described by Western psychiatry as a culture - bound syndrome as it is typically thought only to occur in Malaysian and Indonesian people although the medical literature has had an ongoing debate about whether other cultures have the same phenomenon under a different name .
This is from an article on culture bound syndromes from The Psychiatric Times :
This same physiology has been elaborated in a variety of societies that are unrelated either historically or culturally .
Among the Ainu in Japan , the syndrome is called imu , and in a French - Canadian population in Maine it is called jumping .
Thus , these syndromes are similar , but not identical , from society to society .
This , of course , is true of the diagnostic entities described in DSM - IV as well .
Like hyperstartling , sleep paralysis ( a feeling of paralysis when either just falling asleep or waking up , sometimes accompanied by visual or audio hallucinations ) has been elaborated into a culture - bound syndrome in a number of unrelated geographic locations .
It is known as uqamairineq among the Yupik Eskimos and as old hag in parts of Newfoundland , Canada .
Anthropologists , who are much better at dealing with cultural variation without trying to shoehorn it into their familiar categories , have often loudly scoffed at the psychiatric definition of latah as a syndrome , suggesting it is just a defined social role of the local culture that has its own limits and and ‘ rules ’ .
The latah can break social convention by swearing or acting the fool , but violence or sexual indecency rarely occur and would be frowned upon .
In other words , it allows for socially sanctioned rule breaking while giving the person the justification of not being in control of their behaviour .
This is a common theme in society .
Think about our ideas of a ‘ wild night out ’ .
Someone gets really drunk and flashes their arse at a passing bus – craaazy !
Someone gets really drunk and flashes their cock at a bus – sex offender .
The ‘ drunk ’ reason does n’t seem to excuse the latter quite so well , showing that there are limits to being ‘ out of control ’ .
This does n’t mean that we are fully in control either , it just means that all societies have established ways of allowing us to live on the boundaries ( the liminal if you want the jargon ) .
From this perspective , Latah is a local example of a common human tendency .

Religious Freedom
Transcript of Elder Dallin H. Oaks speech given at BYU - Idaho on 13 October 2009 .
My dear young friends , I am pleased to speak to this BYU - Idaho audience .
I am conscious that I am also speaking to many in other places .
In this time of the Internet , what we say in one place is instantly put before a wider audience , including many to whom we do not intend to speak .
That complicates my task , so I ask your understanding as I speak to a very diverse audience .
In choosing my subject I have relied on an old military maxim that when there is a battle underway , persons who desire to join the fray should “ march to the sound of the guns . ” [ i ]
So it is that I invite you to march with me as I speak about religious freedom under the United States Constitution .
There is a battle over the meaning of that freedom .
The contest is of eternal importance , and it is your generation that must understand the issues and make the efforts to prevail .
I .
An 1833 revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith declared that the Lord established the United States Constitution by wise men whom he raised up for that very purpose ( Doctrine and Covenants 101:80 ) .
The Lord also declared that this constitution “ should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh ” ( Doctrine and Covenants 101:77 ; emphasis added ) .
In 1833 , when almost all people in the world were still ruled by kings or tyrants , few could see how the infant United States Constitution could be divinely designed “ for the rights and protection of all flesh . ”
Today , 176 years after that revelation , almost every nation in the world has adopted a written constitution , and the United States Constitution profoundly influenced all of them .
Truly , this nation ’s most important export is its constitution , whose great principles stand as a model “ for the rights and protection of all flesh . ”
On the vital human right of religious freedom , however , many constitutions fall short of the protections that are needed , so we are grateful that the United States government seeks to encourage religious freedom all over the world . [ ii ]
II .
To illustrate the importance of basic human rights in other countries , I refer to some recent history in Mongolia , which shows that the religious freedom we have taken for granted in the United States must be won by dangerous sacrifice in some other nations .
Following the perestroika movement in the Soviet Union , popular demonstrations in Mongolia forced the Communist government to resign in March 1990 .
Other political parties were legalized , but the first Mongolian elections gave the Communists a majority in the new parliament , and the old repressive attitudes persisted in all government departments .
The full functioning of a democratic process and the full enjoyment of the people ’s needed freedoms do not occur without a struggle .
In Mongolia , the freedoms of speech , press and religion — a principal feature of the inspired United States Constitution — remained unfulfilled .
In that precarious environment , a 42 - year - old married woman , Oyun Altangerel , a department head in the state library , courageously took some actions that would prove historic .
Acting against official pressure , she organized a “ Democratic Association Branch Council . ”
This 12 - member group , the first of its kind , spoke out for democracy and proposed that state employees have the freedoms of worship , belief and expression , including the right to belong to a political party of their choice .
When Oyun and others were fired from their state employment , Oyun began a hunger strike in the state library .
Within three hours she was joined by 20 others , mostly women , and their hunger strike , which continued for five days , became a public demonstration that took their grievances to the people of Mongolia .
This demonstration , backed by major democratic movement leaders , encouraged other government employees to organize similar democratic councils .
These dangerous actions expanded into a national anti-government movement that voiced powerful support for the basic human freedoms of speech , press and religion .
Eventually the government accepted the demands , and in the adoption of a democratic constitution two years later Mongolia took a major step toward a free society .
For Latter - day Saints , this birth of constitutional freedom in Mongolia has special interest .
Less than two years after the historic hunger strike , we sent our first missionaries to Mongolia .
In 1992 these couples began their meetings in the state library , where Oyun was working .
The following year , she showed her courage again by being baptized into this newly arrived Christian church .
Her only child , a 22 - year - old son , was baptized two years later .
Today , the Mongolian members of our Church number 9,000 , reportedly the largest group of Christians in the country .
A few months ago we organized our first stake in Mongolia .
Called as the stake president was Sister Oyun ’s son , Odgerel .
He had studied for a year at BYU - Hawaii , and his wife , Ariuna , a former missionary in Utah , graduated there .[ iii ]
III .
One of the great fundamentals of our inspired constitution , relied on by Oyun of Mongolia and countless others struggling for freedom in many countries in the world , is the principle that the people are the source of government power .
This principle of popular sovereignty was first written and applied on the American continent over 200 years ago .
A group of colonies won independence from a king , and their representatives had the unique opportunity of establishing a new government .
They did this by creating the first written constitution that has survived to govern a modern nation .
The United States Constitution declared the source of government power , delegated that power to a government , and regulated its exercise .
Along with many other religious people , we affirm that God is the ultimate source of power and that , under Him , it is the people ’s inherent right to decide their form of government .
Sovereign power is not inherent in a state or nation just because its leaders have the power that comes from force of arms .
And sovereign power does not come from the divine right of a king , who grants his subjects such power as he pleases or is forced to concede , as in Magna Carta .
As the preamble to our constitution states : “ We the People of the United States . . . do ordain and establish this Constitution . ”
This principle of sovereignty in the people explains the meaning of God ’s revelation that He established the Constitution of the United States “ that every man may act . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him , that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment ” ( Doctrine and Covenants 101:78 ) .
In other words , the most desirable condition for the effective exercise of God - given moral agency is a condition of maximum freedom and responsibility — the opposite of slavery or political oppression .
With freedom we can be accountable for our own actions and cannot blame our conditions on our bondage to another .
This is the condition the Lord praised in the Book of Mormon , where the people — not a king — established the laws and were governed by them ( see Mosiah 29:23 – 26 ) .
This popular sovereignty necessarily implies popular responsibility .
Instead of blaming their troubles on a king or tyrant , all citizens are responsible to share the burdens of governing , “ that every man might bear his part ” ( Mosiah 29:34 ) .
IV .
“ For the rights and protection of all flesh ” the United States Constitution includes in its First Amendment the guarantees of free exercise of religion and free speech and press .
Without these great fundamentals of the Constitution , America could not have served as the host nation for the restoration of the gospel , which began just three decades after the Bill of Rights was ratified .
The First Amendment reads : “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ”
The prohibition against “ an establishment of religion ” was intended to separate churches and government , to prevent a national church of the kind still found in Europe .
In the interest of time I will say no more about the establishment of religion , but only concentrate on the direction that the United States shall have no law “ prohibiting the free exercise ” of religion .
The guarantee of the free exercise of religion , which I will call religious freedom , is the first expression in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution .
As noted by many , this “ pre-eminent place ” identifies freedom of religion as “ a cornerstone of American democracy . ” [ iv ]
The American colonies were originally settled by people who , for the most part , had come to this continent to be able to practice their religious faith without persecution , and their successors deliberately placed religious freedom first in the nation ’s Bill of Rights .
So it is that our national law formally declares : “ The right to freedom of religion undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States . ” [
v ]
The free “ exercise ” of religion obviously involves both the right to choose religious beliefs and affiliations and the right to “ exercise ” or practice those beliefs .
But in a nation with citizens of many different religious beliefs , the right of some to act upon their religious principles must be qualified by the government ’s responsibility to protect the health and safety of all .
Otherwise , for example , the government could not protect its citizens ’ person or property from neighbors whose intentions include taking human life or stealing in circumstances rationalized on the basis of their religious beliefs .
The inherent conflict between the precious religious freedom of the people and the legitimate regulatory responsibilities of the government is the central issue of religious freedom .
Here are just a few examples of current controversial public issues that involve this conflict : laws governing marriage and adoption ; laws regulating the activities of church - related organizations like BYU - Idaho in furtherance of their religious missions — activities such as who they will serve or employ ; and laws prohibiting discrimination in employment or work conditions against persons with unpopular religious beliefs or practices .
The problems are not simple , and over the years the United States Supreme Court , which has the ultimate responsibility of interpreting the meaning of the lofty and general provisions of the Constitution , has struggled to identify principles that can guide its decisions when government action is claimed to violate someone ’s free exercise of religion .
As would be expected , most of the battles over the extent of religious freedom have involved government efforts to impose upon the practices of small groups like Mormons .
Not surprisingly , government officials sometimes seem more tolerant toward the religious practices of large groups of voters .
Unpopular minority religions are especially dependent upon a constitutional guarantee of free exercise of religion .
We are fortunate to have such a guarantee in the United States , but many nations do not .
The importance of that guarantee in the United States should make us ever diligent to defend it .
And it is in need of being defended .
During my lifetime I have seen a significant deterioration in the respect accorded to religion in our public life , and I believe that the vitality of religious freedom is in danger of being weakened accordingly .
Religious belief is obviously protected against government action .
The practice of that belief must have some limits , as I suggested earlier .
But unless the guarantee of free exercise of religion gives a religious actor greater protection against government prohibitions than are already guaranteed to all actors by other provisions of the constitution ( like freedom of speech ) , what is the special value of religious freedom ?
Surely the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion was intended to grant more freedom to religious action than to other kinds of action .
Treating actions based on religious belief the same as actions based on other systems of belief should not be enough to satisfy the special place of religion in the United States Constitution .
V .
Religious freedom has always been at risk .
It was repression of religious belief and practice that drove the Pilgrim fathers and other dissenters to the shores of this continent .
Even today , leaders in all too many nations use state power to repress religious believers .
The greatest infringements of religious freedom occur when the exercise of religion collides with other powerful forces in society .
Among the most threatening collisions in the United States today are ( 1 ) the rising strength of those who seek to silence religious voices in public debates , and ( 2 ) perceived conflicts between religious freedom and the popular appeal of newly alleged civil rights .
As I address this audience of young adults , I invite your careful attention to what I say on these subjects , because I am describing conditions you will face and challenges you must confront .
Silencing Religious Voices in the Public Square
A writer for The Christian Science Monitor predicts that the coming century will be “ very secular and religiously antagonistic , ” with intolerance of Christianity “ ris[ing ] to levels many of us have not believed possible in our lifetimes . ” [ vi ]
Other wise observers have noted the ever - growing , relentless attack on the Christian religion by forces who reject the existence or authority of God. [ vii ]
The extent and nature of religious devotion in this nation is changing .
The tide of public opinion in favor of religion is receding , and this probably portends public pressures for laws that will impinge on religious freedom .
Atheism has always been hostile to religion , such as in its arguments that freedom of or for religion should include freedom from religion .
Atheism ’s threat rises as its proponents grow in numbers and aggressiveness .
“ By some counts , ” a recent article in The Economist declares , “ there are at least 500 [ million ] declared non-believers in the world — enough to make atheism the fourth - biggest religion . ” [ viii ]
And atheism ’s spokesmen are aggressive , as recent publications show . [ ix ]
As noted by John A. Howard of the Howard Center for Family , Religion , and Society , these voices “ have developed great skills in demonizing those who disagree with them , turning their opponents into objects of fear , hatred and scorn . ” [ x ]
Such forces — atheists and others — would intimidate persons with religious - based points of view from influencing or making the laws of their state or nation .
Noted author and legal commentator Hugh Hewitt described the current circumstance this way :
“ There is a growing anti-religious bigotry in the United States . . . .
“ For three decades people of faith have watched a systematic and very effective effort waged in the courts and the media to drive them from the public square and to delegitimize their participation in politics as somehow threatening . ” [ xi ]
For example , a prominent gay - rights spokesman gave this explanation for his objection to our Church ’s position on California ’s Proposition 8 :
“ I ’m not intending it to harm the religion .
I think they do wonderful things .
Nicest people . . . .
My single goal is to get them out of the same - sex marriage business and back to helping hurricane victims . ” [ xii ]
Aside from the obvious fact that this objection would deny free speech as well as religious freedom to members of our Church and its coalition partners , there are other reasons why the public square must be open to religious ideas and religious persons .
As Richard John Neuhaus said many years ago , “ In a democracy that is free and robust , an opinion is no more disqualified for being ‘ religious ’ than for being atheistic , or psychoanalytic , or Marxist , or just plain dumb . ” [ xiii ]
Religious Freedom Diluted by Other “ Civil Rights ”
A second threat to religious freedom is from those who perceive it to be in conflict with the newly alleged “ civil right ” of same - gender couples to enjoy the privileges of marriage .
We have endured a wave of media - reported charges that the Mormons are trying to “ deny ” people or “ strip ” people of their “ rights . ”
After a significant majority of California voters ( seven million — over 52 percent ) approved Proposition 8 ’s limiting marriage to a man and a woman , some opponents characterized the vote as denying people their civil rights .
In fact , the Proposition 8 battle was not about civil rights , but about what equal rights demand and what religious rights protect .
At no time did anyone question or jeopardize the civil right of Proposition 8 opponents to vote or speak their views .
The real issue in the Proposition 8 debate — an issue that will not go away in years to come and for whose resolution it is critical that we protect everyone ’s freedom of speech and the equally important freedom to stand for religious beliefs — is whether the opponents of Proposition 8 should be allowed to change the vital institution of marriage itself .
The marriage union of a man and a woman has been the teaching of the Judeo - Christian scriptures and the core legal definition and practice of marriage in Western culture for thousands of years .
Those who seek to change the foundation of marriage should not be allowed to pretend that those who defend the ancient order are trampling on civil rights .
The supporters of Proposition 8 were exercising their constitutional right to defend the institution of marriage — an institution of transcendent importance that they , along with countless others of many persuasions , feel conscientiously obliged to protect .
Religious freedom needs defending against the claims of newly asserted human rights .
The so - called “ Yogyakarta Principles , ” published by an international human rights group , call for governments to assure that all persons have the right to practice their religious beliefs regardless of sexual orientation or identity .[ xiv ]
This apparently proposes that governments require church practices and their doctrines to ignore gender differences .
Any such effort to have governments invade religion to override religious doctrines or practices should be resisted by all believers .
At the same time , all who conduct such resistance should frame their advocacy and their personal relations so that they are never seen as being doctrinaire opponents of the very real civil rights ( such as free speech ) of their adversaries or any other disadvantaged group .

And now , in conclusion , I offer five points of counsel on how Latter - day Saints should conduct themselves to enhance religious freedom in this period of turmoil and challenge .
First , we must speak with love , always showing patience , understanding and compassion toward our adversaries .
We are under command to love our neighbor ( Luke 10:27 ) , to forgive all men ( Doctrine and Covenants 64:10 ) , to do good to them who despitefully use us ( Matthew 5:44 ) and to conduct our teaching in mildness and meekness ( Doctrine and Covenants 38:41 ) .
Even as we seek to speak with love , we must not be surprised when our positions are ridiculed and we are persecuted and reviled .
As the Savior said , “ so persecuted they the prophets which were before you ” ( Matthew 5:12 ) .
And modern revelation commands us not to revile against revilers ( Doctrine and Covenants 19:30 ) .
Second , we must not be deterred or coerced into silence by the kinds of intimidation I have described .
We must insist on our constitutional right and duty to exercise our religion , to vote our consciences on public issues and to participate in elections and debates in the public square and the halls of justice .
These are the rights of all citizens and they are also the rights of religious leaders .
While our church rarely speaks on public issues , it does so by exception on what the First Presidency defines as significant moral issues , which could surely include laws affecting the fundamental legal / cultural / moral environment of our communities and nations .
We must also insist on this companion condition of democratic government : when churches and their members or any other group act or speak out on public issues , win or lose , they have a right to expect freedom from retaliation .
Along with many others , we were disappointed with what we experienced in the aftermath of California ’s adoption of Proposition 8 , including vandalism of church facilities and harassment of church members by firings and boycotts of member businesses and by retaliation against donors .
Mormons were the targets of most of this , but it also hit other churches in the pro-8 coalition and other persons who could be identified as supporters .
Fortunately , some recognized such retaliation for what it was .
A full - page ad in the New York Times branded this “ violence and intimidation ” against religious organizations and individual believers “ simply because they supported Proposition 8 [ as ] an outrage that must stop . ” [ xv ]
The fact that this ad was signed by some leaders who had no history of friendship for our faith only added to its force .
It is important to note that while this aggressive intimidation in connection with the Proposition 8 election was primarily directed at religious persons and symbols , it was not anti-religious as such .
These incidents were expressions of outrage against those who disagreed with the gay - rights position and had prevailed in a public contest .
As such , these incidents of “ violence and intimidation ” are not so much anti-religious as anti-democratic .
In their effect they are like the well - known and widely condemned voter - intimidation of blacks in the South that produced corrective federal civil - rights legislation .
Third , we must insist on our freedom to preach the doctrines of our faith .
Why do I make this obvious point ?
Religious people who share our moral convictions feel some intimidation .
Fortunately , our leaders do not refrain from stating and explaining our position that homosexual behavior is sinful .
Last summer Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke these words to a BYU audience :
“ We follow Jesus Christ by living the law of chastity .
God gave this commandment , and He has never revoked or changed it .
This law is clear and simple .
No one is to engage in sexual relationships outside the bounds the Lord has set .
This applies to homosexual behavior of any kind and to heterosexual relationships outside marriage .
It is a sin to violate the law of chastity .
“ We follow Jesus Christ by adhering to God ’s law of marriage , which is marriage between one man and one woman .
This commandment has been in place from the very beginning . ” [ xvi ]
We will continue to teach what our Heavenly Father has commanded us to teach , and trust that the precious free exercise of religion remains strong enough to guarantee our right to exercise this most basic freedom .
Fourth , as advocates of the obvious truth that persons with religious positions or motivations have the right to express their religious views in public , we must nevertheless be wise in our political participation .
Preachers have been prime movers in the civil rights movement from the earliest advocates of abolition , but even the civil rights of religionists must be exercised legally and wisely .
As Latter - day Saints , we should never be reticent to declare and act upon the sure foundations of our faith .
The call of conscience — whether religious or otherwise — requires no secular justification .
At the same time , religious persons will often be most persuasive in political discourse by framing arguments and positions in ways that are respectful of those who do not share their religious beliefs and that contribute to the reasoned discussion and compromise that is essential in a pluralistic society .[ xvii ]
Fifth and finally , Latter - day Saints must be careful never to support or act upon the idea that a person must subscribe to some particular set of religious beliefs in order to qualify for a public office .
The framers of our constitution included a provision that “ no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States ” ( Article VI ) .
That constitutional principle forbids a religious test as a legal requirement , but it of course leaves citizens free to cast their votes on the basis of any preference they choose .
But wise religious leaders and members will never advocate religious tests for public office .
Fragile freedoms are best preserved when not employed beyond their intended purpose .
If a candidate is seen to be rejected at the ballot box primarily because of religious belief or affiliation , the precious free exercise of religion is weakened at its foundation , especially when this reason for rejection has been advocated by other religionists .
Such advocacy suggests that if religionists prevail in electing their preferred candidate this will lead to the use of government power in support of their religious beliefs and practices .
The religion of a candidate should not be an issue in a political campaign .
Conclusion
It was the Christian principles of human worth and dignity that made possible the formation of the United States Constitution over 200 years ago , and only those principles in the hearts of a majority of our diverse population can sustain that constitution today .
Our constitution ’s revolutionary concepts of sovereignty in the people and significant guarantees of personal rights were , as John A. Howard has written ,
“ generated by a people for whom Christianity had been for a century and a half the compelling feature of their lives .
It was Jesus who first stated that all men are created equal [ and ] that every person . . . is valued and loved by God. ” [ xviii ]
Professor Dinesh D’Souza reminds us :
“ The attempt to ground respect for equality on a purely secular basis ignores the vital contribution by Christianity to its spread .
It is folly to believe that it could survive without the continuing aid of religious belief . ” [ xix ]
Religious values and political realities are so interlinked in the origin and perpetuation of this nation that we cannot lose the influence of Christianity in the public square without seriously jeopardizing our freedoms .
I maintain that this is a political fact , well qualified for argument in the public square by religious people whose freedom to believe and act must always be protected by what is properly called our “ First Freedom , ” the free exercise of religion .
My dear brothers and sisters , I testify to the truth of these principles I have expressed today .
I testify of Jesus Christ , our Savior , who is the author and finisher of our faith and whose revelations to a prophet of God in these modern times have affirmed the foundation of the United States constitution , which as we have said , was given by God to His children for the rights and protection of all flesh .
May
God bless us to understand it , to sustain it , and to spread its influence throughout the world , I pray , in the name of Jesus Christ , amen .

Several Canadian police forces have adopted new directives which urge officers to avoid firing Tasers at people 's chests .
The directive , from Taser International , says police officers should not target a suspect 's chest if possible .
Instead officers should aim at the back , lower abdomen or the legs .
The manufacturer says the risk of affecting an individual 's heart is low from a chest shot , but officers will not be able to determine whether the suspect has been taking drugs or has an underlying heart condition that could cause cardiac arrest .
But the directive is not sitting well with some police officers .
Mike Sutherland is the president of the Winnipeg police association .
" It 's going to be a difficult shot and in high - stress , high - volatility type scenarios that 's not always going to be possible , " he said .
Police forces in Winnipeg , Calgary , and Vancouver , as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , say they will follow the new directive .
The Queensland Police Service ( QPS ) says it will look into the directive .
From Harper ’s Magazine :
[ Editor ’s Note : ]
From a March email by Michael Kinahan , coach of a soccer team for girls aged seven and under in Scituate , Massachusetts , to the children ’s parents .
After parents complained to league officials , Kinahan resigned , saying in his resignation letter that the email was meant to be “ a satire of those who take youth sports too seriously for the wrong reasons . ”
The email was obtained by the Patriot Ledger .
Congratulations on being selected for Team 7 ( forest - green shirts ) of the Scituate Soccer Club !
My name is Michael , and I have been fortunate enough to be selected to coach what I know will be a wonderful group of young ladies .
Okay , here ’s the real deal : Team 7 will be called Green Death .
We will only acknowledge “ Team 7 ” for scheduling and disciplinary purposes .
Green Death is not a team but a family ( some say cult ) that you belong to forever .
We play fair at all times , but we play tough and physical soccer .
We have some returning players who know the deal ; for the others , I only expect 110 percent at every game and practice .
We do not cater to superstars but prefer the gritty determination of journeymen who bring their lunch pail to work every week , chase every ball , and dig in corners like a Michael Vick pit bull .
Some say soccer at this age is about fun , and I completely agree .
I believe , however , that winning is fun and losing is for losers .
Ergo , we will strive for the W in each game .
Although we may not win every game ( excuse me , I just got a little nauseous ) , I expect us to fight for every loose ball and play every shift as if it were the finals of the World Cup .
As I spent a good Saturday morning listening to the legal - liability BS , which included a thirty - minute dissertation on how we need to baby the kids and especially the refs , I was disgusted .
The kids will run , they will fall , get bumps and bruises , even bleed a little .
Big deal ; it ’s good for them ( but I do hope the other team is the one bleeding ) .
If the refs ca n’t handle a little criticism , then they should turn in their whistles .
My heckling of the refs actually helps them develop as people .
The political - correctness police are not welcome on my sidelines .
America ’s youth are becoming fat , lazy , and noncompetitive because competition is viewed as “ bad . ”
I argue that competition is crucial to the evolution of our species and our survival in what has become an increasingly competitive global economy and dangerous world .
Second - place trophies are nothing to be proud of .
They serve only as a reminder that you missed your goal ; their only purpose is as an inspiration to do that next set of reps .
Do n’t animals eat what they kill ?
( And yes , someone actually kills the meat we eat — it is n’t grown in plastic wrap . )
And speaking of meat , I expect that the ladies be put on a diet of fish , undercooked red meat , and lots of veggies .
No junk food .
Protein shakes are encouraged , and while blood doping and HGH use is frowned upon , there is no testing policy .
And at the risk of stating the obvious , blue slushies are for winners .
These are my views and not necessarily the views of the league ( but they should be ) .
I recognize that my school of thought may be an ideological shift from conventional norms .
But it is imperative that we all fight the good fight , get involved now , and resist the urge to become sweatxedo - wearing yuppies who sit on the sidelines in L.L.
Bean chairs sipping mocha - latte - half - caf - accinos while discussing reality TV and home decorating with other feeble - minded folks .
I want to hear cheering , I want to hear encouragement , I want to get the team pumped up and know they are playing for something .
We are all cognizant of the soft bigotry that expects women , and especially little girls , to be dainty and submissive ; I wholeheartedly reject such drivel .
My overarching goal is to develop ladies who are confident and fearless , who will stand up for their beliefs and challenge the status quo .
Girls who will kick ass and take names on the field , off the field , and throughout their lives .
I want these girls to be winners in the game of life .
Who ’s with me ?
Go Green Death !
Health care as we know it did n't exist 3,000 years ago .
But along the Georgia coast , the Pacific Northwest , and coastal Brazil , people grew tall and strong and lived relatively free of disease .
They ate game , fish , shellfish and wild plants .
But as corn farming spread through various regions of the Americas , people got shorter .
Many became prone to anemia and began dying of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases .
" It 's counterintuitive -- with agriculture , people should have been better nourished , " said Emory University anthropologist George Armelagos .
But a different story is emerging from studies of ancient bones and teeth as well as blood samples from isolated hunters and farmers .
Hunters , of course , were not exactly invulnerable .
Their skeletons showed many fell prey to violence .
But new evidence may overturn what we understood about the diseases that killed humans over the centuries and how those threats have changed in the modern world .
With prevention now being touted as a strategy to counter crushing health care costs , insights from the past could help us better understand whether we can really prevent disease and how to best go about it .
The latest effort is mapping health over at least the last 3,000 years across the globe .
Although that study is just gearing up , the results are backing up earlier work showing that people were probably healthier 3,000 years ago than they were 300 years ago .
In Europe and America , health started to improve only recently -- about 150 years ago -- with safer food and better sanitation , and the rise of modern medicine .
" Our health conditions did n't pop out of nowhere , " said Clark Spencer Larsen , an anthropologist at Ohio State University .
" Our interest is in looking at the context for our health today . "
Emory 's Armelagos said this work might help settle debates over the so - called Paleolithic diets , which periodically become trendy , advocating little more than wild meat , seafood , a few nuts , and vegetables .
Did humans really evolve to eat this way , or has our species adapted to dairy products , domestic animals and grain ?
A surprising amount of information can be gleaned from skeletons , said Larsen , so he and colleagues are studying 17,000 of them as part of the Global History of Health Project .
They unveiled their first results , which covered Europe , this year .
The global project followed a similar one that compared different populations living in the Americas over the last 3,000 years .
That project showed that the rise of farming often came along with a fall in health .
One common measure of health is height , said project leader Richard Steckel of Ohio State University .
This can be approximated by thighbone length when researchers do n't have complete skeletons .
When people are poorly nourished , their children fail to grow to their full potential height .
People got shorter through most of the last 3,000 years , reaching the lowest point between the 1600s and late 1800s , Steckel said .
That 's when British philosopher Thomas Hobbes coined the phrase " nasty , brutish and short " to describe life before civilization .
Several other telltale signs on the bones show that farming populations often suffered from anemia and Vitamin B - 12 deficiency .
There was also more infectious disease -- TB , for example .
Armelagos , who was not in the project , said it was not that surprising that infectious diseases would rise with farming since it allowed denser centers of populations .
Humans have certainly always gotten sick , but disease was less likely to spread into epidemics when populations were sparse , he said .
With the rise of cities , crowding and exposure to human waste allowed disease to spread as never before .
Raising animals also allowed new pathogens to jump to humans .
Livestock hosted influenza , allowing the viruses to mutate and evolve , leading to ever more deadly pandemics .
And when farming of grains brought about greater quantities of food , he said , what people ate lacked certain nutrients -- iron and Vitamin B - 12 , for example , whose effects show up in the bones and teeth .
The only health measure that was generally worse for hunter - gatherers was violence , said Ohio State 's Steckel .
Many of their skeletons had signs of injuries inflicted by other humans .
Otzi , the 5,300 - year - old " ice man " discovered frozen in the Alps , may have been typical .
An analysis shows he was 45 years old and the cause of death was an arrow lodged in his shoulder .
Longevity will be harder to estimate -- but more research may eventually reveal whether hunter - gatherers who avoided spears in the back lived longer than their farming counterparts .
Some clues may come from isolated pockets of modern people who still live more ancient lifestyles .
This month , for example , a collaboration of gerontologists and anthropologists published a study on a remote group in Bolivia called the Tsimane .
These indigenous people got most of their food from growing rice and a starchy vegetable called manioc , with some added protein from game and fish .
They live in groups of 50 to 100 people with no sanitation , running water , electricity or modern medical care .
" This population lives in conditions as close to those of a historical population as we can get in the real world today , " said team member Eileen Crimmins , a gerontologist from the University of Southern California .
For this study , the researchers focused on the concept of inflammation as an agent of our deterioration and aging .
Though inflammation can help the body clear infections , it 's also been associated with heart disease as well as cancer and Alzheimer's .
One common signpost of inflammation is a substance called C- reactive protein or CRP .
The Tsimane CRP was so high that they appeared to be suffering sky - high inflammation levels -- enough that they should be dropping dead from heart attacks .
And yet they had very little evidence of heart disease or the sort of deterioration of the vascular system that appears to be almost inevitable among Western populations .
Working in their favor , most Tsimane had low body fat and low cholesterol , though they had unusually low levels of the " good " HDL cholesterol .
Their overall life expectancy is in the 40s , but the average is brought down by a high infant mortality rate , said collaborator Hillard Kaplan of the University of New Mexico .
Those who reach adulthood usually live into their 60s or early 70s .
" What 's really fascinating is that as different as our environments are , the schedule of life is n't all that different from ours , " Kaplan said .
" A 65 - year - old Tsimane looks and acts pretty similar to a 65 - year - old American . "
But instead of dying from heart disease , the Tsimane die from infections .
Kaplan suspects that fighting a relentless onslaught of infection eventually breaks down their immune systems by the time they reach 70 .
Thomas McDade , an anthropologist from Northwestern University , recently discovered that Tsimane of the past may have benefited from traditional medicine .
He found parents with the greatest traditional knowledge of local medicinal plants had the healthiest children .
The sickest children belonged to those who had lost this knowledge .

Full Frame features photo essays and conversations with photographers in the field .
See more galleries here and here .
Behind the ominous barbed wire and high concrete walls of the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in Mexico City , sits a cheerful nursery school with colorful walls , a maze of swings and slides and a playgroup of giggling toddlers .
The inmates at the female penitentiary include women serving sentences for murder , drug dealing and kidnapping .
There are also about 50 children , living inside the prison with their incarcerated mothers .
I first entered Santa Martha nervous and a bit angry that the government would allow and even encourage such a habitat for children , and skeptical that the Mexican prison of my imagination would ever be considered a place for a child .
Hard - faced guards in black commando garb mauled hastily through my bag before letting me in , then watched my every move as we made our way through the prison ’s dank echoing hallways where tough - looking women eyed me up and down with curiosity , suspicion , or both .
Upon reaching a small nursery school created within the prison ’s walls where I would be allowed to photograph that first day , I was pleasantly surprised .
While Santa Martha is undeniably a correctional institution and home to a rough crowd , it became quickly obvious that someone was trying hard to create a mini- world within for the children who call this place home .
Mothers lined up outside , eagerly waiting to collect kindergarteners , laughing and gossiping as if they were at any other preschool .
Inside , seemingly happy tikes bounced joyfully on balls and cut animals out of colorful construction paper to be hung on the school walls .
Still , iron gates and menacing guard towers loom over sand piles and jungle gyms ; outside the mini oasis of a daycare , life is that of a high - security penitentiary .
Inside the prison , moms serving long sentences dread the day when their children are tossed out upon turning 6 , and many struggle financially to care for them while they are there .
Photography allows me to meld passions for storytelling , art and the unraveling of the human condition by encapsulating isolated moments , whirling them into a fusion of truth and art , and sending them out into the world to tell stories that would not have the same effect if told through any other medium .
Some people seem to be caught up in the idea that photography has to fall into one of two distinct categories : fine art or documentary .
They claim that " artistic photography " forces one to turn reality into abstract , whereas " photojournalism " makes the abstract concrete .
I feel pulled toward both realms , and seek to strike a balance between them in my work : to make images with an artist ’s eye that reveal truth in the powerful stories of quiet voices across the globe .
It is in this mind that I embarked on the Santa Martha prison project .
Here you have this seemingly unthinkable scenario and a story screaming to be told in way that disgusts , but also all these glimpses of beauty and gentleness popping up between harsh lines , as if maternity and human instinct know no bounds .
Brute and hardened , tattoo - covered women smuggle in weapons and drugs and lash out at each other in the classroom , then melt into calm while in the presence of a child .
In working on this piece , I strove to consciously capture these moments of softness , while still conveying the truths of the rough scene they were found in .

Scientist Ray Kurzweil claims humans could become immortal in as little as 20 years ' time through nanotechnology and an increased understanding of how the body works .
The 61 - year - old American , who has predicted new technologies arriving before , says our understanding of genes and computer technology is accelerating at an incredible rate .
He says theoretically , at the rate our understanding is increasing , nanotechnologies capable of replacing many of our vital organs could be available in 20 years time .
Mr Kurzweil adds that although his claims may seem far - fetched , artificial pancreases and neural implants are already available .
Mr Kurzweil calls his theory the Law of Accelerating Returns .
Writing in The Sun , Mr Kurzweil said : " I and many other scientists now believe that in around 20 years we will have the means to reprogramme our bodies ' stone - age software so we can halt , then reverse , ageing .
Then nanotechnology will let us live for ever .
" Ultimately , nanobots will replace blood cells and do their work thousands of times more effectively .
" Within 25 years we will be able to do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath , or go scuba - diving for four hours without oxygen .
" Heart - attack victims – who have n't taken advantage of widely available bionic hearts – will calmly drive to the doctors for a minor operation as their blood bots keep them alive .
" Nanotechnology will extend our mental capacities to such an extent we will be able to write books within minutes .
" If we want to go into virtual - reality mode , nanobots will shut down brain signals and take us wherever we want to go .
Virtual sex will become commonplace .
And in our daily lives , hologram like figures will pop in our brain to explain what is happening .
" So we can look forward to a world where humans become cyborgs , with artificial limbs and organs . "

Advertisement UK ISP TalkTalk has staged a wireless stunt , aimed at illustrating why it thinks Lord Mandelson 's plans to disconnect filesharers is " naive " .
TalkTalk has long been an outspoken critic of government plans to cut off persistent file - sharers .
The stunt demonstrates how innocent people could be disconnected from the network if the plans become law .
The British Phonographic Industry stressed that any new system would educate before disconnecting users .
The music industry has been lobbying government on the issue of internet piracy .
According to its figures , there are around six million active file - sharers in the UK .
The government is mulling whether to give regulator Ofcom the power to disconnect pirates who repeatedly download illegal content .
It follows intervention from Business Secretary Lord Mandelson to beef up the file - sharing policy originally outlined in the Digital Britain report .
Presumed guilt ILLEGAL FILE - SHARING
File - sharing is not illegal .
It only becomes illegal when users are sharing content , such as music , that is protected by copyrights
The crackdown will be aimed at people who regularly use technologies , such as BitTorrent , and websites , such as The Pirate Bay , to find and download files
There are plenty of legitimate services which use file - sharing technology such as some on - demand TV services
Q&A : Disconnecting file - sharers
But ISPs have argued that it is not their job to police the network .
In previous court cases it has been ruled that ISPs are " mere conduits " of content .
Furthermore , they argue that under current plans anyone with unsecured home wi-fi could be held responsible if it were stolen by those intent on downloading music illegally .
They would face the penalties even though they might be unaware their network had been used for nefarious purposes .
The fact that the music industry would presume guilt rather than innocence is a step away from the due process of law in the UK , they say .
" The Mandelson scheme is every bit as wrong - headed as it is naive , " said Andrew Heaney , director of strategy and regulation at TalkTalk .
" The lack of presumption of innocence and the absence of judicial process combined with the prevalence of wi-fi hacking will result in innocent people being disconnected , " he said .
Barry Manilow TalkTalk visited a street to prove stealing music was easy
In order to illustrate the point Matt Roxburgh , a security expert from TalkTalk , visited an ordinary street in Stanmore , Middlesex .
Within a couple of hours he had identified 23 wireless connections on residential street The Highway , which were unsecured .
He downloaded music files from two connections , including Barry Manilow 's hit Mandy and the soundtrack to the 1992 film Peter 's Friends .
In both cases , the residents had given prior permission to " be hacked " and the content downloaded was legal .
TalkTalk plans to offer advice to all residents about how to secure their wi- fi networks .
Which ?
Computing magazine has highlighted several cases where net users were wrongly accused of illegally sharing video games .
The British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) remains confident that its " robust " evidence - gathering system will not allow innocent people to be caught in the net in the same way as has happened in the video game industry .
For those who have had their wi-fi connection hacked into , there would be no immediate threat of disconnection , said BPI spokesman Adam Liversage .
" The account holder would receive a notification in the first instance , which would represent an opportunity to discuss filesharing with others in the household and which would provide the account holder with the information and tools to help ensure that the account is not used illegally again , " he said .
" This information would extend to explaining to the account holder how they can secure their wireless router to ensure that it is n't accessed by unknown third parties , " he added .
' Mistakes occur '
But ultimately , householders will be held to account for what happens on their own networks , he added .
" The responsibility for ensuring that an internet account shared throughout a household is not being used for illegal filesharing clearly lies with the account holder , " he said .
A statement from the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills said : " We realise it 's possible for mistakes to occur or for people to have their wi-fi connection hi-jacked .
So it 's important we have an independent and easy route of appeal at all stages in the process .
At the moment we envisage a tribunal system to which people would have recourse before any action was taken against them . "
The government 's decision is due at the same time as the draft Digital Economy Bill , which will appear alongside or shortly after the Queen 's Speech to parliament in November .

The Arctic Monopoly Taking Stock of North Pole Riches
Oil and natural gas are luring the major powers to the Arctic .
The new Great Game includes Russia , the US , Canada and other countries competing for natural resources around the North Pole .
More information is available today than ever before about the location and abundance of the region 's riches .
Many liberal Jews have long chafed at the premise that Aipac or the Anti-Defamation League represented their point of view .
Bush got only a quarter of the Jewish vote in 2004 and was deeply loathed by the most liberal - leaning voters .
The community began searching for new ways to represent itself .
Existing progressive groups like the Israel Policy Forum issued position papers or agitated for a change in policy ; but scarce few did the yeoman labor of lobbying .
Tom Dine , a former Aipac executive director , says he was approached in 2006 by a group of liberal Jewish philanthropists about heading a “ counter - Aipac . ”
That idea went nowhere , but in late 2006 a different group of philanthropists and activists , including Ben - Ami , began to talk about combining the progressive organizations into a more powerful and influential collective body .
Out of these conversations came J Street , named after the street missing from Washington ’s grid and thus evoking a voice missing from Washington ’s policy discussions .
Early financing came from Alan Sagner , a retired New Jersey real estate developer and longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and Jewish causes , and from Davidi Gilo , an Israeli - American high - tech entrepreneur ; another 50 early backers each gave $ 10,000 .
Unlike the liberal advocacy or policy organizations ( or Aipac , for that matter ) , the new group would endorse and finance candidates , through a body called J Street PAC .

Ben -Ami is a political junkie who , at age 14 , handed out leaflets for Jimmy Carter .
He has worked in New York City government and politics ; he served as deputy domestic - policy adviser in Bill Clinton ’s first term and national policy director on Howard Dean ’s presidential campaign .
But he also benefits from an unusual Israeli pedigree .
His great - grandparents joined the first group of Russian Jews to make aliyah — to move to the Holy Land — in 1882 .
His grandparents were among the 66 families that in 1909 drew seashells from a hat — the legendary Seashell Lottery — to parcel out sandy lots in what was to become Israel .
His father served as a commander for Betar , the youth arm affiliated with Irgun , the fervent nationalist movement that fought the British to gain Israel ’s independence .
Ben - Ami ’s father was tasked with purchasing the Altalena , a naval vessel left over from World War II that was then filled with arms and was on its way to Palestine when David Ben-Gurion declared the independent state of Israel and ordered all fighters to accept the authority of the state .
After Menachem Begin , the head of Irgun , refused to turn back the Altalena , it was sunk by Ben-Gurion ’s forces , led by Yitzhak Rabin .
Ben -Ami , who was born in New York , says , “ I grew up with my father spending his entire life arguing with his friends about the Altalena and Ben-Gurion and what a schmuck he was and how could Begin give back the Sinai . ”
This is the world that shaped the mainstream American Jewish groups .
Abraham Foxman , the head of the Anti-Defamation League , was born in Poland in 1940 , and he often sounds as if only eternal vigilance will ward off the Holocaust in the offing .
Morton Klein , president of the Zionist Organization of America , was born in a camp for displaced persons , to parents who were Holocaust survivors .
The prophetic voice comes naturally to such men .
So does the sense of besetting peril .
Important Jewish organizations are normally reached through a series of locked doors presided over by glassed - in functionaries .
The peril may be real .
But it can also feel like a marketing device .
“ You know what these guys are afraid of ? ” says M. J. Rosenberg , Washington director of the Israel Policy Forum .
“ Their generation is disappearing .
All the old Jewish people in senior - citizen homes speaking Yiddish are dying — and they ’re being replaced by 60 - year - old Woodstock types . ”
J Street , by contrast , is wide open to the public .
Visitors must thread their way through a graphic - design studio with which the organization shares office space .
There appears to be nothing worth guarding .
The average age of the dozen or so staff members is about 30 .
Ben - Ami speaks for , and to , this post - Holocaust generation .
“ They ’re all intermarried , ” he says .
“ They ’re all doing Buddhist seders . ”
They are , he adds , baffled by the notion of “ Israel as the place you can always count on when they come to get you . ”
Living in a world of blogs , they ’re similarly skeptical of the premise that “ we ’re still on too - shaky ground ” to permit public disagreement .
There ’s a curious and striking analogy with the situation of Cuban - Americans , whose politics until quite recently were dominated by the generation that fled Castro ’s revolution and were grimly determined to see his regime overthrown .
Obama has not had to pay a price for moderating the American embargo , as his predecessors would have , because Cuban - American opinion is no longer in thrall to the older generation — precisely J Street ’s goal in regard to the Middle East .
Street PAC sent out a questionnaire to Congressional candidates in the summer of 2008 , seeking their views on U.S. engagement with the Middle East .
The group ultimately decided to support 41 candidates ( most of them non-Jewish ) and raised $ 580,000 in barely six months .
A lot of the money came in small donations over the Internet , another sign of the organization ’s new - generation status .
And the money has continued to flow .
This past June , several Jewish leaders were quoted in Politico as being disappointed in Donna Edwards , an African - American freshman legislator from suburban Maryland whom J Street had endorsed last year .
Edwards voted merely “ present ” on a resolution supporting Israel ’s assault on Gaza , and she criticized Israel ’s settlement policy during a visit to the region .
Edwards ’s supporters feared she could face a primary challenge from a more pro-Israel candidate .
As soon as the Politico item appeared , Ben -Ami fired off a fund - raising appeal to the J Street netroots .
“ This is exactly how — for decades — established pro-Israel groups have enforced right - wing message discipline on Israel in Congress , ” he wrote .
“ But not this time — and not to our friend Donna Edwards . ”
Edwards , who says that her own views place her “ right where the administration is ” on Israel - Palestine issues , attracted $ 30,000 via J Street PAC ’s appeal in three or four days .
That made people in Washington take notice .
It also infuriated some established leaders .
One of them told me that any group that would raise money for the likes of Edwards “ is not a responsible Jewish organization . ”
On the fundamental questions of Middle East peace , J Street occupies fairly traditional liberal territory , which of course places it well to the left of the mainstream groups .
According to its “ statement of principles , ” the group favors “ creation of a viable Palestinian state as part of a negotiated two - state solution , based on the 1967 borders with agreed reciprocal land swaps ” — the formula envisioned by the Clinton administration in its 2000 negotiations with Yasir Arafat and Ehud Barak .
Ben - Ami says he also favors Jerusalem as the shared capital of the two states .
On the question of talks with Hamas , classed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union , J Street takes the cautious view that while we should not speak directly with officials , we should engage through intermediaries with the goal of finding interlocutors willing to live in peace with Israel .
J Street maintains that most American Jews share its views on the Middle East .
They are reliably liberal on questions of war and peace ; three - quarters of Jewish respondents to a 2007 Gallup poll , for example , opposed the war in Iraq .
The question is how much of an exception they make for Israel .
J Street sought to answer this question by commissioning an extensive poll of Jewish opinion on Middle East issues .
The survey , taken in July 2008 and repeated with almost identical findings in March , found that American Jews opposed further Israeli settlements ( 60 percent to 40 percent ) , that they overwhelmingly supported the proposition that the U.S. should be actively engaged in the peace process even if that entailed “ publicly stating its disagreements with both the Israelis and the Arabs ” and that they strongly supported doing so even when the premise was revised to “ publicly stating its disagreements with Israel . ”
Strikingly , the average respondent placed Israel eighth among a list of concerns ; only 8 percent placed it first or second .
Day - to - day decisions are made by Mullah Omar ’s deputies , in particular Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , a skilled , pragmatic commander , who runs many meetings with Taliban commanders and “ shadow governors ” appointed in much of the country , analysts say .
Mullah Omar heads the Taliban ’s Rahbari Shura , or leadership council , often called the Quetta Shura since it relocated to the Pakistani city in 2002 .
The shura , consisting of the Taliban commanders , “ operates like the politburo of a communist party , ” setting broad strategy , said Mr. Yusufzai , the Pakistani journalist .
General McChrystal wrote in his assessment that the shura “ conducts a formal campaign review each winter , after which Mullah Omar announces his guidance and intent for the coming year . ”
Thomas E. Gouttierre , director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska , Omaha , said that “ as a symbolic figure , Omar is a centrifugal force for the Taliban , ” playing a similar role to that of Osama bin Laden in Al Qaeda .
But Dr. Gouttierre credits the Taliban ’s success not to any military genius on the part of Mullah Omar but to more worldly advisers from Pakistan ’s intelligence service and Al Qaeda .
Western and Afghan sources agree on the bare outline of Mullah Omar ’s biography :
He was born in a village , had limited religious schooling , fought with the mujahedeen against the Soviet Army and helped form the Taliban in 1994 .
Some accounts say he is married and has two sons .
His emergence as the leader of the puritanical students who later fought their way to the capital , Kabul , may have resulted from his very obscurity , some experts say .
He was not a flamboyant warlord with allies and enemies , a likely plus for the Taliban ’s sponsors in Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence Directorate .
“ He had an unaligned quality that made him useful , ” Mr. Strick van Linschoten said .
In jihadist accounts , his story has the feeling of legend : “ At the height of his youth , he stepped forward against the disbelievers and terrorized their ranks , ” says an undated 10 - page biography from an Islamist information agency , which also describes how he once refused cream and other delicacies , preferring “ a bowl of plain soup with some hard , stale bread . ”
Taliban folklore tells of his bravery in the 1980s in removing his own injured eye and fighting on ; of his dream in the mid-1990s in which the Prophet Muhammad told him he would bring peace to Afghanistan ; and of how in 1996 , he donned a cloak reputed to have belonged to the prophet and took the title “ commander of the faithful . ”

Zygomycota
Microscopic ' Pin ' or ' Sugar ' Molds

The tree shown above is based on several phylogenetic analyses of gene sequences of nuclear small subunit ( SSU ) ribosomal DNA ( Lutzoni et al.
2004 , Nagahama et al. 1995 , O'Donnell et al. 1998 , Tanabe et al. 2000 ) , elongation factor 1α , the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II ( RPB1 ; Tanabe et al. 2004 ) , and combined analysis of multiple genes ( James et al .
2006 ; White et al. 2006 ; Liu et al. 2006 ) .
Most of the clades shown are strongly supported as monophyletic , but relationships among them are poorly resolved .
Moreover , monophyly of the Zygomycota remains controversial , and it was not included as a formal taxon in the " AFTOL classification " of Fungi ( Hibbett et al. , 2007 ) .
This page is currently being revised to reflect understanding of the phylogeny of taxa formerly placed in Zygomycota .
Introduction The Zygomycota contains approximately 1 % of the described species of true Fungi ( ~900 described species ; Kirk et al. 2001 ) .
The most familiar representatives include the fast - growing molds that we encounter on spoiled strawberries ( Figure 1 ) and other fruits high in sugar content .
Although these fungi are common in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems , they are rarely noticed by humans because they are of microscopic size .
Colonial growth and the taxonomically informative asexual reproductive structures Zygomycota produce are typically studied after culturing on various agar media .
Direct microscopic observation of suitable substrates is required for those species that either have not or can not be cultured .
Fewer than half of the species have been cultured and the majority of these are members of the Mucorales , a group that includes some of the fastest growing fungi .

Zygomycota are defined and distinguished from all other fungi by sexual reproduction via zygospores following gametangial fusion ( Figure 2A , B ) and asexual reproduction by uni-to - multispored sporangia ( Figure 3A , B ) within which nonmotile , single - celled sporangiospores are produced .
The phylum comprises at least seven phylogenetically diverse orders .
Monophyly of the phylum and interrelationships among orders are currently under intensive investigation using multilocus DNA sequence data .
This introduction to the Zygomycota does not include the order comprising the arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM ) fungi , the Glomales , because it has been elevated to the rank of phylum , the Glomeromycota ( Schüßler et al. 2001 ) .
One other group , the Microsporidia , were previously considered protozoa , however , DNA , biochemistry , and morphology suggest these highly reduced , obligate , intracellular parasites may have evolved from a zygomycete - like ancestor ( Keeling 2003 ) .

Zygomycota are arguably the most ecologically diverse group of fungi , functioning as saprophytes on substrates such as fruit , soil , and dung ( Mucorales ) , as harmless inhabitants of arthropod guts ( Harpellales ) , as plant mutualists forming ectomycorrhizae ( Endogonales ) , and as pathogens of animals , plants , amoebae , and especially other fungi ( all Dimargaritales and some Zoopagales are mycoparasites ) .
A number of species are used in Asian food fermentations , such as Rhizopus oligosporus in the Indonesian staple tempeh , and Actinomucor elegans in Chinese cheese or sufu ( Hesseltine 1991 ) .
Conversely , some species have a negative economic impact on human affairs by causing storage rots of fruits ( particularly strawberries by Rhizopus stolonifer [ Figure 1 ] ) , as agents of plant disease ( e.g. , Choanephora cucurbitarum flower rot of curcurbits ) , while other species can cause life - threatening opportunistic infections of diabetic , immuno - suppressed , and immuno - compromised patients ( de Hoog et al. 2000 ) .
In addition to some Mucorales that attack immuno - suppressed humans , several species of microsporidia cause serious human infections .
Some zygomycetes are regularly isolated by veterinarians from domesticated animals in tropical and subtropical regions of the world , including the US gulf states .
Characteristics Zygomycota , like all true fungi , produce cell walls containing chitin .
They grow primarily as mycelia , or filaments of long cells called hyphae .
Unlike the so - called ' higher fungi ' comprising the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota which produce regularly septate mycelia , most Zygomycota form hyphae which are generally coenocytic because they lack cross walls or septa .
There are , however , several exceptions and septa may form at irregular intervals throughout the older parts of the mycelium or are regularly spaced in two sister orders of Zygomycota , the Kickxellales and Harpellales .
The unique character ( synapomorphy ) of the Zygomycota is the zygospore .
Zygospores are formed within a zygosporangium after the fusion of specialized hyphae called gametangia during the sexual cycle ( Figure 2A ) .
A single zygospore is formed per zygosporangium .
Because of this one - to - one relationship , the terms are often used interchangably .
The mature zygospore is often thick - walled ( Figure 2B ) , and undergoes an obligatory dormant period before germination .
Most Zygomycota are thought to have a zygotic or haplontic life cycle ( Figure 4 ) .
Thus , the only diploid phase takes place within the zygospore .
Nuclei within the zygospore are believed to undergo meiosis during germination , but this has only been demonstrated genetically within the model eukaryote Phycomyces blakesleeanus ( Eslava et al. 1975 ) .
Click on an image to view larger version & data in a new window Figure 4 .
Generalized life cycle of Zygomycota .
Asexual reproduction occurs primarily by sporangiospores produced by mitosis and cell division .
The only diploid ( 2N ) phase in the life cycle is the zygospore , produced through the conjugation of compatible gametangia during the sexual cycle ( see Figure 2A , B ) .
Zygomycota typically undergo prolific asexual reproduction through the formation of sporangia and sporangiospores .
Sporangiospores are distinguished from other types of asexual spores , such as conidia of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota , by their development .
Walled sporangiospores are formed by the internal cleavage of the sporangial cytoplasm .
At maturity , the sporangial wall typically disintegrates or dehisces ( Figure 3B ) , thereby freeing the spores that are usually dispersed by wind or water .
Sporangia are formed at the ends of specialized hyphae called sporangiophores .
In the model organism , Phycomyces blakesleeanus , sporangial development has been studied extensively to understand the genetic basis for various trophisms , including the strong phototrophic responses to blue light .
A unique spore dispersal strategy for the Mucorales is exhibited by the dung fungus Pilobolus , whose name literally means ' the hat thrower ' ( see far left Title illustration ) .
The entire black sporangium is explosively shot off of the top of the sporangiophore up to distances of several meters .
Phototrophic growth of the sporangiophore facilitates dispersal away from the dung onto a fresh blade of grass where it may be consumed by an herbivore , thereby completing the asexual cycle after the spores pass through the digestive system .
Some members of the Entomophthorales ( e.g. , Basidiobolus , Conidiobolus ) also reproduce via forcibly discharged asexual spores .
Interestingly , species of Basidiobolus , Conidiobolus and several other genera produce a second kind of spore on a long stalk that appears to have certain morphological adaptations for efficient insect dispersal .

The few - spored sporangiola are borne at the tips of the sporangiophore branches ( © G. L. Barron 2004 ) .
Two variant types of sporangia include sporangiola and merosporangia .
Sporangiola are simply uni-to - few spored sporangia containing between 1 - to - 30 spores ( Figures 3A and 5 ) .
Merosporangia are elongated sporangiola with uniseriate spores usually produced from a vesicle or stalk ( Figure 6 ) .

( From O'Donnell 1979 ) .
Merosporangiferous members of the Zygomycota , however , do not form a clade , indicating that this sporangial type has evolved independently more than once within the phylum ( e.g. , Mucorales and Zoopagales ) .
A unique sporangiolum type is the trichospore , a one - spored sporangiolum , produced by members of the Harpellales ( Figure 7 and far right Title slide ) , which are endocommensals living within the gut of arthropods , including terrestrial beetles and millipedes , fiddler crabs , and the larvae of many aquatic insects ( Lichtwardt 1986 ) .
Trichospores possess one to several basal hair - like filaments that likely aid in the attachment of the spores to debris and plants in aquatic ecosystems before they reenter the arthropod gut .

Like other Fungi , Zygomycota are heterotrophic and typically grow inside their food , dissolving the substrate with extracellular enzymes , and taking up nutrients by absorption rather than by phagocytosis , as observed in many protists .
The most common members of the Zygomycota are the fast growing members of the Mucorales .
They function as decomposers in soil and dung , thereby playing a significant role in the carbon cycle .
Zygomycota also participate in a number of interesting symbioses .
As mentioned above , the Harpellales inhabit arthropods ( particularly freshwater aquatic insect larvae ; Figure 7 ) where they are attached to the chitinous lining of the hindgut .
Harpellids presumably feed on nutrients that are not utilized by the arthropod .
Because they are generally assumed to neither harm nor benefit the host animal , this association is considered commensalistic .
In contrast , the Entomophthorales include many insect pathogens that can cause huge disease outbreaks ( see center Title slide showing infected maggot fly ) .
Some of this pathogenicity is being tapped for use in the biocontrol of specific insect pests , including periodical cicadas ( Bidochka et al. 1996 ; Hajek 1999 ) .
A number of other Zygomycota are mycoparasitic , or parasites of other fungi .
All members of the Dimargaritales ( only 15 species ) and many Zoopagales are typically obligate parasites of mucoralean hosts .
Other mycoparasites in the Mucorales ( e.g. , Syzygites , Spinellus ) specialize on mushroom fruiting bodies ( Basidiomycota ; Figure 8 ) .

Certain species of Zoopagales parasitize non-fungal hosts , such as nematodes , rotifers , and amoebae ( Figure 9 ) .
The Endogonales are a unique group in the Zygomycota because some members can form ectomycorrhizal associations with pine roots , while others appear to be saprobic .

Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships
The Zygomycota are thought to have diverged from the remaining fungi before the colonization of land by plants 600 - 1,400 million years ago ( Berbee and Taylor 2001 ; Heckman et al. 2001 ) .
Molecular phylogenetic studies place the Zygomycota near the base of the kingdom Fungi , diverging after the Chytridiomycota , the most basal fungal lineage ( James et al .
2006 ; White et al. 2006 ) .
However , as presently circumscribed , it is uncertain whether the Zygomycota represent a monophyletic group .
Studies using SSU rDNA sequence data have generated molecular phylogenies suggesting the Zygomycota may be either para- or polyphyletic ( Bruns et al. 1992 ; Tanabe et al. 2000 , 2004 ) .
With the recent removal of the Glomales from the Zygomycota ( Schüßler et al. 2001 ) , this phylum is restricted to species which form zygospores through mycelial conjugation , at least in those species where sexual reproduction is known .
Prior to the use of molecular phylogenetics , the Zygomycota were classified into two classes , the Zygomycetes and Trichomycetes ( Alexopoulos et al. 1996 ) .
Analyses of SSU rDNA sequences , however , have shown that the Trichomycetes are polyphyletic , comprising what we now know are Ichthyosporean protozoans related to animals ( Benny and O'Donnell 2000 ; Ustinova et al. 2000 ) and also some true Fungi , the Harpellales , which are nested within the Zygomycetes ( O' Donnell et al. 1998 ; Tanabe et al. 2000 ) .
Although relationships among the orders are poorly understood , analyses of RPB1 DNA sequences resolved a clade comprising the Kickxellales - Harpellales - Dimargaritales ( Tanabe et al. 2004 ) .
A morphological synapomorphy for this clade is the possession of a uniperforate septum with a lenticular cavity ( Figure 10 ; Benny et al. 2001 ) .
A large - scale phylogeny of the Mucorales , using three genes and at least one member of each recognized genus , suggests that several of the largest families and the two largest genera ( Mucor and Absidia ) are polyphyletic ( O' Donnell et al. 2001 ) .

Scale bar = 0.5 µm. ( From Tanabe et al. 2004 ; © Elsevier 2003 ) .
The Entomophthorales appears to be one of the most distinctive and problematical lineages of Zygomycota for two reasons : 1 ) SSU rDNA analyses suggest that it may be more closely related to the Blastocladiales ( Chytridiomycota ) ( James et al. 2000 ; Tanabe et al. 2004 ) , rather than other Zygomycota , and 2 ) they are morphologically distinct from other Zygomycota in the way their sporangia are formed and in the frequent production of secondary sporangiospores ( Cole and Samson 1979 ; Benny et al. 2001 ) .
Phylogenetic placement of one of the most problematic species , Basidiobolus ranarum , is uncertain ( Jensen et al. 1998 ) , but a recent phylogenetic analysis using RPB1 sequence data suggests that it is nested within the Zygomycota ( Tanabe et al. 2004 ) .
However , this species appears to be distinct from the Entomophthorales with which it has been classified traditionally .
Although B. ranarum possesses many of the features of other entomophthoralean species , such as forcibly discharged spores , morphologically similar zygospores , and symbiotic associations with insects ( Krejzova 1978 ; Blackwell and Malloch 1989 ) , this species does not appear to group with other Entomophthorales in molecular phylogenetic studies using SSU rDNA sequences ( Nagahama et al. 1995 ; James et al. 2000 ) .
Basidiobolus spp. possess centriole - like nuclear - associated organelles ( McKerracher and Heath 1985 ; Cavalier - Smith 1998 ) , however , only members of the Chytridiomycota , the only flagellated true Fungi , possess functional centrioles .
Though controversial , congruent evidence from alpha- and beta - tubulin gene phylogenies support a zygomycete origin of the microsporidia , a group of highly reduced obligate intracellular parasites of a wide variety of animals including humans ( Keeling et al. 2000 ; Keeling 2003 ) .
Because several microsporidian species have emerged as major pathogens of immuno - compromised patients over the past two decades , this enigmatic group has received considerable attention recently by the scientific community .
Placement of the microsporidia , however , remains controversial .
The Terms ' Pin ' or ' Sugar ' Molds
The common names ' pin ' or ' sugar ' molds are not formal taxonomic names for this group of fungi but refer to their morphological appearance or to one of the most common substrates upon which some members of the Mucorales ( Zygomycota ) grow .
Many members of the Mucorales produce unbranched sporangiophores with a sporangium for a ' head , ' a structure that superficially resembles a pin , hence the common name ' pin ' molds .
Many species commonly cause economically destructive rots of fruits in storage .
These fruits , including strawberries and nectarines , are high in simple sugars such as glucose , thereby explaining the origin of this common name .
The vast majority of Zygomycota , however , are never encountered by humans and therefore do not have common names .

So was letting Lehman go to the wall the greatest economic policy error of the modern age , or would we have ended up in much the same place regardless of what Mr Paulson had done ?
Many bankers argue the former , but then they would , would n't they ?
The same applies to central bankers , all of whom failed to see the recession coming until it was too late .
For them , it is convenient to think that , but for the stupidity of Mr Paulson , everything would have been just fine .
This is one of my favorite bugs of all time : Ubuntu bug # 248619 , where OpenOffice.org wo n’t print to Brother printers on Tuesdays ( but works on other days of the week ) .
Read some of the duplicate reports to follow the analysis and developer / user cooperation which isolated the bug .
It ’s a great example of a Bohrbug , where the circumstances which trigger the problem can be very difficult to isolate .
It ’s likely that many such bugs exist in Ubuntu and other software today , but have not yet been isolated , as bug 248619 has been .
We ’ve all observed a complex software stack misbehaving in ways we would never expect .
It ’s just as confusing when things suddenly start working again , for no apparent reason .
We start to doubt our senses , or the person who is reporting their observations .
In The Psychology of Computer Programming ( chapter 5 ) , Jerry Weinberg presents a case where two identical systems , physically isolated from each other but running the same software , exhibited precisely the same error at the same time .
This obviously pointed to a software bug , but after two weeks of searching , the problem could not be replicated and the root cause was not found .
The team gave up on finding it , and the system went into production , only to have the bug recur and cause a serious operational outage .
Bugs which occur very rarely may not always be worth investigating , but they are real , and can be explained .
When it really matters , we should remember not to disregard them .
Now , how much alcohol does it take to get them schnockered ?
Scientists routinely puff ethanol vapors at insects and measure their sensitivity with devices called inebriometers .
Bugs are no lightweights , often withstanding vapor concentrations of 60 percent alcohol , far more than what 's in our blood after a couple beers .
" Someone who 's had 10 drinks might have a blood alcohol content of 0.2 percent , " says entomologist Coby Schal of North Carolina State University .
To a mosquito , a blood meal that contains 0.2 percent alcohol is like drinking a beer diluted 25 - fold .
Back in August , I got a surprise in the mail : a long Braille computer printout and a letter .
The letter was from Patti Smith , who teaches visually impaired middle - schoolers in Detroit ’s public school system .
She explained that almost all the Braille kids ’ books she had access to were for really little kids — kindergartners , basically — and how discouraging this was for her kids .
The reason she was writing to me was to thank me for releasing my young adult novel Little Brother under a Creative Commons license , which meant that she could download the ebook version and run it through her school ’s Braille embosser ( US copyright law makes it legal to convert any book to Braille or audiobook for blind people , but it is technically challenging and expensive to do this without the electronic text ) .
I wrote about this on my personal blog , and it inspired my colleague , the sf / f writer Paula Johansen , to write to Patti to offer up her own YA titles as ebooks for Patti ’s students .
Well , this got me thinking that there might be lots of YA writers who’d be glad to see their books get into the hands of visually impaired , literature - hungry students , so I worked with Patti to put together the pitch below .
Please pass it along to all the YA writers you know .
I would love to see Patti ’s class start the school year with a magnificent library of hundreds and hundreds of fantastic YA books to choose from , so that they can start a lifelong love - affair with literature .
Thanks !
I am Patti Smith and I teach at OW Holmes , which is an elementary - middle
school in Detroit Public Schools in Detroit , Michigan .
My students are
visually impaired , ranging in age from 2nd grade to 8th grade .
Five of
my students are Braille writers and two are learning Braille .
I would
love books for young adults in electronic format ( Word or RTF ) so that I can plug the
file into my computer program and emboss the book in Braille so my kids
can have something to read .
I have found it very difficult to find books for young adults ; most seem to be written for very young readers .
My Braille readers are all age 11 + and it is a challenge to find relevant books for them to read .
Thank you so much !!

Trump : Mr. Gadhafi , Tear Down
That Tent Libya leader packs up his tent ; wo n't stay in New York suburb .
Sept. 23 , 2009  --
It was n't the public outcry , but rather pressure from billionaire Donald Trump that forced Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to pack up his tent and apparently abandon a plan to spend the night in a ritzy New York suburb .
After a rambling , conspiracy - theory - filled speech delivered at the U.N. Wednesday morning , Gadhafi planned to spend the night in Bedford , N.Y. , where his agents Tuesday pitched a giant Bedouin tent on a property owned by Trump .
As local officials steamed at hosting an accused sponsor of terror , the Secret Service prepared to escort Gadhafi to the tony town outside New York City .
Just as the town was preparing to deal with the dictator next door , Donald Trump , who said he unknowingly rented a piece of his 113 - acre Seven Springs estate to the Libyan , stepped in and asked the leader to take down his tent and find housing elsewhere .
" We have requested that the tenant occupying the property in Bedford , N.Y. remove the tent that was erected .
They have complied with this request .
Additionally , Mr. Gadhafi will not be going to the property , " said Trump Organization spokeswoman Rhona Graff .
The tent was taken down just after Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano said the Secret Service told him Gadhafi would be going to Trump 's estate .
Spano 's office later told the Associated Press that the Secret Service informed him that Gadhafi would not be camping out in Bedford after all , but said that information " subject to change . "
" The town 's attorney , building inspector and police chief have visited the site and verified that the tent has been dismantled , " read a statement posted on the town 's Web site .
" Supervisor [ Lee ] Roberts thanked Donald Trump for his key role in bringing this situation to a close , " the statement read .
Following news Tuesday that Gadafhi would be staying in Bedford , town officials ordered the tent be dismantled , claiming it violated building codes .
Democratic U.S. Reps . John Hall and Nita Lowey appealed to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- who lives in Westchester County -- to do " everything in your power " to prevent Gadhafi from moving into his tent .
The so - called " mad dog of the Middle East " stayed in Manhattan Tuesday night close to the United Nations , where he addressed the General Assembly today .
Gadhafi , who followed President Obama to the podium , was introduced by his countryman as the " king of kings " and gave a marathon speech criticizing the U.N. and saying the Security Council should be renamed the " terror council . "
His reception in the United States has been as chilly as a desert night and his aides have wandered around the metro region trying to find a place to pitch their leader 's tent .
After being rejected by New York City 's Central Park and by the town of Englewood , N.J. , the Libyans posed as Dutch diplomats to rent a Manhattan town house that had a large roof that could have accommodated a tent .
When that deal fell through , the Libyans apparently used intermediaries to rent Trump 's 113 - acre estate called the Seven Springs in the posh Westchester County suburb of Bedford , home to such tyrants of taste as Martha Stewart .
As workers began pitching the tent , local officials were pitching a fit .
By Tuesday evening , as media helicopters filmed the progress of the tent 's construction , the Bedford town lawyer issued a stop work order because there was no permit for the tent .
Bedford town attorney Joel Sachs said a stop work order was issued on the tent just after 5 p.m .
Tuesday because it is illegal to build a temporary residence without a permit .
He called the tent an " illegal structure . "
" If no activity has been undertaken , so far as either removing the tent or other equipment , or removing any individuals who may be residing in the tent , then we would then proceed to take one of two types of enforcement actions , " Sachs told The Associated Press .
He said the town might " seek an injunction to have the tent taken down , and individuals residing in the tent removed from the property . "
Gadhafi's Tent Is Perfumed
Gadhafi 's tent has accompanied him on trips to Paris , Rome and Moscow .
He apparently distrusts elevators and needs space for his all - female security team .
Diane Sawyer , anchor of " Good Morning America , " said today that she has been in Gadhafi 's tent in Libya .
" It 's perfumed , you should know , " Sawyer said .
State and federal politicians who learned that Gadhafi had rented property in the area were outraged that the Libyan , who has been linked to acts of state - sponsored terror , might sleep among their constituents .
" He 's not going to have many fans in Bedford or Westchester County , certainly not me .
Do n't want to see him in my county or my district .
There 's not going to be any welcome mat for him in Bedford , " Republican State Sen. Vincent L. Leibell said .
U.S. Rep .
Hall said he would contact the State Department and other federal authorities to protest Gadhafi 's presence in his district .
" This sponsor of terror is not welcome here , " Hall said .
" Several residents of this area were horrifically murdered on Pan Am Flight 103 .
Gadhafi 's presence in our community is a slap in the face to the memories of these victims and their families , adding to the recent outrage of the hero 's welcome Gadhafi staged for the convicted murderer released by Scotland . "
Gadhafi 's plans have been greeted with similar sentiments elsewhere .
In August , Englewood residents protested the possibility of Gadhafi pitching a tent on property there owned by the Libyan Embassy .
Iranian Leader Also Finds Welcome Mat Pulled
Many of the Englewood residents were particularly incensed by the release of Abdelbaset al - Megrahi , a Libyan imprisoned in Scotland for the 1988 bombing of Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , who was warmly welcomed home by Gadhafi last month .
" Frankly speaking , I 'm glad he wo n't be sleeping in my city limits , " said Michael Wildes , mayor of Englewood and an immigration lawyer .
" I can't understand why he wo n't be served an arrest warrant for the 38 citizens of New Jersey that died in the Lockerbie disaster .
" It is my prayer that the State Department will issue a restrictive visa so he wo n't , under the cover of night , sneak into my town , " Wildes said .
Gadhafi is n't the only world leader who has had trouble finding a place to stay for this week 's world summit .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran , had a difficult time finding a spot to hang up a favorite khaki - colored sports coat .
When he arrived in New York in 2007 to address the General Assembly and students at Columbia University , Iran 's Ahmadinejad was met with protests .
In 2007 , he was considered a pariah who denied the Holocaust , called for the destruction of Israel and pursued an internationally condemned nuclear weapons program .
Following an allegedly botched and rigged presidential election in June , Ahmadinejad has suppressed protests at home while renewing his rhetoric about the Holocaust and , according to some , continuing efforts to develop nuclear weapons .
The Iranian president , as it turns out , will stay near the U.N. at InterContinental 's Barclay , a fact that the hotel is not exactly advertising .
The accommodations for the Iranians were first revealed by the protest group United Against Nuclear Iran , and sources have confirmed the account to ABC News .
The UANI has been unable to get the InterContinental to give Ahmadinejad the boot , but several other New York hotels that were planning on allowing Ahmadinejad to hold dinners abandoned the president after being targeted by the group .
The Helmsley Hotel and catering hall Gotham Hall both canceled receptions that Ahmadinejad planned on holding in New York .
" As soon as Helmsley corporate management learned of the possibility of either the Iranian mission or President Ahmadinejad holding a function at the New York Helmsley Hotel , they immediately ordered the cancellation of that function , " said Helmsley spokesman Howard Rubenstein in a statement .
" Neither the Iranian mission nor President Ahmadinejad is welcome at any Helmsley facility .
The Helmsley organization is grateful to United Against Nuclear Iran for bringing this matter to its attention so that appropriate action could be taken , " he said .
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai bowed to Western pressure Tuesday , agreeing to take part in a presidential runoff vote in two weeks .
Hamid Karzai failed to score a first round win in August 's election .
Karzai , who will face his main challenger Abdullah Abdullah in the November 7 second round , said he was putting his country 's interests over his own .
" It was not important who the winner is , and we need to leave this to the people of Afghanistan to judge who the winner was , " Karzai said at a news conference through an interpreter .
" Whether I am the winner or not , it 's probably in my interest , but I prefer the national interest of Afghanistan over my personal interests . "
Western powers , particularly the United States , had been pushing Karzai to accept the final election results in order to ensure Afghanistan has a legitimate government , particularly as Washington considers beefing up its military presence there .
Karzai spoke shortly after Afghanistan 's Independent Election Commission certified the election results , which gave him less than the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff .
The U.N. - backed Electoral Complaints Commission had invalidated nearly a third of Karzai 's votes from the August 20 presidential election because of " clear and convincing evidence of fraud . "
Last month , final uncertified results showed Karzai with 54 percent .
" We welcome the decision made by the Independent Election Commission , we believe the session is legitimate , legal and according to the constitution of Afghanistan , " Karzai said Tuesday .
" It 's going to be a historic period that we all are waiting to go through . "
The International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in Afghanistan said that it would " support the Afghan National Security Forces ' preparations to ensure a safe runoff election . "
Spokesman Col .
Wayne
Shanks said that ISAF had been preparing for a possible runoff election " for some time . "
" As in the election 's first round , ISAF will only provide third - layer of security , reinforcing the Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army in line with the security plan signed by the chairman of the Afghan Independent Election Commission along with representatives from the Afghan Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defense , and ISAF in 2008 , " Shanks said .
Karzai's decision was immediately hailed by U.S. Sen .
John Kerry , one of several Western representatives who appeared alongside the Afghan president at Tuesday 's delayed news conference .
Kerry , who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Karzai 's decision to participate in the runoff " will allow the national leadership to govern with legitimacy . "
" We believe with this decision by the president today that a time of enormous uncertainty has been transformed into a great opportunity , " Kerry said .
Watch President Karzai and Sen. John Kerry discuss runoff elections »
Minutes after the news conference concluded , U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement praising Karzai for accepting the election results and agreeing to a second round of voting .
" While this election could have remained unresolved to the detriment of the country , President Karzai 's constructive actions established an important precedent for Afghanistan 's new democracy , " Obama said .
Obama is considering sending more troops to Afghanistan , and Kerry has said the results of the country 's election should be settled before the United States makes any decision on troop levels .

Abdullah told CNN on Monday he was prepared to participate in a runoff , but said " the door is open " to other alternatives .
" There are some practical questions ahead , " Abdullah told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , citing winter , the security situation " and other realities on the ground . "
If the election were not held by early November , winter weather would make voting impossible in some areas and force a delay until spring of 2010 , according to Afghanistan 's ambassador to the United States , Said Jawad .
Such a delay , he warned , would be a " recipe for disaster " that would create confusion in Afghanistan and heighten tension between the United States and Karzai 's government .
The cost of government has exploded in recent years and if we do n't act fast , the price will continue to soar , eventually leaving affordable government out of the reach of many .
Already we have millions of people without government .
You see them all around you , hanging out on street corners , unemployed , smoking pot , begging .
Without explicitly provisioning for more government , we will be responsible for these people anyway .
We will have to taser them and jail them and feed them .
And that will mean an even higher cost of government .
We are on the brink of disaster .
And we can clearly see that the private sector has failed .
Unbridled capitalism has failed .
Competition among greedy , self - centered individuals has utterly failed to lower the price of government .
Only a public plan can hope to stall the rapid and unsustainable growth in government .
Many people have already written to , called , or visited their legislators about this current crisis .
One woman broke down in tears when describing her life without government .
Fortunately , a kindly and gracious politician immediately provided her some life - saving government , but without drastic , quick action , millions of other Americans will die without equal access .

With the new public option , people who wish to remain at their current level of government can do so , but those who are ready to step boldly into the future can opt in .
The new plan offers not only more government , but also better , more affordable government .
The essential insight is to allow those who opt into the public option to not bear the costs of the plan .
They can all get more government for free .
Indeed , with more government , we can lower the cost of all government .
Administrative overhead will be minimized .
Organizational synergies can be effected .
Just imagine how convenient it will be to pick up your government at the same place where you get your mail or recycle your garbage .
And it is not only that the direct costs of government will be lowered with more government : there are numerous indirect costs that will fall as well .
Our justice system is plagued with multiple private competitors suing each other over frivolous contract and intellectual property violations .
Individuals also sue corporations for fraud or breach of contract , and vice versa .
Many of these inefficient judicial proceedings can be replaced with a single , effective federal agency in charge of dispute resolution .
The whole process can be streamlined to ensure quick , accurate , and fair decisions to any conflict .
Furthermore , not only can we make government better , cheaper , and more efficient by making it larger , we can also leverage these same principles and apply them to other vital issues .
We have been fighting wars all across the globe for decades with no end in sight .
We have been legislating against climate change for years .
We have been regulating financial entities and maintaining a tight grip on health care .
We have been monopolizing the price of money .

We have been going about it all wrong .
The right solution is more .
( The left solution is also more . )
More soldiers will end the war faster .
More legislation will end pollution .
More regulation will stop our economic malaise and make everyone healthier .
A bigger , more secretive Federal Reserve will be able to issue more money and keep the currency stronger .
But these changes should not be incremental or marginal .
The mistake we have been making is to think that we need " just a little more " to accomplish our goals .
This is an error .
There is no single piece of legislation short enough to be read by those voting for it that can do what needs to be done .

To have maximal effect , we need sweeping new legislation and powers .
Powers so sweeping , we wo n't know for years or decades what they really mean .
In some cases , we may never find out .
In the days and weeks to come , you will be introduced to a variety of new agencies , committees , and entities formed for the purpose of reducing the costs of government and increasing the availability of government to all .
To the extent certain unavoidable payments are to be incurred , they will be paid for through debt and various esoteric operations by the Fed .
And not to worry — even the future interest payments will be paid for through new debt issues as needed .
We have indeed discovered a way to guarantee more government to everybody with nobody of consequence paying more .
We will be putting this plan into action immediately , with or without your approval , so you are encouraged to publicly express support for the plan in order to be among the first to receive your generous share of the increased government .
A glorious new world order is right around the corner , if only we have the courage and conviction to see it through .
Perhaps someday we can all live in a world where no one wants any more government .

Mini sats to improve Earth observation
A constellation of miniature satellites working as a group could better monitor disasters , map the planet and help improve climate predictions , says an Australian engineer .
Dr Xiaofeng
Wu of the University of Sydney has developed a control system for such satellites and presented his research at the 9th Australian Space Sciences Conference in Sydney .
Wu 's control system that predicts the trajectory of a satellite 's nearest neighbours and communicates this prediction via a wireless network and on - board computer .
The satellites , which are still at the development stage , will measure 10 centimetres cubed and fly up to 22 kilometres apart .
Each will communicate via a ' protocol ' similar to wireless networks , or WiFi , and use a predictive model to compensate for any delay in receiving signals .
" In communicating with each other to find out the neighbouring satellite 's attitude and position , there is a delay and information packet loss in wireless communications , " says Wu .
Constant communication
" To address this , the control system on board each satellite predicts each [ other 's ] attitude and calculates this on board , then compares it to the actual satellite attitude .
The information is used to adjust the controls on board the satellite . "
The satellites need to consider other satellite 's attitudes in a continual loop in order to achieve their performance , he says .
So far , Wu has built hardware for attitude determination and control .
He also has the satellite structure and on board computers , as well as the communication protocol for inter-satellite communication .
He is working with the colleagues in the UK to develop the virtual space sensor architecture and is seeking funding from the Australian space sciences research program .
Better coverage
When built , the satellites could be deployed into a low Earth orbit equipped with sensors .
" You can cover a much wider area than you can with terrestrial [ sensors ] and transmit signals to ground stations at almost real time , " says Wu .
Miniature satellite networks could be used for surveillance and reconnaissance , humanitarian and disaster assistance , collecting weather and ocean data and monitoring forest fires .
Professor John Le Marshall , senior scientist in charge of future satellites systems for the Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne says the system would be a useful way of deploying instruments .
He says it is a logical extension of satellite systems such as NASA 's A - Train satellite constellation , a line of six satellites that follow each other in orbit around the Earth .
" Instead of putting all the satellites on the same flight like Battlestar Galactica , if you put them in a constellation you reduce the risk that you have the same observations of the same area at the same time , " he says .
Minister for oil says any non-state sanctioned organisations in the industry will be ' suspected of plotting against revolution '

Employees of oil companies in Venezuela have protested against an ultimatum by President Hugo Chávez 's government to embrace the socialist revolution or face the sack .
Hundreds of workers picketed a refinery yesterday and said they would mobilise next week to challenge the politicisation of the state oil company , PDVSA .
The unrest followed a government warning this week that employees would be suspected of subversion unless they joined pro-Chávez trade unions and community groups .
" By now there should not be one single counter - revolutionary left in the heart of the oil trade unions .
We must stay on alert , " Rafael Ramírez , the oil minister and head of PDVSA , said in a televised speech .
" There can not be one single state company where socialist committees do not exist .
Any state companies lacking a socialist committee shall be suspected of plotting against the revolution . "
The minister said the nationalised oil industry , which drives Venezuela 's economy , must advance the president 's radical agenda .
" The oligarchy has to fear us , because we hate the oligarchy .
PDVSA will be here at the forefront of the revolution under the leadership of Commander Chávez . "
Oligarchy is government shorthand for opponents .
The minister , who doubles up as head of the oil company and is a close ally of the president , added that he would not negotiate a collective labour contract " with any enemy of Chávez " .
Union leaders condemned the comments as an attack on workers ' political rights and said they would march in protest .
" It 's an irresponsible statement .
We wo n't accept it , " one leader , Froilan Barrios , told a press conference .
Even union leaders who support the government said the comments went too far .
The oil industry has been at the heart of Venezuela 's transformation under Chávez since he defeated a strike by PDVSA workers in 2002 - 03 .
Thousands of employees were sacked and replaced with government supporters , who swelled the payroll to 80,000 .
To bypass inefficient ministries , Chávez entrusted the company with an operating income of $ 126bn ( £ 77bn ) , with multiple tasks such as adult education , food distribution and bicycle manufacturing .
But production has slumped by a quarter and after prices tumbled from last year 's peak and the company , once an Opec powerhouse , has struggled to pay creditors and employees who were absorbed by PDVSA after recent state takeovers of private oil contractors .

And though there is no credible word yet on the origin of all these Android MID pics that keep making the rounds , there has been much speculation .
As SlashGear points out , the device has more than a passing resemblance to the Wallet , which France 's eviGroup has been threatening to lay on the world since back in May ( a 5 - inch touchscreen device touted as " halfway between a cellphone and a TabletPC " ) .
And if that is n't enough , someone named focus3G has been furiously posting new pics of the thing on his Twitpic account for two weeks now -- we 've contacted him for an explanation to no avail ( not yet , at least ) .
But what do you think ?
Hit the gallery below , and let the speculation begin .
Binary compatibility between releases .
Technically , it 's byte code compatibility in Android 's case .
Maemo lacks it , which means hard time for developers with every new release .
Android is better positioned at mid-end smartphone market , where it will compete with Symbian OS .
Better game development , especially cross-platform game development .
Qt can ( and should ! ) be used for cross-platform development for both Maemo and Symbian OS , which equals developing with modern app dev framework for the largest smartphone install base .
Technically , both Maemo and Android run on Linux kernels .
However , Maemo is a full Linux distro , based on Debian , while Android is a sole kernel with a few programs on top of it ( namely , Dalvik virtual machine and Sqlite database ) .
On Adnroid all applications run within Dalvik virtual machine , which is heavily optimized and modified version of Java virtual machine ( JVM ) .
I tried to analyze the benefits of each platform from the perspective of a software developer , as well as platforms ' current " strategic position " .
If you are too busy to read all the details , there is a shortparagraph at the end of each chapter .
Development .
Maemo SDK is Linux - only .
It 's not a problem for me ( as Linux is my OS of choice ) , but it may be a problem for many developers .
SDK works best on Debian or Debian - based distros ( e.g. Ubuntu ) .
Maemo is also a Debian - based distro , so SDK simply uses Scratchbox cross-compilation toolkit to build for both x86 and ARM architectures .
Maemo applications are developed in GTK +
using Hildon application framework .
Naturally , the primary language of Maemo application development is C .
Other languages can also be used , as GTK + has bindings for many programming languages , including C++ , Java , C# , Ruby etc .
However , most applications will be developed in C , mainly due to performance constraints , which are especially actual for mobile devices .
GTK + itself is a bit archaic by today 's standards , and although Hildon is specifically targeted for touch - screen interfaces , most of work is still done in GTK + and good old C .
Thus , the development platform is not on par with modern mobile application development environments such as iPhone SDK , Android SDK , or Palm WebOS Mojo SDK .
This may change with Maemo 6 release ( codenamed " Harmattan " ) when Qt libraries will be supported and Qt will become Maemo official application development framework .
But this will happen somewhere in 2011 , so for now Maemo application development is a step behind that of Android .
As multiple commenters pointed out , Qt should beused for Maemo application development .
It 's a modern way to develop cross-platform apps that will run on both Maemo and Symbian OS ( as well as Windows / Mac OS X / Linux , although it may not be practical to use similar UI for both desktop and mobile software ) .
The earlier Qt becomes official application development framework for Maemo and Symbian OS , the better .
Android SDK is available for Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X. Applications are developed in Java and the development platform is really easy to get into .
It features XML ( DSL ) for GUI interface building , easy strings internationalization , app storage within SQLite database , background processes management etc .
To make a long story short , it 's how modern mobile application development platform should look like .
The only downside is that all applications are in Java , and for some developers Java became the synonym of slowness ( although it 's not that slow on Android , as Dalvik VM is specifically optimized for running on it ) .
For such developers , there is an option of using Native Android SDK , although its capabilities are very limited , especially in hardware access department .
Porting existing applications .
In this area , Maemo has a huge advantage over Android , as it's a full Debian based distro .
With the help of Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit many open - source tools can be compiled for ARM architecture .
A number of command line utilities can be ported with a simple cross-compilation , GUI apps usually require UI rewrite , but anyway it 's much easier to port open - source app to Maemo than to write it from scratch .
Some of the famous open - source apps are already ported to Maemo : MPlayer , Pidgin , Gnumeric , Abiword and many others .
On Android , porting an open - source app from x86 Linux is almost as hard as porting an app from any other platform : all UI and logic has to be rewritten from scratch .
Both platforms are aimed at the same vertical market : .
Maemo is backed by Nokia alone , while Android is backed by Open Handset Alliance , whose members include Google , Samsung , LG , Motorola , HTC , Acer and others .
Nokia may be the largest mobile phone and smartphone manufacturer on the planet , but it cannot compete with such a might .
Thus , it 's obvious that in the nearest future Android devices will outnumber Maemo devices by a large margin .
There should be 18 Android devices released by the end of the year , while there will be only 4 Maemo devices released by that time ( Nokia N770 , N800 , N810 , N900 ) .
Even if N900 and new Maemo MIDs , and finally netbooks will sell better than their Android counterparts , the total install base of Android devices will grow faster than that of Maemo devices .
The larger install base , the more OS is interesting for developers ( assuming , it has a decent app dev platform ) .
Nokia 's main competitors - Samsung and LG - will use Android as a competitive advantage , and throw their development and marketing efforts behind this platform .
Motorola is trying to save itself with its MOTOCLIQ aggressive pricing and MOTOBLUR Android software , and it has the chances to succeed !.
Under the circumstances , Maemo becomes Nokia 's main competitive advantage , so the company should throw its efforts behind it or lose market leadership .
The position of fierce competition ensures the bright future for both platforms .
However , which platform will finally win is another question , and perhaps the most interesting one .
The logical winner is Android : it 'll have larger install base in the nearest future ; more developers will work on apps for Android ; it is backed by powerful corporations , mighty Google among them .
Nevertheless , there is a single power that can keep Maemo up float and possibly even make it prevail in the long term : .
You 'd argue : both Maemo and Android are open source .
What matters is whether the platform could benefit from countless man-years of efforts , done by open - source community .
Android benefits only from Linux kernel development and a small number of other open - source projects , all Android apps have to be written from scratch .
Contrary to that , any open - source project which runs on Linux indirectly contributes into Maemo software ecosystem ( as it can be relatively easily ported ) .
Maemo has to use this to its own advantage , or it has no chance against Android .
Thus , Maemo core developers should make this advantage even bigger by easing the process of porting open - source apps to Maemo , which can be achieved by migrating from ARM to x86 at some point .
Another advantage of Maemo is that it 's more suitable for larger devices - MIDs and netbooks .
Maemo was designed to run on MIDs , and it already proved its worth in this area .
Being a Debian - based distro , Maemo will probably fit well on touchscreen netbooks as well .
Android looks good on smartphones , but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough for netbooks .
There is a chance that Android will succeed on smartphone market , while Maemo will prevail on MIDs and netbooks .
Either Android or Maemo , Linux will win after all :)
As much as you may prefer Android , Maemo , or other smartphone OS , the ideal situation for smartphone market as a whole would be healthy competition between a few major platforms , not a single platform dominance .
Maemo and Android are both open - source and overly good operating systems , so it will be good if they become those dominate platforms , not killing each other , but competing in equilibrium for years , bringing innovation along the way .
For more insights and opinions on topic , please read the comments below and the article 's discussions on Reddit , and Maemo Talk Summarizing the opinions , I 've listed the following advantages of each platform :

It was pretty much the perfect story :
The Senate introduced a bill that would let the President take over the entire internet during a crisis .
Our online Weimar Republic is crumbling beneath the digital Führer !
Minor catch :
It was n't true .
Advertisement
Credit to Nicholas Thompson over at Epicenter , who spent some quality time with the bill :
[ I ] n its original form , did have some seriously bad ideas in it .
For example , in an emergency , the president could " order the limitation or shutdown of Internet traffic to and from any compromised Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information system or network . "
Advertisement
And then , Senate procedure happened .
The softened , pared - down language of the current bill would only entitle the President to , " In the event of an immediate threat to strategic national interests involving compromised Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information system or network " help to " direct the national response " to a crisis , " in coordination with relevant industry sectors . "
As Thompson notes , nothing scary is granted here , and the President definitely has n't been authorized to take over private networks , for malign ends , for fun , or otherwise .
In reality , the bill might actually aid transparency , oddly enough : Thompson highlights a theory that , by ensuring the government 's digital emergency management powers are kept out of the less accountable hands of the NSA and in the public view , abuses are less likely .
So there 's that !

Many of the problems we have with the Federal Government today can be traced back to a critical year .
That year was 1913 , the year in which the 16th and 17th Amendments were ratified and the Federal Reserve Act was passed , which set up the Federal Reserve Bank .
Of course , the seeds of the Statist Revolution of 1913 were sown earlier , but that was the year that the bad seeds took permanent root , where the Federal Government finally removed all semblance of being balanced by the states , and spawned the monstrosity we have today .
The 16th Amendment allowed Congress to directly levy an income tax on U.S. citizens without apportioning it among the states .
Prior to this , Congress ’s authority to levy an income tax was limited and could only levy direct taxes on the states ( as determined by census counts ) .
There is some dispute over how much this affected the balance of power between the states and the federal government , but its passage was ( at least ) symbolic and represented a key time when the Federal Government determined to increasingly tax incomes , and when – because of this assertion of its power to directly tax – it felt more able to take on debt .
The 17th Amendment allowed for the direct election of U.S. senators so that rather than having state legislatures elect senators – ensuring that the senators would be answerable to the states – they were elected by popular vote , nationalizing the elections and bringing national special interests into the funding of senatorial campaigns .
In effect , it created a structural and incentive problem that shifted power away from the states and since that time the states have become more and more subservient satellites to a hegemonic national force .
Finally , the Federal Reserve Act which set up the Federal Reserve System and Central Bank in the United States , has resulted in economic catastrophe , impoverishing inflation ( and subsequent dollar depreciation ) and wealth - destroying boom - bust cycles .
The net effect has been that the states no longer are effective counter - weights to the Federal Government , and the Federal Government now rules with impunity .
Indeed , it has reduced the states to pawns in its statist moves .
Perhaps the most insidious practice the Federal Government engages in is that of unfunded mandates , wherein the Federal Government dictates to a state how it must act , while simultaneously compelling the state to pay for the program .
Attempts to limit this in the past have failed to stop the harmful practice .
In essence , the states and its citizens are then enslaved by Federal Government .
Even the ultra-liberal Janet Napolitano , the former governor of AZ and current Head of Homeland Security recently expressed exasperation with the harmful effects that Washington DC ’s unfunded mandates have on the states .
One way to turn a Big Government liberal into an advocate for states rights is to just make her responsible for implementing and finding confiscatory takings to pay for a Big Government as mandate .
It is just this outrage felt by both conservatives and liberals in state governments that is pointing to a way forward .
The first step in the process is that the states must assert their sovereignty , which is their right under the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
It reads :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
The glimmer of hope now felt is that many states are beginning to assert their sovereignty .
There is a movement under foot , a bi-partisan movement at the state level , called the 10th Amendment Movement .
Within this movement state lawmakers are introducing legislation which asserts their power to regulate matters not specifically and constitutionally delegated to the federal government .
In Arizona , this legislation recently passed the House and Senate and could soon be signed into law .
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona , the Senate concurring , that : 1 . That the State of Arizona hereby claims sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States .
2 . That this Resolution serves as notice and demand to the federal government , as our agent , to cease and desist , effective immediately , mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers .
3 . That all compulsory federal legislation that directs states to comply under threat of civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or requires states to pass legislation or lose federal funding be prohibited or repealed .
4 . That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the United States , the President of the United States Senate , the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate of each state ’s legislature and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona .
Thirty - five states have introduced similar legislation this year .
For those of you keeping count , yes , that is more than a two - thirds majority , which is all that would be required under Article V of the Constitution to call a constitutional convention – the “ nuclear option ” the states have to modify the constitution and by those means strip the Federal Government of the powers it currently unjustly employs to harm the states .
This is a psychologically important fact .
Now , the important part .
You need to get involved .
First , look at this map to see the status of state sovereignty legislation in your state .
Second , call your state legislators – find their contact information here – to either express support of the legislation if it is in process , or express your desire to see the legislation introduced if it has not yet been .
Third , ask your friends , co-workers , employees , family members , and neighbors to join you in this effort .
Share with them this video ( also embedded below ) .
If you are the type that loathes “ talking politics ” with others , do n’t worry , this is n’t a partisan thing and is something that people of all stripes are supporting – majorities of Americans see the federal government as meddlesome and overwhelmingly disapprove of Congress .
Now , there is an additional thing you can do .
You can also contact your U.S. Legislators and support the Enumerated Powers Act that has been introduced in the House by John Shadegg .
Tell them you want them to support HR 450 .
It wo n’t limit their powers or what they do , but by requiring all legislation to enumerate powers , it returns the focus to the constitution and builds evidence that can later be used to restrict powers , evidence the states can use later to document abuse and remove federal power .
The United States is a nation of 50 constitutional republics bound by a common federal constitution .
The federal government was constitutionally never intended to be a Leviathan and in fact the Constitution was established precisely to prevent what has happened today .
It is the states ’ constitutional right to have sovereignty in all areas not expressly delegated by the constitution .
While efforts to overturn the 16th and 17th amendments and abolish the Federal Reserve system face significant uphill battles , the fight is more winnable if the states are willing to reclaim their constitutional sovereignty .
The federal government wo n’t be reformed from within .
Only an irate , tireless minority keen to set brush fires of liberty in the minds of others can inspire the states to us the power of the 10th Amendment to slay Leviathan .

READ IT BEFORE IT'S BANNED BY THE US GOVERNMENT
PART 27 By Thomas R. Horn October 13 , 2009 NewsWithViews.com
Previously we summarized Hall ’s comments about the " mass of occult and Masonic symbols " on the Great Seal , which he believed only students of archaic or esoteric symbolism would be able to accurately decipher .
This included the obverse side of the Great Seal , where a bald eagle , which he illustrated was a shrewd mythical phoenix so important to Masonic mysticism , clutches a bundle of arrows in its left talon , while its right claw grips an olive branch .
" But , " Hall then went on to say :
If this design on the obverse side of the seal is stamped with the signature of the Order of the Quest , the design on the reverse is even more definitely related to the old Mysteries . …
Here is represented the great pyramid of Gizah , composed of thirteen rows of masonry , showing seventy - two stones .
The pyramid is without a cap stone , and above its upper platform floats a triangle containing the all - seeing eye surrounded by rays of light . …
The combination of the phoenix , the pyramid , and the all - seeing eye is more than chance or coincidence . …
There is only one possible origin for these symbols , and that is the secret societies which came to this country 150 years before the Revolutionary War . …
There can be no question that the great seal was directly inspired by these orders of the human Quest , and that it set forth the purpose for this nation as that purpose was seen and known to the Founding Fathers .
As Manly Hall did , thirty - third vice president of the United States and 32nd - Degree Mason Henry Wallace also viewed the unfinished pyramid with the all - seeing eye hovering above it on the Great Seal as central to the prophecy of a New World Order .
Whenever the United States assumed its position as the capital of the world , he believed , the Grand Architect would return and metaphorically the all - seeing eye would be fitted atop the pyramid as the finished " apex stone . "
But Whose All - Seeing Eye Is This , Anyway ?
While different versions of the eye of providence or all - seeing eye have appeared throughout time within various cultures , the origin of each can usually be understood within the context of its adjoined symbolism .
In the case of the all - seeing eye on the Great Seal of the United States , the connection to the uncapped Egyptian pyramid and to the Osiris - Apollo - related mottoes positively determines the culture to which this specific " eye " refers , and the solar deity represented by it - Osiris / Horus / Apollo / Nimrod .
This is further illustrated by the " numerological values " of the arcane mottoes , which were carefully chosen for the Great Seal due to their connection to the pagan deity .
So important was it that the Masonic numbers three ( 3 ) and thirteen ( 13 ) be reinforced with the multi-named " god " ( the numbers three and thirteen are historically connected with the deities Apollo , Osiris , and Nimrod , and this is why , for instance , the American space mission Apollo 13 was named after the deity and had this number ) , that not only was the original amount of American states intentionally set at thirteen , but Freemason David Ovason , whom Robert Hieronimus ( considered one of the the world ’s foremost authorities on the Great Seal ) calls " exceptionally well referenced , " confirms how a letter was " cut " from the Latin word saeclorum ( the usual spelling ) in order to create the word seclorum to contribute to three sets of thirteen on the reverse side of the Great Seal .
After acknowledging that the top motto , annuit coeptis , had the obligatory thirteen letters , Ovason pointed out how saeclorum was letter - cut to join the bottom motto , novus ordo seclorum , so that the phrase would end up being seventeen letters , which when added to the nine numerals in the Roman date would equal a total of twenty - six , or two sets of the number thirteen .
Combined with the top motto , these three sets of thirteen were very important to establish , Ovason says , in order to reflect the trinity represented in the Great Seal " Eye of Providence , and in the nominal triangle from which the pyramid is constructed . "
Based purely on the Great Seal ’s symbolism , the trinity these three sets of the number thirteen denote is authoritatively identified as Osiris , Horus , and Isis , the pagan versions of Father , Son , and Holy Spirit , respectively .
The use of the number thirteen in this way also connects the Great Seal to the mythological and astrological significance of the legend of Osiris as the dying and rising god .
It was evidently so important to maintain this talisman - like value , thirteen , that other phases of the design and layout of Washington DC were coordinated accordingly , says Ovason .
This includes the laying of the White House cornerstone on October 13 , 1792 , by Masons , and the Fourth of July signing of the Declaration of Independence thirteen days after summer solstice , so that the sun would be on Sirius .
In Egyptian mythology , the sun represented Osiris while the star Sirius symbolized Isis , and thirteen was the number of pieces of Osiris that Isis was able to find after Seth , his evil brother , murdered and threw fourteen pieces of him into the Nile .
Isis searched the riverbank until she recovered every piece , except for his genitals , which had been swallowed by a fish .
Isis replaced the missing organ with an obelisk and magically impregnated herself with Horus .
Therefore , in Masonic as well as in ancient Egyptian mythology , the number thirteen — used a total of thirteen times on the Great Seal , counting front and back — is the number that represents the return or resurrection of Osiris .
This mythology was so meaningful to the founding of the United States and the construction of its capital — including having the missing Osiris genitalia represented by the 6,666 - inches - high Egyptian obelisk known as the Washington Monument — that nearly all of David Ovason ’s five hundred - plus - page Secret Architecture of Our Nation ’s Capital is dedicated to establishing the singular correlation between Washington DC and Virgo , the constellation of Isis , or what Ovason calls , " Isis , who was the chief of the feminine mystery deities and the prototype of the steller Virgo . "
This affiliation existed from the very day Freemasons gathered on April 15 , 1791 , beginning appropriately at 3:30 PM ( reflecting the mystical value , thirty - three ) because of the astrological position of Jupiter and Virgo , and what this would mean for the secret destiny of America :
At exactly 3:30 PM , Jupiter … began to rise over the horizon .
It was in 23 degrees of Virgo . …
By this means , the zodiacal power of Virgo , which was called in later Masonic circles " the Beautiful Virgin , " was able to stamp her benign influence on the building of the federal city .…
A few of the many Freemasons present at this ceremony would have been only to well aware of the profound implications of what they were doing . …
It is quite clear that the ceremonial placing of the stone related to more than merely the founding of the federal district : it was somehow linked to the future destiny of America itself .
By dedicating the United States through its astrological alignment to the constellation of Isis , the founders had dedicated the " destiny " of America to fulfilling the secret doctrine of Freemasonry , as also reflected in the Osiris / Apollo symbolism of the Great Seal , concerning subservience — now and upon his return as Antichrist — to Osiris / Apollo / Nimrod .
Interestingly , the same dedication to Osiris / Isis / Apollo exists in New York where the events of September 11 , 2001 , initiated the push toward the novus ordo seclorum .
The Statue of Liberty in New York ’s Harbor , which holds the Masonic " Torch of Enlightenment , " was presented in 1884 as a gift to American Masons by the French Grand Orient Temple Masons .
Designed by French Freemason and sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by another French Freemason , Gustave Eiffel , the statue was originally identified as " the goddess Isis " with the statue ’s head formed to represent " the Greek Sun - god Apollo…as preserved on an ancient marble tablet ( today in the Archaeological Museum of Corinth , Corinth , Greece ) — Apollo was represented as a solar deity , dressed in a similar robe and having on its head a ‘ radiate crown ’ with the seven spiked rays of the Helios - Apollo ’s sun rays . "
The legend of Osiris and Isis , the connection with Apollo , the magical number thirteen , and the history surrounding their mythos is often openly discussed in Masonic and brotherhood - friendly literature .
For instance in Morals and Dogma , Albert Pike enumerated the esoteric significance of the Osiris epic at length , adding that lower - level Masons ( Blue Masonry ) are ignorant of its true meaning , which is only known to those who are " initiated into the Mysteries . "
Pike also spoke of the star Sirius — connected to Isis and at length to Lucifer / Satan — as " still glittering " in the Masonic lodges as " the Blazing Star . "
Elsewhere in Morals and Dogma , Pike reiterated that the " All - Seeing Eye…was the emblem of Osiris " and that the " Sun was termed by the Greeks the Eye of Jupiter , and the Eye of the World ; and his is the All - Seeing Eye in our Lodges . "
Once people understand this illuminated Masonic connection to the " trinity " on America ’s Great Seal , and what the prophetic symbolism , mottoes , and numerology imply , it becomes apparent why so much effort was put forward for so long by those who felt it was necessary to hide this extraordinary destiny .
Ovason acknowledges this conspiracy of silence as well :
The motto at the top of the seal , Annuit Coeptis , is from Virgil … from the Aeneid . …
This is a prayer to the god Jupiter .…
We should observe that while the subject matter of the reverse of the seal is undoubtedly pagan — if symbolic of hermetic Egypt — the superior motto is itself a prayer to a pagan god .
Could this be the reason why there has been so much reluctance to bring the reverse of the seal into the light of day ?
Whatever the nature of the god , the prayer directed in this way is a petition that the daring undertaking [ the secret destiny of America as symbolized in " finishing " the pyramid ] may be completed , and that the new age will find fulfillment .
Ovason , a Mason whose research earned praise from Fred Kleinknecht , Sovereign Grand Commander of the 33rd - Degree Supreme Council of Freemasons in Washington DC , is to be thanked for inadvertently revealing what the Illuminatus has secretly known for ages — that the Great Seal of the United States is a pagan prophecy and petition to a pagan god ( the same entity the Bible identifies by name as the end - times Antichrist ) to assist in the conclusion of the great work by his return .
" When we have grasped the importance of these New Age expectations , " Ovason concludes , " we shall be in a better position to understand why the design for this reverse [ side of the Great Seal ] has remained so consistently hidden . "
The Unfinished Pyramid Beneath the All - Seeing Eye
Where the numerology and astrological signs related to the all - seeing eye add to why certain symbolism on the Great Seal was important to Freemasons , it is the unfinished pyramid upon the seal ’s reverse side that Manly Hall called the " trestleboard " that set forth symbolically the " task to the accomplishment of which the United States Government was dedicated from the day of its inception . "
This language , drawn directly from how trestleboards are used and what they represent in both operative and speculative Masonry , is revealing , as the trestleboard is the board upon which the Master Mason draws out the diagrams and geometric figures that are to be used as a blueprint for directing the workers in the construction of the task .
In speculative Masonry , the trestleboard also takes on spiritual meaning , which reflects lessons from the Books of Nature and the will of the Great Architect of the Universe .
In Masonic rituals , this means a spiritual plan has been put in place and that it is to be carried out on an individual , family , social , national , and international level .
The plan includes the timing as to when the project should officially start , as well as generally when it is to be concluded .
Thus , if the pyramid on the Great Seal is the trestleboard laying out the " task of which the United States Government was dedicated from the day of its inception , " it is the drawing board for the destiny of America and is branded by 1 ) the identity of the Great Architect to whom the work is dedicated ; and 2 ) the date on which the work was started and is to be completed .
Concerning the first subject matter — the identity of the Great Architect — we have illustrated numerous times how the symbols and mottoes speak for themselves in communicating who this deity is .
In the prologue of his book , The Lost Keys of Freemasonry , Manly Hall joins in this revelation by recounting the familiar story of Hiram Abiff , the Tyrian " First Grand Master " of the order of Masons and the chief builder who sets out to construct the temple of the Great Architect of the Universe , but is killed by three spectres .
This story , impersonated every time an initiate reaches the level of Master Mason , is by admission of Freemasons a retelling of the death - epic of the god Osiris .
In Lost Keys , Hall narrates how the Great Architect gives Hiram ( Osiris ) the trestleboard for the construction of the great temple , and when he is killed by three ruffians , the Great Architect bathes him in " a glory celestial , " as in the glory surrounding the all - seeing eye of Osisis above the pyramid on the Great Seal .
The Great Architect follows this by charging those who would finish the building with the task of finding the body of Hiram ( Osiris ) and raising him from the dead .
When this has been accomplished , the great work will conclude and the god will inhabit the temple :
Seek ye where the broken twig lies and the dead stick molds away , where the clouds float together and the stones rest by the hillside , for all these mark the grave of Hiram [ Osiris ] who has carried my Will with him to the tomb .
This eternal quest is yours until ye have found your Builder , until the cup giveth up its secret , until the grave giveth up its ghosts .
No more shall I speak until ye have found and raised my beloeved Son [ Osiris ] , and have listened to the words of my Messenger and with Him as your guide have finished the temple which I shall then inhabit .
Amen .
" So once again we are brought back to the Great Pyramid of Giza , " writes Peter Goodgame , " the first built and last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world , which is the reputed resting place of Osiris .
The Great Pyramid itself is but one structure within a major Necropolis that was designed according to the layout of the constellation Orion , the Great Hunter in the sky [ Osiris / Gilgamesh / Nimrod ] .
As we have endeavored to show , Osiris is none other than the Biblical Nimrod , the ‘ mighty hunter before the Lord . ’ "
Advertisement The Encyclopedia of Freemasonry identifies the character Nimrod with this legend of the Brotherhood as well , in the Old Constitutions , where it distinguishes him as a founder of Masonry .
" Thus in the York MS. , No. 1 , we read : ‘ At ye making of ye toure of Babell there was a Masonrie first much esteemed of , and the King of Babilon yt called Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Masons . ’ "
Other authorities not only connect the Masonic founder Hiram Abiff with Osiris and Nimrod , but explain that Nimrod plus the building of the Tower of Babel — not the temple of Solomon — was the true origin of Masonic cosmology .
In Symbols of Freemasonry , translated from the French Les Symboles des Francs - Macons , Daniel Beresniak notes :
The date of the construction of King Solomon ’s temple has not always been the key date in the Freemasons ’ cosmology .
This central role was once given to the Tower of Babel .
The Regius manuscript , which predates Cooke [ 1410 ] by twenty years , cites King Nemrod , the builder of that famous tower , as " the first and most excellent master . "
He it was , and not King Solomon , who gave the Masons their first " charge , " their rules of conduct and professional code . …
A Masonic text known as the Thistle manuscript , of 1756 , says that Nemrod " created the Masons " and " gave them their signs and terms so that they could distinguish themselves from other people … it was the first time that the Masons were organised as a craft . "
Thus the appearance of the uncapped pyramid of Giza on the Great Seal of the United States echoes the ancient pagan as well as Masonic beliefs concerning the old mysteries , and the prophecy of the return of Osiris / Apollo / Nimrod .
In Rosicrucian and Masonic Origins , Manly Hall , who had said in The Secret Teachings of All Ages that the Great Pyramid was " the tomb of Osiris , " explains that Preston , Gould , Mackey , Oliver , Pike , and nearly every other great historian of Freemasonry were aware of this connection between Freemasonry and the ancient mysteries and primitive ceremonials based on Osiris .
" These eminent Masonic scholars have all recognized in the legend of Hiram Abiff an adaptation of the Osiris myth ; nor do they deny that the major part of the symbolism of the craft is derived from the pagan institutions of antiquity when the gods were venerated in secret places with strange figures and appropriate rituals . "
But whereas Freemasons like Manly Hall considered the symbolism and myth related to the pyramid on the Great Seal and the history of Apollo / Osiris / Nimrod to be the working " trestleboard " laying out the secret destiny of America , New Age esotericists like Robert Hieronimus — one of the world ’s foremost authorities on the reverse of the seal ’s symbolism — view the circular design and symbolism on the Great Seal to be an " initiatory mandala . "
Mandalas , from the Hindu term for " circle , " are concentric diagrams , such as is familiar in Tantrism , Buddhism , and Hinduism , having ritual and spiritual use for " focusing " or trance - inducing aspirants and adepts who seek mystical oneness with the cosmos or deeper levels of the unconscious mind .
Related to the design of the Great Seal , Hieronimus , as an occultist , views the geometric patterns as representing a type of mandala or microcosm embodying the cosmic or metaphysical divine powers at work in the secret destiny of America , including the god or universal forces represented in the diagram that herald a coming new age of gods and demigods .
Occultists often use mandalas based on the concept of a " protective circle " or variation , which they believe allow certain doorways into the supernatural to be opened or closed , and entities compelled accordingly , as in the magical five - pointed pentagram circle .
This is similar to an initiatory mandala used in Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism , in which deities are represented by specific locations in the diagram .
In Yoga : Immortality and Freedom , scholar Mircea Eliade explains the importance of this part of the mandala design :
At the periphery of the construction there are four cardinal doors , defended by terrifying images called " guardians of the doors . "
Their role is twofold .
On the one hand , the guardians defend consciousness from the disintegrating forces of the unconscious ; on the other , they have an offensive mission — in order to lay hold upon the fluid and mysterious world of the unconscious , consciousness must carry the struggle into the enemy ’s camp and hence assume the violent and terrible aspect appropriate to the forces to be combated .
Indeed , even the divinities inside the mandala sometimes have a terrifying appearance ; they are the gods whom man will encounter after death , in the state of bardo .
The guardians of the doors and the terrible divinities emphasize the initiatory character of entrance into a mandala . …
The typical initiatory ordeal is the " struggle with a monster " … both spiritual ( against evil spirits and demons , forces of chaos ) and material ( against enemies ) … who [ attempt ] to return " forms " to the amorphous state from which they originated .
What makes this interesting is that the arcane symbols and mottoes of the Great Seal represent — as admitted by Masonry ’s greatest historians , mystics , and philosophers — gods that were known in ancient times alternatively as saviors or demons , creators , and destroyers ; spirits that seek entry into the conscious and unconscious world .
That such concepts would be related to the uncapped pyramid on the seal is fitting in that the Great Pyramid of Giza is not only thought of as the actual tomb - site of the deity , but as a symbol of Christ by some and of the Antichrist by others .
These paradoxical conclusions arrive because of certain mysterious attributes related to the Great Pyramid .
In his wonderful book , The Great Pyramid : Prophecy in Stone , Dr. Noah Hutchings is able to show that the Great Pyramid , unlike the other inferior ones on the Giza Plateau whose walls are covered with Egyptian symbols , is devoid of such idolatrous symbolism and defies to this day what methods were employed to manufacture its unparalleled creation .
Just how matchless is the Great Pyramid ?
Hutchings starts out by showing that it is : • A building so large that all the locomotives in the world today could not pull its weight .
•
A building so large that it could hold the cathedrals of Rome , Florence , and Milan and still have room for the Empire State Building , Westminster Abbey , St. Paul ’s Cathedral , and both houses of the British Parliament .
•
A building made up of two and one - half million blocks of stone ranging from three to sixty tons each .
•
A building that has not settled , has not shifted , has not budged even one - tenth of an inch in thousands of years — a feat that even modern engineering could not equal .
I ’ve had the privilege of being on the Southwest Radio Ministries broadcast with Dr. Hutchings , and have told him on the air how the first edition of his book , Prophecy in Stone ( in the 1970s ) , was an eye - opener for me .
I was not aware back then of the intriguing tidbits of information concerning the Great Pyramid that seemed to parallel biblical prophecy — for instance , how some ancient writers referred to the Great Pyramid as " the Pillar of Enoch . "
This was engaging to me because the so - called " King ’s Chamber " in the Great Pyramid was found to have never been occupied , and Enoch " was not , for God took him " ( Genesis 5:24 ) .
When the empty coffer in the King ’s Chamber was measured , it was discovered that the interior dimensions are the same as the biblical Ark of the Covenant .
Besides this , 144,000 polished limestone blocks originally covered the exterior of the Great Pyramid , which were sealed with an adhesive so strong that they would break anywhere but at the seal .
This is the same number of the saints who , in the book of Revelation 7:3 –8 , are sealed with the seal of God .
Yet of all such fascinating findings Dr. Hutchings describes in The Great Pyramid : Prophecy
In Stone , the sections in his book I found most interesting focus on the missing head cornerstone ( apex stone , capstone ) of the Great Pyramid , and the curious verses in Psalms 118:22 and Acts 4:11 pertaining to Jesus as the " stone " the builders rejected and that has become the " head cornerstone . "
As Hutchings points out , the only kind of building in all the world that requires a head cornerstone is a pyramid .
Because of this , Hutchings believes the " pillar " that Isaiah ( Isaiah 19:19 – 20 ) said would stand as a " sign and for a witness unto the Lord " in the end times may be the Great Pyramid on the old border that separated lower and upper Egypt .
Conversely , a few years ago , another friend of mine named Patrick ( Paddy ) Heron wrote a book entitled Pyramid of the Apocalypse , in which he postulated that the Great Pyramid at Giza had been built by the nephilim , the offspring of Watchers .
Besides associated legends , part of his reasoning had to do with the scale of the massive undertaking and the same biblical parallels — the one hundred forty - four thousand , the missing capstone , etc. — which Heron viewed as the Watchers trying to copy , plagiarize , mimic , or borrow from the fame of something known only to the angels , namely , the design of the New Jerusalem in heaven , whose height and width are the same , as in a pyramidal structure ( as opposed to those who believe the New Jerusalem will be cube - shaped ) .
Heron and researchers like him further warn that an antichrist who is somehow related to the Great Pyramid — as a resurrected Osiris / Apollo / Nimrod would be , though we could only offer at this point fantastic speculation how this deity , returned to flesh , would be outrightly connected to the Great Pyramid — could use these mysterious attributes of the Great Pyramid , which seem related to biblical prophecy , as a great deception to guide people away from the true Messiah .
This theological premise is interesting , as everything about the coming of the False Christ will be an antithetical mirror of Jesus .
For example , Jesus has seven stars in His right hand ( Revelation 1:20 ) , while the Antichrist Osiris / Apollo / Nimrod is represented by the seven - star Pleiades system .
The Great Pyramid capstone is missing , representing temporary vacancy by Apollo according to the mottoes , whose coming will " cap " the pyramid , and yet as we have seen , Jesus is also called the head cornerstone .

Whoever turns out to be correct in the debate above , the design of the Great Seal of the United States makes it clear which side of the discussion America ’s national cipher points to .
There are no biblical verses on the Great Seal heralding the second coming of Jesus Christ .
And , unlike the actual Great Pyramid in Giza , whose walls are devoid of idolatrous symbols , the Great Seal is made up entirely of mottoes and prayers to the pagan father of the deity Apollo , to fulfill the Cumaean Sibyl ’s prophecy and to return to earthly rule the disembodied spirit of the deceased god Apollo / Osiris / Nimrod .
Is this what is meant in Psalms 118 and Acts chapter 4 where Jesus is the capstone the builders refused ?
Was
He rejected as the Messiah by " the builders " — a literal reference to " Masons " — because another is coming that will cap their pyramid ?
A second messiah ?

Whoever turns out to be correct in the debate above , the design of the Great Seal of the United States makes it clear which side of the discussion America ’s national cipher points to .
There are no biblical verses on the Great Seal heralding the second coming of Jesus Christ .
OKLAHOMA CITY - A new law set to come into effect on Nov. 1 , will require all men in Oklahoma to reveal personal details regarding every sperm that they murder .
" Every year in Oklahoma , a googleplex of sperm die lonely deaths inside socks , in showers and other places , " said Oklahoma spokeswoman Sally Kern .
" This holocaust of the unborn must end . "
While the law wo n't require men to give out their identities , each day they will be required to fill out a form answering these eight questions :
1. Date of sperm death
2. County in which murder of sperm was performed
3. Age
4. Marital status
5. Race
6 . Years of education
7 . Address where sperm corpses were left
8. Total number of sperm murdered
The information will be gathered and then State 's Department Of Health , which will then post the collected data on a public website .
Proponents of the legislation claim that women should not be concerned over their privacy since no names or " personal information " will be reported .
Men 's groups have tried to fight back , stating that the questions to be asked and reported could easily be used to identify any member of a smaller community .
" Now , everyone will know who masturbates and when , " said a man .
" What this issue is truly about is a man 's right to control his own body as he sees fit .
It 's a travesty .
" This law is designed to frighten men away from masturbation , " he added .
While the controversial measure will cost $ 281,285 to implement and $ 256,285 each subsequent year to maintain , Kern said the cost was unimportant in " the quest to save American pre-babies , " and that she is pleased that the law is going to come into effect soon .
" Do we really want to be silent witnesses to this mass slaughter of undeveloped Sperm - American citizens ? " said Kern .
" The answer is no .
Men must be held accountable for each and every sperm murdered .
One day , tossing millions of innocent lives away in a tissue will be a thing of the past , God willing . "

The far - right British National party has agreed to change its constitution to allow non-white people to join , it emerged today .
The BNP confirmed it would consider changes to its rules and membership criteria after the Equality and Human Rights Commission launched county court proceedings against the party 's leader , Nick Griffin , and two other party officials : Simon Darby and Tanya Jane Lumby .
Robin Allen QC , counsel for the commission , said Griffin had agreed to present members with a revised constitution at its general meeting next month .
He added that the party had agreed not to accept any new members until the new constitution was in place .
John Wadham , group director legal at the Equality and Human Rights Commission , said : " We are pleased that the party has conceded this case and agreed to all of the commission 's requirements .
Political parties , like any other organisation are obliged to respect the law and not discriminate against people .
" It is unfortunate that the BNP spent several months before conceding and dealing properly with our legal requirements .
We will be monitoring the BNP 's compliance with this court order on membership , and its other legal obligations , including to its constituents . "
The Central London county court heard Griffin would be given 10 days to submit a signed undertaking confirming the proposed changes .
The case has now been adjourned until 28 January to allow the BNP to comply .
It is understood that the BNP regarded the action as an attempt to bankrupt the party .
Chris Roberts , the party 's eastern regional spokesman , said it was too early to say how the proposed rule change would affect its membership : " I can not speculate as to who will join our party when our constitution changes .
" I just believe its another obstacle thrown into our way by the Lib - Lab - Con elite that now we are taking votes from them they are trying to put us out of business . "
During the case , the commission argued it had a statutory duty , under the Equality Act 2006 , to enforce provisions of the act and to work towards the elimination of unlawful discrimination .
This duty includes preventing discrimination by political parties .
The commission sent a letter on 22 June 2009 to the BNP setting out its concerns about its constitution and membership criteria which appear to restrict membership to those within what the BNP regards as particular " ethnic groups " and those whose skin colour is white .
This exclusion is contrary to the Race Relations Act , which the party is legally obliged to comply with .
The commission asked the BNP to provide written undertakings it would amend its constitution and membership criteria to ensure , and to make transparent , that it does not discriminate against potential or actual members on racial grounds .
In an order issued at the Central London county court this morning , the BNP agreed to use all reasonable endeavours to revise its constitution so that it does not discriminate , either directly or indirectly on any " protected characteristic " – for example on the grounds of race , ethnic or religious status – as defined in clause 4 of the equality bill .
The changes must be carried out as soon as reasonably practicable , and no later than three months from today .
What if dinosaurs were just a prank ?
No , this is not some Creationist ranting , but a genuine question about our Jurassic buddies .
Have you ever seen a dinosaur ?
In a museum ?
Those are n’t real dinosaurs –they ’re just bones !
And most of the time they ’re not even the real bones but castings of the supposed actual bones .
It ’s not a fair question , though .
Dinosaurs have been extinct for millions of years !
Sure , that ’s what they want you to believe .
Who is this mysterious they ?
Scientists ?
They have better things to occupy their time than making up fake animals–such as torturing real ones in labs .
Scientists hate mice , so they have no real reason to start making up new animals until they ’ve finished off Mickey and friends .
So , who ?
I do n’t know , you tell me .
Who would want all mankind to fictitiously believe in large reptiles which once ruled the earth ?
Right , the V aliens .
When they come they ’d like for us to be comfortable with the concept of reptiles in charge .
Trust me , all those museum exhibits are just going to look like reptile pride parades to them .
The next time you give your child a small plastic dinosaur to play with , I hope you realize you ’re just training them for their future reptilian overlords .
( CNN ) --
In 1967 , the Mamas & the Papas had a hit with a song that detailed , with bittersweet harmonies , the checkered history of the band .
The song , written by the group 's John Phillips and his wife , Michelle , was called " Creeque Alley . "
Michelle Phillips , Denny Doherty and John Phillips , here in 1998 , were members of the Mamas & the Papas .
If the song were to be updated today , it might have to be retitled " Creep Alley . "
With the claims by John 's daughter , Mackenzie , that she had an incestuous relationship with her father , the story of Phillips and his group -- in music , models of California dreams and California dreamin ' -- takes on a darker hue .
The story was already tangled , a motley love - and drug - soaked tale of excess set to the group 's distinctive four - part harmonies .
Phillips left his first wife , Mackenzie 's mother , Susan Adams , for 18 - year - old Michelle , whom he'd met in a San Francisco club while touring in the early ' 60s , according to the band 's biography on Allmusic.com .
The band 's lead male singer , Denny Doherty , later had an affair with Michelle ; she was forced out of the group for a time .
The fourth member , Cass Elliot , had an unrequited crush on Doherty , the biography noted .
After the Mamas & the Papas ' success with such singles as " California Dreamin ' " and the No. 1 hit " Monday , Monday , " the Phillipses bought a Bel Air mansion from which they ruled over the Los Angeles music scene .
In his 1986 memoir , " Papa John , " John Phillips , who died in 2001 , remembered hosting parties for the Beatles when they visited town .
John Phillips , the band 's primary songwriter , was at least six years older than the others and did not shy from the task of addressing the group 's pain and confusion in song .
In such songs as " Got a Feelin ' , " " I Saw Her Again Last Night " and " Trip , Stumble and Fall , " he cast a cold eye on the band 's romantic entanglements , even as his melancholy and sometimes cutting lyrics were often belied by those sunny harmonies and Lou Adler 's slick production .
" One does n't try to hold Cass and Denny and Michelle together , " he said in a 1995 interview .
" It 's a useless task to start with .
You just sort of stay out of the way and let things roll as they can . "
In 1968 , the group split up .
There was a 1971 reunion that produced the contractually obligated album " People Like Us , " but the experience was " horrible , " John Phillips recalled in the liner notes to the group 's anthology , " The History of the Mamas and the Papas . "
The group members had mixed success after the breakup .
Elliot , who died of a heart attack in 1974 ( and not by choking on a sandwich , as urban legend has it ) , pursued a solo career ; she had a handful of hits .
Doherty and John Phillips also tried their hands at solo careers ; the latter 's 1970 " John , the Wolf King of L.A. , " produced a minor hit and is now considered a classic but sold relatively poorly upon release .
More common were the stories of trouble .
Michelle and John Phillips divorced in 1970 ; late that year , Michelle was married to Dennis Hopper for eight days .
John Phillips , who married Genevieve Waite in 1972 , became increasingly immersed in drugs , says his Allmusic biography , to the point where he could n't finish an album commissioned by the Rolling Stones ' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards .
In 1981 , he was convicted of drug trafficking .
By that point , daughter Mackenzie says , she was also a full - blown drug addict .
" I grew up in a place where there were no rules ... which did not serve me well , and everybody , I think , knew that , " she said on a reunion special for her ' 70s sitcom , " One Day at a Time . "
According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh 's " The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows , " Phillips missed the 1980 - 81 season while in rehab for addiction issues .
In her new book , " High on Arrival , " she claims she had become sexually involved with her father in 1979 , after he forced sex on her the night before she married a rock manager , Jeff Sessler .
( Earlier that year , the house she shared with Sessler burned down , taking all her belongings with it . )
According to Mackenzie Phillips , the affair with her father lasted 10 years .
She told Chynna Phillips , her half - sister , about the affair in the late '90s , according to an interview with Chynna in Us magazine .
" Somebody could have dropped a piano on my head , and I probably would n't have felt it , " Chynna Phillips told the magazine .
" But I knew it was true .
I mean , who in their right mind would make such a claim if it was n't true ? "
She says the news sent her into " a deep , deep sadness and depression for about 10 days .
A part of me died when I found out . "
John Phillips also underwent rehab but struggled for the rest of his life .
He had a liver transplant in 1992 but was photographed drinking several months later .
He toured with versions of the Mamas & the Papas , some including Mackenzie .
He died in 2001 of heart failure .
Chynna Phillips and Mackenzie 's " One Day at a Time " co-star Valerie Bertinelli have since rallied around her .
But others have not .
" I am stunned by Mackenzie 's terrible allegations about her father , " Waite , John Phillips ' third wife , wrote in a statement released to " The Oprah Winfrey Show . "
Mackenzie Phillips appeared on the show Wednesday .
" I would often complain about her overly familiar attitudes towards him , and he said it was just her way .
John was a good man .
...
He was incapable , no matter how drunk or drugged he was , to have sexual relations with his own child . "
And Mackenzie 's half - brother , Tamerlane , the follower of an Indian guru , is having none of it .
" My family is and always will be a decrepit bowl of dog urine compared to Nityananda of Ganeshpuri .
That is how great Nityananda is , " he told the New York Post 's Page Six .
" Worship Nityananda , not the Phillips family . "

The Wii gets cheaper .
Nintendo is cutting the price of its popular Wii games console by 20 % in the US and Japan .
The company has also confirmed to BBC News that the trade price will drop in the UK and Republic of Ireland .
However , the firm said the the ultimate cost for UK customers would be " determined by retailers themselves " .
Earlier this year , the Japanese firm raised the trade price of the games console in the UK by £ 20 , citing depreciation of the pound .
The current retail price is £ 199 in the UK , although many retailers still sell it for £ 179 .
So far the Wii has sold more than 52 million units worldwide , outselling both the Xbox 360 ( over 30 m ) and Sony PlayStation 3 consoles ( over 23 m ) .
However Wii sales this year are down - 2.23 m units were sold between April and June , compared with 5.17 m last year .
Nintendo hopes the new price will encourage a new wave of interest in the Wii .
The US arm of the company said its research indicates that there are 50 m potential new customers in America alone .
" Our aim has always been to expand the gaming population and there are still many more people out there who have not yet experienced the fun of video games , " said a spokesperson for the firm .
The Nintendo announcements echoes moves by Sony and Microsoft , who have slashed the cost of the PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) and Xbox 360 as the countdown to Christmas shopping begins .
The Xbox 360 Elite gaming console has been cut by £ 30 to £ 199.99 ( $ 100 to $ 299 in the US ) , and the PS3 is now £ 249 ( $ 299 in the US ) .

Following our meeting with the City , AIGA Portland delivered our recommendations for addressing the issues surrounding the PortlandOnline “ Challenge . ”
Since our exchange , the City of Portland has posted a revised challenge .
Some suggestions were adopted and others were not .
We were well aware that the City would make their own decisions , and we respect the outcomes of their position .
We are n’t required to like every aspect of their approach .
As creative professionals , we can make our own decisions of whether to participate or not .
Aside from this challenge , we believe that this case marks the beginning of an open conversation with the City and the creative community to develop a creative “ Bill of Rights ” and establish best practices for working together .
We are hopeful .
We have established a date for our next Town Hall meeting .
Tuesday , September 8 at 6 - 8 p.m.
The discussion will be held at The Rose Room at City Hall .
All are welcome to attend .
Further details will be posted through various media outlets , including the Silicon Florist and the AIGA Portland .
To bring you up to speed on what has transpired since our last meeting , our two most recent e-mails follow .
( Laurel Butman ’s response on 21 August to our recommendations on 17 August is listed first . )

Johnny & Eric –
Thank you so much for your feedback on the banner challenge rules and criteria .
We were able to incorporate many of your excellent suggestions into the final document , which we will post online Monday when we launch the challenge .
I wanted to share some specifics with you and then lay out some next steps for continuing the dialogue that this experience has started .
First , your comments about a ) underscoring the value of design professionals , b ) the ability of participants to remove themselves from association with the challenge , and c ) pointing out the need to clarify the definition of “ commission ” that we are using in this context were all extremely helpful .
Also , thank you for catching the remaining POL acronyms .
You also recommended that we work with a single design firm at this time and NOT request submissions for the completed design of a banner .
We believe this may signify the largest misunderstanding in this process since the City is not requesting submissions for a completed design of a banner .
Now significantly altered in its direction and name , our “ challenge ” will not request finished work from the public .
Rather , it will welcome pictures , concepts , and banner suggestions that will then be incorporated into a redesign by in - house or contracted designers .
I hope this helps clarify further .
You were also somewhat concerned that repurposing this effort as a “ challenge ” might be considered political posturing .
We are aware of the potential for such criticism .
However , because the nature of our query for public input has so significantly changed — from one that originally solicited multiple layouts and information architecture , to one that now asks for unfinished images to inform our direction on the banner ’s look and feel — we felt it appropriate to alter the name of our project ’s title in a permanent way in order to avoid confusion , and to communicate the significance of this change .
We are excited about moving forward with the challenge in order to stimulate community involvement in and ownership of PortlandOnline , the City of Portland ’’s official web site , and once again thank you for your willingness to work with the City to improve this process .
We have learned a great deal and value the new understandings and relationships that are emerging .
On that note , we are now looking forward to continuing the dialogue , as planned , in September .
When we spoke , I believe we came to the agreement that the City would like to work with you to convene the attendees from your previous meeting at Souk and anyone else who wants to join in mid-September for further discussion .
Some items for that discussion included :
An opportunity for the City to hear from this group and listen to folks ’ perspectives
An opportunity for the City to clarify and dispel any remaining misapprehensions
An opportunity to use our recent experiences as a “ case study ” to discuss future improvements A beginning to a discussion of a creative community “ bill of rights ” & best practices for working together
I am anxious to book a room before they are snatched up in September .
We ’ll set the time for 5 - 7 or 6 - 8 on a weekday if you think that ’s optimal .
Can you give me a guesstimate of how many to plan for so I can get a room of the right size ?
Also , please inform my of any evenings that would be problematic for your members and constituents .
Looking forward to hearing from you , Laurel

Subject : AIGA Portland Feedback on PortlandOnline Challenge Draft
Dear Jeremy ,
Thank you for submitting your latest rules and criteria draft to AIGA Portland for our review .
We greatly appreciate your desire to create a mutually satisfying endeavor for the advancing needs of PortlandOnline.com .
To date , this has proven to be a satisfying exchange and it appears that together , we can continue to take great strides .
We understand that our suggestions are for consideration only and that it is incumbent upon the City to determine what is in its best interest .
Within the creative community , we have heard positive responses with regard to the City clarifying its scope and certain language regarding the “ Challenge ” .
We applaud your team in these efforts and we realize that it has n’t been easy on the City or Mayor ’s Office .
However , with those steps taken , there remains certain questions and concerns that AIGA Portland has with the current Challenge language .
The recommendations that follow are drawn from AIGA ’s position on speculative work and considers feedback that we ’ve received from our board as well as others within the creative community .
As discussed , we believe that the City aims ( and claims ) to value the contributions of the community , yet wo n’t ( or can ’t ) adequately compensate for the time and effort to create finished work .
The design community is willing to go to great lengths to contribute .
AIGA Portland is concerned that the Mayor ’s repeated call for creative contributions may fall flat without a statement from him about the value of design and the need for reasonable compensation to design professionals .
Of equal concern , and due to the language associated with the Challenge , we believe that other professional associations ’
positions on speculative work will also limit the contributions by the most qualified suppliers in the industry .
These concerns are consistent with what other professional associations ’ members ( and individuals ) have expressed .
Furthermore , we believe that simply changing the name to “ Challenge ” will be viewed as an attempt to reframe the “ contest ” format .
As you know , the idea of a contest carries a negative connotation within the design community .
“ Challenge ” is a much better term , to be sure , but we are concerned that it may be considered political posturing .
The City should be aware of the potential for criticism .
Page 6 : Item 1 of the Challenge rules and criteria draft asks all participants to transfer rights to their designs to the City .
The City then reserves the right to alter or use the designs for any City - sponsored promotional materials .
This establishes a difficult precedent for the City ’s ability to select a single winner , or multiple winners .
This has been a serious and consistent flaw in the “ crowd sourcing ” model simply because ( 1 ) entrants believe that a winner will be selected , and ( 2 ) they will wish to see the winning submissions and will require an understanding of the criteria by which the submissions were selected .
If this does n’t occur as promised , there is often considerable backlash .
If the City can alter submitted work , to what extent can it be altered ?
And is this still the work that was originally submitted ?
To what extent can it be used ?
We believe that it should be clearly stated that an entrant may quickly and legally remove any and all association with the design if an image is significantly altered and / or used by the City in other promotional materials .
We recommend that the clause be removed .
Page 6 : Item 4 states that credit will be given for the work being “ commissioned ” by the City , but the term “ commissioned ” suggests a prearranged assignment between a client and supplier .
That is not the case here .
Obviously , it would be ideal if a relationship could be established between client and designer .
As it reads now it is misleading .
“ Commissioned ” should be changed to “ ” used ” ” .
In our most recent draft , there are inconsistencies in the use of the PortlandOnline acronym .
Is it “ PoL ” or “ POL ” ?
AIGA Portland understands that this project , and its myriad components , must move forward on some level .
It is AIGA ’s recommendation that you do not pursue this banner redesign with your current Challenge , but rather work to establish a manner of soliciting citizen and community feedback without requesting completed design work .
Citizen and community feedback should be encouraged throughout the project , in the form of comments or simple polls .
We recommend that a single design firm be contracted to design a simple template for the banner format for the PortlandOnline Web site .
It could easily be produced by one of the firms currently under contract , with the understanding that the template may be redesigned in the future .
It need not be a complicated or an expensive process .
In keeping with the spirit of the Challenge , we suggest that the City should focus on facilitating community contributions by creating a positive collaboration between the City and its citizens , but NOT request submissions for the completed design of a banner .
The City should establish a framework for many participants to submit images , audio , video , or text , and then , to provide proper attribution .
The site could display these contributions as rotating images embedded within the header banner format designed by the contracted firm .
This provides an opportunity for individual attribution and alleviates the issue of speculative design work altogether .
Furthermore this collection of user - supplied images ( or other content ) will assist in stitching together the unique and diverse visual patchwork that is Portland .
The template can then establish or support the proper brand attributes for the site , and serve as an all - inclusive envelope for the submissions from Portland ’s citizenry at large .
If you need examples of positions on speculative work , we ’d be happy to supply a list .
Within the last couple of weeks , the issue seems to have bubbled up yet again .
You might also be interested in articles regarding “ crowd sourcing ” and how government has used this model and related tools to solicit feedback and establish future strategy based on input from various sources .
We look forward to continuing this discussion in person and we hope that these recommendations are helpful .
We appreciate the opportunity to assist in this effort .
Kindest regards ,
Eric Hillerns and Johnny Levenson

There are things that should be left enough alone and Amazon 's Orwellian removal of the book " Nineteen Eighty - Four " from Kindle e-readers is one of them .
Orwell would have gotten a kick out of this , yet Amazon seems to miss the humor in it .
You remember the story : Amazon thought it had digital rights necessary to offer George Orwell 's " Nineteen Eighty - Four " and " Animal Farm " to users of its Kindle e-reader .
When it turned out Amazon did n't have the rights , it without warning simply removed the books from user accounts and refunded their money .
The irony of Amazon essentially " burning " Orwell books , and certainly some customers , was not lost on the world at - large and many electrons lost their lives chronicling the sad tale .
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos used a blog post to apologize to customers in very serious tones :
" This is an apology for the way we previously handled illegally sold copies of 1984 and other novels on Kindle .
Our ï¿½solutionï¿½ to the problem was stupid , thoughtless , and painfully out of line with our principles .
It is wholly self - inflicted , and we deserve the criticism weï¿½ve received .
We will use the scar tissue from this painful mistake to help make better decisions going forward , ones that match our mission . "
That seemed to end it .
Except that now Orwell has returned , or at least might return to users ' Kindles .
Customers who found the book missing may now get it back , along with their notes and annotations , or Amazon will pay them for their trouble .
ï¿½As you were one of the customers impacted by the removal of ï¿ ½Nineteen Eighty - Fourï¿½ from your Kindle device in July of this year , we would like to offer you the option to have us re-deliver this book to your Kindle along with any annotations you made , ï¿½ reads Amazon 's note .
ï¿½You will not be charged for the book .
If you do not wish to have us re-deliver the book to your Kindle , you can instead choose to receive an Amazon.com electronic gift certificate or check for $ 30 .ï¿½
That good news and Amazon is known for doing right by customers , but in offering $ 30 cash compensation , the company probably went a little overboard .
I 'd have offered $ 19.84 .
( And if Amazon sent me such a check , I 'd have framed it ) .

How the dolphins being massacred to satisfy a food fetish are poisoning the Japanese who eat them
At the heart of a Japanese nature reserve , a horror story is unfolding .
Over the coming months , thousands of dolphins - some only a few days old - will be hacked to death .
Hundreds more will be sold into captivity , where they will die lingering deaths from stress and disease .
The dolphins are captured and slaughtered just off the southern Japanese fishing village of Taiji .
Every autumn , tens of thousands of the creatures gather there to feast on the abundant fish .
And once they have eaten their fill , one of the world 's greatest wildlife spectacles unfolds as the dolphins socialise and play .
Wholesale slaughter : Japanese fisherman haul slaughtered dolphins from the bloodied water in Taiji Cove
Massacre : Japanese fishermen use a sickle to drag dead dolphins into their boat
Thousands of the creatures can be seen leaping through the air playing the dolphin equivalent of tag .
As far as the eye can see , dolphins race this way and that , blowing huge plumes of seawater into the air - just for the fun of it .
If you are lucky enough to be on a boat , the creatures will ride your bow wave or even leap straight over the top of you .
But Japanese fishermen see this event rather differently .
For them , the dolphins are a source of cheap meat - and pests to be exterminated .
And they kill them with a ferocity seen nowhere else on earth .
As soon as the fishermen see a pod of dolphins , they launch an armada of small boats to capture the creatures .
The fishermen first confuse and terrify the animals by banging steel pipes suspended in the sea .
This disrupts the dolphins ' delicate sonar , which they use to ' see ' their watery world .
This wall of sound acts as an acoustic net - and once ensnared in this invisible trap , the dolphins find it virtually impossible to escape .
' Feeding this toxic meat to children is morally repugnant '
The fishermen then drive the hapless creatures towards a rocky cove .
Once inside , nets are strung across the entrance to prevent their escape .
The terrified animals are then left overnight trapped in the tiny inlet .
The fishermen claim this makes the dolphins ' flesh softer , sweeter , tastier .
At dawn the next morning , traders arrive from all over the world to buy dolphins they can train for aquaria .
A particularly cute creature can fetch £ 100,000 .
But once the buyers have chosen their specimens , the rest are slaughtered .
The fishermen begin slashing at the animals with gutting knives and impale them with sharpened poles .
The terrified animals thrash around in the water - turning it a bright frothy red .
Agonised sounds fill the air as mother dolphins call out to their young and try desperately to protect them .
When the petrified animals have been weakened by blood - loss and pain , they are hauled aboard the fishing boats .
Here , the ' lucky ' ones have their throats cut .
Others have their spinal cords slashed open to paralyse them .
Many more are simply left to drown .
' Torture ' : Ric O'Barry , head of the Save Japan Dolphins Coalition , looks at dolphins in a tank in Taiji .
He has witnessed the slaughter of dolphins first hand .
Such horrific scenes are seen every few days during the six - month dolphinhunting season , according to Ric O'Barry , head of the international Save Japan Dolphins Coalition and trainer of Flipper , star of the Seventies TV series .
' Every year , the fishermen try to provoke us so that the government has an excuse to deport us , ' he says .
' They will often torture animals in front of us .
A few years ago , one fisherman held up a baby dolphin in front of my face and sliced its head off . '
Other witnesses to the slaughter describe equally horrific scenes .
Mandy - Rae Cruikshank , seven times world free - diving champion , saw the cull two years ago while making a documentary .
She was stunned by the brutality she witnessed when a pod of 40 dolphins was herded into the Taiji killing cove .
' They separated the babies - some were only as big as my arm - and then they began to kill them , ' says Ms Cruikshank .
' The emerald water in front of us began to turn red .
' One dolphin had been stabbed and tried to escape the killing cove by leaping over two nets .
Blood was streaming from it .
We saw its final breaths - it was impossible not to cry . '
Then something even more barbaric occurred .
Ms Cruikshank was forced to watch helplessly as the fishermen turned their attention to the young dolphins .
' The babies were led out to sea and were either killed or left to die of starvation , ' she says .
' It was awful to watch .
Awful . '
In The Cove , a documentary about the cull to be released in UK cinemas next month , Ms Cruikshank tells of the countless times that dolphins have rescued drowning sailors and surfers .
They are the only creatures who regularly risk their own lives to save humans from certain death .
One celebrated case involved the rescue of surfer Todd Endris in Monterey Bay , California , in 2007 .
A 15ft Great
White shark attacked him , ripping the skin off his back ' like a banana peel ' , he said .
Innocent : Thousands of dolphins are killed each year by Japanese fishermen
The shark then attacked again , swallowing his right leg and trying to wrench it off .
Only his surfboard , which had become sandwiched between his thigh and the shark 's lower teeth , prevented the loss of his leg .
But as the shark moved in to deliver the coup de grace , a miracle happened .
A pod of dolphins surrounded Todd and attacked the shark .
Within moments , the shark was beaten back and swam away .
The dolphins stayed with him until he was able to re-mount his surfboard and struggle ashore .
Louie Psihoyos , director of The Cove , was also saved by dolphins while diving in Polynesia .
Unknown to Louie , a giant hammerhead shark had been stalking him and was preparing to attack .
But then , out of the blue , a pod of dolphins he had been filming swam between Louie and the attacking shark .
' They saved my life , ' he says .
' It is what people throughout history have witnessed , but I never expected to see it myself . '
But while we in the Western world see dolphins as friendly , ' cute ' creatures , the Japanese Government and the nation 's fishermen see them as little more than vermin .
To them , killing dolphins and whales is no different to raising cows or pigs for slaughter .
' People say dolphins are cute and smart , but some regions have a tradition of eating dolphin meat , ' says Toshinori Uoya , spokesman for the Japanese fisheries ' department .
' Dolphin killing may be negative for our international image , but it is not something we can order stopped . '
In Taiji , many regard slaughtering dolphins as a normal part of daily life .
They see the campaign against the hunt as an attack on their culture and traditions .
' And besides , ' says , Mutsuyo Kaino , an 88 - year - old housekeeper from Taiji , ' dolphin meat tastes so good . '
The Taiji slaughter is legal under both Japanese and international law , even though it occurs in a nature reserve .
Although dolphins belong to the same family as whales , they are not protected by the international ban on whaling .
And while Japan openly flouts the ban , in the guise of so called ' scientific whaling ' , it is at least illegal and one hopes the country will eventually begin honouring the treaties it has signed up to .
No such treaties protect the 23,000 dolphins killed by Japanese fishermen each year - indeed , the dolphins are victims of the whaling ban .
' He held up a calf in front of me and sliced its head off '
When the whaling moratorium came into force in 1986 , the Japanese authorities and fishing industry began slaughtering tens of thousands of dolphins .
They did this to satisfy and maintain the Japanese love for whale flesh , which apparently tastes very similar to dolphin .
Within 12 months , the Japanese were killing more than 40,000 dolphins every year .
Most were fed to children in school meals , with the rest being exported to China .
Ironically , recent scientific research suggests that the Japanese authorities might be endangering the health of their own children through this practice .
Dolphin meat is full of toxic mercury , cadmium , DDT and carcinogens such as dioxins and PCBs .
Some cuts of dolphin meat have more than 5,000 times the safe level of mercury .
Such levels can very quickly lead to severe nervous system problems and even insanity .
The dolphin meat is so toxic because the seas around Japan have become a soup of industrial wastes .
These poisons become concentrated in fish , which the dolphins then eat .
And when the Japanese eat the dolphins , they progressively poison themselves .
' Killing dolphins is horrific , but feeding their meat to children is morally repugnant and ethically untenable , ' says Ric O'Barry .
' The government and fishermen put dolphin meat on sale where pregnant women and children can easily buy it .
It 's killing them .
' If you go to the hospitals around Taiji , you 'll find evidence of people with mercury poisoning . '
These poisons are also having a shattering impact on whales and dolphins .
Mercury damages their brains and nervous systems , too .
And pesticides and other long - lived pollutants devastate their immune systems and cause cancer .
But perhaps the most insidious effect of all is the impact these pollutants have on fertility .
Dolphin numbers are plummeting worldwide .
Hunting obviously has a big impact , but reduced fertility plays an equally significant role .
And in recent years , yet another problem has begun to threaten dolphins and whales - noise pollution .
Not only do both creatures use sound to ' see ' underwater , they also rely on it to navigate and communicate .
Sound from ships ' engines , oil exploration , and military sonar confuses them and can permanently damage their hearing .
The impact of noise pollution cannot be over - stated .
The latest generation of sonar used by both the U.S and Royal navies can seriously harm whales and dolphins .
To put this in perspective , if a submarine uses its sonar at maximum power , then dolphins 100 miles away will hear an ear - splitting sound equivalent to standing next to a jet fighter on full thrust .
Such noise pollution is believed to have led to many whale and dolphin strandings in recent years .
Whaling fears : Activists are also concerned about the continuing slaughter of the world 's whales
Although the killing of dolphins at Taiji is undoubtedly horrific , campaigners fear that an equally horrific fate lies in store for the world 's whales .
For the International Whaling Commission - at the behest of the U.S government - is currently working on a ' compromise ' agreement that would legalise commercial whaling .
For the past 23 years , Japan has ignored international law and hunted whales illegally .
To try to bring Japan back into the fold , the IWC is proposing to allow them to kill as many whales as they choose in their own waters .
' If the Japanese get their way , they will have succeeded in slaughtering hundreds of thousands of dolphins in defiance of world opinion , ' says Andy Ottaway , director of the UKbased welfare group Campaign Whale .
' They will also have won the right to kill thousands of whales .
' But there are also signs of hope .
Japan has just voted out a government that was in power for more than 40 years .
For the first time in decades , there 's a chance that attitudes might begin to change .
' If this issue is raised at the highest level - preferably at Prime Ministerial level - then there is a chance that this slaughter , and that of the whales , might finally end . '
Until then , however , the waters of Taiji will continue to run red .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft
Corp issued its biggest software patch on record on Tuesday to fix a range of security issues in its programs , including the yet to be released Windows 7 operating system .
Steven Sinofsky Microsoft senior vice president for the Windows and Windows Live Engineering Group discusses the features of Microsofts 's new operating system Windows 7 at the 2008 Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles in this October 28 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
In a monthly update sent to users of its software , Microsoft released 13 security bulletins , or patches , to address 34 vulnerabilities it identified across its Windows , Internet Explorer , Silverlight , Office and other products .
It said six of the patches were high priority and should be deployed immediately .
The patches -- which update software to write over glitches -- are designed to protect users from hackers or malicious software downloaded from the Internet .
Several of the patches affect Windows 7 , the software maker ’s new operating system , which will be officially unveiled next week , but has been widely used in test versions .
Such an early sign of security issues on Windows 7 is potentially worrisome for Microsoft , which is hoping its new operating system will erase bad feelings among many customers who bought the predecessor , Vista .
A Microsoft spokesperson could not immediately say whether the company had identified further security problems with Windows 7 .
The company generally does not disclose such problems until it has patches available .
The vulnerabilities in Windows 7 , including the risk of having a PC taken over by a hacker , were serious flaws , but to be expected , according to Dave Marcus , senior researcher at software security firm McAfee Inc .
“ As long as human beings are writing code there are always going to be vulnerabilities , ” he said .
Tuesday ’s update included the largest number of patches to be issued on a single day by Microsoft .
Corporate users will need to test the patches before they deploy them to make sure they do not cause machines to crash because of compatibility issues with existing software .
KABUL -- Afghan authorities and the United Nations , supported by U.S. - led international forces , began distributing millions of ballots , tamper - proof ink and equipment for a runoff presidential election on Nov. 7 .
Afghanistan 's Independent Election Commission decided to cut the number of polling stations that will be open during the runoff , officials said .
The closings will be in areas where the central government has no control and the security threat is high -- and where , according to observers , ballot boxes were stuffed ...
Children born in the winter months already have a few strikes against them .
Study after study has shown that they test poorly , do n't get as far in school , earn less , are less healthy , and do n't live as long as children born at other times of year .
Researchers have spent years documenting the effect and trying to understand it .
But economists Kasey Buckles and Daniel Hungerman at the University of Notre Dame may have uncovered an overlooked explanation for why season of birth matters .
Their discovery challenges the validity of past research and highlights how seemingly safe assumptions economists make may overlook key causes of curious effects .
And they came across it by accident .
In 2007 , Mr. Hungerman was doing research on sibling behavior when he noticed that children in the same families tend to be born at the same time of year .
Meanwhile , Ms. Buckles was examining the economic factors that lead to multiple births , and coming across what looked like a relationship between mothers ' education levels and when children were born .
" I was just playing around with the data and getting an unexpected result , " Ms. Buckles recalls of the tendency that less educated mothers were having children in winter .
A German specialist has found a new Malaysian species of arachnid and linked it to the rock star as part of efforts to raise awareness
David Bowie has received one of the most unusual tributes of his career .
A newly discovered Malaysian spider has been named after the rock star .
The giant yellow – and very hairy – spider has been named Heteropoda davidbowie and is the most recent discovery of German spider specialist Peter Jäger , who has found 200 new species in the past 10 years .
Most of these arachnids are endangered , and by naming spiders after celebrities Jäger hopes to attract public attention to the dangers facing each species .
" It is working against time , " he says .
" Along with the species , we are also quickly losing genetic resources that have evolved over more than 300 million years . "
Bowie – whose album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was a major hit in 1972 – shares the honour of having a spider named after him with Jakob von Uexkull , founder of the Right Livelihood Award , which honours those working on solutions to global problems , and Nina Hagen , a German punk singer .
INDIANAPOLIS -- No wonder President Obama wo n't stand up for us .
He wo n't even defend his personal safety !
Two weeks ago , a right - wing man protested outside the president 's healthcare meeting in New Hampshire wearing a gun strapped to his leg .
Lest we miss his point , he carried a sign that called for the shedding of blood in a new revolution .
A week later , a dozen men appeared outside Obama 's appearance in Phoenix brandishing loaded guns .
" We will forcefully resist people imposing their will on us through the strength of the majority with a vote , " said one , who carried an AR - 15 military - style automatic rifle .
You read that right -- they threatened to use guns to annul the results of the last election .
Cops stood by and watched .
The Secret Service did nothing .
Strictly speaking , these mooks are allowed to openly carry guns .
Which is fine with me .
I 'm a big fan of the Second Amendment .
It is , however , horrifying to watch goons threaten to assassinate the President of the United States and get away with it .
Make no mistake : guns do n't have anything to do with healthcare .
This is a revival of Klannism .
A black man is president , and the good ol ' boys do n't like it .
That 's what this is about : putting him in his place .
Which , if they or someone they inspire has their way , will be six feet under .
God .
The smirks those turds wear !
Run a Google Image search on " Klansmen " or " lynching . "
Same ones .
( Doubt this is about race ?
Bill Clinton 's 1993 healthcare proposal would have gone farther than Obama's .
And he was n't nearly as popular .
Yet he did n't face gun-toting loons at his public appearances . )
John Lott of Fox News says the liberal media is making a big deal out of nothing .
" A story about an American with a gun who behaved properly is twisted into something else : a narrative about crazy conservatives who want to threaten the president , " he argues , too clever by half .
But the right - wing media does n't even try to explain what place guns have in the healthcare debate .
These are crazy conservatives who want to threaten the president .
Federal laws do change .
Kody Ray Brittingham , who faces five years in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 under Title 18 , Section 871 of the United States Code for threatening Obama -- thinks a lot about that fact nowadays .
" We take all threats against the President and other high officials of the United States very seriously , " said the U.S. attorney prosecuting the case against the 20 - year - old soldier , who said he planned to shoot Obama - - but never made any move to do so .
" The threat itself represents a disruption of the United States Government , even if no actual attempt is made to carry out the threat . "
That was just six months ago .
Why does n't the Obama Administration want the gunmen taken in for questioning and investigated ?
He would n't even have to file charges .
Habeas corpus is gone , eliminated by Bush .
Obama's " indefinite detention " continues Bush 's policy .
These town hall terrorists could be declared enemy combatants and bundled off to Bagram with the stroke of a pen .
If ever there were a reason for suspending civil rights , this is it .
Perhaps Obama 's team does n't think gunmen a block or two away from a Secret Service perimeter is a big deal .
Maybe the White House has made a political call : better to gamble the life of the president than to risk antagonizing the gun lobby .
They should rethink .
Arthur Schlesinger 's classic book " A Thousand Days : John F. Kennedy in the White House " describes how an atmosphere of violence can contribute to the death of a president :
In late October 1963 , former vice presidential candidate and then U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Adlai Stevenson " had gone to Dallas for a meeting ... The next day handbills with photographs of the President of the United States - - full - face an profile - - were scattered around Dallas : ' WANTED FOR TREASON .
THIS MAN is wanted for treasonous activities against the United States , ' followed by a scurrilous bill of particulars . "
What follows reads like last week 's news reports about town hall meetings on healthcare : " That evening ... While Adlai spoke , there was hooting and heckling , placards and flags were waved , and noisemakers set off .
When the police removed one of the agitators from the hall , Stevenson , with customary poise , said , ' For my part , I believe in the forgiveness of sin and the redemption of ignorance . '
At the close he walked through a jostling crowd of pickets to his car .
A woman screamed at him , and he stopped for a moment to calm her down .
The mob closed in on him .
Another woman crashed a sign down on his head .
A man spat at him . "
Schlesinger did n't claim that JFK was killed by a right - wing anti-U.N. protester .
Instead , he wrote , " The fundamentalist religious background of many of its inhabitants had instilled a self - righteous absolutism of thought ... [ Dallas ] was a city of violence and hysteria , and its atmosphere was bound to affect people who were already weak , suggestible , and themselves filled with chaos and hate . "
Four weeks later , a weak - minded , eminently suggestible man shot President Kennedy to death .
" Supporters of the Second Amendment ought to find another way to send their message , " editorialized The Washington Post .
It was a typical , reasoned , pointless stance .
But it 's too late now to call for common sense and self - control .
Now that extreme right racists have made a splash , they 're only going to double down .
Obama 's approach may be a brave one , but it 's not his to take .
As a recent headline put it , the presidency belongs to all of us .
Like JFK , Obama 's assassination would lead to a host of tragic consequences , not least in the area of race relations .
And what about the more likely danger , a repeat of the Greensboro massacre , when right - wing thugs shot leftists at a rally ?
Existing gun laws were n't written with death threats to public officials in mind .
Anyone who shows up armed at a forum where a public official or political candidate is due to appear ought to be detained -- and possibly prosecuted .

Why Yes , We Scientists Have A Death Wish And We Are Taking You With Us
I have just discovered a group on Facebook entitled ' Do n't Bomb The Moon ' .
Under the elegant summation " NASA is planning to bomb the moon ... join this group to stop it happening " aided by the haiku - like sparsity and poetic licence of :
The moon controls all the tides and time ... hitting it with a bomb could be really dangerous .. join to help !!!!
... you could be forgiven for thinking there was something worth worrying about .
If , that is , you were convinced that all the scientific minds at NASA , and their academic consultants , were out to get their measurements whether or not it involved imperilling the human race .
I mean , even assuming they'd be able to analyse them in the absence of civilisation as we know it , where would they publish ?
Or is it that these guys think that NASA has n't considered the possibility that ' the moon controls all the tides ' ?
Some professor at NASA is going to sit up and go ' Gosh , Joe from North Carolina points out that the moon interacts with the Earth !
Stop everything , we must n't touch it in case we knock the planet 's orbit out of whack ! '
He then mutters , as an aside to his secretary , ' Send that man a t - shirt as a gesture of thanks .
Then have him kidnapped and kept in a Cape Canaveral basement as our Senior Plans - A - Four - Year - Old- Could - See - Though Checker . '
Oh , and if you were wondering how NASA managed to obtain funds for a ' bomb the moon ' mission , they cunningly dressed it up as http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/,
Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite .
A rather exciting duo consisting of one rocket ( not , actually , a bomb , but I guess ' do n't crash into the moon ' was a bit less snappy ) which will do a kamikaze dive into a permanently shaded - crater , and a probe which will make a leisurely descent through the debris checking for ice .
If we find ice , of course ( why yes for these purposes I am now a member of NASA ) , this raises a number of intriguing possibilities :
Research base on the moon for low - g , vacuum or lower escape velocity experiments
Staging post on the moon for longer hops , allowing caches to be established
Moon mining , either of minerals using ice as supplies for any crew , or of ice itself — could be a pressing problem as global warming sets in , as seems inevitable since noone gives a damn
The capture of wild soup dragons and maintenance of a breeding population to provide succour to the hungry
Other things I probably have n't thought of .
Of course , people did the same thing in the hype before the LHC power - up .
Again , I 'm not sure whether they thought scientists were not bothered by black holes , immune to them , or just not capable of getting their facts right .
Once reassured we 're not all going to die , people 's thoughts turn , naturally , to their wallets .
At this point they suddenly become very concerned with government spending and insist the $ 2 mil should go on healthcare or something humanitarian .
Commendable , but unlikely , given that governments spend money on a lot of things and any spare funds rarely get relocated into improving health services , since this is a bottomless pit for mazuma .
Give people enough beds , and they want enough medication .
Give them enough medication , they want preventative care and gym passes .
Eventually you 'll have a super - healthy population , and then where will your alcohol and tobacco revenues come from ?
Even if the money could be diverted directly into humanitarian causes , once your population has a decent living standard , there 's a lot to be said for scientific programmes .
First of all , they have incidental benefits to People At Large : for example , in computing , electronics , materials science and , um , medicine .
Secondly , they encourage people to study science , which makes the economy grow ( particularly good if you 're a country a bit low on natural resources ) .
Thirdly , and most importantly , they give people hope and ambition and dreams .
They expand the sum total of humanity 's knowledge and ... you know what , if you have to have me explain it , you 'll never know .
Try watching videos of the moon landing and see if you can work your way up to a sense of wonder .
There are varying views on gun rights and gun control in America , and since Barack Obama was elected president , the right has been whipping up their fringe base , warning that the Democrats are coming for their guns .
We 've seen unprecedented displays of weapons outside Obama events in recent months and right wing violence is on the rise .
In this very ironic and tragic story , a woman from Pennsylvania who carried an open , loaded pistol to her child 's soccer game was shot and killed in an apparent murder - suicide :
Meleanie Hain , the pistol - carrying Lebanon mom who received national attention for taking a loaded gun to her daughter ’s soccer game , was shot to death Wednesday night with her husband in an apparent murder - suicide , police said .
Meleanie Hain was thrust into the national spotlight when she took a gun , in plain view and holstered on her hip , to a soccer game Sept. 11 , 2008 , at Optimist Park in Lebanon .
In a case that was sure to get a lot of traction from the right , Hain was in the process of suing the sheriff who revoked her gun permit after the incident -- even though her license was reinstated shortly after .
Hain then filed a lawsuit against DeLeo for $ 1 million in U.S. Middle District Court seeking reimbursement of attorneys ’ fees and costs , emotional distress and lost wages .
" Just the fact that he was wrong is evidenced by the fact that my license was restored to me .
... I am a victim of Sheriff Michael DeLeo’s .
I am a victim of those in society as a direct result of his actions as well .
The way people look at me sometimes when I am out running errands , I feel as if I am wearing a scarlet letter , and really it ’s a Glock 26 . "
Read on ...
I 'm not trying to put Hain on trial here , but I disagree with her irresponsible actions in taking a loaded weapon and openly displaying it at a children 's sporting event .
I feel for their three children who were at home at the time of the shootings and are now faced with growing up without their parents .
In what is nothing short of a major win for the Safe Harbor provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , a federal judge has hamstrung Universal Music Group 's copyright infringement lawsuit against Veoh Networks .
The judge 's ruling that Veoh fully qualifies for Safe Harbor protection comes in the wake of his rejection of UMG's attempts to undermine Veoh 's Safe Harbor defense late last year .
The ruling is likely to have major ramifications in a billion - dollar lawsuit filed by Viacom against YouTube .
Veoh is a user - generated video site that operates in the long shadow of YouTube .
UMG sued the site back in 2007 over the presence of infringing videos on the site .
Accusing Veoh of " engaging of high - tech theft in the name of ' sharing , ' " UMG argued that Veoh 's transcoding of uploaded videos disqualified it from any sort of protection under the DMCA .
The music giant then asked the judge to bar Veoh from using the Safe Harbor as part of its defense , to no avail .
In the civil minutes from a meeting held in his chambers between the attorneys for both sides earlier this month , Judge A. Howard Matz noted that Veoh " expeditiously " took down infringing material once it was notified of its existence and that the site also employed filtering and fingerprinting software to prevent repeat uploading of infringing clips .
" Veoh has provided substantial evidence that it fulfilled the requirements of section 512 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , " wrote Judge Matz .
" UMG has provided no material evidence to the contrary . "
Judge Matz also has some strong words for UMG's argument that Veoh is ineligible for the Safe Harbor because it realized that its users tend to upload a significant amount of infringing material .
" No doubt it is common knowledge that most websites that allow users to contribute material contain infringing items .
If such general awareness were enough to raise a 'red flag , ' the DMCA safe harbor would not serve its purpose of ' facilitat[ing ] the robust development and world - wide expansion of electronic commerce , communications , research , development , and education in the digital age , ' and ' balanc[ing ] the interests of content owners , on - line and other service providers , and information users in a way that will foster the continued development of electronic commerce and the growth of the Internet , ' " read the Civil Minutes .
Veoh calls the case an " important step " for the online video industry .
" From an industry perspective , this decision is a big deal as well , as we now have a second clear victory showing that companies who work diligently to respect property owners and the DMCA will be able to run their businesses and be successful without the fear of those select content owners who may be uncomfortable with emerging technology , " said Veoh CEO Dmitry Shapiro in a statement .
UMG calls the decision erroneous and one that upsets the balance between rightsholders and technology that Congress set , promising a swift appeal .
" The ruling today is wrong because it runs counter to established precedent and legislative intent , and to the express language of the DMCA , " the company said in a statement .
With the court issuing a summary judgment in Veoh 's favor over the Safe Harbor , there 's not really much left for UMG to litigate .
Although the case has n't been dismissed yet , lawyers from the two sides will meet later this month to determine if there 's anything left to litigate over .
In the meantime , Viacom can't find much comfort with the ruling as it continues to press ahead with its copyright infringement lawsuit against YouTube .
When a judge first ruled that Veoh would qualify for Safe Harbor in August 2008 , Viacom said it was irrelevant , since YouTube " is a business built on infringement " that did n't do enough to protect copyright holders .
Provided YouTube is taking all of the same steps as Veoh to identify infringing content , taking it down when asked to by rights holders , and preventing repeat uploading of identical clips , then the it may find itself in the same situation as Veoh does today .
It should be noted , however , that Viacom v. YouTube is being heard in a different district — but judges pay attention to and often cite other related rulings from other federal courts , as was the case during the RIAA 's legal campaign against P2P users .
The EFF's Fred von Lohmann believes the Viacom - YouTube judge may very well be influenced by the decision .
" [ T ] his ruling could prove to be influential on the judge in the YouTube case , since Veoh 's policies are very similar to YouTube 's , " von Lohmann told Ars .
" The ruling further cements a number of earlier rulings that have insisted that the burden of policing user - generated content for copyright infringements falls to the copyright owner , not to the video hosting provider . "
Viacom general counsel Mike Fricklas begs to differ .
" Our case is in a different forum , not bound by the Veoh case , and we remain confident that we will prevail on the law and the facts , " he told Ars .
" Today 's decision contradicts the consensus that sites and copyright owners share the responsibility to use readily available tools to minimize copyright infringements . "
One additional result of the ruling may be more advertising surrounding user - uploaded videos , according to von Lohmann , as Judge Matz said the question of whether a site like Veoh is benefiting financially from user - generated content should n't factor into whether the Safe Harbor is applicable .
" Merely having the ability to delete material from your site does not count as ' control ' sufficient to strip you of the safe harbor , even when you stand to get a financial benefit from infringing content , " he said .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran test - fired missiles on Sunday to show it was prepared to head off any military threat , four days before the Islamic Republic is due to hold rare talks with world powers worried about its nuclear ambitions .
The missile maneuvers coincide with escalating tension in Iran ’s nuclear row with the West , after last week ’s disclosure by Tehran that it is building a second uranium enrichment plant .
News of the nuclear facility south of Tehran added a sense of urgency to a crucial meeting in Geneva Thursday between Iranian officials and representatives of six major powers , including the United States .
Iran will be put “ to the test ” in Geneva and a move to sanctions would follow if the talks failed , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CBS .
An Iranian official warned “ fabricated Western clamor ” over the new plant would negatively affect the talks at which the six powers want Iran to agree to open its facilities to inspection to prove its program is for power and not nuclear weapons .
Ali Asghar Soltanieh , Iran ’s envoy to the U.N. ’s nuclear watchdog , said , referring to Western condemnation of the plant : “ This ... approach will have a negative impact on Iran ’s negotiations with the 5+1 countries . ”
He has said Iran is arranging International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of the plant “ in the very near future . ”
U.S. President Barack Obama said Saturday the discovery of the secret nuclear plant in Iran showed a “ disturbing pattern ” of evasion by Tehran .
He warned Iran Friday it would face “ sanctions that bite ” if it did not come clean .
Earlier this month , Obama dropped a Bush - era plan to deploy missiles in Poland that had been proposed as a shield amid concerns Iran was trying to develop nuclear warheads it could mount on long - range missiles .
Iranian media said Revolutionary Guards launched at least two types of short - range missiles on the exercise ’s first day on Sunday in central Iran and tested a multiple missile launcher .
“ For all those who ... might harbor dreams about undertaking military invasion against our nation and country , a message of this maneuver is firmness , destructiveness , real and endless resistance , ” Iranian General Hossein Salami , head of the Guards ’ air force , told state television .
Iranian media said medium - range Shahab 1 and 2 missiles , which officials say have a range of 300 and 500 km respectively , would be test - fired Sunday evening .
State radio said the Guards Monday would test - fire the Shahab 3 missile , which Iranian officials say has a range of around 2,000 km , potentially putting Israel and U.S. bases in the Gulf within reach .
It was last tested in mid-2008 .

Iran conducts war games or tests weapons to show its resolve to counter any attack by foes like Israel or the United States .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who says any military action against Iran would only “ buy time ” and stresses the need for diplomacy , told CNN he hoped the disclosure of the second facility would force Tehran to make concessions .
“ The Iranians are in a very bad spot now because of this deception , ” he said .

VAPOR TRAILS
State television showed footage of missiles soaring into the sky in desert - like terrain , leaving vapor trails , in the drills held during Iran ’s Holy Defense Week marking the start of the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war .
Andrew Brookes , of the International Institute for Strategic Studies think - tank in London , told Reuters by phone he believed the missile tests had long been planned and were not a response to Western condemnation of the second enrichment plant .
But he noted the firing of the missiles came before the Geneva talks , adding Tehran was showing “ we are a powerful nation , we need respect ... we are coming as equals . ”
English - language Press TV said the weapons tested Sunday included a ground - to - ground missile and a naval missile , naming them as Fateh ( Victorious ) and Tondar ( Thunder ) .
The United States , which suspects Iran is seeking to build nuclear bombs , has previously expressed concern about Tehran ’s missile program .
Iran says its nuclear work is solely for peaceful power generation purposes .
Neither the United States nor its ally Israel have ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to resolve the nuclear row .
Iran has said it would respond to any attack by targeting U.S. interests in the region and Israel , as well as closing the Strait of Hormuz , a vital route for world oil supplies .
Iran acknowledged the existence of the enrichment plant near the holy city of Qom for the first time Monday to the International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. nuclear watchdog .
U.S. officials said the disclosure was designed to pre-empt an announcement by Western governments , which were aware of the site , but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the plant was legal and open for inspection by the IAEA .
A senior U.S. administration official said the six powers -- the United States , Russia , Britain , France , China and Germany -- were preparing “ a set of transparency demands ” focused on the uranium enrichment plant near Qom .
“ Those demands include unfettered access for the IAEA to the Qom facility , the people working there , and timelines related to its development , ” the official said .
Boo !
Oh , sorry .
I forgot that it ’s still 3 weeks until Halloween .
You see , I ’ve got pumpkin on the brain .
Ever since I realized there was a pumpkin shortage ( yes , I said shortage .
It ’s true . )
I ’ve been craving all things pumpkin .
I finally was able to get my hands on some canned pumpkin last weekend , and have been putting it to good use .
I ’m talking cupcakes and cookies and muffins and breads … we even made a savory salad with a fresh pie pumpkin ( I had such high hopes for it , but it was a disappointment , to say the least , it ’s not a recipe you ’ll be seeing here .
darn . )
One ca n’t turn orange from eating too much pumpkin , right ?
These cupcakes have to be one of my favorites .
If you ’ve been reading this blog since last year you might recognize the recipe .
Call it a bit of cupcake mix -n - match , I took my pumpkin chip cupcake recipe , and topped it with a delicious brown sugar buttercream .
Pumpkin + brown sugar , well , it was meant to be .
The mummy - inspired decor is surprisingly simple , basically strips of frosting piped on with a flat tip .
The sugar eyes are something I ’ve had in my stash for a while , just waiting for the perfect use for them .
In the meantime , if you see canned pumpkin , stock up .
Make sure you have plenty to feed your pumpkin cravings until the supply is back to normal .

Three treasure hunters where caught with archaeological items in the western Bulgarian town of Bobovdol Wednesday .
The men aged 41 , 42 , and 52 , have criminal records ; they were captured with 30 Roman bronze coins - one dated to 1st century BC , and the others - to 3rd - 5th centuries AD , two Roman rings , a spear head , and lead melts .
When they were arrested , the three admitted the treasures had been found near the village of Chukovets .
Experts from the Regional History Museum in the city of Kyustendil , together with the police inspected the spot and found a religious plaque with inscriptions in Greek dedicated to the Thracian god Heros , known as the Thracian Horseman .
Date Wed , 9 Sep 2009 16:06:27 - 0700 ( PDT ) From Linus Torvalds <> Subject Linux 2.6.31
Ok , there 's just a few final commits since - rc9 to fix a couple of last
regressions and problems , and now the final 2.6.31 is out there .
The small
diffstat and shortlog is below , the full log and diff from 2.6.30 are
being uploaded to kernel.org ( and then mirrored out ) as I write this .
In general , the full set of 2.6.30 ->31 changes are too numerous to list ,
but as usual , you 'll find some high - level overviews on kernelnewbies.org .
One of the more painful changes has been the new cleaned - up fsnotify
backend that takes care of both inotify and dnotify ( and shrinks the inode
while doing so ) , but its teething problems have hopefully been sorted out .
There 's also been lots of work on KMS - both lots of updates on the intel
side ( displayport support , next - gen IGD etc ) , and obviously the whole new
( and still experimental ) radeon KMS code .
There 's also a fair chunk of new debugging / peformance counter stuff :
memory leak detection ( " kmemleak " ) , memory usage checking ( " kmemcheck " )
and performance counters ( " perf_counter " ) .
Those new debugging features
are not likely usable under any real load , but are good for finding kernel
bugs at a huge performance cost .
The performance counters are a nice and easy - to - use alternative to things
like oprofile , allowing you easy access to some pretty powerful profiling
of hardware ( and sw ) events .
What else ?
Lots and lots of driver work .
Over 70 % of all of the 2.6.30 to
2.6.31 patch is under drivers / , and there 's another 6 % + in firmware / and
sound / .
That 's not entirely unusual , but it does seem to be growing .
My
rough rule of thumb used to be " 50 % drivers , 50 % everything else " , but
that 's clearly not true any more ( and has n't been for a while - we 've been
60 % + since after 2.6.27 - I think the whole ' staging ' thing is what moved
things up by several percentage points ) .
If you ignore drivers / ( and firmware / and sound / ) about half the remaining
changes are to arch / code ( with ARM leading the way with its insane number
of platforms , but mips , powerpc , sh , and x86 are up there too ) , and the
rest being filesystem updates ( VFS layer : mostly that fsnotify thing , but
also : btrfs , cifs , ext3 , fuse , gfs2 , nfs , nilfs , xfs ) and with a spinkling
of Documentation , kernel and perf - tools updates .
And as usual , this obviously means that the merge window for 2.6.32 is
open .
But give me a day or so before bombarding me with merge requests : I
like to encourage even developers to first give the plain new release a
go , and not immediately start the crazy flood of patches .

Well , that was quick .
Just four days after the launch of the Car Allowance Rebate Systems ( CARS ) program , better known as " Cash for Clunkers , " it appears that it may be suspended due to its own success .
Apparently eager buyers have blown through the $ 1 billion allocation , and dealers are worrying they wo n't get paid for clunkers they 've already taken in and disabled .
We first saw the story late last night from our cohorts at Motor Authority .
Then the alerts started flooding in .
This morning 's news carries rumors that the US Transportation Department will suspend the program , although there 's been no definitive statement yet .
Late yesterday , the White House said , " We are working tonight to assess the situation facing what is obviously an incredibly popular program . "
[ UPDATE 4 , 1:30 pm Eastern : Numerous tweets ( here , here , here , here , and here ) are reporting that the House of Representatives has passed HR 3445 , voting 316 to 109 , to reallocate another $ 2 billion to Cash - for - Clunkers from an energy - loan guarantee program .
The US Senate will now have to vote on the issue next week . ]
[ UPDATE 3 , 11:30 am Eastern : According to The Detroit News , an emergency measure to allocate another $ 2 billion to the CARS program ( H.R. 3445 ) was introduced in the House of Representatives today .
The funds would be reallocated from an energy loan - guarantee program , part of February 's $ 787 billion stimulus package , and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) is said to be working to get unanimous consent among House members to approve the bill before the August recess . ]
[ UPDATE 2 , 11:15 am Eastern : According to The New York Times , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration plans to meet with Congress to discuss methods of keeping the CARS program going , though he would n't say how long it could continue without new funding .
But , he said , the program will continue at least through the weekend .
“ If you were planning on going to buy a car this weekend using this program , the program continues to run , ” he said .
“ If you meet the requirements of the program , the certificates will be honored . ” ]
[ UPDATE 1 , 9:40 am Eastern : According to Automotive News ( subscription required ) , the program is still operating as of this morning and the White House , the Department of Transportation , and Congress continue to meet to assess the situation . ]
End or suspend ?
Unless Congress and the White House can quickly agree on a new source of funds to extend the program , it may have to be suspended or ended today .
Adding to the challenge , Congress will recess for August , leaving just one day to approve any additional funds .
The confusion stems from conflicting reports over how many clunkers have already been traded in .
Dealers have complained bitterly about confusing and complex paperwork ( the program 's rules run 135 pages ) and , worse , a website that simply seized up under the load of registrations and reimbursement requests .
Late yesterday , the Transportation Department said it had already paid out $ 221 million to dealers .
Officials also claimed that any problems with the website had been resolved .
But John McEleny , head of the powerful National Auto Dealers Association ( NADA ) , told reporters most of the $ 1 billion in funding had already been used up , based on a dealer survey showing a huge backlog of reimbursement requests that would take the total to almost 250,000 tradeins .
Dealer fear :
No cash for worthless hulks
The original program had been planned for $ 4 billion , but Congress cut the allocation to $ 1 billion when it approved the program in June .
That amount was to take the CARS program through November 1 .
Dealers fear that if they complete tradein deals that involve clunkers , they wo n't get reimbursed for vehicles whose engines they have already had to disable under the rules .
The White House statement attempted to reassure dealers that all valid tradeins would be reimbursed .
" Auto dealers and consumers should have confidence that all valid CARS transactions that have taken place to - date will be honored , " said last night 's statement .
Some have called the program a highlight of the Administration 's various stimulus efforts .
" This is simply the most stimulative $ 1 billion the federal government has spent during the entire economic downturn , " said Representative Candice Miller ( R - MI ) .
Rules : 22 mpg or more for cars
Under the program , owners of 1984 - 2002 vehicles with a combined EPA mileage rating of 18 miles per gallon or less qualified for a $ 3,500 voucher towards the purchase of a new car rated at 22 mpg or better .
The maximum voucher of $ 4,500 was available to those who bought cars rated at 10 mpg ( or more ) higher than the tradein .
Trucks used a different system ; the replacement had to be rated at 18 mpg or better , and also be 2 mpg more efficient than the tradein to qualify for a $ 3,500 voucher .
Improving mileage by 5 mpg or more garnered the full $ 4,500 .
TheCarConnection.com will update this story during the day as news develops .

THE Chinese economy is gaining momentum , with heavy industry breaking production records to supply a resurgent construction sector .
China 's National Bureau of Statistics yesterday announced a slew of eye - popping production data for August , with total industrial production up 12.3 per cent from a year earlier .
Iron output rose 22 per cent over the year to 52.3 million tonnes , and cement production rose 24 per cent to 150 million tonnes .
Production of electricity rose 9 per cent from a year earlier and is now 25 per cent above the trough in January , after seasonal adjustment .
China also produced 657,000 cars , almost double the figure for August last year .
Total vehicle production of 1.17 million keeps China on track to make more vehicles this year than the US .
Some years ago I read about a slightly loony " garbologist " who liked to go through people 's trash , including that of one person in particular - Mr. Robert Zimmerman of Woodstock , New York , aka Bob Dylan .
One day when said garbologist was busy in the trash cans in front of Dylan 's Woodstock home , the songwriter supposedly spotted him , came tearing out of the house with the first blunt object that came to hand - a bicycle pump - and whacked the researcher upside the head with it .
If this story is true , it increases my respect for Bob Dylan .
But it also brings up a question :
What 's the ownership status of trash ?
When I put it out in front of my house for pickup , is it still my property and is someone rifling through it guilty of trespassing and theft ?
Or is it abandoned and , as such , fair game for any passing " researcher " ?
- Alex Skovan , Clinton Corners , New York
We 'll get to the legalities in a moment , Alex .
First , however , we need to review the fact situation , as the lawyers say .
The part about the garbologist , A.J. Weberman , going through Dylan 's trash is true , although as far as I can tell the scene of his garbage - picking exploits was n't Woodstock but Greenwich Village , where Dylan lived on and off in the 60s and 70s .
The two men have definitely had words , and allegedly had worse .
In a 2001 Rolling Stone article Weberman says he had made peace with Dylan sometime around 1971 but still craved publicity and so soon returned to Dylan 's trash .
Was Dylan understanding ?
Weberman says no :
" Dylan 's wife comes out and starts screaming about me going through the garbage .
Dylan said if I ever fucked with his wife , he'd beat the shit out of me .
A couple of days later , I 'm on Elizabeth Street and someone jumps me , starts punching me .
I turn around and it 's like - Dylan .
I 'm thinking , ‘ Can you believe this ?
I 'm getting the crap beat out of me by Bob Dylan ! ' "
Now to the case law .
Does Dylan have a right to complain about Weberman 's intrusions ?
Straight Dope staff attorney Gfactor says it depends .
If your trash is still on your property , nobody but the trash collector can come in and paw through it .
However , most jurisdictions consider possessions abandoned once you set them out at the curb , in the alley , etc .
Some specifics :
• The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled police do n't need a warrant to search trash left at the curb ( in legal terms , " outside the curtilage " - i.e. , outside your private domain , sometimes but not always denoted by the property line ) .
Police officer Gina Hoesly of Portland , Oregon , learned this firsthand when fellow officers searched her garbage , found drug residue and a pipe , and busted her .
Hoesly 's lawyers argued her rights were broader under the Oregon constitution , and the state 's court of appeals agreed .
Unfortunately for other Oregonians , the cops merely changed tactics and began enlisting the help of the garbage companies , and state courts have now held police can search trash once it 's picked up .
• Given the rising value of recyclables , many jurisdictions are passing antiscavenging laws making your trash city property once you dump it at the curb , at which point no one but a city employee can legally remove it .
• In a related matter the city of Rancho Mirage , California , sought to stop local businesses from selling recyclables to a commercial firm and instead required them to turn it over to the city 's chosen recycler .
Basically the court ruled waste , by definition , is worthless .
Since the businesses were selling it , it was n't worthless ; therefore , they were within their rights to do so .
Justice triumphs again .
Can you retrieve something you threw out by accident ?
Generally , yes - legally you can't abandon something by mistake .
Gfactor found a story about a vial of radium discarded by a hospital ; it was recovered after authorities allowed 500 pigs to graze the dump , then ran each animal by a Geiger counter .
This tale has zero juridical relevance , but it gives us an idea to help out Bob D .
Salting your garbage with radium is problematic , but how about feeding it to 500 pigs ?
Weberman might still go through the result , but my feeling is , whether he does or not , either way you win .

Over the next three months I meandered back and forth through the country , testing for myself every facet of French chic : not least their legendary cuisine .
" It 's almost impossible to eat a bad meal in France " , or so everyone had assured me : and while in reality it proved as easy to dine poorly as it is at home ( one particular meal at the Cross of Jerusalem Pizza House in Lourdes I still recall as being beyond the help of even divine intervention ) , none the less , with a little time and care , I soon realised you could indeed eat like a king .
A retired General who served more than 30 years in the U.S. Army and helped train Iraq ’s military between 2003 and 2004 called former Vice President Dick Cheney an “ incompetent war fighter . ”
National Security Network Senior Adviser and Retired General Paul Eaton made the comments after Cheney criticized Obama in a Wednesday night speech for “ dithering ” about whether to substantially increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Obama has been under pressure from his top commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , to add as many as 40,000 to 60,000 U.S. troops on the ground .

“ The record is clear : Dick Cheney and the Bush administration were incompetent war fighters , ” Eaton said in a statement released Thursday .
“ They ignored Afghanistan for 7 years with a crude approach to counter - insurgency warfare best illustrated by : 1 . Deny it .
2 . Ignore it .
3 . Bomb it .
While our intelligence agencies called the region the greatest threat to America , the Bush White House under - resourced our military efforts , shifted attention to Iraq , and failed to bring to justice the masterminds of September 11 . ”
Cheney ’s criticisms of Obama came during his Wednesday night acceptance speech for the Center for Security Policy ’s “ Keeper of the Flame ” award .
“ President Obama now seems afraid to make a decision , and unable to provide his commander on the ground with the troops he needs to complete his mission , ” the former vice president said of the current administration ’s approach to Afghanistan .
Eaton rejected those comments , adding that “ the only time Cheney and his cabal of foreign policy ‘ experts ’ have anything to say is when they feel compelled to protect this failed legacy .
While President Obama is tasked with cleaning up the considerable mess they left behind , they continue to defend torture or rewrite a legacy of indifference on Afghanistan .
Simply put , Mr. Cheney sees history throughout extremely myopic and partisan eyes . ”
Eaton said he appreciates the “ profound deliberations ” that Obama and military commanders are having about Afhgan war strategy , and would “ dismiss men like Cheney who inject partisan politics ” into those discussions .

Oh please please please let this be true .
Honda CEO Takanobu
Ito says the company is planning on building a " green " sports car that is affordable , noting the car " would be environmentally friendly and have great performance . "
And then he took a huge swipe at the Lexus LFA supercar unveiled at the Tokyo Auto Show .
" Sure , there are folks who like that ' vroom ' of the engine out of nostalgia , " he told Automotive News .
" But those people are stuck in the past .
The era of V - 10 engines is gone . "
Oh snap !
But lest you think Ito - san is some granola - munching tree - hugging hippie who hates cars , remember he was the chief body engineer on the first - gen Acura NSX , a mid-engine sports car that offered exceptional handling .
( That 's an NSX in the picture , with Ayrton Senna at the wheel at Suzuka in 1990 , and you 've gotta see the – video of that . )
Ito was essential in advancing the NSX 's lightweight aluminum structure and body .
But that was then and this is now and times have changed .
" There is a great demand to have green cars , and we are working on environmental technologies , " Ito told Autoblog .
" Right now we are in the midst of developing new green technologies .
That includes fuel cells and hybrids for larger vehicles .
Once we come up with these new , innovative technologies that we are in the midst of researching ...
I definitely would like to see Honda build a sports car which would symbolize these technologies . "
The CR - Z hybrid is clearly a step in that direction .
Honda is pitching it as the first hybrid sports car , a claim that gains credibility given the car sports a 1.5 - liter iVTEC engine and a six - speed gearbox .
And the styling is spot on , tastefully updating the second - generation CRX - Si .
Then he took another dig at the big Lex with the $ 375,000 price tag , saying , " Once that day comes , our sports car will not be something like what Toyota announced yesterday but instead will be something that is environmentally friendly and at the same time enjoy outstanding performance .
I 'd love to do that "
We love his thinking .
Oh sure , we 're as impressed as any other gearhead with the Lexus LFA .
But if Honda could produce an eco- friendlier sports car with a reasonable price tag , it would go a long way toward eradicating the belief among gearheads that efficiency is boring .
Ito sounds like just the guy to make that happen .
With all his talk cars that are easy to drive with good performance and very good fuel economy , he sounds more like Colin Chapman than some hair - shirted environmentalist .

Galaxy NGC 4522 , moving at 10 million km/h within its galactic cluster , has gases being stripped away by ram pressure .
Bright blue pockets of new star formation can be seen in the gas .
( ( NASA / ESA ) )
Newly released images from the Hubble Space Telescope show two galaxies that are moving so fast that gas within the galaxies is being stripped away .
The two galaxies , NGC 4522 and NGC 4402 , are located in the Virgo galaxy cluster , about 60 million light years from Earth .
Astronomers estimate that NGC 4522 is moving within the cluster at more than 10 million km/h , or nearly 2,800 kilometres every second .
Because the space within the cluster is n't empty , but filled with a very thin mixture of gases called the intracluster medium , the galaxy 's movement is creating drag , in the same way that a rider on a speeding motorcycle will feel wind , even on a calm day .
The drag , or ram pressure , is stripping gases out of the galaxy , leaving a ghostly shadow behind .
The Hubble images show new stars forming in bright blue clusters in the cloud of gas being left behind the galaxy .
Galaxy NGC 4402 shows signs of gases being blown away by ram pressure .
( ( NASA / ESA ) )
An image of another galaxy , NGC 4402 , also shows signs of ram pressure : a curved disc of gas and dust being pushed out of the galaxy .
The images were taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble before it broke down in 2007 .
Astronauts were able to restore the camera during a 13 - day mission to the telescope in May 2009 .
Studying how ram pressure strips gas out of galaxies in these galactic clusters helps astronomers understand the forces that cause galaxies to form and evolve over time .
The Symbian Foundation has liberated the source code of the Symbian platform 's EKA2 microkernel .
The code base is now available under the terms of the open source Eclipse Public License ( EPL ) .
This is a key milestone in the foundation 's plan to open up the entire platform .
The group says that it is ahead of schedule and moving forward with its roadmap at a rapid pace .
Symbian is the dominant mobile operating system , but its considerable marketshare is being eroded by emerging competitors with more modern technology .
Nokia acquired Symbian last year and began an aggressive campaign to reshape the platform with the aim of opening the source code and adopting the powerful Qt toolkit to serve as the basis for a next - generation Symbian user interface .
During the early stages of the transition , the foundation only made platform source code available under royalty - free terms to its members .
The code is being opened up to the general public under the permissive EPL in stages .
A number of components were already opened prior to the kernel code release this week .
The foundation says that it is on track to have everything in the open by the middle of 2010 .
In addition to opening the kernel source code , the foundation has also labored to produce a fairly cohesive development kit that will allow developers to start working with the code and testing it on real hardware .
The kit includes an ARM compiler toolchain , an open source emulator based on QEMU , and support for running the OS on the OMAP - powered BeagleBoard .
Instructions for building a Symbian environment with a text - based shell are available on the foundation 's wiki .
Symbian Foundation developer Daniel Rubio discussed the kernel source code release in a blog entry earlier this week .
He emphasized that the kit includes much more than just the kernel source and says that the foundation wants to make it easy for developers to adopt the Symbian kernel in a wide range of different contexts .
" It is time for anyone that has not been exposed to EKA2 before to come out and play at very little or no cost and test the capabilities of the state - of - the - art real time , multitasking , SMP - ready kernel that has , is , and will be shipping in millions of smartphones , " he wrote .
" This is a major breakthrough for the Foundation that shows our commitment to open source and the wider community while enabling the Symbian ecosystem to make business as usual .
We have tried to lower the adoption barrier to a bare minimum , fostering [ hardware ] innovation and empowering developers to port the platform to all kind of devices . "
Symbian 's advantages
I spoke with the Symbian Foundation 's executive director , Lee Williams , about the announcement .
He says that the foundation fast - tracked the process of opening the kernel because it wanted to get it into the hands of developers and hardware makers as soon as possible .
I asked him some questions about the competitive landscape in the mobile market and how Symbian stacks up against other platforms , particularly Linux .
He believes that EKA2 , as a true microkernel that is heavily optimized for mobile and embedded deployment , offers some compelling advantages over the Linux kernel .
He touts the strength of Symbian 's broad and diverse ecosystem .
The platform has been deployed on 70 different product form factors , he says , and it supports 53 languages and 300 operator networks .
He views Symbian 's rich support for native application development as an advantage over Android 's Java - based model , and he says that the Symbian Foundation is more inclusive and participatory than Google 's Open Handset Alliance .
Google 's dominance in the Android ecosystem undermines the Android platform 's vendor neutrality and poses challenges for open governance , he says , whereas the Symbian Foundation 's technical council gives its members a real opportunity to direct the evolution of the Symbian platform .
Symbian has come a long way in a short period of time , but the foundation still has plenty of work to do if it wants to retain Symbian 's historical dominance .
Major Symbian backers like Nokia are boosting their commitments to Linux and delivering Linux - based products that outshine their best Symbian - based offerings .
Meanwhile , individual mobile application developers are increasingly gravitating towards Apple 's iPhone platform .
The Symbian Foundation 's efforts to overhaul its operating system are very promising , but it will be tough to overcome the perception that Symbian 's relevance is in decline .
Kernel source code availability is another positive step in the right direction , though .
Legislators from 16 major economies will meet on Saturday to seek consensus on a raft of climate - related policies ahead of December talks in Copenhagen .
The 120 delegates believe that the policies could address 70 % of the emissions cuts necessary before 2020 .
A consensus , if reached , could ensure the policies are put into practice regardless of the outcome of the landmark climate talks in December .
The group will present its results to the Danish PM who will host the talks .
The delegates will include a number of MEPs and former UK Foreign Office head Lord Michael Jay alongside people holding in climate - and environment - related posts in 16 nations .
The meeting has been organised by the Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment ( Globe ) .
' Real opportunity '
Issues to be discussed are standards for building and appliance standards , vehicle fuel efficiencies , renewable energy and forestry .
Together , the delegates hope to agree targets that they have committed to push through their own governments at home .
In addition , they will band together to push for ambitious targets at the December COP15 ( Conferences of the Parties ) meeting .
Any deals that are agreed at the weekend meeting are particularly relevant in light of the claim made last week by Yvo De Boer , head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat , that a comprehensive and binding treaty at the December talks was unlikely .
Danish Prime Minister and COP15 host Lars Lokke Rasmussen said of the meeting : " The Globe Copenhagen Legislators Forum ... presents a very real opportunity to outline to national leaders where the political boundaries could be for an ambitious agreement at the formal negotiations .
" This will be a powerful and new intervention contributing to the international response to climate change . "
LANSINGBURGH —
A small pocketknife given to Matthew Whalen by his grandfather to use in his car may affect the rest of his life .
Whalen was suspended from Lansingburgh High School last month after administrators found the 11/2 - inch key - chain knife in his glove compartment , an infraction of the district 's zero - tolerance policy for weapons on school grounds .
It was a gift from his grandfather , Robert Whalen , chief of the Hoosick Falls Police Department .
Now , Whalen is concerned the school 's 20 - day suspension may hurt his chances of gaining admission to West Point , a dream of his since he brought in his grandfather 's medals from Vietnam for show - and - tell in first grade .
" I just want to be able to go back to school , " Whalen said .
" I did n't intentionally do anything wrong .
I do n't even consider it a weapon . "
Whalen 's story went national Tuesday , as he traveled to New York City for an appearance on the Fox News Channel 's " Fox and Friends " show to discuss his suspension .
District Superintendent George J. Goodwin said Tuesday that he thinks the punishment was " appropriate and fair . "
He said the district has to equally enforce its zero - tolerance policy , even for students like Whalen who do n't have any past record of misbehavior .
" Sometimes young people do things they may not see as serious , " Goodwin said .
" We look at any possession of any type of knife as serious . "
Goodwin said he is open to the possibility of contacting West Point to ensure that the incident does not affect Whalen 's chances of admission .
Whalen , an Eagle Scout and member of the National Guard , likes to be prepared .
He learned CPR at age 12 , and in 2005 , when he was just 13 , he saved his aunt 's life by performing CPR on her after she had a grand mal seizure and stopped breathing .
He was given a Lifesaving Heroism Award by the Boy Scouts of America .
Now , he carries water bottles , a sleeping bag and a change of clothes in his 1999 Mercury Sable in case it breaks down .
He considered the key - chain knife part of that preparedness kit .
Whalen , 17 , said he forgot the knife was even in his car when a school administrator confronted him in late September and asked if he had a weapon .
He volunteered that he had the pocket - size blade in his car , and walked a vice principal out to his car , where he turned it over without thinking much of the incident .
He is not sure how officials knew the knife was even in his car , but thinks another student may have told a school administrator , probably as a prank .
He initially was given a five - day suspension by an assistant principal .
He found out his suspension was extended to 20 days after a meeting at which the principal and athletic director were present .
He said he can understand five days , but the extra 15 days struck him as overly harsh .
" In the past 200 years , America 's gotten by just fine without zero tolerance , " he said .
" Why do New York state schools have to have it ? "
Robert Whalen , Matthew 's grandfather , said he understands zero tolerance because his department regularly enforces a similar policy with drunken drivers .
But he said the school 's 20 - day punishment was overly harsh , particularly in light of how it could affect his grandson 's life plans , and said officials should use " common sense " when disciplining students .
" He 's been planning this for years , " Robert Whalen said of attending West Point .
Matthew Whalen will return to school on Oct. 21 , about a week before the first part of his West Point application is due .
He said he is worried about all the school he is missing since he can only receive two hours of tutoring a day at the district 's offices .
" I 'm falling behind big - time in my classes , " he said .

PATRIOT Drug War
Act – what we ’ve been telling you all along
Those of us involved in drug policy knew this all along .
I talked about it back in 2003 just after I started blogging .
I , and others in the drug policy reform movement , noted that the government has used the drug war as an excuse to increase police powers beyond what would otherwise have been considered Constitutionally acceptable .
After 911 , the government capitalized on that event to claim that it needed to expand its power even further to go after terrorists ( explaining that it was just a logical next step from what they already had available to go after drug traffickers , so we should n’t worry our frightened little heads over it ) .
We knew that these powers would be turned right back on our own citizens to ratchet up the war on drugs in a continuing attempted cycle of increased police powers .
That ’s why this report by Ryan Grim of today ’s hearings on the PATRIOT Act , conducted by Senator Russ Feingold , come as little surprise .
In the debate over the PATRIOT Act , the Bush White House insisted it needed the authority to search people ’s homes without their permission or knowledge so that terrorists would n’t be tipped off that they ’re under investigation .
Now that the authority is law , how has the Department of Justice used the new power ?
To go after drug dealers .
Only three of the 763 “ sneak - and - peek ” requests in fiscal year 2008 involved terrorism cases , according to a July 2009 report from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts .
Sixty - five percent were drug cases .
If you ’ve got time , this is just under 5 minutes and worth watching .
Feingold does an excellent job .
And the DOJ official simply admits that the PATRIOT
Act provisions are being used primarily for the drug war .
Update : Al Franken reads the 4th Amendment to Justice Department Official .
Good for him .

Advertising Mail and the Environment
Myths and Realities
Direct mail has an environmental impact - but what is a myth and what is reality ?
Knowing the facts helps consumers , businesses and organizations formulate more informed opinions about the value of the communications in their mailbox .
Myth :
Trees are being destroyed to produce catalogs and direct mail pieces .
Reality : Direct mail is not trees , it is printed communication .
Thanks to sustainable forestry practices throughout North America , the amount of forested lands has grown significantly in recent years , providing for a steady , responsible supply of fiber used to make paper .
Trees are harvested and replanted on a continuing basis .
Today , we have more forests in the United States than we did 50 years ago , and about the same forestland in the United States as we had 100 years ago ( U.S. Forest Resource Facts and Historical Trends ) .
Old - growth forests are not harvested to make direct mail paper , and the marketplace is beginning to " certify " paper that originates from sustainably forested lands .
Myth : Catalogs and direct mail cannot be recycled , or are difficult to recycle .
Reality : In 2007 , the Federal Trade Commission gave direct marketing businesses and organizations clearance to begin including " recycle please " messaging on catalogs and direct mail pieces .
That 's because a super - majority ( 65 % ) of U.S. residents now have access to local recycling collection options , such as drop - off and curbside pickup .
Discarded catalogs classify as " old magazines , " and are highly valued for the long , strong fiber that they contain - making discarded catalogs ( and magazines ) a perfect candidate for reuse as recycled paper in office papers and newsprint .
Discarded direct mail most often classifies as " mixed paper " and is recycled as tissue papers here at home and exported abroad .
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , 35.8 % of discarded Standard Mail was recovered for recycling in 2005 - a near seven - fold increase since 1990 , and an 11.9 % increase since 2003 ( 2005 Municipal Solid Waste in the United States ) .
Claim : Discarded mail is filling up America 's landfills .
Reality : Discarded direct mail represents just 2.4 % of municipal solid waste , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the recycling recovery rate has grown nearly 700 % since 1990 .
As a result , while direct mail volume in the United States has grown 57 % in 15 years , the amount of discarded mail sent to landfills has remained virtually unchanged ( 2005 Municipal Solid Waste in the United States ) .
Myth :
The production and disposal of mail is a wasteful use of energy .
Reality :
Is the generation of commerce and consumer education a wasteful use of energy and print communication ?
More than 4 in 10 Americans make shop - at - home purchases - participating in the " Largest Carpool on Earth " ( MediaMark , 2006 ) .
By shopping ( and donating ) direct , these consumers and businesses use the convenience of their home and office to research and make purchase decisions , and rely on courier companies and the U.S. Postal Service , as they make their appointed rounds , to deliver the goods - creating a highly efficient distribution of goods and services .
Consumers also use direct mail to make targeted trips to retail locations , rather than impulsive ones .
Myth : Direct mail volume is growing out of control .
Reality : Direct mail growth reflects U.S. economic growth .
So , why is direct mail growing , even in the digital age ?
Because it is more targeted than ever - and by measuring response , companies and organizations know that direct mail works .
It is among the most efficient forms of advertising -- typically , response rates to today 's targeted direct mail campaigns are measured in whole , single and double - digit figures .
Direct - response advertising in magazines and newspapers generate response rates measured in the hundredths of a single percentage point and broadcast media response rates are measured in the thousandths of a single percentage point of total audience reached .
Even permission - based e-mail response rates rarely surpass that of targeted direct mail ( Direct Marketing Association , 2006 ) .
Myth : Americans throw much of their direct mail away unopened .
Reality : The average U.S. household receives less than three pieces of direct mail advertising per day .
According to the USPS Household Diary Study ( 2006 ) , 16 % of households choose not to read their mail - the vast majority , 81 percent read or scan the direct mail they receive .
Almost all mail eventually is discarded , thus it is vital to have recycling options available for Americans at the community level .

We 've reported on the story about Drew Olanoff , who was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and started a campaign to raise money for LIVESTRONG , auctioning the Twitter name @drew to the highest bidder .
Drew Carey bid $ 25,000 for the name , and additionally said he 'll donate $ 100,000 ( if he managed to reach 100,000 followers at his Twitter account , @drewfromtv , by Nov. 9th ) , and then raised the bid to 1 million dollars if he can reach 1 million followers by the end of the year .
Reaching one million followers is no small feat , so Drew Olanoff built a website , located at milliondollardrew.com , to promote the campaign .
Visually , it 's somewhat similar to the old Million Dollar Homepage ( anyone still remember that project ? ) , only instead of tiny pixelated images , it consists of Twitter images .
We 've no doubt that the project will be a success .
Carey said that he 'll donate as many dollars as @drewfromtv gets followers , so even if it does n't make one million , LIVESTRONG will still get a hefty donation , but we certainly hope it will .

The War of the Empire has many faces
The ' war on terror ' has become nameless since our administration changed .
But it is the same war , it has the same goals and it is as unwinnable as it always was .
But certainly there are other ways of conquering the planet , says Washington .
And so they impose the huge industries with their humungous profits on the entire world , corporations like Monsanto , Cargill , Dow , Bunge and others , giants that impose their own laws on world - wide agriculture and their goal is to make us eat only what they profit from .
Through lies and total lack of concern for the final outcome , they insert their hired crooks , their representatives , in top positions everywhere , make deals with corrupt governments all over the world , deals that make farmers the innocent victims of a world - wide scam .
The result is disaster for the farmers and the poor people all over the world and enormous power for the Biotech Companies that suck the blood out of the earth and out of the people who used to cultivate it with their own millennia - old and environmentally safe methods .
Monsanto is just about the most callous , the most harmful , the most insidious of the whole gang of predators who are out to get on top of the world - and who are ruining it savagely in the process .
They are busy ruining the environment irredeemably and the health of the inhabitants of this threatened world .
Global warming does n't even have to play out its role , the biotech industry will play the part of the Grim Reaper , mowing down everything that does not add to their profits , ruining people 's health , playing hell with the earth 's ecosystems and biodiversity that has served the planet for millennia in a world that was mostly safe from predators , the kind of sharks that devour their prey without any afterthoughts .
Monsanto plays the part as the leader of the gang of predators in the destruction of age - old agriculture that provided the world population with natural foods that fitted into the ecosystems of the region where they were grown .
And they go about this destruction with the fierce cruelty of the shark , with NO consideration for anything except the instant and short - term profit of the predators themselves .
Below are excerpts from a couple of essays , facts that need to be brought to the attention of the people of the world .
**********
See Stephen Lendman : ' Food Standards Guidelines ' Threaten Human Health - Codex Alimentarius ( CA ) serves corporate interests
* The Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1963 by the FAO ( Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN )
...
" Whatever its founding purpose , * CA is much different today because corporate interests control it - global pharmaceutical , food , and banking giants in league with complicit UN and government agencies to promote GMOs over healthy foods , and drugs over natural remedies by restricting or banning vitamin and dietary supplements , except the ones they control .
...
" On December 31 , 2009 , Codex standards will be globally mandated unless legal challenges prevent it .
In force , they 'll override food and drug laws of all member countries , including consumer protection laws and America 's 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act ( DSHEA ) .
It classifies nutrients and herbs as foods , sets no dosage limits , and permits the sale of all dietary supplements unless expressly proved unsafe .
Codex rules reverse things by prohibiting everything NOT proved safe , including high potency , therapeutically effective nutrients and supplements .
...
" In contrast , about 300 dangerous food additives will be allowed , including aspartame , BHA , BHT , potassium bromate , and tartrazine .
New guidelines will authorize the worldwide proliferation of unlabeled GMO foods , drugs , and ingredients , known to harm human health . "
There is also another important point to make in President Obama 's choice of Michael Taylor to head the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
Michael Taylor is the notorious revolving - door man who , during the George W. Bush era switched jobs between a high - level post for Monsanto and working for the government agencies that are supposed to regulate the food industry , such as Monsanto .
See ' Monsanto's Man in the Obama Administration '
By ISABELLA KENFIELD
" Michael R. Taylor 's appointment by the Obama administration to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) on July 7th sparked immediate debate and even outrage among many food and agriculture researchers , NGOs and activists .
The Vice President for Public Policy at Monsanto Corp. from 1998 until 2001 , Taylor exemplifies the revolving door between the food industry and the government agencies that regulate it .
He is reviled for shaping and implementing the government 's favorable agricultural biotechnology policies during the Clinton administration .
Yet what has slipped under everyone 's radar screen is Taylor 's involvement in setting U.S. policy on agricultural assistance in Africa .
In collusion with the Rockefeller and Bill and Melinda Gates foundations , Taylor is once again the go - between man for Monsanto and the U.S. government , this time with the goal to open up African markets for genetically - modified ( GM ) seed and agrochemicals . "
There are other proofs coming up constantly concerning the danger of GM foods .
See Jeffrey Smith ' Lyme / Autism Group Blasts Genetically Modified Foods as Dangerous '
" Stop eating dangerous genetically modified ( GM ) foods !
That 's the upshot of the Lyme Induced Autism ( LIA ) Foundation 's position paper released today . "
( August 25 , 2009 )
...
" The five main GM foods are soy , corn , cotton , canola , and sugar beets .
Their derivatives are found in more than 70 percent of the foods in the supermarket .
The primary reason the plants are engineered is to allow them to drink poison .
They 're inserted with bacterial genes that allow them to survive otherwise deadly doses of poisonous herbicide .
Biotech companies sell the seed and herbicide as a package deal .
Roundup Ready crops survive sprays of Roundup .
Liberty Link crops survive Liberty .
US farmers use hundreds of millions of pounds more herbicide because of these herbicide - tolerant crops , and the higher toxic residues end up inside of us . "

The following essay by Siv O'Neall was written right after the first airing of the documentary ' The World According to Monsanto ' ( Le monde selon Monsanto ) by French journalist and film maker Marie - Monique Robin on the French / German television channel ARTE .
In view of several recent events , among them the huge threat of the upcoming decision of a global mandate on Codex Alimentarius , we feel that it is of interest to republish this essay .
If Codex Alimentarius is globally mandated , it would spell disaster for human health and victory for the Biotech Industry and their callous drive for maximized profits without taking into consideration any proven facts about the dangers to humans and to the future of the planet .
' The World According to Monsanto ' - A documentary that Americans wo n't ever see ( Republished from March 11 , 2008 )
The gigantic biotech corporation Monsanto is threatening to destroy the agricultural biodiversity which has served mankind for thousands of years .
The endless list of genetically modified seeds , sold and controlled by Monsanto , are putting at enormous risk age - old agricultural patterns under the presumptuous slogan of aiming at solving the huge problem of hunger in the world .
On March 11 , 2008 a new documentary was aired on French television ( ARTE - French - German cultural TV channel ) by French journalist and film maker Marie - Monique Robin , entitled ' The World According to Monsanto ' [ 1 ] .
Starting from the Internet over a period of three years Robin has collected material for her documentary , going on to numerous interviews with people of very different backgrounds .
She traveled widely , from Latin America , to Asia , through Europe and the United States , to personally interview farmers and people in influential positions .
As an example of pro-Monsanto interviews , she talked at length with Michael Taylor who has worked as a lawyer for Monsanto and also for the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , where he had great influence on the legalization of the genetically modified bovine growth hormone ( rBGH ) .
It also became FDA policy during Taylor 's tenure that GM seeds are declared to be " substantially equivalent [ 2 ] to non-GM seeds , hence proclaiming proof of the harmlessness of GMs to be unnecessary .
Michael Taylor [ 3 ] is a typical example of technocrats employed via ' the revolving door policy ' .
He is now head of the Washington , D.C. office of Monsanto Corporation .
The gospel according to Monsanto is that their patented GM seeds and their bovine growth hormone ( BGH ) will increase worldwide production of agricultural , dairy and meat products and Bt cotton to the extent that worldwide hunger and poverty will be eradicated .
The actual truth is rather the opposite .
GMOs are creating serious damage all over the world and artificial rBGH injection in cows [ 4 ] cause numerous health problems , and even death .
Monsanto is not held back by any considerations of ethics and it hides the reality of its sordid machinations behind a wall of secrecy .
Everything Monsanto does is exclusively with the intent of increasing its own profit - everything else be damned .
If left to its own devices it will most certainly destroy the livelihood of millions of farmers - a process begun a decade ago in India and certainly in many other countries as well [ 5 ] .
The planet 's ecosystems will be seriously threatened by unnatural ways of changing agricultural patterns .
The dangers of GMO cultivation to the environment come in many forms :
Switching from age - old biodiverse crops that can tolerate low - level amounts of water to industrial monocultures of crops such as GM soya , cotton , sugarcane , etc. that require large amounts of irrigation .
Inundating cultivated lands with toxic herbicides , in particular the dangerous Monsanto product Roundup , to which the GMO seeds have been made biotechnically resistant .
Any other growth should succumb to Roundup , were it not for the fact that weeds to a very large extent become Roundup resistant .
Putting an end to biological farming and poisoning non GM cultures through pollenization from GM crops and accidental exposure to Roundup herbicide .
Deforestation to make more land available for the culture of the GM seeds Monsanto sells at high prices to poor farmers .
On top of all these dangers to biodiversity and biological farming comes the fact that Monsanto has patented its products and farmers are legally bound not to save seeds for replanting for the following year .
They must buy new seeds from Monsanto every year and the company has a sizeable staff that just deals with prosecuting farmers suspected of illegally using one year 's seeds for the planting of the next year 's crop .
Globalization and Poverty
Biological farming is adapted to existing ecosystems .
But age - old biological farming has had to give room to industrial monocultures that enrich the few and cause poverty and despair for millions of small farmers .
Now there is soil erosion , destruction of biodiversity and social / economic disasters in tow .
Contrary to Monsanto promises that GM seeds and Roundup would reduce production cost , farmers now have to pay skyrocketing prices for herbicides , pesticides and fertilizer . [ 6 ]
The destructive effects of genetically engineered crops are worldwide , but the extensive damage done in India has been widely documented by Dr Vandana Shiva .
She is a physicist and environmentalist as well as a tireless activist and author of many books concerning the nefarious consequences of GM farming as opposed to the wisdom of traditional family and biological farming .
She is currently based in New Delhi .
Quote from Dr. Vandana Shiva :
" I am writing this statement from beautiful Doon Valley in the Himalaya where the monsoons have arrived , and our Navdanya ( Nine Seeds - Our National Movement on Conservation of Biodiversity ) team is busy with transplanting of over 300 rice varieties which we are conserving along with the rich diversity of other agricultural crops .
Our farm does not use any chemicals or external inputs .
It is a self - regenerative system which preserves biodiversity while meeting human needs and needs of farm animals .
Our 2 bullocks are the alternative to chemical fertilisers which pollute soil and water as well as to tractors and fossil fuels which pollute the atmosphere and destabilise the climate . " [ 7 ]
" Economic globalization has become a war against nature and the poor " says Dr. Vandana Shiva .
" Recently I was visiting Bhatinda in Punjab because of an epidemic of farmers ' suicides .
Punjab used to be the most prosperous agricultural region in India .
Today every farmer is in debt and despair .
Vast stretches of land have become waterlogged desert .
And , as an old farmer pointed out , even the trees have stopped bearing fruit because heavy use of pesticides has killed the pollinators - the bees and butterflies .
" And Punjab is not alone in experiencing this ecological and social disaster .
Last year I was in Warangal , Andhra Pradesh , where farmers have also been committing suicide .
Farmers who traditionally grew pulses and millets and paddy have been lured by seed companies to buy hybrid cotton seeds referred to as " white gold " , which were supposed to make them millionaires .
Instead they became paupers . " [ 8 ]
In India as well as in China it has been proven that the unscrupulous promises of Monsanto that Bt cotton ( genetically engineered cotton ) would produce a far higher yield and prove less costly in terms of herbicide and fertilizer required have been the exact opposite of what was promised .
Bt cotton increases irrigation and water requirements where biological cotton would thrive without added irrigation .
Thus the yield of Bt cotton has been far inferior to that of biological cotton and the costs of production significantly higher . [ 9 ]
Disastrous health problems caused by GMO products
In spite of the reassurances from Monsanto and its own lawyers and scientists that GMO cultures and Roundup herbicide are not health hazardous , it has been proven in their own research that rats have developed different forms of tumors and other health problems .
However , instead of pushing the research further , they put a complete stop to it .
From : ( ' Economic , health & environmental impacts of Roundup - type chemical and Roundup Ready soybeans ' , by Ronnie Cummins )
" As farmers know , there is a cancer epidemic in America 's heartland - partly resulting from exposure to chemicals like Roundup , and partly from ingesting contaminated food and drinking water . "
Particularly when Roundup is applied by aerial spraying , the risk of drift of the herbicide to close - by crops and trees is considerable .
Both trees and nutritious and medicinal herbs have been proven to be killed or producing severely damaged fruit and leaves from the effect of Roundup being sprayed on nearby cultures , by air as well as by ground spraying .
From ' New research on the impact of GMOs on health '
" Although some GMOs have been approved and marketed for several years , there was no body of scientific research on their impact on the biology of living organisms .
This is partly because animal feeding trials are not required in the current safety approval process for GMOs in the EU or USA .
Only now is a body of evidence starting to emerge from a small number of animal feeding trials into the health effects and progress in the new science of epigenetics .
This indicates that genetic engineering is much more unpredictable and risky than traditional breeding . " [ 10 ]
Various health problems from GMO products have been identified , from serious skin problems in humans in Argentina at soya plantations ( documented by Marie - Monique Robin in her film - The World According to Monsanto ) , to allergies in humans as well as tumors , damage to internal organs and internal bleeding in rats fed with genetically engineered potatoes .
From a lack of sufficient research and the fact that many health hazards develop over a long period of time , there is still no complete list of real health hazards to humans caused by GMO products .
Monsanto who provides 90 % of the world 's long list of genetically engineered products [ 11 ] ( having bought up 50 smaller companies during the last decade ) does their business with such complete secrecy that there are still sold - out individuals out there who praise the complete revolution of agriculture achieved by the culture of GMO crops .
These corrupt people seem to be totally unaware of the health hazards and the drive to despair and ruin of small farmers caused by GMO products .
They seem to still believe that genetically engineered seeds can save the world 's food problems .
Or worse yet , they do n't care .
A high representative for Monsanto has openly admitted that " We want to control the world 's food supply . " [ 12 ]
It is also very clear that they have no concern for health hazards or human disasters caused by the callous decisions of world leaders to give up on biological farming and opt for genetically engineered food production and monoculture industrial farming .
The proofs that GM huge industrial monocultures and Roundup herbicide are destroying the earth 's environment and human health are completely censured and ignored , due to intense lobbying and pressure from sold - out individuals at the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration .
Once again , only corporate profit counts and people as well as the environment are of no importance .
And the neocon puppets are playing the game with great gusto .

A rapid increase in indebtedness , was at the root of farmers taking their lives .
Debt is a reflection of a negative economy , a loosing economy .
Two factors have transformed the positive economy of agriculture into a negative economy for peasants - the rising costs of production and the falling prices of farm commodities .
Both these factors are rooted in the policies of trade liberalization and corporate globalisation .

The shift from farm - saved seed to corporate monopolies of the seed supply is also a shift from biodiversity to monocultures in agriculture .
The District of Warangal in Andhra Pradesh ( India ) used to grow diverse legumes , millets , and oilseeds .
Seed monopolies created crop monocultures of cotton , leading to disappearance of millions of products of nature 's evolution and farmer 's breeding .
Monocultures and uniformity increase the risks of crop failure as diverse seeds adapted to diverse ecosystems are replaced by rushed introduction of unadapted and often untested seeds into the market .
When Monsanto first introduced Bt Cotton in India in 2002 , the farmers lost Rs. 1 billion due to crop failure .
Instead of 1,500 Kg / acre as promised by the company , the harvest was as low as 200 kg .
Instead of increased incomes of Rs. 10,000 / acre , farmers ran into losses of Rs. 6400 / acre . ( Vandana Shiva )

Much has been written about the relationship between SAT scores and test - takers ’ family income .
Generally speaking , the wealthier a student ’s family is , the higher the SAT score .
Let ’s take a look at how income correlated with scores this year .
About two - thirds of test - takers voluntarily report their family incomes when they sit down to take the SAT .
Using this information , the College Board breaks down the average scores for 10 income groups , each in a $ 20,000 range .

A few observations :
A student at a university in the Democratic Republic of Congo got a sharp response from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when he asked what her husband thought of an issue .
Mrs Clinton was asked , through a translator , what former President Bill Clinton thought about Chinese investment in the country .
Officials said later that the student had apologised to Mrs Clinton , saying he had meant to ask what President Obama thought .
As readers will know by now , this is an austere kind of column .
We do n't do sex scandals .
We do n't dabble our fingers in the stuff of people 's souls .
I would not normally dream of citing a divorce case now unfolding before the courts ; and therefore I will keep the details to the minimum before we come to the point at interest .
Let us say that there is a certain glamorous blonde in the throes of parting with her husband .
She claims that he is worth £ 400 million and that under the laws of England she is entitled to half of his assets .
He claims that this dosh has all but vanished .
As soon as she lost that loving feeling , she found that his cash was gone , gone , gone and could not now be retrieved .
I have no idea who is right .
It may be that the husband never had the £ 400 m , or it may be that he left it in the back of a taxi or accidentally mixed it up with the dog food .
Or it may be that the estranged wife is right to think that he still has it behind the sofa or in the cistern of the downstairs loo .
CHICAGO -- Milton Bradley said he 's experienced plenty of hatred during his rough first season with the Chicago Cubs after signing a three - year , $ 30 million contract .
Bradley has been booed at times by the impatient fans at Wrigley Field during Chicago 's disappointing season .
Bradley went 4 for 4 on Tuesday night with a homer but talked after the game about how difficult it has been to be comfortable " when you do n't get a hit and get booed every time .
" When I go home and look in the mirror , I like what I see .
My family is there I have people I can talk to who are very supportive , in spite of everything and all the adversity and the hatred you face on a daily basis .
But I 'll be all right .
I always have . "
Asked Wednesday to elaborate on his comments from the previous night after a 15 - 6 Cubs loss , Bradley said :
" I 'm talking about hatred , period .
I 'm talking about when I go to eat at a restaurant .
I 've got to listen to the waiters badmouthing me at another table , sitting in a restaurant .
That 's what I 'm talking about .
Everything . "
Bradley took a .259 average with 10 homers and only 32 RBIs into Wednesday night 's game against the Washington Nationals , hugely disappointing numbers for a player brought into help the Cubs reach the next level after back - to - back division titles .
Instead , they began play Wednesday nine games out of first .
Cubs fans have let Bradley hear it .
There were a few scattered boos Wednesday night after he struck out in the first inning .
" All I 'm saying is I pray the game is nine innings , so I can go out there the least amount of time possible and go home , " Bradley said .
Left fielder Alfonso Soriano , who 's also struggled this season , said ignoring the fans who boo is the best way to shut them up and off .
" You can not listen to those fans because they pay their money , they can do whatever they want .
But if you listen , they want to do it more , " Soriano said .
" But if you ignore them like ` I do n't care , ' they want to get tired . "
Bradley , known for emotional outbursts throughout his career , said what he 's gone through is not new and is not surprising .
" It 's nothing that just started when Milton Bradley came here , " he said .
So does he regret signing with the Cubs , who are his seventh major league team ?
" I do n't regret anything , " he said .
" I regret that there are idiots in the world , that 's what I regret . "

Why : Consumers who use Android , the Google - developed operating system for wireless devices , ca n't use Skype , a leading Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) service .
A pioneer in free Internet calling , Skype allows you to talk as long as you want without draining cellphone minutes .
Android users get Skype Lite , a watered - down version of the original that routes calls over traditional phone networks — not the Internet .
As a result , long - distance calls are still cheap or free , but cellphone minutes are gobbled up every time a Skype Lite call is made .
Ben Scott , public policy director of Free Press , a consumer advocacy group , says Google " is in an awkward spot .
On the one hand , their application is being blocked on the Apple App Store .
But on the other hand , they engaged in similar behavior " with Skype .
Skype , to some degree , is caught in the middle .
Android " does not support a full - featured version of Skype , " Skype told USA TODAY .
" In order to make Skype available on Android devices , as well as hundreds of other regular mobile phones , we designed Skype Lite . "
In a statement prepared for USA TODAY , Google acknowledged that it " has the ability to filter , " or block , VoIP .
The search giant said it does that " at the request " of individual operators .
Right now , there are just two Android devices in the USA : the G1 and MyTouch , both sold by T - Mobile .
Google 's explanation would seem to suggest that T - Mobile requested the block on Skype , but the carrier says that 's not the case .
" T - Mobile has not asked Google to block that service , " says spokesman Joe Farren , referring to original Skype .
Google says the latest version of Android for developers would support full VoIP , but no developer has submitted an app .
As part of its Google Voice probe , the FCC has asked Google to describe its process for " considering and approving " Android apps .
The agency also asked the Web giant to specify the percentage of apps that are rejected and explain why .
Roger Entner , head of telecom research at Nielsen , says that with wireless red hot he's not surprised Google , Apple and the others are playing hardball .

So a lot of folks were disturbed by my post last night about the pilot using my laptop and wi-fi card to find a new route .
I would have explained last night , but we did n’t get to Dallas until after 1 am and I went right to sleep .
There were two or three different lines of storms in the west and south that were effecting all Newark outbound air traffic .
There is no mechanism on a 737-500 to look at weather .
The radar they have only works in flight , and even then it ca n’t show what ’s happening outside of about 50 miles .
We were 50 th–yes 50 th–on line for takeoff and the captain said that at that point air traffic control really does not care anymore .
Their number one priority is international flights , then they get to domestic .
So he wanted to see if he could figure out a new route around the storms that he could propose to air traffic control .
Neat .
So they used my laptop to go to this site : http://www.intellicast.com.
The best part was that neither of them knew how to drive a Mac , let alone Safari , so I surfed for them .
It was cool to listen to them talk about different flight plans .
This went on for a few minutes and then they got on with air traffic control and someone found a new route .
I ’m not sure if it was us or air traffic control , but I ’d like to think it was us .
I was really hoping for a pair of wings or an honorary junior captain ’s badge or something but all I got was an extra cookie from the flight attendant .
That was pretty cool .
Oh , one more thing .
I ’ll never be able to help when the “ is there a doctor on board ” announcement comes over the PA system .
But when the “ is there someone with wi - fi who knows how to use the internet on board ” announcement is made , I ’m there .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
At the broadest level , everything we can do to address climate change / national security / energy balance of trade and just about any other meaningful social question associated with our energy use falls into one of three categories :
1 . Use less downstream energy .
Turn down the thermostat , ride your bike to work , move to a smaller home , etc .
2. Switch upstream fuels .
Favor coal in the name of national security .
Favor nuclear in the name of CO2 .
Favor wind in the name of green jobs .
Etc .
3 . Use less upstream energy .
Insulate your home , build CHP plants , recycle your plastic and aluminum waste , etc .
All three have a critical role to play , but note that only the third creates social benefits and can be guaranteed to increase our overall standard of living .
In the famous Amory Lovins-ism , no one gives a damn about how much coal , oil or gas they use – they care about how hot their shower is and how cold their beer .
Ergo , we ought to make maximal use of anything that fits into that third bucket as a matter of public policy .
Which raises the question : how big is that third bucket ?
Or , framed another way : how much energy does the U.S. currently waste ?
Any increase in our efficiency of energy conversion ( from upstream fuel to downstream energy ) is implicitly a reduction in our energy waste .
Tell me how much we waste and you will tell me the maximum size of that third bucket .
How Much do we Consume ?
As it turns out , there ’s very little good data on how much energy we waste .
DOE estimates that we use about 100 quadrillion btus ( “ quads ” ) of primary energy per year .
But they too often present that data in charts like this one that seem to assume a perfectly efficient economy .
As that great philosopher Homer Simpson said , “ In this house , we obey the laws of thermodynamics ! ”
And I ’m pretty sure thermo says that you ca n’t get 100 percent of the energy you put in out in a useful form .
DOE charts to the contrary notwithstanding …
Nonetheless , this does bound our analysis .
If we put 100 quads of primary energy in , we must get 100 quads out somewhere .
At the very least , it implies that there ca n’t be more than 100 quads of wasted energy presently available in the system .
Solid Waste
EPA estimates that the average American produces 1,130 lbs of trash per year .
At 4,500 btu/lb and just over 307 million people , that ’s 1.6 quads of energy in our trash .
Add in 6.5 million metric tons of solid waste in our sewage per year at 10,000 btu / dry ton and that ’s another 0.1 quads .
So in total , all our solid waste is about 1.7 quads of total energy waste , or 1.7 percent of all our primary energy use .
Industrial Waste
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has estimated that the US could produce 96 GW of electric power from energy that is currently wasted by the US industrial sector .
( This waste includes a host of different materials , from paper sludge to waste heat . )
RED ‘s internal analysis suggests that this may be conservative , but let ’s use the LBNL data .
Assuming 25 percent fuel - to - power generation efficiency ( and assuming further that this represents 100 percent of all energy wasted by the US industrial sector , and not simply the economically recoverable / LBNL - identifiable fraction ) that works out to an additional 11.4 quads .
Power Generation Waste
In 2008 , we generated 3,806,611 GWh from fossil - fired thermal power plants .
Those plants , on average , operate at 33 percent fuel efficiency , meaning that for every 1 unit of electric power generated , 2 units of waste heat were thrown away in cooling towers , rivers and streams .
That ’s 2 x 3,806,611 GWh of wasted heat , or 26.4 quads up in smoke .
Transportation Waste
The total US transportation sector uses some 28.6 quads of fuel per year .
For rather obvious reasons , there ’s not a lot of good data on how much of that goes out the tailpipe vs. a more productive use .
But conservatively , let ’s assume that we get 30 percent of the useful energy out of that fuel ( this is considerably higher than a passenger car over normal driving cycles , but probably low for rail , shipping and long - haul trucking on an efficiency per ton - mile basis . )
Clearly , this is the least accurate of the numbers , but even at 30 percent , that implies an additional waste of 0.7 x 28.6 or 20 quads of waste , going into tail pipe exhaust , hot brakes , burnt tires , etc .
Total Identifiable Waste
Add those all up and we ’ve got 100 quads of primary energy and 60 quads of waste energy .
For all the reasons noted above , the waste energy is probably much higher , but even at this level , it is a massive opportunity .
Recovering just half of this total would reduce every issue associated with fossil fuel use by one third with no detriment to our standard of living .
Getting this waste out of the system ought to be a priority of our national energy and environmental policy .
Quinton “ Rampage ” Jackson Humps Interviewer : Video
I do n’t follow MMA , so I have no idea if this interviewer is someone noteworthy , nor do I know what this interview of Quinton “ Rampage ” Jackson is for .
All I know is that it features a lot of humping .
Part way through the interview , the girl who was questioning Rampage suggested they star in a romantic comedy together .
He then started humping her .
After about 2 seconds of pelvic thrusting , the act starts to get old , then it just gets uncomfortable and weird as he continues at a quietly frantic pace like a puppy who needs to be Bob Barkered .
The giggly and ever - so - professional girl is eventually rescued , but apparently nobody warned her about his antics , as this is not the first time he ’s gotten frisky while being interviewed .
Someone get this guy on a leash the next time he goes on camera .

Will he or wo n't he ?
Everyone 's waiting to see what President Obama will say in tomorrow night 's speech .
Will he draw a line in the sand over the public option ?
Despite the president 's rousing speech yesterday , this article makes it seem doubtful .
Here 's the problem in a nutshell : President Obama is looking for " something he can call a public option , " not an actual public option .
He wants a political compromise above an actual solution - an approach which may work on some issues , but is ill - suited to the magnitude of this health care crisis :
Amid fresh signs that the White House is preparing to back a scaled - down health care overhaul that would only include a public insurance option as a fallback plan , several House liberals told Roll Call that they could support such a bill depending on how it was structured .
The “ trigger ” approach has been considered a deal - killer by liberals on and off Capitol Hill , and the willingness of some Congressional Progressive Caucus members to entertain it reflects a recognition that a bruising August recess has imperiled prospects for reform and redrawn expectations for what is possible .
“ This is a way to get a bill , ” Rep. Bill Pascrell ( D - N.J. ) said .
“ I believe it ’s worth listening to because I want legislation that is going to , in some shape or form , expand coverage and bring down the cost of health care . ”
Boy , that 's a far cry from what we heard a year ago , is n't it ?
Because we 're not all that interested in Massachusetts - style mandates that not only are n't worth anything to people whose budgets are already stretched too thin , it imposes an additional burden for the privilege .
And it sounds like the progressive caucus is starting to crack .
Joint statement by the Sudanese Communist Party and the Tudeh Party of Iran
Recently , representatives of the central committees of the Tudeh Party of Iran and the Sudanese Communist Party exchanged views and consulted on the political situation unfolding in Iran , in light of the rigged elections of June 12 and the mass protests that quickly took place and began to gain momentum shortly thereafter .
The two parties discussed the political situation in their respective countries and the conditions in which the struggle for peace , human rights , democracy and social justice is taking place .
Based on their discussion and deliberations the leaderships of the two fraternal parties hereby issue the following statement :
The existing electoral process in Iran is a mockery of democracy , designed to disenfranchise the Iranian electorate .
Its entire se- up is not related to the pursuit and furthering of democracy or any concept of progress within Iranian society but to keep the reins of power firmly in the hands of the despotic theocratic regime regardless of the wishes and aspirations of the Iranian people .
Despite using every method to orientate the electoral process in their favour , the ruling guard of the theocracy still sought fit to directly rig the outcome of the ballots cast on the day of the election .
The two parties observed that the Iranian people have demonstrated their revulsion towards this dictatorship through the ballot box and then further with widespread peaceful protests in the wake of the news of the fraudulent result .
Both parties strongly condemn the sham re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad which has been directly supported and ratified by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei .
The clerical regime has demonstrated the depth of its bankruptcy by mobilisation the state security apparatus including the vicious and feared paramilitary forces against peaceful demonstrators .
Representatives of the Iranian and Sudanese Communist Parties condemned the killing and injuring of hundreds of innocent citizens and arrest of more than 800 activists including leaders of the reform movement .
Representative of the Sudanese Communist Party stated that the party “ shares the analysis of the Tudeh Party of Iran that the struggle currently being waged by large sections of Iranian society for the fair and due processing of their votes is a deeply genuine struggle for democracy and must be respected .
Sudanese Communists join their Iranian counterparts in expressing their serious concern and alarm over the obvious falsification of the election results and the brutal treatment of those protesting against this shameful policies and actions of the Iranian regime .
We condemn the brutal and violent suppression of the Iranian people ’s democratic rights to protest against what they perceive to have been an unfair and fraudulently conducted election .
These events have once again exposed the brutal and reactionary nature of the Islamic republic . ”
The two parties support the demands of the mass popular movement and its leadership for the continuation of the people ’s exercise of their right to demonstrate peacefully and the nullification of the rigged June 12 ballot and holding of fresh elections .
We demand the release of all political prisoners and those arrested over the recent weeks .
We call for all those responsible for the rigging of the election and subsequent suppression of demonstrators to be tried in open courts of law .
We stand in solidarity with Iran 's trade unions , working people , women , students and all of Iran 's democratic forces in their brave and unflinching struggle for liberty and democracy .
The Sudanese Communist Party firmly reiterate its support and enthusiasm for the major part that the women ’s movement in Iran have played in the recent popular movement in their pursuit of equality , a better position for women in Iranian society and for an end to stifling traditional patriarchy .
The Sudanese communists also support and applaud the struggle of Iran ’s progressive intellectuals , artists and journalists against censorship and for freedom of expression and right to be published .
They join the Tudeh Party in steadfastly condemning the limitations placed by the Islamic regime on the Iranian population , its repression of any dissent and the brutal tactics it has employed to put down any sign of opposition .
The representative of the Central Committee of Tudeh Party of Iran expressed support for the struggle of the Sudanese democratic forces and communists against repression , reactionary and dictatorial laws of censorship , and for democratic rights including the right to freedom of expression , assembly , and freedom of the press .
Tudeh Party of Iran supports the struggle to achieve a democratic and peaceful solution to the Darfur problem with the active participation of the people of Darfur and their political organisations as well as all the Sudanese political parties and interested civil society organisation .
Both the Tudeh Party of Iran and the Sudanese Communist Party believe that respect for human rights and democracy are the fundamental prerequisites in any society for the development of social justice .

I can see why Girls Gone Wild is so popular , if this is any indication .

Yesterday , Majority Leader Harry Reid testified in support of a bill championed by Senator Leahy to repeal the anti-trust exemption health insurance companies currently enjoy .
The bill has received a ton of support :
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) on Wednesday called for an amendment to the health care reform bill that would remove the long - standing antitrust exemption for insurers , echoing a push by other Democrats to crack down on the industry .
" The health insurance ’s antitrust exemption is one of the worst accidents of American history , " Schumer said .
" It deserves a lot of the blame for the huge rise in premiums that has made health insurance so unaffordable .
It is time to end this special status and bring true competition to the health insurance industry . " ... Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) added his support to repealing the exemption at the Leahy hearing .
" It ’s something that should have been done a long time ago , " Reid said .
As for insurance companies , " There is n’t anything we could do to satisfy them in this health care bill .
Nothing , " Reid said .
" They are so anti-competitive .
Why ?
Because they make more money than any other business in America today .
. . . What a sweet deal they have . "
The exemption , known as McCarran - Ferguson , cedes regulatory control of the industry , on the business side , to individual states .
But repealing the antitrust exemption would give the federal government more authority to oversee the business side of health insurance companies — something states now have the sole authority to monitor .
...
Leahy ’s bill would repeal the exemption established in the 1945 McCarran - Ferguson
Act for any companies engaged in price fixing or bid rigging — which are both already illegal .
He has introduced similar legislation in other Congresses , including a broader repeal of the underlying law .
Reid is a co-sponsor of the current bill .
In the House , where Democratic leaders are exploring the issue further , Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) has introduced legislation that would essentially end McCarran - Ferguson and give the federal government the right to regulate insurers at the national level .
So , what would this repeal do ?
In testimony on the bill yesterday , Christine Varney , the government 's top anti-trust lawyer , said :
The McCarran - Ferguson
Act antitrust exemption is very expansive with regard to anything that can be said to fall within " the business of insurance , " including premium pricing and market allocations .
As a result , " the most egregiously anticompetitive claims , such as naked agreements fixing price or reducing coverage , are virtually always found immune . "
Concerns over the exemption ’s effects are especially relevant given the importance of health insurance reform to our nation .
There is a general consensus that health insurance reform should be built on a strong commitment to competition in all health - care markets , including those for health and medical malpractice insurance .
Repealing the McCarran - Ferguson
Act would allow competition to have a greater role in reforming health and medical malpractice insurance markets than would otherwise be the case .
There is a ton of evidence that premium price fixing and backroom deals to preserve market share between competitors occur regularly today .
Health Care for America Now 's report [ pdf ] on insurance industry absuses documents how Blue Cross Blue Shield in Massachusetts and a big hospital made a deal to increase payments to providers , and providers made a deal to not allow any other insurer to pay them less .
Thus , Blue Cross raised their rates , leading to a period of skyrocketing premium increases in Massachusetts , the hospital got rich off their locked in payments , and other hospitals and insurers in the state had to scramble to keep up .
In all , people had to pay more , and those increased premiums were passed along to the hospitals in on the deal .
This kind of price fixing and deal making is absolutely illegal in other businesses , but in the insurance industry , because of their anti-trust exemptions , they 're allowed to screw customers without repercussions .
Similarly , Health Care for America
Now found that 94 % of insurance markets in this country are " highly concentrated , " a Department of Justice term that means these markets are at risk for monopoly .
For example , in Arkansas [ pdf ] , Blue Cross Blue Shield controls 75 % of the market , a level of concentration that would raise anti-trust lawsuits in any other industry .
These kinds of market concentrations were caused by years of mergers , mergers that would never have been allowed under normal anti-trust rules .
And this market concentration is a huge driver of skyrocketing costs .
Ending the anti-trust exemption would be a huge start towards ending these abuses .
The insurance industry needs two things : Real competition and an end to their anti-trust exemption .
Price fixing , backroom deals , collusion , and market - concentrating mergers should once again be illegal in health insurance .
And we need a public health insurance option to ensure insurance companies follow the rules set out for them .
Anything less and we 'll get more of what we have now - skyrocketing prices and anti-competitive dealmaking resulting in more medical bankruptcies for Americans .

Remarks of President Barack Obama Weekly Address October 24 , 2009 Washington , DC
All across America , even today , on a Saturday , millions of Americans are hard at work .
They ’re running the mom and pop stores and neighborhood restaurants we know and love .
They ’re building tiny startups with big ideas that could revolutionize an industry , maybe even transform our economy .
They are the more than half of all Americans who work at a small business , or own a small business .
And they embody the spirit of possibility , the relentless work ethic , and the hope for something better that is at the heart of the American Dream .
They also represent a segment of our economy that has been hard hit by this recession .
Over the past couple of years , small businesses have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs .
Many have struggled to get the loans they need to finance their inventories and make payroll .
Many entrepreneurs can’t get financing to start a small business in the first place .
And many more are discouraged from even trying because of the crushing costs of health care – costs that have forced too many small businesses to cut benefits , shed jobs , or shut their doors for good .
Small businesses have always been the engine of our economy – creating 65 percent of all new jobs over the past decade and a half – and they must be at the forefront of our recovery .
That ’s why the Recovery Act was designed to help small businesses expand and create jobs .
It ’s provided $ 5 billion worth of tax relief , as well as temporarily reducing or eliminating fees on SBA loans and guaranteeing some of these loans up to 90 percent , which has supported nearly $ 13 billion in new lending to more than 33,000 businesses .
In addition , our health reform plan will allow small businesses to buy insurance for their employees through an insurance exchange , which may offer better coverage at lower costs – and we ’ll provide tax credits for those that choose to do so .
And this past week , I called on Congress to increase the maximum size of various SBA loans , so that more small business owners can set up shop and grow their operations .
I also announced that we ’ll be taking additional steps through our Financial Stability plan to make more credit available to the small local and community banks that so many small businesses depend on – the banks who know their borrowers , who gave them their first loan and watched them grow .
The goal here is to get credit where it ’s needed most – to businesses that support families , sustain communities , and create the jobs that power our economy .
That ’s why we enacted the Financial Stability Plan in the first place , back when many of our largest banks were on the verge of collapse ; our credit markets were frozen ; and it was nearly impossible for ordinary people to get loans to buy a car or home or pay for college .
The idea was to jumpstart lending and keep our economy from spiraling into a depression .
Fortunately , it worked .
Thanks to the American taxpayers , we ’ve now achieved the stability we need to get our economy moving forward again .
But while credit may be more available for large businesses , too many small business owners are still struggling to get the credit they need .
These are the very taxpayers who stood by America ’s banks in a crisis – and now it ’s time for our banks to stand by creditworthy small businesses , and make the loans they need to open their doors , grow their operations , and create new jobs .
It ’s time for those banks to fulfill their responsibility to help ensure a wider recovery , a more secure system , and more broadly shared prosperity .
And we ’re going to take every appropriate step to encourage them to meet those responsibilities .
Because if it ’s one thing we ’ve learned , it ’s that here in America , we rise and fall together .
Our economy as a whole can’t move ahead if small businesses and the middle class continue to fall behind .
This country was built by dreamers .
They ’re the workers who took a chance on their desire to be their own boss .
The part - time inventors who became the fulltime entrepreneurs .
The men and women who have helped build the American middle class , keeping alive that most American of ideals – that all things are possible for all people , and we ’re limited only by the size of our dreams and our willingness to work for them .
We need to do everything we can to ensure that they can keep taking those risks , acting on those dreams , and building the enterprises that fuel our economy and make us who we are .
Thanks .

Today in Biology we looked at population growth , graphing populations of bacteria ( hypothetical ) , bees in a hive , deer and the human population .
The rate of population growth is dependent on four factors – births and immigration ( increase ) and deaths and emigration ( decrease ) .
In the hypothetical situation of bacterial growth with no limits , we saw that the population increased exponentially .
Bees showed a gradual increase and then reached their equilibrium around the ‘ carrying capacity ’ of the hive .
The ‘ carrying capacity ’ is dependent on environmental pressures such as space and nutrient availablity .
Other environmental factors that will affect population growth include predation , disease ( parasites and pathogens ) , catastrophic weather events ( drought , flood , fire , storms ) and habitat destruction .
The deer population showed a more gradual increase , a peak and then a sharp decline .
This may have been as a result of hunting , drought , disease , introduced predators or parasites .
The human population growth showed an exponential increase , with our global population now at nearly 7 billion people .
Check out the Worldometer for current ( real - time ) population statisitcs .
Worldmapper has some interesting thematic maps showing the size of each country relative to different statistics – for example population , infant mortality , life span or income .
One good example of how a human population exceeded it ’s carrying capacity is Easter Island .
“ The Mystery of Easter Island ” describes how a once flourishing civilisation was reduced to starvation , disease , war and cannabilism .
This was also the title of an excellent documentary .
We also discussed the article “ More than 100 million women are missing ” and “ Where did 100 million missing women go ? ”
A black youth worker arrested and charged for watching at a distance as police detained a teenager at a London railway station is to receive an apology and £ 22,000 compensation from the British Transport police .
Ken Hinds , 50 , who regularly liaises with police in his work for a charity tackling gang violence , will receive the payout under an agreement to be finalised later this week .
While his lawyer welcomed the settlement , she expressed grave concern that the officers involved received only a minor reprimand despite their admission – contrary to the evidence they gave in court – that one of them copied his evidence from his colleague .
Fiona Murphy , of solicitors Bhatt Murphy , also condemned the BTP for failing to properly investigate the incident over a period of five years , and only settling when faced with a high court claim for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution .
Incidents in which black men were arrested for no apparent reason remained " almost routine " despite decades of efforts to eradicate racism among police forces in London , she added .
Hinds was returning home from an Arts Council event in May 2004 and had arranged to meet his son , then aged 12 , at Seven Sisters train station in north London .
While waiting in the ticket hall , he saw a group of police arresting a young black man and stood where he could observe from a distance in case he was needed as a witness .
He was then approached by another officer , from the BTP .
" He walked over and said : ' Do you know that young man ? '
I said no .
He said : ' Fuck off , then .
It 's got nothing to do with you , ' " Hinds said .
After insisting calmly that he was within his legal rights to remain , Hinds was first threatened with arrest and then marched across the station in handcuffs by two BTP policemen .
Hinds was taken to a north London police station and held for four hours .
He was charged with threatening and abusive behaviour but acquitted after magistrates questioned why witness statements by two policemen involved were worded identically in several passages .
It later transpired one policeman had been emailed his colleagues ' version , which he had partly copied .
Two internal BTP investigations concluded that the officers had merely been incompetent in exchanging their accounts and failed to consider the allegation that they had been dishonest .
" That is the disappointing thing about this , " said Murphy .
" Despite apologising to Mr Hinds , the BTP have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to investigate properly , mislaying CCTV footage of him in the station and failing even to try and track down the emails between the officers . "
A BTP statement released as part of the settlement said the force " regrets the circumstances " in which Hinds was asked to move on at the station " and wishes to apologise for this " , while admitting no liability over the event .
Hinds said he was sorry that even this had to be " prised out of them " .
He says he backs the police and fully supports efforts to attract more black recruits .
" My message to them is : we understand you 've got a difficult job and you wo n't get it right 100 % of the time , and we want you there to help safeguard our communities , but we want you to do it in a fair and just way .
When you do make a mistake , say sorry .
It 's not a big deal .
But in my case it took a long time . "
Cheney should recall that the Republican nominee for president past time around believed that Cheney authorized torture , took the position that waterboarding was indisputably torture , and that the Bush administration had grotesquely violated American honor by embracing the tactics of police states and totalitarian regimes .
If Cheney travels abroad ( which is probably an unwise thing for a war criminal to do ) , he might understand the depth of the abyss he cast the US 's reputation into .
Cheney is fighting against a narrative that will , in due course , cast him in history as one of the most criminal and incompetent officials in American history .
It is logical for him to fight in this way , to lie about his record and to attack a sitting president in the vilest way possible while that president and the country remains at war .
It is not logical for anyone else to take him the faintest bit seriously .
Except for this :
For a former vice - president to do this in real time , and to use this kind of rhetoric , and play with these kinds of stakes - to warn , in fact , than any future terror attack will be blamed on the president , not al Qaeda , and used as partisan tool to get his own allies in power again to prevent justice being brought to him and his criminal cronies - well , it 's as despicable as the rest of Cheney 's record .
Which is saying something .
I wondered if Cheney 's record and legacy could get even worse after his eight years of thuggery and incompetence .
He 's proving every day that it can .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

ABC Radio National ’s Philosopher ’s Zone has a fantastic programme discussing Michel Foucault ’s influential book ‘ Madness and Civilisation ’ on the 50th anniversary of its publication .
The book is nominally a history of madness since the enlightenment .
Foucault argues that the age saw a cultural shift where madness was distinguished from reason and the civilised mind and where the mad were marked out and separated from mainstream society .
He argues that Europe began creating legal and social mechanisms to control those they deemed mad .
Not least among these was the invention of the asylum and Foucault cites the 17th century as where lunatics began to be banished to these imposing human warehouses in what he called the ‘ great confinement ’ .
Except , it never happened .
As the late great medical historian Roy Porter noted in his book A Social History of Madness ( ISBN 1857995023 ) , there is no evidence of a systematic confinement of the mad in the 17th century .
The records show that France was the only country in Europe to centralise its administration of services for the ‘ pauper madman ’ while other countries did n’t typically have any legislation in place until the 19th century .
This detail is glossed over by the programme but , by examining some other of Foucault ’s claims , it does make a similar point that Madness and Civilisation is n’t actually a very good history book .
This has only recently become clear to many as while an abridged version has been available for years in English , the full translation , including the now clearly inadequate references to historical sources , was only published in 2005 .
Perhaps the book ’s lasting legacy is not in the details of the rather shaky arguments but in the way in which Foucault approached the subject : showing that medical and scientific concepts are influenced as much by cultural beliefs and fashions as by empirical data .
By the way , Porter ’s A Social History of Madness is a little academic in it ’s style but is otherwise absolutely fantastic .
It got glowing reviews from pretty much everyone in psychiatry including arch ‘ anti-psychiatrist ’
Thomas Szasz , which is quite an achievement in itself .
Link to Philosopher ’s Zone on Madness and Civilisation .
The political world is astir .
Economies are faltering .
Public trust is waning .
Individuals feel vulnerable .
And social cohesion wears thin .
Meanwhile , stories of rage and agitation fill our airwaves , streets and town halls .
Where are the voices of balance and moderation in these extreme times ?
During a recent address given in an interfaith setting , Church President Thomas S. Monson declared : " When a spirit of goodwill prompts our thinking and when united effort goes to work on a common problem , the results can be most gratifying . "
Further , former Church President Gordon B. Hinckley once said that living “ together in communities with respect and concern one for another ” is “ the hallmark of civilization . ”
That hallmark is under increasing threat .
So many of the habits and conventions of modern culture — ubiquitous media , anonymous and unsourced online participation , politicization of the routine , fractured community and family life — undermine the virtues and manners that make peaceful coexistence in a pluralist society possible .
The fabric of civil society tears when stretched thin by its extremities .
Civility , then , becomes the measure of our collective and individual character as citizens of a democracy .
A healthy democracy maintains equilibrium through diverse means , including a patchwork of competing interests and an effective system of governmental checks .
Nevertheless , this order ultimately relies on the integrity of the people .
Speaking at general conference , a semiannual worldwide gathering of the Church , Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles asserted : “ In the end , it is only an internal moral compass in each individual that can effectively deal with the root causes as well as the symptoms of societal decay . ”
Likewise , Presiding Bishop H. David Burton * emphasized that the virtues of fidelity , charity , generosity , humility and responsibility “ form the foundation of a Christian life and are the outward manifestation of the inner man . ”
Thus , moral virtues blend into civic virtues .
The seriousness of our common challenges calls for an equally serious engagement with reasonable ideas and solutions .
What we need is rigorous debate , not rancorous altercations .
Civility is not only a matter of discourse .
It is primarily a mode of engagement .
The technological interconnectedness of society has made isolation impossible .
Of all the institutions in the modern world , religion has had perhaps the greatest difficulty adjusting to the reality of give and take with the public .
Today , and throughout its history , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints continuously encounters the legitimate interests of various stakeholders in its interaction with the public .
Rather than exempting itself from the rules of law and civility , the Church has sought the path of cooperative engagement and avoided the perils of acrimonious confrontation .
Echoing this mode of civil engagement , President Monson declared : “ As a church we reach out not only to our own people but also to those people of goodwill throughout the world in that spirit of brotherhood which comes from the Lord Jesus Christ . ”
Speaking of civility on a personal level , Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught Latter - day Saints how to respond to criticism : “ Some people mistakenly think responses such as silence , meekness , forgiveness , and bearing humble testimony are passive or weak .
But , to ‘ love [ our ] enemies , bless them that curse [ us ] , do good to them that hate [ us ] , and pray for them which despitefully use [ us ] , and persecute [ us ] ’ ( Matthew 5:44 ) takes faith , strength , and , most of all , Christian courage . ”
The moral basis of civility is the Golden Rule , taught by a broad range of cultures and individuals , perhaps most popularly by Jesus Christ : “ And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise ” ( Luke 6:31 ) .
This ethic of reciprocity reminds us all of our responsibility toward one another and reinforces the communal nature of human life .
Similarly , the Book of Mormon tells a sober story of civilizational decline in which various peoples repeat the cycle of prosperity , pride and fall .
In almost every case , the seeds of decay begin with the violation of the simple rules of civility .
Cooperation , humility and empathy gradually give way to contention , strife and malice .
The need for civility is perhaps most relevant in the realm of partisan politics .
As the Church operates in countries around the world , it embraces the richness of pluralism .
Thus , the political diversity of Latter - day Saints spans the ideological spectrum .
Individual members are free to choose their own political philosophy and affiliation .
Moreover , the Church itself is not aligned with any particular political ideology or movement .
It defies category .
Its moral values may be expressed in a number of parties and ideologies .
Furthermore , the Church views with concern the politics of fear and rhetorical extremism that render civil discussion impossible .
As the Church begins to rise in prominence and its members achieve a higher public profile , a diversity of voices and opinions naturally follows .
Some may even mistake these voices as being authoritative or representative of the Church .
However , individual members think and speak for themselves .
Only the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles speak for the whole Church .
Latter - day Saint ethical life requires members to treat their neighbors with respect , regardless of the situation .
Behavior in a religious setting should be consistent with behavior in a secular setting .
The Church hopes that our democratic system will facilitate kinder and more reasoned exchanges among fellow Americans than we are now seeing .
In his inaugural press conference President Monson emphasized the importance of cooperation in civic endeavors : “ We have a responsibility to be active in the communities where we live , all Latter - day Saints , and to work cooperatively with other churches and organizations .
My objective there is ... that we eliminate the weakness of one standing alone and substitute for it the strength of people working together . ”
* Bishop H. David Burton was released from his assignment as Presiding Bishop on 31 March 2012
Set in Pioneer Courthouse Square , Back to Back Theater ’s “ Small Metal Objects ” is a fairly minimalistic piece – two guys stroll the square talking about life and their relationship .
A third person comes along to interject a small amount of drama and the piece builds slightly , only to reach an anti-climax .
There are n’t many highs and lows to the piece ; it ’s all fairly mundane .
The fairly simple interaction is heightened as each actor is impeccably mic’d and the audience , equipped with high - end head phones , can hear every single word no matter where the actors are located in the square .
It ’s an odd experience watching a piece of theater where the actor ’s audio sounds so close .
In this piece this intimate audio experience is even more odd as it ’s so clearly intertwined with a very public space in which the actors perform .
In addition to the dialog , music is mixed over the headphones creating the real mood and the tension of the performance .
The real magic of Small Metal Objects is the slight of hand that Back to Back Theater does , duping the audience into thinking that they are the observers when in fact they are the show .
Sitting in a confined and clearly marked space above the square , wearing big silver headphones , it ’s the audience that are the “ small metal objects ” .
We are the ones really on display and the actors who walk the square are nearly invisible to people who pass through the square .
It ’s a fairly brilliant inversion and quite effectively challenges the very notion of what performance and theater are .
The downside of this is that the piece is pretty much a one trick pony .
Once you realize the trick there ’s little else to hang on to .
There are some nuggets narratively in Small Metal Objects and the two main characters are compelling , but it has the potential to be even better .
Back to Back could have delivered a one - two punch with a piece that both challenges the concept of performance and has stronger narrative elements .
It ’s an opportunity missed , but not enough to prevent me from recommending the show .
I applaud Back to Back Theater for so skillfully challenging the core concept of performance .
Technically the show was impeccable , but with a stronger narrative it could have been even better .

Should Judge Laurence Silberman have recused himself from a case involving alleged torture for which his buddies were ultimately responsible ?
By Jeremy Scahill On September 11 , the US appeals court for the District of Columbia announced in a 2 - 1 decision that it was throwing out a lawsuit against CACI International and L - 3 Communications Titan unit , which are being sued by Iraqi civilians for their alleged role in the torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison .
The companies provided interrogators at the prison at the height of the abuses there .
The suit alleges that employees of the companies conspired with U.S. Army reservist Charles Graner , who was convicted of prisoner abuse on January 14 , 2005 and is currently serving 10 years at Fort Leavenworth , and others to torture prisoners at Abu Ghraib .
Several of the plaintiffs are Iraqis whose torture was depicted in graphic photos revealed over the past several years .
The judge who wrote the majority opinion , Laurence H. Silberman , said : " During wartime , where a private service contractor is integrated into combatant activities over which the military retains command authority , a tort claim arising out of the contractor�s engagement in such activities shall be preempted . "
The decision was swiftly celebrated by the private security industry .
" The court�s decision today is an important step toward resolving all legal matters regarding the company�s mission and duties in Iraq , " Jody Brown , executive vice president for public relations at CACI , said in a statement .
" We have said from day one that these lawsuits are completely without merit and designed to pursue a political agenda . "
" This is big , and this is the kind of good news the contracting community needs , " wrote one security contractor on his blog .
" Precedents like this are what we need for further protection in the future for similar cases . "
Scott Horton , the great military and constitutional law expert wrote at Harper�s that Silberman�s opinion " reflects an amazing ignorance of or indifference to the basic concepts of the law of armed conflict : "
That law imposes a rule of absolute accountability on any persons fielded in a conflict , including contractors .
It does not permit impunity or immunity .
Not every aspect of the law of armed conflict is subject to private enforcement in the courts .
But the prohibition on torture and cruel , inhuman , and degrading conduct is .
The United States agreed in ratifying the Convention Against Torture that it would provide individuals who were tortured with legal recourse .
The Alien Tort Statute , which formed the basis for the suit , has historically been used in federal courts to give foreigners compensation for claims of torture .
But Judge Silberman decided to grant the contractors immunity from such suits .
In a dissenting opinion , Judge Merrick B. Garland wrote :
The plaintiffs in these cases allege that they were beaten , electrocuted , raped , subjected to attacks by dogs , and otherwise abused by private contractors working as interpreters and interrogators at Abu Ghraib prison .
At the current stage of the litigation , we must accept these allegations as true �
No act of Congress and no judicial precedent bars the plaintiffs from suing the private contractors � who were neither soldiers nor civilian government employees .
Indeed , the only statute to which the defendants point expressly excludes private contractors from the immunity it preserves for the government � the Department of Defense has repeatedly stated that employees of private contractors accompanying the Armed Forces in the field are not within the military�s chain of command , and that such contractors are subject to civil liability .
" Republican legal architects talk about a culture of accountability , but what they are introducing is actually a culture in which corporate surrogates torture , rape , and abuse with no consequences whatsoever , " writes Horton .
Beyond the legal issues here , which Horton deftly tackles , there is another issue : Judge Laurence Silberman himself .
Silberman was appointed to the bench by President Reagan in 1985 , but he had already made a name for himself in right wing political circles .
Several journalists have dug deep into Silberman�s alleged involvement with the arms - for - hostages deal , his exoneration of Iran - Contra figures Oliver North and John Poindexter and Silberman�s role in promoting the career of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas .
For a good summary of Silberman�s career see this excellent article by MIchele Goldberg on Salon.com .
Goldberg writes : [ Silberman ] has been near the febrile center of the largest political scandals of the past two decades , from the rumored " October surprise " of 1980 and the Iran - contra trials to the character assassination of Anita Hill and the impeachment of President Clinton .
Whenever right - wing conspiracies swing into action , Silberman is there .
A veteran of the Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan administrations who is close to Vice President Dick Cheney , Silberman has a reputation as a fierce ideologue who doesn�t let his judicial responsibilities get in the way of his Republican activism .
Judge Silberman also counts among his " close friends " former vice president Dick Cheney and former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld � going back to their time in the Ford Administration .
Rumsfeld was ultimately the official responsible for the abuses at Abu Ghraib at the time of the alleged torture of the plaintiffs in this case and Cheney was a major architect of the torture program .
One of Bush / Cheney�s key " torture lawyers , " John Yoo , clerked under Silberman .
Silberman also was chosen by President George W Bush to co-chair the Iraq Intelligence Commission .
The 600 + page report Silberman�s commission produced placed the blame for " intelligence failures " squarely on intelligence analysts and exonerated officials , like Cheney , who worked tirelessly to politicize intelligence to fit the White House�s political agenda and its drive to invade Iraq .
In June 2008 , Bush awarded Silberman the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
In 2004 , former Nixon staffer Kevin Phillips said , " In the past , Silberman has been more involved with coverups in the Middle East than with any attempts to unravel them . "
Should Silberman have recused himself from this case ?
In 1994 , the Supreme Court found that " Disqualification is required if an objective observer would entertain reasonable questions about the judge�s impartiality .
If a judge�s attitude or state of mind leads a detached observer to conclude that a fair and impartial hearing is unlikely , the judge must be disqualified . "
[ Liteky v. U.S. , 114 S.Ct. 1147 , 1162 ( 1994 ) ]
There are also these decisions : Courts have found that Section 455 ( a ) of the Judicial Code , 28 U.S.C. � 455 ( a ) " requires a judge to recuse himself in any proceeding in which her impartiality might reasonably be questioned . "
[ Taylor v. O�Grady , 888 F.2d 1189 ( 7th Cir. 1989 ) ] .
In Pfizer Inc. v. Lord , the Court stated that " It is important that the litigant not only actually receive justice , but that he believes that he has received justice . "
[ 456 F.2d 532 ( 8th Cir. 1972 ) ]
Do Silberman�s relationships to Cheney and Rumsfeld whose policies ultimately led to the torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib constitute " reasonable questions " about his " impartiality ? "
Enlarge By Doane Gregory , 20th Century Fox Man-eater : Megan Fox has cannibal tastes in Jennifer 's Body .
Jennifer 's Body , the horror thriller opening Friday with a script by Oscar winner Juno ) that blends R-rated frights with the stripper - turned - scribe 's smarty - pants sense of humor .
" Hell is a teenage girl . "
That opening line is brought to flesh - and - blood life in , the horror thriller opening Friday with a script by Oscar winner Diablo Cody ) that blends R-rated frights with the stripper - turned - scribe 's smarty - pants sense of humor .
With strong hints of 1976's Carrie ( the scary prom ) and 1988 's Heathers ( the snarky attitude ) , Jennifer attempts to update the modern - day conceit of a woman 's sexuality as a source of terror — memorably exemplified by the shower scene in 1960's Psycho — and drag it into the 21st century .
WRITER'S PICKS : Diablo Cody 's favorite female - centric creepers PHOTOS : Megan
Fox on screen and on the red carpet
The shapely body this time belongs to a possessed high school hellion ( Megan Fox of Transformers 1 and 2 ) , a queen bee with cannibalistic leanings who develops a taste for her male classmates in the worst way .
The only sin of her victims ?
Finding their attacker attractive .
" It 's like an animal needs to eat to survive , " Fox says .
" When a shark hunts for prey , it goes after the weakest fish . "
Perhaps most destructive is the toxic sway that gorgeous Jennifer holds over Needy ( Amanda Seyfried of Mamma Mia ! ) , her dorkish BFF since childhood who must summon the courage to put an end to her pal 's feeding frenzy .
" It represents adolescent females at their worst , " Seyfried says .
Jennifer 's
Body strives to be an original take on a trend in horror that continues with upcoming remakes of A Nightmare on Elm Street and Poltergeist , one that puts strong female characters front and center .
That 's because a generation of girls weaned on Twilight and True Blood ( and a few of their mothers , too ) who prefer vampy bloodsuckers to vapid pop stars can't wait to feast on what fresh hell might await at the multiplex each weekend .
The demographic fact that females have accounted for more than half the ticket sales for such past fright flicks as The Grudge and The Ring did n't escape the notice of Hollywood .
Which is why , for much of this decade , studios have been busy pumping out updates of such classic scares as Prom Night and Halloween .
That explains last Friday 's arrival of Sorority Row , which puts a fresh gloss on a slasher scenario from 1983 .
After accidentally causing the death of a friend , college women — including Demi Moore and Bruce Willis ' daughter Rumer — are stalked by a mystery slayer and slain one by one .
Lisa Dombrowski , an associate film professor at Wesleyan University , recalls how a producer of the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , whose success helped kick off the current raid on chillers from the ' 70s and ' 80s , told her class that tracking for the film initially showed a lack of interest among girls .
" They crafted a new set of trailers that highlighted clips of Jessica Biel fighting back against Leatherface , " she says .
" The tracking shot through the roof .
Part of the appeal of these films is the fantasy of female empowerment and taking action , even violent action .
They are stories of what they fear most and of overcoming that . "
Jennifer 's
Body also is in the tradition of films that turn a female body into a weapon and / or portray it as something monstrous , such as recent cult titles Ginger Snaps and Teeth or such oldies as The Exorcistand The Brood .
Says Aviva Briefel , an associate professor of English who teaches a class on horror movies at Bowdoin College , " It sounds like Jennifer 's Body is an attempt to celebrate a women's act of violence , a rape - revenge fantasy . "
Given that Jennifer 's condition was caused by guyliner - wearing emo rockers who tried to use her as a human sacrifice , the situation does make her somewhat sympathetic .
But a genre can't thrive on a diet of recycled goose bumps alone .
While Jennifer 's Body pays attention to the past , it also strives to break from it .
As Seyfried says , " It 's the kind of kick - ass film that guys usually make , " but created by women .
Cody took a knife to horror stereotypes , as well .
It bothers her when plot summaries assume , given Jennifer 's outfit in promotional photos , that she is all - too - predictably a cheerleader .
Instead , she 's the leader of a flag team at her downscale high school , which can't afford a squad of pom-pom shakers .
Besides , " Jennifer is not so much popular as untouchable , " Cody explains .
" Her being incredibly beautiful makes her bulletproof .
I did n't want it to be some clichéd story about a crazy cannibal cheerleader . "
" The tradition in horror films is that the victimizers tend to be males , " says director Karyn Kusama ( Girlfight ) .
" It 's usually a male vs. female experience .
This one is more complicated than that .
The alpha female can be as frightening as a crazed killer .
Everyone knows a girl from high school who could make you feel small .
The boys are irrelevant . "
Actually , they are totally out of the picture during the most erotic sequence , when Jennifer and Needy share a long , lingering kiss .
" People ask me if it is a shameless ploy to titillate boys , " Kusama says .
" What interests me is their assumption that it is only for boys .
The way the scene functions is to reveal another layer to these two girls .
It 's a secret component of their relationship , something that makes them very vulnerable .
Girls who have seen it understand it and say it 's one of the most frightening scenes . "
Or , as Cody puts it , " There 's something very tense about kissing a cannibal — she could eat her face . "
Seyfried says the film reflects the cruel realities of pubescent behavior .
" It symbolizes the relationship that a lot of girls have with each other at that age , " she says .
" They have n't figured things out yet , and there 's a lot of insecurity and competition .
It is kind of similar to what high school was like for me , except without all the chewing jaws and the zombie Satan worshiping . "

When Right - Wing Radio Talkmeister Said ' We Need Segregated Buses ' After Incident on an Illinois School Bus , He Not Only Told His ' Dittohead ' Listeners a Bald - Faced Lie About What Happened , He Also Crossed a Red Line By Openly Advocating the Direct Flouting of More Than 50 Years of Federal Laws and Court Rulings That Ban Racial Segregation
An open call to violate the law :
That 's what right - wing talk - radio host Rush Limbaugh did on Tuesday when he said " we need segregated buses " in response to an incident aboard a school bus in Bellville , Illinois in which two black teenagers attacked a white teenager .
The incident was at first thought to be racially motivated , but videotape recorded by an on - board security camera led local police to rule that out .
Not only did Limbaugh falsely accuse other black students aboard the bus of cheering the attackers on for racist reasons , but in saying " We need segregated buses , " Limbaugh also openly advocated the reimposition of race - based segregation -- which has been illegal under federal law and a host of court rulings for more than half a century .

==================================
A 'SKEETER BITES REPORT EDITORIAL
==================================
Rush Limbaugh has gone too far .
The right - wing radio talk - show host has been sounding increasingly belligerent in the past year toward liberals , Democrats , women and racial and ethnic minorities .
But last week , he crossed a legal " red line " he should not have crossed when he called for publicly - owned school buses to be racially segregated .
" We need segregated buses , " he said , commentating on an incident aboard a school bus in which a white teenager was attacked by two black teens .
Seizing upon the incident to fire yet another slam at President Obama , Limbaugh said , " I think not only it was racism , it was justifiable racism .
I mean , that 's the lesson that we 're being taught here today .
[ The ] kid should n't have been on the bus anyway .
We need segregated buses -- it was invading space and so forth .
This is Obama 's America . "
Limbaugh -- never once referring to the president by his official title , or even by his first name -- continued , " In Obama 's America , the white kids now get beat up with the black kids cheering , ' Yay , right on , right on , right on , right on ! ' "
But Limbaugh told his " Dittohead " listeners a bald - faced lie -- and the proof that he lied is on videotape .
ATTACK ON TEEN CAPTURED ON SECURITY VIDEO
In the incident , which was captured by an on - board security camera , two black high school students pummeled a white student while on their way to school last Monday morning in the St. Louis suburb of Belleville , Illinois .
The attack was initially labeled as racially motivated , but local police later backed away from that assessment .
According to a Fox News report fed to local Fox network affiliates , Belleville police said kids on the bus repeatedly told the 17 - year - old victim he could not sit beside them , so he finally pushed aside a backpack and sat anyway .
The network quoted Belleville Police Captain Don Sax as saying that the incident was " an extreme case of kids behaving poorly . "
After the white student sat down , " Pretty soon the kid who he sat next to is pushing him , trying to push him out of the seat and the next thing you know he starts punching him and choking him and punching him some more , " Sax said .
" It 's ridiculous . "
Four minutes after the first attack , the victim was pummeled again by a second student .
Neither the 17 - year - old victim nor his alleged attackers , aged 14 and 15 , were identified , but his assailants were expected to be charged in Juvenile Court with assault .
Sax told Fox News that because the victim was white and his attackers black , " It 's a strong suggestion that it was race - related . "
But after examining the videotape , police ruled out a racial motive for the assault .
VIDEO CLEARLY SHOWS OTHER WHITE KIDS CHEERING ON ATTACKERS
In his Tuesday broadcast , Limbaugh claimed that the black students aboard the bus chanted " ' Yay , right on , right on , right on , right on ! ' " while the white student was being pummeled .
But a close examination of the audio portion of the video -- which is available for viewing on YouTube and other Web sites , including Limbaugh 's -- shows that Limbaugh lied .
There was no " Right on ! " chant -- although it did pick up one student yelling " Kick his ass ! " just prior to the initial attack and shouts of " Get off the bus ! " during it .
More importantly , the video clearly shows other white kids cheering on the victim 's attackers , as the driver shouted frantically at the teenagers to return to their seats .
Other students seated at the front of the bus -- black and white alike -- can be seen reacting with shock at what was going on .
LIMBAUGH : 'THIS IS OBAMA'S AMERICA -- WHITE KIDS GETTING BEAT UP ON SCHOOL BUSES '
Limbaugh point - blank used the Belleville incident to engage in deliberate race - baiting .
According to a transcript of his Tuesday broadcast posted on his own Web site , the right - wing commentator said :
" Hey , look , folks , the white kid on that bus in Belleville , Illinois , he deserved to be beat up .
You do n't know about this story ?
Oh , there 's video of this .
The school bus filled with mostly black students beat up a white student a couple of times with all the black students cheering .
" Of course the white student on the bus deserved the beating , " Limbaugh continued .
" He was born a racist .
That 's what Newsweek magazine told us in its most recent cover .
Limbaugh 's rant continues : " It 's Obama 's America , is it not ?
Obama 's America , white kids getting beat up on school buses now .
You put your kids on a school bus , you expect safety but in Obama 's America the white kids now get beat up with the black kids cheering , " Yay , right on , right on , right on , right on , " and , of course , everybody says the white kid deserved it , he was born a racist , he 's white . "
When a caller reminded Limbaugh that Sax " did not comment on anything other than he said more investigations shows that [ the incident ] was not racially motivated , " the right - wing talkmeister replied , " I think the guy [ Sax ] is wrong .
I think not only was it racism , it 's justifiable racism . "
Then came Limbaugh 's stunner : " I mean , that 's the lesson that we 're being taught here today .
[ The ] kid should n't have been on the bus anyway .
We need segregated buses .
It was invading of space and so forth .
This is Obama 's America . "
DEAN COMPARES LIMBAUGH TO 1930S RADIO DEMAGOGUE FATHER COUGHLIN
Reaction to Limbaugh 's rant was swift and furious .
Appearing Thursday night on MSNBC's " Countdown with Keith Olbermann , " former Democratic national chairman Howard Dean compared Limbaugh to another notorious right - wing radio demagogue : Father Charles Coughlin , a Roman Catholic priest who in the 1930s used his radio program to issue blatantly anti-Semitic commentary and to rationalize the policies of Hitler and Mussolini .
" There 's a lot of money to be made in passing out hate of the kind that Rush Limbaugh is just doing , " Dean said .
" He 's always an entertainer , but he 's way over the line .
And this is a long -- there 's a long , unfortunate American tradition of this , going back to Father Coughlin and people before that .
They appeal to the very worst in people . "
On the same program , Mark Potok , a spokesman for the anti-racism Southern Poverty Law Center , said by arguing that school buses be segregated , as far as Limbaugh was concerned , " this is the only way , I suppose , that white people can be protected from black people .
" I think when we have characters like Limbaugh saying that on the air to millions of Americans -- many of whom actually revere the man -- it 's not surprising that people feel that ' the race wars around the corner ' and that we 're allowed to say these kinds of things , " Potok said .
LIMBAUGH CLAIMS HIS ' BUSES ' REMARK IS A 'JOKE ' -- BUT THAT'S A CROCK OF BULL ----!
Not surprisingly , Limbaugh fired back on Friday .
" This whole race tumult is being orchestrated and run out of the White House straight out of [ chief of staff ]
Rahm Emanuel and [ senior advisor David ] Axelrod 's office .
They are promoting it ; they are encouraging it .
Is n't it amazing ?
You have black kids who beat up a white kid on a school bus .
That 's not racism .
You have half the country criticizing a socialist health care plan , and that is racism . "
Limbaugh took dead aim at Potok : " So I 'm doing a total parodic rant .
I mean , the sarcasm is dripping -- and this bottom - feeder at the Southern Poverty Law Center , Mark Potok , is putting it out there that I made a call for segregated buses .
You know what this is like ? "
" Parody , " my ass .
Pardon me for using blunt language , but Limbaugh 's claim that his call for " segregated buses " was a sarcastic " parody " is a crock of pure , unadulterated bull ----.
He knew what he was doing when he said it .
I 've never bought Limbaugh 's namby - pamby excuse that he 's " just an entertainer . "
Bull ----!
He 's a demagogue .
He meant what he said .
RIGHT -WING TALKMEISTER CALLED FOR OPENLY FLOUTING HALF -CENTURY OF COURT RULINGS , LAWS
By calling for " segregated buses , " Limbaugh has used his radio platform to openly advocate the re-imposition of racial segregation in a public accommodation -- which has been illegal under a host of court rulings and a passel of federal and state laws for more than half a century .
Rosa Parks -- whose refusal to yield a front seat to a white man in 1955 led to the Montgomery bus boycott that kicked off the civil rights movement -- must be turning over in her grave .
Ditto Dr. Martin Luther King , Medgar Evers , Ralph David Abernathy , Roy Wilkins , Bayard Rustin and scores of others who devoted -- and in many cases , sacrificed -- their lives to bring an end to the evil of America 's apartheid based on race .
Limbaugh has the unmitigated gall to employ reverse psychology again and again and again to not only deflect longstanding complaints against him as a demagogue , but to accuse his critics of being demagogues themselves .
But this time , Limbaugh has gone too far .
He has called for the open flouting of the law .
The First Amendment bars the Federal Communications Commission from taking punitive action against Limbaugh for violating its rules that strongly condemn the use of the airwaves to promote illegal activity .
But that does not mean that Limbaugh cannot be held accountable .
ADVERTISER BOYCOTT AGAINST GLENN BECK SHOULD EXPAND TO INCLUDE LIMBAUGH
Not by the FCC , but by the advertisers who buy time on his show to air their spots -- a fact that Fox News host Glenn Beck has learned the hard way after his blatantly slanderous and defamatory attack on President Obama as a " racist who hates white people " without providing a scintilla of evidence to prove it .
Now he 's costing Fox News hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost advertising revenue -- despite a big spike in Beck 's ratings -- thanks to a advertiser boycott of his show .
Money talks and bull ---- walks .
It took an advertiser boycott to bring down Don Imus after he made a highly inflammatory remark about the Rutgers University women 's basketball team .
The multimillionaire Limbaugh can be hit where it really hurts -- in his massive bank account .
Limbaugh 's show is syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks , which is owned by Clear Channel Communications .
Premiere also syndicates Glenn Beck 's radio show , as well as that of Sean Hannity .
I see no reason why the advertiser boycott of Beck 's TV show should not spread to his radio show as well .
Nor do I see any reason why there should n't be an advertiser boycott of Limbaugh .
He 's a demagogue who 's called for the deliberate flouting of laws banning race segregation .
If I were an advertising executive , I 'd think twice before having my client 's product associated with race - baiting demagogues like Limbaugh and Beck .

The Federal Reserve is a quasi- private banking cartel that has a monopoly on the currency and credit of the United States .
The FED is often referred to as the “ fourth branch of the government . ”
FED Chairman and oligarch Ben Bernanke ultimately answers to no one in government on monetary policy .
Congress has completely reneged on their constitutional duty to the American people to maintain the integrity of our currency , the dollar .
The FED holds the “ money power ” of our nation , and this power belongs to We the People , not international bankers wearing Brooks Brothers suits .
The FED is also responsible for the price inflation we have seen our entire lives .
However , make no mistake – it is not really the loaf of bread or gallon of gas that is getting more expensive ; it is the plummeting purchasing power of the dollar because the FED has created so many new dollars .
As your Congressman , I will fight to , as is said , END THE FED !
and return the money power to the people , just as Thomas Jefferson and President Andrew Jackson 's “ hard money ” Democrats successfully did .
I will propose a bill to phase out the FED within one year , and transition from “ Federal Reserve Notes ” to “ United States Notes . ”
In the transition period , Congressional oversight will be implemented on all decisions .
Fractional reserve banking practices will be phased out and eventually banned .
I will work to gradually transition from the fiat United States Notes to gold and silver currency .
Legal tender laws will be removed , the U.S. Mint will offer free coinage of gold and silver coins , and all taxes will be removed on other currencies .
While the FED exists I will :
Fight for monthly audits so that Congress and the American people know what the FED is up to with our currency .
Fight to eliminate centralized control of interest rates and the money supply .
Fight to restore proper congressional oversight on the FED and empower Congress to veto the FED 's actions .
A future without the FED is worth striving for .
Imagine an America where the family no longer must send both parents to work while sending the children to daycare .
Imagine an America where money saved in the present - day worth the same or even more decades later , enabling individuals to pursue retirements or have more leisure time for personal pursuits .
Join me and imagine a future where government bureaucrats can no longer press the key and create more currency in a single second than you could earn in a lifetime .
Without a monopoly over money and credit , the government will once more be forced to serve
We the People as our servant , not be our harsh master .
I have written fairly extensively on the FED .

Drinkers could be banned from pubs or off - licences for up to two years New powers to impose Drinking Banning Orders - dubbed " booze Asbos " - on people who behave anti-socially while drunk have come under fire .
From Monday , police and councils in England and Wales can seek such an order on anyone aged 16 and over .
Offenders must stay away from pubs , bars , off - licences and named areas for up to two years or face a £ 2,500 fine .
However , the Magistrates Association said trying to ban people from all licensed premises was " nonsense " .
Its chairman John Thornhill said : " We are not satisfied that these will work as effectively as perhaps some of the Asbos have .
" If you try banning [ offenders ] from all the pubs in the town , who is going to tell all the pubs in the town ?
Many of the supermarkets now have a licence to sell alcohol .
It 's going to be nonsense really . "
He added that many offenders simply ignored Asbo conditions .
It will be jelly bean Asbos for sugared - up kids next .
Surely it 's time to call last orders on endless new legislation

Other critics branded the measure a " gimmick " that failed to tackle the issue , although it enjoyed support from some alcohol charities .
The government insists the orders will ensure that irresponsible drinkers face " very real consequences " .
Home Office minister Alan Campbell said crime and disorder linked to alcohol cost the UK billions of pounds every year .
" These orders will stop those people who are well known to the authorities , licensees and often the communities where they live , from ruining lives - and will make them face up to their destructive behaviour , " he added .
Metropolitan Police Commander Simon O'Brien , who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on alcohol licensing , said the orders " add to the toolbox of tactics " in tackling drunken and persistent offenders .
But shadow home affairs minister James Brokenshire said they would not be enforced .
He claimed powers to act against outlets repeatedly caught selling alcohol to children had been used only once in three years .
' Tough enforcement ' Isabella Sankey , policy director , for civil liberties group Liberty said : " How many times can you spin a new ' crackdown ' without tackling the causes of offending behaviour ?
" It will be jelly bean Asbos for sugared - up kids next .
Surely it 's time to call last orders on endless new legislation . "
Jeremy Beadles , the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association which represents companies in the industry , said " tough enforcement " of the powers was critical .
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians , said the government needed to end the availability of cheap alcohol to limit the health and criminal effects of alcohol .
Some offenders may be referred to a course to address their drinking , and if successfully completed , could see the length of the order reduced .
The participant , not the government , is expected to cover the costs of the Positive Behaviour Intervention Courses , from £ 120 to £ 250 .
In Scotland , Asbos can be used to prohibit people from drinking in the streets - the first such orders were imposed on four people in Dumfries in 2006 .

The thesis is simple – cars are the enemy of strong cities .
Despite a tremendous amount of writing on this topic , people ’s opinions on the matter have rarely changed – they either agree with this idea or they do n’t .
There is n’t a lot of middle ground .
But as we come to understand networks more intuitively , the principle that the conveyance is n’t the key but how its used will be much more obvious .
The intuitive understanding can come from how networks , generally , work to make life more fun and more efficient .
The problem with cars in a city starts with the amount of space that it takes up in parking and roadways that can handle the 5 PM rush .
Saint Paul , my city , has many tall buildings of 20 stories or more that form a panorama that is supposed to show our sophistication .
Yet if you took the net area of our urban core and threw it into a blender , pouring it back out as one even layer , you ’d see that the average building is a very Parisian 5 - 6 stories .
The reason for this is that surface parking lots that handle the cars surround the Civic Center ( where the NHL ’s Minnesota Wild play ) and the fringes of the core in oceans of asphalt .
Baron Haussmann had it right all along .
This space naturally separates the core from the rest of the city , which is the real problem .
For many years the Chamber of Commerce insisted that access to the core was essential , emphasizing the ways that people would get to the city over where they would come from or go to .
The result is isolation .
More interestingly , the problem is being repeated by a plan for a massive LRT that will snake through large sections of the core – never quite arriving at the logical destination , the train station .
The thinking is exactly the same as the car , but the expected result is different .
Why will the result be the same ?
Because what all of these plans lack is a sense of place , the idea that any given point is not just a stop on a line but a connection between things .
A city is a network of connections , whether they are intersections or places where the transit lines cross .
Times Square is n’t just Broadway , it ’s 7th and Broadway , 42nd to 44th .
The same mistake is made when people evaluate a new technology such as Twitter , to name a fave flave of the moment .
Many words have been written about the potential of this bit of technology , and terms like “ social media ” and “ microblogging ” have been thrown around as meaningful in and of themselves .
But as any person who has used the service knows , it ’s only as good as the connections it makes for you .
I ’ve met some wonderful people that have made my Twitter experience worthwhile and waded through gobs of spam trying to stay connected .
The same can be said of Facebook , which has put me in touch with friends from High School after I sift through the zillions of “ gifts ” .
What is any of this stuff worth ?
Cities and technologies , as networks , work to the extent that they have a strong sense of place .
The streetscapes or the user experience define the journey to a place , which should be easy and fun .
The way people get there , which is to say the car or the web app , does n’t really define any sense of place .
The people who you meet up with are what define things , not the machines .
This may be a huge “ Duh ! ” to most people , but if you get too tied up in the machine you run the risk of ignoring what makes it all possible .
It ’s the storyline , either memories or a chat with a friend , that moves people to the centers where a strong sense of place makes new connections .
It ’s entirely possible for the technology to get in the way of a smooth and believable story .
The internet has its own sea of asphalt that separates it from many people ’s lives in ways that make the promise of all these new connections less real or accessible .
Jargon , spam , and a fair amount of condescension from the “ cool kids ” are what substitute for the seas of surface parking in this world .
Like a skyline , many people refer to it all from a distance as if it ’s a massive sculpture rather than a real human ecology .
Why not instead imagine a gentle , constant streetscape with human scaled buildings that define each step of the journey without blotting out the sun ?
Why not imagine a trip to a place that is made up of legends , some of which are n’t yet written ?
If you forget about the lust for this machine or that , and allow people to get there on their own terms , they get to define the sense of place themselves .
Networks are made up of nodes where connections form , often understood as patterns .
They require a strong sense of place , no matter what kind of network you ’re talking about .
The technology is only useful to the extent it makes that happen – and no further .
In fact , though , regulators and lawmakers have spent most of the last year trying to save the financial industry , rather than transform it .
In the short run , their efforts have succeeded .
Citigroup and other wounded banks have avoided bankruptcy , and the economy has sidestepped a depression .
But the same investors and economists who predicted , and in some cases profited from , the collapse last fall say the rescue has come at an extraordinary cost .
They warn that if the industry ’s systemic risks are not addressed , they could cause an even bigger crisis  in years , not decades .
Next time , they say , the credit of the United States government may be at risk .
Simon Johnson , a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund , said that the seeds of another collapse had already sprouted .
If major banks are allowed to keep making bets that are ultimately backed by taxpayer guarantees , they will return to the practices that led them to underwrite trillions of dollars in bad loans , Professor Johnson said .
“ They will run up big risks , they will fail again , they will hit us for a big check , ” he predicted .
The doomsday view is far from universal .
Wall Street executives say the Lehman bankruptcy opened their eyes to the fragility of their institutions .
They note that they have pulled back on risk and reduced leverage , creating a bigger cushion against losses .
And they say that regulators were right to support the financial industry over the last year , rather than imposing new rules or allowing weak banks to collapse .
“ There is less leverage in the entire financial system , ” said David A. Viniar , Goldman ’s chief financial officer .
At Goldman , $ 1 in capital now supports about $ 14 in loans and investments , compared with $ 24 a year ago .
Other countries or territories have copied the model  Liechtenstein , Bermuda , the Cayman Islands , Macao and Hong Kong among them .
And while Switzerland is probably seen as the most conservative , blue chip , upstanding offshore haven , the others are measured by a sliding scale of probity and association with dubious business practices , if not crime .
The European banker said that in the early 1990s , following the fall of the Soviet Union , he worked in Switzerland where he said agents of Russian expats would show up with “ boxes of cash ” from Cyprus , a popular haven for capital fleeing the Russian authorities and the country ’s post - collapse chaos .
The backlash against this illicit world has not been confined to the United States ; it is apparent across Europe , too .
France will become of one of the first European countries to put in place a new tax treaty with Switzerland to improve transparency and access to banking information .
Germany is in discussions with Liechtenstein over issues related to tax evasion by German companies and individuals .
Liechtenstein has also struck a disclosure agreement with Britain , encouraging British clients of Liechtenstein banks to volunteer information to British tax authorities in return for reduced penalties .
In Italy , tax officials have started an investigation into whether the estate of the late Gianni Agnelli , the former chairman of Fiat , has money hidden away in Switzerland .
In Britain , the government has become particularly exercised by tax competition  the offering of low tax rates and other advantages like tax secrecy to lure capital away .
In the Swiss settlement last week , the American authorities got the information they needed after they saw an opportunity in the weakness of UBS , a bank that once enjoyed a sterling global reputation but has suffered billions of dollars in losses linked to United States subprime securities and had to be saved by a big government bailout last October .
For the Swiss government , the deal lifts the immediate threat of heftier legal action and frees the bank  one of the mainstays of the Swiss economy  to concentrate on recovery .
But will anything really change ?
Although the United States is supposed to learn the identities of a few thousand tax evaders , those names will go first to an intermediate tax administration in Switzerland for review .
The actual process of recovering the names may become lost in bureaucracy and foot - dragging .
Moreover , as The Times reported last week , smaller Swiss banks say they are confident that they can continue to profit by finding new , more elaborate ways to protect the privacy of their clients .
Those banks continue to help clients hide billions of dollars through complex structures in offshore havens .
There are some pro-gay billboards in Texas that are causing quite a stir … because they quote the Bible just as their opponents do :
It ’s all part of a campaign called Would Jesus Discriminate .
Say what you will about the accuracy of the citations .
It ’s doing a great job of getting soundbytes from religious people :
The billboard angered [ Christine ]
Lutz so much , that she fired off a stern e-mail .
“ I said how dare you take the scriptures and twist it to fit your needs , ” she recalled .
My irony meter just exploded .
Pastor Sam Dennis , of Parkway Hills Baptist Church in Plano , says Christians should n’t hate gays .
He disagrees however with the billboards ’ use of scripture to back a pro-gay message .
“ I ’m hard pressed to find that scripture advocates that it ’s alright to live in a gay lifestyle .
Just like I ’m hard pressed to find that scripture advocates that ’s it ’s alright to live in an adulterous relationship or as a wife abuser or as a murderer . ”
That ’s ridiculous .
I ’m sure commenters can find plenty of examples of the Bible condoning awful things .
I suggest starting at Skeptics Annotated Bible .
It ’s nice to see Christians using their faith to defend homosexuality for once .
These are the discussions they ought to be having in their churches — it ’s relevant and it ’s divisive .
By just excluding gay people , churches are putting themselves in jeopardy by alienating younger Christians — not that there ’s anything wrong with that .
But if change can happen within the church , it has to start from within .
This is a novel , interesting way to get people thinking .
" That left us in a terrible spot .
We 'd thought we were contributing to the community and the legacy of this game by reviving it , not stealing from them by charging for it — and we did n't think $ 2.99 was unreasonable ( and , again , the source is available for free from our page ) .
It never occurred to us that one of the original creators would feel that we were betraying their contribution .
We 've discussed the philosophical fine points of free - as - in - speech vs. free - as - in - beer with him , and have suggested a number of remedies — such as reducing the price ( it 's now $ 1.99 ) , profit - sharing with previous contributors , making the game free at some point in the future ( once we 'd at least recouped our costs ) , or going ' freemium ' ( offering a fully - functional free version plus a paid version with enhancements we added ourselves , with both GPLed of course ) .
But in each case , the bottom line is that this developer feels the app should be free - as - in - beer period , and anything less is a sleazy betrayal of anybody that made contributions under that license .
Which is a shame , because we deeply respect his work on this game and would love for him to be on board with the port — but at the same time this was months worth of work and we honestly believe we 're going about this in a reasonable way .
Obviously , one of us has a non-mainstream understanding of open source ethos , but it 's become clear we can't come to a consensus on which of us it is , and whether the ' spirit of the GPL ' should allow selling GPLed software ( especially when one was n't the original creator of the software , but a more recent contributor ) .
The only way to determine that , it seems , is to poll the open source community itself .
We 're determined to do the right thing by the GPL and the community , and we 'd like to hear opinions on this .
Remember , we 're not talking about whether it 's practical to base a business on GPLed software , nor the best business model for doing so , and certainly not whether the source must be distributed for free ( obviously it must be ) , but just whether charging for the binary version of an enhanced / ported version of a GPLed app ( while releasing the corresponding source for free ) is an ethically defensible thing to do .

A few days ago we found a nice blog post on the usability approach taken by the KDE community for the KDE 4 series .
We have contacted the author to see if he was interested in doing a guest article for the dot expanding on his blog post .
So without further ado , I present a writing by Daniel Memenode , web publisher and designer .
KDE always stood out as a desktop environment that does n't shy away from giving you lots of options and features .
It is no wonder that one of its flagship products , Konqueror , was often compared to a swiss army knife .
It could be used as a file manager for both local and remote files , an image viewer and a fairly powerful web browser shifting from one role to the other as needed .
This however came with one downside in that it increased the perceived complexity of the desktop environment and increased the learning curve of a new user .
KDE 4 was expected , among other things , to come with innovations which would possibly resolve this issue and I think it has already made some significant strides in that direction .
On face value KDE 4 did n't fundamentally change the typical layout of the desktop .
There is still a main panel at the bottom with a K - Menu on one side of it , system tray on the other and task manager in between .
The biggest visible change in defaults is that desktop icons now reside in a folder view widget and that the K - Menu is completely different .
However behind the scenes everything changed and the nature of these basic desktop elements changed as well .
They all became configurable plasma widgets thus actually providing the user even more flexibility than before .
This could mean that KDE 4 could be even more complex and come with an even greater learning curve than KDE 3 , but that does n't seem to have happened .
Instead , in the experience of many including myself as someone who typically used GNOME exactly for its simplicity , KDE actually became at least a little simpler and more streamlined , and I think it is further evolving in that respect .
KDE 4 demonstrates the effort by the KDE community to make peace between these two seemingly mutually exclusive characters : power and flexibility ( lots of options to choose from ) versus simplicity and ease of use .
The idea is to offer the user lots of choice and power over the way the desktop behaves without this feeling like a burden .
It is to bring up the extra options when the user is actually looking for them and when they actually make sense - offering them in a way that does n't add to the perceived complexity and does n't ruin the usability of the default experience .
The context menu when dropping a text file on the desktop
The context menu when dropping a text file on the desktop
One nice example of the way KDE did this even in KDE 3 is the contextual menu that appears when you drag and drop files or folders .
It asks you if you want to move , copy , make a link or cancel the whole operation .
In KDE 4.3 there are additional options added to this menu that depend on what kind of file you 're dragging .
For instance , if it 's a picture and you 're dragging it to the desktop , it lets you choose to make it into a desktop wallpaper .
If it 's a text file it offers the choice of making a sticky note widget from it .
If you 're dragging a folder it allows you to make an entire folder into a folder view widget .
This last example is especially interesting because this is where a whole new feature , one that new users may be unfamiliar with , is revealed to the user when it actually makes sense and may be quite useful .
You 're moving a folder and get the option to create a " folder view " .
Choose it and voila , folder view begins to make sense and you 're that much closer to knowing what exactly a " folder view " option in a desktop settings dialog ( available from a desktop right - click menu ) does refer to .
In fact , it may even become clear to the more tech savvy and experienced among us that this is what all desktops with icons including Windows , Mac OS and GNOME actually are ; nothing but views of content of specific folders ( like / home / user / Desktop ) .
Another example is a dialog for configuring toolbars in many KDE4 applications ( Dolphin , Kate , Konqueror , Dragon Player etc. ) which uses a relatively simple and logical interface that in one place allows the user to add from a pretty big list of possible toolbar buttons and position them wherever wanted by either dragging and dropping or using the arrows .
It offers two methods for doing the same thing without one disrupting the other .
All that 's missing is the ability to drag and drop the buttons directly to the toolbar which on one hand would seem redundant , but on the other would provide the user a third choice without disrupting the existing two .
Editing toolbars like it works in any KDE application Editing toolbars like it works in any KDE application
This demonstrates that choice of ways of doing things does n't have to come at the expense of usability .
If an additional method can be added without making the other available methods any less effective and easy to use then there is no good reason not to , from the user experience perspective .
This also stands true in the example of " + " and " - " emblems on files and folders in KDE4 which allow selecting and deselecting them without holding ctrl or drawing a selection rectangle .
This too actually adds another way of selecting files and folders without disrupting an existing one , thus serving people of both preferences at the same time .
Furthermore , this particular feature actually aids usability , especially if the desktop is configured to use a convenient single - click launch for files and folders where single click to select would also launch the file or folder . " + " and " - " emblems get around that problem .
Select emblem on hover Select emblem on hover
There are other examples that illustrate the principle of offering flexibility without impairing ease of use .
But perhaps most important ones involve the reinvention of primary desktop workspace elements as plasma widgets .
This almost turns KDE4 users into designers of their own perfect desktop , should they want to be that .
Everything is exchangeable and mobile .
You do n't need to have a typical bottom or top panel .
You can mix and mash desktop elements in any way you like them .
You can even have multiple arrangements at the same time by taking advantage of desktop activities .
Is this extra amount of choice really impairing the usability of those who may want to simply stick to the familiar defaults ?
No , because by making all workspace elements into a widget they have all been put on the same fundamental level where each can be manipulated in the same basic ways .
It 's not like you have to go into some sort of an editor or a configuration dialog with a slew of options presented via textual descriptions you do n't necessarily understand in order to completely transform your desktop ( which actually reminds me of Compiz settings manager and even worse , gconf ) .
Instead you literally take the elements by their handles and move them around .
You manipulate them almost in the same manner you would arrange items on your real life desktop .
And if you need finer tweaks you can open the relevant settings dialog right from what you 're editing .
This is why I am beginning to appreciate the persistence of the KDE project at giving users great power and flexibility .
I no longer believe that having lots of choice necessarily means a harder to use desktop .
I think KDE 4 is well on its way to proving that point .
In a sense it seems to show that good usability is n't necessarily about creating an interface that is " perfect " and " usable " for everyone with a single set of options and a single " mindset " , but rather about providing a desktop that can do nearly everything anyone wants it to do , but do it only IF the user actually chooses so without impairing the experience of those who do n't make that choice .
In other words , the desktop morphs to the subjective preferences and personality of its user rather than trying to assume what most users want .
If usability is to some extent in the eyes of the beholder , as I think it is , then such a desktop adapts to that reality and becomes a perfectly usable desktop not by the definition of a particular group of experts , but by the definition of the user standing in front of it .
If that 's the vision behind KDE 4 , as it seems to be , then I think the potential is limitless .
Of course , literal achievement of such a potential may be an unreachable ideal , at least with current technologies , but KDE 4 is making significant steps forward in that direction .
Just proving that choice is not necessarily an usability problem is a big accomplishment in itself .

While I was reorganizing my freezer the other day so my wife could easily pull out the frozen dumplings without having to touch alligator legs , goose feet , or any number of other " experiments " going on in there at the moment , I came across a stash of rendered animal fats — beef , duck , and lamb , to be precise .
I 'm the kind of cook who does n't like throwing anything away , and sure , duck , beef , and lamb fats have their uses ( think confit , burgers , or fried potatoes ) .
But seriously — even I can't think of a way to consume a pint of each , and my freezer was getting awfully full .
Just as I was about to pack it in and tip them into the trash , I had one of those moments where jumbled images come swimming into your brain and suddenly crystallize into something so perfectly obvious that you start to say to yourself , " why did n't I think of that ? " before happily realizing that you just did .
Afraid that the image might soon disappear , I grabbed a pad and paper like Ethan Hawke in Explorers and quickly sketched it out .
Here 's what was in my head :
I thought to myself : " If I can make mayonnaise out of egg yolks and oil , why can't I make mayonnaise out of egg yolks and rendered animal fat ? "
Turns out , it 's not so simple .
Mayo Basics
In its loosest definition , mayonnaise is a flavored emulsion of minute particles of fat suspended in water .
The tiny globules of suspended fat have a very difficult time flowing around once they are separated by the thin film of water , which is what gives mayonnaise its viscosity .
Similarly , small bits of fat will refract light to a much greater degree as it passes through , giving mayonnaise its opaque , white appearance .
( Think of it like a block of glass .
When it 's whole , light passes through easily .
But break it up into tiny bits , and it becomes opaque . )
Now normally , when you mix fat molecules with water , no matter how thoroughly you combine them , like MIT nerds visiting an all - girls college mixer , they eventually separate themselves and regroup .
Because of their shape and electrical charges , fat molecules are mutually attracted to each other , while simultaneously being repelled by water .
This is where egg yolks come in .
Egg yolks — which are complex fat and water emulsions in themselves — contain plenty of emulsifiers , the most important of which is lecithin , a phospholipid found in both the low - density lipoproteins ( LDLs ) , and high - density lipoproteins ( HDLs ) abundant in eggs .
Emulsifiers are long molecules that have a hydrophilic ( water - loving , fat - hating ) head , and a hydrophobic ( water - hating , fat - loving ) tail .
When egg yolks , water , and oil are whisked together , the fat - loving heads of the lecithin molecules bury themselves in the minute droplets of fat , exposing only their tails .
These tails repulse each other , preventing the fat droplets from coalescing , and suddenly making the water seem much more attractive to them .
A bit like adding a shot of booze to that nerd fest to mix things up a little .
To make a traditional mayonnaise , egg yolks , water , salt , and a few flavorings — usually Dijon mustard and lemon juice or vinegar — are whisked together vigorously while simultaneously slowly drizzling oil into the mixture ( a food processor makes this process nearly foolproof ) .
As the oil hits the bowl , the rapid action of the whisk quickly breaks it up into tiny droplets , which are kept suspended with the help of the emulsifiers in the egg yolk .
As the sauce gets thicker and thicker , its viscosity makes it easier to break the oil into minute droplets , and as a result , oil can be added more rapidly .
The final result is the rich , creamy , mild - flavored condiment we all know so well .
Fiddling with Fats
So back to the question at hand : making mayonnaise out of animal fat .
For my first attempt , I simply melted some beef fat in the microwave ( because of it's high saturated fat content , beef fat is a waxy solid at room temperature ) , keeping the temperature as low as possible , so as not to cook the egg yolk .
I made a mayonnaise exactly as I would have done with vegetable oil .
Almost immediately , the mayonnaise broke ( the fat and water separated ) , its smooth , glossy sheen transforming into the dull matte texture of shortening right before my eyes .
OK , not a big deal , I thought .
Just because I have n't broken a mayonnaise in years , does n't mean it can't happen , right ?
I tried again , the exact same way , and once again , my emulsion broke .
I do n't take failed experiments lightly , and this time I was angry enough that my wife had to ask me to stop yelling at the suet .
Still mumbling , " damn you , beef fat , " under my breath , I hit the books looking for an answer as to why my emulsion was n't holding .
McGee ?
Nothing .
Corriher ?
Nothing .
Wolke ?
Nothing .
Not a single mention of animal fat emulsions in any of my go - to references .
I knew that the main difference between animal fats and vegetable fats is that animal fats contain a much higher proportion of saturated fatty acids .
Fatty acids are essentially a long chain of carbon molecules .
In saturated fats , each of these carbon molecules has two hydrogen molecules bonded to it .
These hydrogen molecules act kind of like a support system , keeping the fatty acids long and straight .
On the other hand , unsaturated fats ( a fatty acid that contains one or more carbon molecule missing a one of its two hydrogen partners ) , have a bent , kinked shape .
Oddly enough , with fatty acids , threesomes are actually less kinky than pairs .
The chart at the right indicates percentage of saturated fatty acids to overall fatty acids in common fats , with butter being the most highly saturated at 62 % , and olive oil with a mere 13 % .

The shape of saturated fat molecules must have something to do with my mayo's problems — after all , asides from minute amounts of flavorful molecules , saturation level is essentially the only difference between vegetable fats and animal fats — but what exactly was going on ?
I emailed my friend Guy Crosby , an associate professor at Harvard and Framingham Universities and science editor at Cook 's Illustrated for some answers .
My hunch was right : shape is everything .
Here 's what he had to say .
Saturated fats ( triglycerides ) contain very linear fatty acids that can pack together and form crystals , sort of like a bunch of pencils in a box .
Unsaturated fatty acids are bent like a V - shape , so they pack very poorly and do not tend to crystallize until much lower temperatures .
The tendency of saturated fats to crystallize means they will be much less likely to form microscopic droplets that can be stabilized by emulsifiers such as lecithin in eggs .
Instead there will be a greater tendency for the saturated fats to separate from the unsaturated oil and water to form more stable crystalline structures .
In other words , the saturated fat molecules have a greater affinity for each other than they do for the emulsifier or the oil .
With this in mind , finding the solution was simple .
All I had to do was increase the ratio of unsaturated fat to saturated fat .
In a more dilute solution , the saturated fat molecules are less likely to come in contact with one another , and therefore less likely to form the crystalline structures that were interfering with my emulsion .

The higher the level of saturated fat in a given rendered animal fat , the more I had to dilute it with vegetable oil .
Serendipitously , this turned out to be a good thing for flavor — highly saturated beef is powerful enough that even when diluted five to one with vegetable oil , the spread positively screams beef .
I quickly whipped out three break - free animal - fat mayos , or meatonnaise , as I 'll now refer to it .
So , you may be asking , how does it all taste in the end ?
Duck Fat
The duck fat meato , was fabulous .
Light and creamy , with just a hint of duck flavor — not so much that it overwhelms the palate , but enough that it makes you sit up and realize : this ain't no Hellman's .
Like a regular mayonnaise , the duck fat meatonnaise is great for taking on and delivering other flavors .
For instance , a bit of Thai curry paste sitting in my fridge transformed it into a lickably good fragrant , spicy spread .
I 'd imagine some canned chipotles or Korean chile - bean paste would work equally good wonders .

Beef Fat
Beef fat meato was bordering on the obscene — lightening it up with a significant amount of water and lemon juice , and adding a bit of garlic to cut into the overwhelming beef flavor , was the key to making it palatable .
This one will be reserved for special , indulgent occasions , and perhaps a bit more testing in the future — there must be some application somewhere in the realm of burger sauces .

Lamb Fat
As for the lamb , no matter how much I diluted the fat , the flavor is simply too powerful and the texture is just too heavy .
If anyone wants to play with it at home and can think of a suitable application , I 'd be interested to hear it .
The only use I can think of is in protecting your taste buds from the ravages of the merciless peppers of Quetzalacatenango .
It was only after I 'd wrapped up my testing and started writing up my results that I realized that I missed the most obviously delicious variant : Baconnaise
Bacon Fat
I truly believe that once this stuff gets out and everyone starts making it , it 'll be the new " it " condiment .
What could be better for dipping your fries or spreading on your burger ?
I 've only started to skim the surface of the applications of this rich , smoky spread , but if my simple open - faced sandwich of toast , tomatoes , and bacaonnaise is any indication , I 've got a long , tasty road ahead of me .

James Martin has presented Saturday Kitchen since 2006 Chef James Martin has apologised for " any offence caused " by a newspaper article he wrote about forcing cyclists off the road as he test drove a car .
Martin , host of BBC One 's Saturday Kitchen , said in the Mail on Sunday he had intentionally forced the group into a hedge causing them " sheer terror " .
It was the best thing he had " ever seen in my rear - view mirror " , he said .
The article provoked an angry reaction from cycling groups .
He apologised in a statement for his " misjudged " piece .
Knowing they would n't hear me coming , I stepped on the gas , waited until the split - second before I overtook them , then gave them an almighty blast on the horn at the exact same time I passed them at speed
James Martin Martin , 37 , spoke of his " hate " for cyclists in the column in the newspaper 's Live magazine .
" That 's one of the reasons I live in the countryside , where birds tweet , horses roam , pigs grunt and Lycra - clad buttocks are miles away , " he wrote .
He said he had spotted the group dressed in " fluorescent Spider - Man outfits , shades , bum bags and stupid cleated shoes " .
" Twenty minutes into my test drive I pulled round a leafy bend , enjoying the bird song - and spotted those damned Spider - Man cyclists .
" Knowing they would n't hear me coming , I stepped on the gas , waited until the split - second before I overtook them , then gave them an almighty blast on the horn at the exact same time I passed them at speed . "
He added : " The look of sheer terror as they tottered into the hedge was the best thing I 've ever seen in my rear - view mirror . "
' Legal team ' Campaign group the Cyclists ' Touring Club ( CTC ) said it had been inundated with complaints from angry members .
It was never my intention to offend the many cyclists who share our roads across the country
James Martin Campaigns and policy manager Roger Geffen said : " James Martin 's comments and actions are both offensive and dangerous to cyclists .
" We urge the group of cyclists who James Martin attempted to run off the road to get in touch with CTC 's accident helpline - our legal team would be only too happy to take the matter further . "
Martin said in his statement on Tuesday : " It was never my intention to offend the many cyclists who share our roads across the country .
" What was intended to be a humorous piece was clearly misjudged . "
He said he did not condone " any form of reckless driving " .
" Once again , I am sincerely sorry for any upset caused in relation to this article , " he added .

This is a brain scan showing electrodes that surgeons use to find and remove the source of seizures ( to cure epilepsy ) while sparing the source of mental functions like language .
Credit : Illustration : Ned T. Sahin , Ph.D.. Brain Image Reconstruction : Sean McInerney .
A study by researchers at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine reports a significant breakthrough in explaining gaps in scientists ' understanding of human brain function .
The study - which provides a picture of language processing in the brain with unprecedented clarity - will be published in the October 16 issue of the journal Science .
" Two central mysteries of human brain function are addressed in this study : one , the way in which higher cognitive processes such as language are implemented in the brain and , two , the nature of what is perhaps the best - known region of the cerebral cortex , called Broca 's area , " said first author Ned T. Sahin , PhD , post - doctoral fellow in the UCSD Department of Radiology and Harvard University Department of Psychology .
The study demonstrates that a small piece of the brain can compute three different things at different times - within a quarter of a second - and shows that Broca 's area does n't just do one thing when processing language .
The discoveries came through the researchers ' use of a rare procedure in which electrodes were placed in the brains of patients .
The technique allowed surgeons to know which small region of the brain to remove to alleviate their seizures , while sparing the healthy regions necessary for language .
Recordings for research purposes were then made while the patients were awake and responsive .
The procedure , called Intra-Cranial Electrophysiology ( ICE ) , allowed the researchers to resolve brain activity related to language with spatial accuracy down to the millimeter and temporal accuracy down to the millisecond .
This is the first experiment to use ICE to document how the human brain computes grammar and produces words .
Direct recordings from sets of brain cells revealed that three fundamentally distinct aspects of language ( meaning , structure , and word sounds ) are computed in a small part of the brain and in a tightly - timed sequence .
Illustrations : Ned T. Sahin , PhD
Because complex language is unique to humans , it has been difficult to investigate its neural mechanisms .
Brain - imaging methods such as functional MRI are generally all that are possible to use in humans , but they blur the activity of thousands or millions of neurons over long periods of time .
Consequently , scientists have been unable to determine in detail whether the mechanisms used by linguistic or computational models to produce grammatically correct speech correspond to the mechanisms that the brain actually uses .
For this study , the researchers recorded activity inside patients ' brains while they repeated words verbatim or produced them in grammatical forms such as past tense or plural - a task that humans effortlessly compute every time they utter a sentence .
ICE enabled the authors to look at three components of language processing in real time , to determine whether related neuronal activities were implemented serially or in parallel , in local or distributed patterns .
" We showed that distinct linguistic processes are computed within small regions of Broca 's area , separated in time and partially overlapping in space , " said Sahin .
Specifically , the researchers found patterns of neuronal activity indicating lexical , grammatical and articulatory computations at roughly 200 , 320 and 450 milliseconds after the target word was presented .
These patterns were identical across nouns and verbs and consistent across patients .
" The first evidence that parts of the brain may correspond to parts of the the mind was the discovery that patients with damage to Broca 's area were unable to talk but could still think .
In the 150 years since this discovery , progress in understanding what precisely Broca 's area contributes to language has been disappointing , " said principal investigator Eric Halgren , PhD , professor in the UCSD Department of Radiology .
" These results suggest that Broca 's area actually consists of several overlapping parts , performing distinct computational steps in a tightly timed choreography , a dance that may simply have been undetectable due to the level of resolution of previous methods . "
According to Sahin , the results help dispel a commonly taught notion that Broca 's area handles expressive language ( speaking ) while another part of the cortex called Wernicke 's area handles receptive language ( reading and hearing ) .
This notion is still taught in many text books .
" Our task involved both reading and speaking , and we found that aspects of word identity , grammar and pronunciation are all computed within Broca 's area .
Crucially , information about the identity of a printed word arrives in Broca 's area very quickly after it is seen , in parallel with its arrival in Wernicke's .
It has been clear for some time that the expressive / receptive model is out of date , and now it is clearer that Broca 's area has several roles , in both expressive and receptive language , " said Sahin .

Alexa Conradi devient présidente de la Fédération des femmes du Québec .
Elle succède à Michèle Asselin qui occupait ce poste depuis six ans .
Lors de l'assemblée générale annuelle de la Fédération des femmes du Québec ( FFQ ) tenue samedi à Montréal , Alexa Conradi a été élue dès le premier tour de scrutin à la présidence de l'organisme .
Elle succède à Michèle Asselin qui occupait ce poste depuis six ans .
Tel que le stipulent les statuts et règlements de la FFQ , elle devait quitter son poste après un troisième mandat consécutif de deux ans .
Alexa Conradi , qui est âgée de 37 ans , est une militante féministe de longue date qui se définit elle - même comme une mère de famille anglophone , fille d'immigrants et lesbienne .
Elle a été préférée à Sylvie Lévesque et Anne Pasquier .
C'était la première fois dans l'histoire de la Fédération que trois candidates sollicitaient le poste de présidente .
Alexa Conradi est l'une des membres fondatrices de Québec solidaire , alors que la FFQ s'est toujours définie comme une organisation non partisane .
Elle assure toutefois que ses allégeances politiques n'auront pas d'influence sur sa présidence .
Née en Angleterre , elle a déclaré dans un communiqué de presse qu'elle compte démontrer que le féminisme est encore pertinent de nos jours .
Reconnue comme une femme d'action et d'idées , cette militante de la FFQ depuis dix ans veut également faire échec au discours qui laisse croire que l'égalité entre les hommes et les femmes est atteinte .
À force d'être placé sur la défensive , à force d'entendre que notre mouvement n'est plus pertinent , nous nous trouvons marginalisées .
Pas moins convaincues , mais faisant face à plus de défis .
Alexa Conradi
Les défis sont nombreux pour la nouvelle présidente .
En moins d'une dizaine d'années , le nombre de membres de la fédération est passé de près de 900 à moins de 500 .
La décision de l'organisme d'appuyer le port de symboles religieux dans la fonction publique a divisé de nombreuses féministes .
En entrevue à La Presse Canadienne , la présidente sortante , Michèle Asselin , a affirmé son intention de poursuivre son engagement social .
Elle n'a toutefois pas voulu dire si elle comptait se lancer en politique , à l'instar de quelques - unes de ses prédécesseures .
( CNN ) --
There 's something lurking in the depths of Loch Ness , Scotland and it has nothing to do with monsters .
Footage from the Loch Ness submarine search showing two golf balls submerged in silt .
On a recent expedition to try and find evidence of the Loch Ness monster , U.S. research teams came across something quite unexpected -- not a prehistoric creature of the deep but thousands of plastic covered golf balls .
Mike O'Brien of SeaTrepid explains : " At first we thought they were mushrooms , there were so many .
But when we lowered the camera , we were surprised to see that they were in fact , golf balls . "
The smattering of balls were found roughly 300 yards from the beach and 100 yards from the shore where it is thought locals and visitors have been using the loch to practice their driving skills for quite some time .
One witness , conservationist Adrian Shine , told CNN he had seen locals launching balls almost 300 feet into the waters .
Watch a video of balls being found at the bottom of Loch Ness . »
However , Shine does n't believe this to be an environmental threat : " Certainly it 's undesirable , but I do n't think it will have a significant environmental impact on the loch . "
It seems missing and discarded golf balls may not be bad news for all concerned .
David Roston has built a career out of wading through rivers and diving in lakes to collect and re-sell discarded golf balls .
His online company www.lakeballs.co.uk have been retailing " lake balls " for almost 10 years , but even his powers of retrieval would be challenged by the monstrous task of recovering balls from the bottom of the loch .
" I 've dived in various lakes and found 10 to 15 thousand golf balls at a time , it 's incredible -- but we 've never attempted to clear a loch ! "
Bobbing along at a depth of 754 feet , it is unlikely these balls of Loch Ness will ever see the light of day again .

Despite the fact that some banks are charging as much as 79 % yearly interest rates , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke insists that Congress must use caution when the it comes to future credit card regulation :
Boston Herald : Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke warned Congress this week about efforts to move up the effective date of tough new rules for credit card companies , saying such action could hurt consumers as much or more than help them .
" Creditors must make extensive changes to their systems and business models in order to comply " with the new rules , Mr. Bernanke said .
Opponents of moving the date to Dec. 1 fear that credit card companies would push the costs of complying the laws earlier than expected on to consumers .
Mr. Bernanke said that the Federal Reserve can’t predict how speeding up the effective date would affect the availability of credit and rates on credit cards .

Response from GlaxoSmithKline
( NaturalNews ) Smoking cessation products such as nicotine gum , lozenges and inhalers may contribute to the development of mouth cancer , according to a study conducted by the Medical Research Council and published in the journal " Although we acknowledge the importance of encouraging people to quit smoking , our research suggests nicotine found in lozenges and chewing gums may increase the risk of mouth cancer , " said lead researcher Muy - Teck Teh , of Queen Mary , University of London .
The researchers emphasized that it is far more important to quit smoking than to avoid nicotine gum , and that the point of the study is to use cessation products just long enough to quit smoking , and not longer .
" Smoking is of course far more dangerous [ than nicotine gum ] , " Teh said , " and people who are using nicotine replacement to give up should continue to use it and consult their [ doctors ] if they are concerned .
The important message is not to overuse it , and to follow advice on the packet .
" The researchers studied the activity of a gene known as FOXM1 , which often occurs in a mutated form in many tumors , including mouth tumors , and also in precancerous mouth lesions .
This mutation increases the activity of the gene .
The elevated activity of FOXM1 caused by the cancer - linked mutation is worsened by exposure to nicotine , the researchers found .
"
If you already have a mouth lesion that is expressing high levels of FOXM1 and you expose it to nicotine , it may add to the risk of converting it into cancer , " Teh said .
" The concern is that with smokers , you are looking at people who are already at risk of oral cancer .
I 'm worried that some may already have lesions they do n't know about in the mouth , and if they keep on taking nicotine replacement when they stop smoking products they will not be doing themselves any good .
" Most nicotine replacement products advise users to scale back after three months and end use after six .
Sources for this story include : www.timesonline.co.uk
I would like to respond to your October 12 , 2009 article entitled  Nicotine gum linked to mouth cancer ,  with important information about the study mentioned to clarify some points that may mislead your readers - especially those considering quitting smoking
The study reported on in your story did not evaluate nicotine replacement therapy in human subjects  rather it exposed human cells to nicotine in a test tube like environment .
The inferences made in the study about therapeutic nicotine safety are speculative .
There is no evidence that nicotine replacement products , like the nicotine patch or gum , cause cancer when used as directed by smokers to stop smoking .
In contrast , cancer risk from smoking is well documented .
Smoking is now known to cause eleven types of cancer : cancer of the mouth , throat , larynx , lung , esophagus , pancreas , kidney , bladder , stomach , cervix , and blood .
Tobacco smoke contains 69 known carcinogens .
Data from clinical studies and real - life use , spanning more than two decades , established that stop - smoking aids such as NicoDerm® CQ ® patch , Nicorette® gum , and Commit® lozenge are safe and effective when used as directed .
They have helped millions of smokers quit when used as directed , and as a result their risk of cancer and other tobacco - related diseases is greatly reduced .
If smokers are concerned about cancer , the most important thing they can do to reduce their risk is to quit smoking and many smokers need assistance from nicotine replacement therapy to help them quit .

MONTGOMERY , Ala . ( AP ) -- Alabama 's unemployment rate has jumped to 10.7 percent , but Madison County 's rate dropped slightly and overtook Shelby County as the county with the lowest unemployment rate .
The statewide figure reported Friday by the state Department of Industrial Relations is the highest since the state reached 10.9 percent in February 1984 .
State Industrial Relations Director Tom Surtees said he 's disappointed the rate continued to rise in September , but the entire country is experiencing increases due to the recession .
The September rate was up from a revised August rate of 10.3 percent .
It was nearly double the 5.4 percent Alabama recorded a year earlier .
Counties with the lowest unemployment rates were Madison at 7.5 percent , down from 7.6 percent in August ) , Shelby at 7.6 percent , and Coffee at 8.5 percent .
Counties with the highest rates were Wilcox at 25.6 percent , Dallas at 21.1 percent , and Perry at 19.8 percent .
Here is a map of unemployment across Alabama counties :
The world will miss its agreed target to stem biodiversity loss by next year , according to experts convening in Cape Town for a landmark conference devoted to biodiversity science .
The goal was agreed at the 6th Conference of Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in April 2003 .
Some 123 world ministers committed to " achieve , by 2010 , a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the local , national and regional levels , as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on Earth . "
" We will certainly miss the target for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 and therefore also miss the 2015 environmental targets within the U.N. Millennium Development Goals to improve health and livelihoods for the world 's poorest and most vulnerable people , " says Georgina Mace of Imperial College , London , and Vice - Chair of the international DIVERSITAS program , which is convening its 2nd Open Science Conference Oct. 13-16 with 600 experts from around the world .
" It is hard to image a more important priority than protecting the ecosystem services underpinned by biodiversity , " says Prof .
Mace .
" Biodiversity is fundamental to humans having food , fuel , clean water and a habitable climate . "
" Yet changes to ecosystems and losses of biodiversity have continued to accelerate .
Since 1992 , even the most conservative estimates agree that an area of tropical rainforest greater than the size of California has been converted mostly for food and fuel .
Species extinction rates are at least 100 times those in pre-human times and are expected to continue to increase . "
However , she adds , " the situation is not hopeless .
There are many steps available that would help but we cannot dawdle .
Meaningful action should have started years ago .
The next best time is now . "
The DIVERSITAS conference , to be opened by UN Under - Secretary - General Achim Steiner , Executive Director of UNEP , will call for new more science - based targets .

" A great deal of awareness - raising is still much needed with respect to the planetary threat posed by the loss of so many species .
The focus of biodiversity science today , though , is evolving from describing problems to policy relevant problem solving , " says Stanford University Prof .
Hal Mooney , DIVERSITAS
Chair .
" Experts are rising to the immense challenge , developing interdisciplinary , science - based solutions to the crisis while building new mechanisms to accelerate progress .
Biodiversity scientists are becoming more engaged in policy debates . "
Five roundtables between top science and policy specialists are scheduled on key issues such as efforts to create a science - based global biodiversity observing system ( GEO - BON ) to improve both coverage and consistency in observations at ground level and via remote sensing .
Says DIVERSITAS vice - chair Prof. Robert Scholes , who heads both GEO - BON and the local organization of the Cape Town conference : " GEO - BON will help give us a comprehensive baseline against which scientists can track biodiversity trends and evaluate the status of everything from genes to ecosystem services .
The lack of such information became acutely apparent during preparation of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment , and in formulating the CBD 's 2010 targets . "
Others , meanwhile , are creating an international mechanism to unify the voice of the biodiversity science community to better inform policy making , its function akin to that of the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
In Nairobi Oct. 5 - 9 , environment ministers from countries the world over will consider the creation of such a body , called IPBES ( the Intergovernmental Science - Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ) , which would require UN General Assembly approval .

Interdisciplinary work underway to address key issue areas also include :
How to demonstrate and quantify the economic costs and impacts on human welfare globally and locally due to biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation ( being conducted under the TEEB Initiative ) ;
How to understand , manage and conserve ecosystem services including , for example , the creation of economic incentives to prevent habitat destruction ;
How to share the benefits from the use of genetic resources fairly and equitably ; and
How to improve research institutions and the international stewardship of biodiversity .
Silent crisis : freshwater species " the most threatened on Earth "
Massive mismanagement and growing human needs for water are causing freshwater ecosystems to collapse , making freshwater species the most threatened on Earth with extinction rates 4 to 6 times higher than their terrestrial and marine cousins , according to conference experts .
Klement Tockner of the Leibniz - Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries , Berlin , says that while freshwater ecosystems cover only 0.8 % of the earth 's surface , they contain roughly 10 % of all animals , including more than 35 % of all vertebrates .
" There is clear and growing scientific evidence that we are on the verge of a major freshwater biodiversity crisis , " says Prof .
Tockner .
" However , few are aware of the catastrophic decline in freshwater biodiversity at both local and global scale .
Threats to freshwater biodiversity have now grown to a global scale . "
The human implications of this trend are " immense , " he adds , because freshwater species in rivers , lakes , ground waters , and wetlands provide a diverse array of vital natural services - more than any other ecosystem type .
The problem puts billions of people at risk as biodiversity loss affects water purification , disease regulation , subsistence agriculture and fishing .
Some experts predict that by 2025 not a single Chinese river will reach the sea except during floods with tremendous effects for coastal fisheries in China .
Prof .
Tockner says freshwater ecosystems and their species also absorb and bury about 7 % of the carbon humans add annually to the atmosphere .
" Although small in area , these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional carbon balances , " he says .
" Freshwater ecosystems will be the first victims of both climate change and rising demands on water supplies .
And the pace of extinctions is quickening - especially in hot spot areas around the Mediterranean , in Central America , China and throughout Southeast Asia . "
" Despite their pivotal ecological and economic importance , freshwater ecosystems have not been of primary concern in policy making , " adds Prof .
Tockner .
" Only recently did the European Union take the initiative to improve this situation through the EC Biodiversity Strategy .
And in the U.S. , recent Supreme Court decisions have made wetlands and small streams more vulnerable to loss . "
Prof .
Tockner , with colleague Charles Vörösmarty of the City University of New York , will present research at one of 25 conference symposia and invite fellow scientists to help formulate clear government policy recommendations and future research priorities .
The DIVERSITAS 2nd Open Science Conference is entitlrd " Understanding connections , adapting to change , " It is being held at Cape Town International Convention Centre , South Africa , 13 - 16 October , 2009 .
Author Greg Keyes is better known to me by his Star Wars Expanded Universe contributions , but as the writer on The Elder Scrolls : Infernal City , he 's been promoted to " potential Bethesda informant . "

A book blurb on the Waterstone 's retail site reads " A novel that takes places forty - five years after the Oblivion Crisis , which is the story of The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion game and the expansion pack Shivering Isles .
It partly bridges the gap for the next game , which is set 200 years after the Oblivion crisis . "
So , assuming " the next game " in Oblivion continuity is n't a ZeniMax Online massively multiplayer online game , this might be a hint at an Elder Scrolls V. Although , to hear Bethesda 's Pete Hines tell it , that 's the natural conclusion anybody could draw from how well The Elder Scrolls IV sold .

So Keyes ' Star Wars work is how I think of him and I consider it a compliment .
Yesterday , the rumors were that Eliot Spitzer , the former governor of New York , had decided to jump back into the political fray – possibly in a bid for the US senate seat currently held by Kirsten Gillibrand .
Now Fox News has Spitzer , who stepped down from his post after a high - profile scandal , signing on as an adjunct professor at The City College of New York .
That 's Professor Lov Gov , to you .
Ellis Simon , a spokesman for the college , has confirmed that Spitzer will teach a 15 - week undergraduate class in the poly - sci department called " Law and Public Policy . "
For his troubles , Spitzer will rake in $ 4,500 .
As Fox News notes , Eliot 's father Bernard has established an endowment for the Anne and Bernard Spitzer Chair in Political Science at CCNY .
So is another forray into politics out of the question for the former govenor of New York ?
On Thursday , " accidental governor " David Paterson , said Spitzer had never mentioned anything to him about the possibility .
" In my conversations with him he has seemed very much the opposite , " said Paterson , who took over for Spitzer in March .
In the July issue of Vanity Fair , Spitzer said he was n’t prepared for the ordeal of another campaign .
“ If by politics you mean running for office again , I ’ve a hard time seeing politics as a career .
I would n’t want to put my family through the agony , ” he said in a response to a question on his political future .
Yesterday , after news of his possible return surfaced , Spitzer reiterated that had no immediate plans to run for office .
For now , academia calls .

The Northwest Airlines plane involved was an Airbus A320 An inquiry has begun after a US plane heading from San Diego to Minneapolis missed the airport it was meant to land at by 150 miles ( 240 km ) .
Contact with the Northwest Airlines plane was lost for an hour as it flew at 37,000 ft , sparking hijack fears .
The crew said they had been distracted by a " heated discussion " but officials will check if they had fallen asleep .
Flight 188 , carrying 147 passengers , landed safely at Minneapolis after contact was resumed .
A statement released by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) said : " The crew stated they were in a heated discussion over airline policy and lost situational awareness . "
Wrong path Board spokesman Keith Holloway told the Associated Press news agency that reports that the pilots may have fallen asleep were " speculative " but the investigation would look at " fatigue issues " .
The plane 's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have been taken from the plane and are being sent to the board 's laboratory in Washington , DC .

Questions have been raised about how the pilots could have missed any warning signals - including city lights and cockpit displays showing that they were no longer on the right path .
The NTSB 's former chief investigator into major accidents , Ben Berman said pilots learned to become instinctively aware of when they needed to start landing preparations and it would take a " fairly dramatic event " to distract them , AP reported .
The plane left San Diego at 1500 local time ( 2200 GMT ) for what would normally be a three - hour journey .
Air traffic controllers lost radio contact with the plane approximately an hour before it was due to reach its destination of Minneapolis - St Paul International / Wold - Chamberlain Airport .
The plane missed its intended stop and continued on for a further 16 minutes before the airline managed to speak to the pilots .
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) contacted the military and two fighter jets were put on alert .
There were initial concerns the plane had been hijacked or had faced other problems and that was why the crew were not responding .
Northwest Airlines merged with Delta Air Lines in 2008 .
In a statement , Delta Air Lines said the plane 's pilot and co-pilot had been " relieved from active flying " .

How often do tempers flare at 35,000 feet ?
It said a decision would be made about them once its own internal investigation and one by the FAA and the safety board were over .
Brent Bjorlin , who was on the flight , told the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper that the passengers had not realised what had happened until they landed and security officials boarded the plane .
Fellow passenger Andrea Allmon said it was " unbelievable " that the pilots had allegedly not been paying attention .
" These guys are supposed to be paying attention to the flight .
The safety of the passengers should be first and foremost , " she said .
Doug Church , a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers ' Association , told the Wall Street Journal controllers at the airport began worrying about terrorism as a factor when they could not reach the crew .
He said when the controllers eventually made contact , to allay their fears the crew had been threatened or overpowered , they made the pilots prove they were still in control of the plane .
Once they were satisfied , the plane made its way back to the airport .

I thought I had read enough about Superfreakonomics and its horrifyingly ignorant chapter on climate change to prepare myself for the actual text .
But nothing could prepare me for the assault on science , logic and the English language that is this excerpt .
Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner managed to pull together just over 43 pages on science they clearly do n't understand , with contradictory assumptions , clichés and gimmicky analogies .
The chapter reads like a student term paper , a compilation of various factoids accumulated over the semester but displaying no real grasp of the subject matter .
The logical leaps between sentences and at times bizarre sentence structure make me wonder if they actually farmed this chapter out to an undergraduate .
The scientific flaws are numerous , starting with the claim that the majority of scientists worried about global cooling just a few decades ago .
This idea , based largely on a 1975 Newsweek story , is categorically false .
It was never a widely accepted idea , and besides , the magazine has since acknowledged that the projections in the story cited so often in this chapter were " spectacularly wrong " .
Levitt and Dubner also seem to think that scientists are not aware that water vapour exists , which , I assure you , is n't the case , and they argue that carbon dioxide was not responsible for historical warming , when , in fact , it was .
All of these are things that a simple deployment of The Google might have helped them avoid , but they do n't seem very interested in facts .
I wo n't dwell on the scientific flaws , as actual scientists have covered them quite well already ( see William Connolley , Joe Romm and Melanie Fitzpatrick to start ) .
Besides , Levitt and Dubner are economists .
I can forgive them for some misunderstanding .
I 'm more interested in their blatant disregard for the truth .
They came into the chapter , it seems , believing that global warming science has " taken on the feel of a religion " , are they wanted to seek out the " heretics " .
Problem is , even one of the main " heretics " they cite says his work and statements were taken out of context .
Ken Caldeira , a climate scientist at Stanford University , says that Superfreakonomics includes " many errors " as well as a " major error " in claiming that he downplays the role of carbon dioxide in warming .
What 's truly offensive is the response from Dubner and Levitt as their numerous errors have been exposed .
Rather than contend with the science , Dubner and Levitt took to their blog to call their critics names and write them off as " activists " .
The chapter , Dubner wrote , " will likely produce a lot of shouting , name - calling and accusations ranging from idiocy to venality . "
" It is curious that the global - warming arena is so rife with shrillness and ridicule , " he ponders .
" Where does this shrillness come from ?
Some say that left - leaning activists have merely borrowed their right - leaning competitors from years past .
A reasonable conjecture ? "
It might also be a reasonable conjecture that there are a number of scientists out there who are deeply concerned about the misinformation that the duo wantonly spreads .
Levitt and Dubner have doubled down as the criticism has increased , accusing their critics of trying to " smear " them .
They also do n't deal with Caldeira 's concerns about the misrepresentation of his work , and instead treat it as a difference of opinion – not grossly misstated " facts " .
And then , over the weekend , they officially jumped the shark .
On Saturday , Levitt appeared on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition programme .
Near the end of the segment , host Scott Simon referenced a critique of the chapter from the Union of Concerned Scientists .
Levitt took to his blog shortly thereafter , alleging that environmental bullies forced NPR to note the critiques .
" A well - known environmental - advocacy group pressured NPR into reading a statement critical of the book , " he wrote .
It 's hard to know whether all this chatter about how badly Levitt and Dubner screwed up the science of climate change will hurt or help them .
They sold four million copies of their last book , and I would never have picked up this new one had it not been for all the hubbub .
I 'm sure I 'm not the only one .
Of course , this is the sole goal of this kind of gimmicky book aimed at people who do n't actually understand economics , the environment or whatever other complicated topic they turn their pop lens to .
That 's how you sell books , and that seems to be their only goal here .

Beauty contest or selection of train attendants ?
Posted below are several pictures of the selection of attendants for high - speed trains , and the criteria for selecting attendants for high - speed trains is : 20 - years old and younger , 1.65 m and taller , 50kg and lighter , dignified appearance , high personal character … do n’t you think this is a beauty contest ?
20 - years - old and younger yet you also want them to have high personal character ?
The standard of evaluation for personal character is basically based on education , and those who are 20 - years - old and younger who have graduated from university are all geniuses .
As a genius , who would go be a train attendant ?
Some contradictions here .
After seeing this , I really do n’t know what you ’re supposed to think .
Do they all have high personal character ?
Everyone already says airline stewardesses are pretty .
In the future , airline stewardesses will have competition from train attendants .
What more , trains are considered relatively safer than airplanes , so in the future let ’s all go ride trains .
From Mop :
Look Look !
Mainland China ’s Ministry of Railways train attendant selection is like a beauty pagent !
20 - years - old and younger , 1.65 m and taller , 50 kg and lighter , dignified appearance , high personal character … this is not a beauty pageant but rather the requirements for high - speed train conductors / attendants .
In addition to service etiquette , the content of their training also requires proper pronunciation of putonghua [ Mandarin ] , even English language training for serving foreign passengers .
Since the train ’s speed is fast , the training also includes some special requirements for service standards .
For example , when pouring water , cups must be held with both hands instead of directly pouring water into cups on tables , and boiling water cannot exceed 2/3 of the container to avoid the boiling water spilling out ; when walking , one must hold onto the back of seats to avoid falls .
[ Same photos as above . ]
Comments from Mop :
我信春 :
With this kind of service , the cost - efficiency is very high .
[ This comment means that taking the train is a better choice than taking a plane , because it is cheaper and you still get pretty attendants . ]
小的不才 :
Is some government official going somewhere to do something ?
I have never received any service when riding the train .
无线固话 :
No wonder it is said that train ticket prices are increasing to be as expensive as airplane prices … now I finally understand …
龙城【九爷】 :
Big bosoms !~~
Train attendants in the past were either middle - aged women or men !
Each one worse than the next !!!
[ I ] support the trains recruiting some beauties , good on the eyes !
Men can also YY while on the train , ah , aesthetically pleasing …
Right now the attendants on high speed trains include quite a few young MM with delicate features .
The Ministry of Railways definitely should hold more selections of train attendants , select more good seedlings , and raise the overall quality …
However us lowly people must reminder you , do n’t TM raise the quality of attendants but not the quality of service !
During the vacations and holidays , buying a ticket requires begging people and using connections or spending a lot of money .
Trying to buy a ticket during New Year ’s is the biggest grief for those of us who work / live away from home !

NND , right when I was looking at the picture with them sticking out their chests , my boss comes in …
jxjwh :
What brother is beckoning / recruiting is not a girl , but loneliness !
娜娜是小可爱 :
Just my personal opinion ~ if you buy a high speed train ticket do n’t be stingy over 5 kuai and buy a cup of coffee ~ because the attendants that walk around making coffee have nice bodies ~ especially when they are bending over / stooping .
hehe
我坐在河畔哭泣 :
Where are the pretty girls - -?
cleanerer :
Those are just the attendants for high - speed trains , the slow trains are still all old ladies .
fuhuibaby :
Good , everyone will no longer take airplanes , as riding the train is both quick and you can see pretty girls too .

WASHINGTON , Sept 10 ( Reuters ) – By most counts , the death toll of U.S. soldiers in America ’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan stood at 5,157 in the second week of September .
Add at least 1,360 private contractors working for the U.S. and the number tops 6,500 .
Contractor deaths and injuries ( around 30,000 so far ) are rarely reported but they highlight the United States ’ steadily growing dependence on private enterprise .
It ’s a dependence some say has slid into incurable addiction .
Contractor ranks in Iraq and Afghanistan have swollen to just under a quarter million .
They outnumber U.S. troops in Afghanistan and they almost match uniformed soldiers in Iraq .
The present ratio of about one contractor for every uniformed member of the U.S. armed forces is more than double that of every other major conflict in American history , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
That means the world ’s only superpower cannot fight its war nor protect its civilian officials , diplomats and embassies without support from contractors .
“ As the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have progressed , the military services , defense agencies and other stakeholder agencies …continue to increase their reliance on contractors .
Contractors are now literally in the center of the battlefield in unprecedented numbers , ” according to a report to Congress by the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ In previous wars , the military police protected bases and the battle space as other military service members engaged and pursued the enemy , ” said the report .
In listing the 1,360 - plus contractor casualties , it said that criticism of the present system and suggestions for reforming it “ in no way diminish their sacrifices . ”
So why are they not routinely added to military casualty counts ?
And why should they ?
A full accounting for total casualties is important because both Congress and the public tend to gauge a war ’s success or failure by the size of the force deployed and the number of killed and wounded , according to George Washington university scholar Steven Schooner .
In other words : the higher the casualty number , the more difficult it is for political and military leaders to convince a sceptical public that a war is worth fighting , particularly a war that promises to be long , such as the conflict in Afghanistan .
Polls show that a majority of Americans already think the Afghan war is not worth fighting .
Figures on deaths and injuries among the vast ranks of civilians in war zones are tracked by the U.S. Department of Labor on the basis of claims under an insurance policy , the Defense Base Act , which all U.S. contracting companies and subcontractors must take out for the civilians they employ outside the United States .
EXPENDABLE PROFITEERS , ROGUES ?
The Labor Department compiles the statistics on a quarterly basis but only releases them in response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act .
This can take weeks .
The Department gives no details of the nationalities of the contractors , saying that doing so would “ constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy ” under the U.S. Privacy Act .
Writing in last autumn ’s Parameters , the quarterly journal of the U.S. Army War College , Schooner said that an accurate tally was critical to any discussion of the costs and benefits of the military ’s efforts in the wars .
What ’s more , the American public needs to know that their government is delegating to the private sector “ the responsibility to stand in harm ’s way and , if required , die for America . ”
Schooner wrote it was troubling that few Americans considered the deaths of contractors relevant or significant even though many of them performed roles carried out by uniformed military only a generation ago .
“ Many …concede that they perceive contractor personnel as expendable profiteers , adventure seekers , cowboys , or rogue elements not entitled to the same respect or value due to the military . ”
That ’s not surprising after a series of ugly incidents involving armed security contractors .
They make up for a small proportion of the total ( about 8 percent ) but account for almost all the headlines that have deepened negative perceptions and prompted labels from mercenary and merchant of death to “ the coalition of the billing . ”
In the most notorious incident , two years ago , employees of the company then known as Blackwater opened fire in a crowded Baghdad square , killing 17 Iraqis .
Five of the Blackwater shooters , who were working for the Department of State , have been indicted on manslaughter and weapons charges .
The Pentagon describes private contractors as a “ force multiplier ” because they let soldiers concentrate on military missions .
Some of the actions of private security contractors could be termed a “ perception multiplier . ”
Such as the after - hours antics of contractors from the company ArmorGroup North America guarding the U.S. embassy in Kabul .
Shaking off the image of rogues became even more difficult for private security contractors after a Washington - based watchdog group , the Project on Government Oversight , accompanied a detailed report on misconduct and morale problems among the guard force with photographs showing nearly nude , drunken employees in a variety of obscene poses and fondling each other .
Whether contractors , even rogue elements and cowboys , should not be counted in the toll of American wars is another matter .
Doing so would be part of the transparency Barack Obama promised when he ran for president .

What would it take to harness solar power from space then beam it down to earth ?
Money ?
Years ?
Super long cables ?
Solar panel maker Mitsubishi Electric Corp and IHI Corp would like to find out .
Mitsubishi Electric Corp and IHI Corp have agreed to work with several companies , to develop technology for a solar station in space .
It will take about $ 21 billion to fund this Japanese project and about 20 years to try to make it happen .
That is a lot of time and money .
The plan is to make it a 1 - gigawatt solar station .
The station will have 4 square kilometers of solar panels and it will be enough to power about " 294,000 average Tokyo homes " .
They are considering launching their first mission in 2015 for testing .
One of the challenges right now of course is the cost .
Transporting solar panels from earth to space will be costly .
They have to figure out a way to cut the cost to make the solar station commercially viable , according to Hiroshi Yoshida the CEO of Excalibur KK .
So , will it happen ?
Only time , technology and money will tell .
What will a solar power station like this do for the world ?
What do you think ?
Will solar power from space be possible before or by 2030 ?
For more information on this solar power Japanese project take a look at the Bloomberg report here .

WASHINGTON -- U.S. spy agencies are considering whether to rewrite a controversial 2007 intelligence report that asserted Tehran halted its efforts to build nuclear weapons in 2003 , current and former U.S. intelligence officials say .
The intelligence agencies ' rethink comes as pressure is mounting on Capitol Hill , and among U.S. allies , for the Obama administration to redo the 2007 assessment , after a string of recent revelations about Tehran 's nuclear program .

The Great Canadian Skyline thread for CMAs 1 million and under
Steelers fans were collectively scratching their heads following the crushing loss to the Bengals on Sunday .
Pittsburgh had n’t lost in Cincy since 2001 , and the feeling of losing to a usually - inferior foe took a toll on everyone .
We tried to lay blame … Limas Sweed , the absence of Rashard Mendenhall , a defense that could n’t step up when needed , Ben ’s pick - 6 .
Maybe all of these were n’t the determining factors .
Perhaps the Bengals won because they had the Miller High Life guy rooting them on .
Hey man , that beer was created 30 years before the Steelers .
And it ’s called “ The Champagne of Beers , ” champagne itself being used by athletes to signify big wins in any sport .
It looks like the forces of nature held this win out of the Steelers ’ hands , and the team really had no chance to change their fate .
I guess Steelers fans will have to get a Rolling Rock horse or an Iron City something - or - other at the game this Sunday to have any chance against the Chargers .

We took Congress in large part because Republicans ignored corruption inside their ranks .
The House ethics committee voted unanimously Thursday to expand the investigation into Rep. Charles Rangel ’s ( D - N.Y. ) alleged financial irregularities .
The panel broadened the jurisdiction of its probe to include amendments to his financial disclosure records showing at least $ 600,000 in previously unreported assets , according to an ethics committee release [...]
The ethics committee has been investigating multiple allegations against Rangel for more than a year and has been criticized for dragging its feet .
The panel , however , has been understaffed and just hired five attorneys and one senior investigator in late July .
In its release about the expansion of the probe the ethics committee highlighted all the work it has done in the Rangel matter thus far , including issuing close to 150 subpoenas , interviewing approximately 34 witnesses resulting in more than 2,100 pages of transcripts .
It also reviewed and analyzed more than 12,000 pages of documents and held more than 30 investigative subcommittee meetings .
As chairman of the House Ways and Means committee , Rangle is one of the most powerful people in government .
Yet despite serious allegations of corruption , he continues to chair his committee .
As Gail Collins writes :
Republicans are , however , completely right about Rangel .
Whenever a powerful committee chairman has so many problems that you need a timeline to keep all the allegations straight , he is a liability .
When those problems revolve around things like failure to pay taxes , it is not a good plan to have him be in charge of tax policy .
Memo to House Democrats -- the " culture of corruption " crosses partisan lines .
Last time the Democrats looked the other way -- with William Jefferson -- Republicans picked up a seat in one of the most Democratic districts in the nation .
Next time , they may pick up the entire U.S. House of Representatives .
Rangel should step down from his chairmanship until the ethics committee completes its work and issues a final report .

Shanghai “ Black girl ” Lou Jing becomes famous on the internet
Lou Jing [ shown with mother above ] , who participated in DragonTV ’s “ Jia you !
Oriental Angels “ , recently became exceptionally popular on the internet , having been cursed to fame by netizens !
Lou Jing was viciously abused owning to her life experience .
Many netizens learned that Lou Jing was born after her married mother had [ extra - marital ] relations with a black man , and let loose a torrent of abuse on the internet .
August 30 , Lou Jing issued on the internet a stern but fair protest against netizens ’ racism , that the color of her skin should not become a target of attack .
At the same time , she also said she reserved the right to take legal action .
From KDS :
Shanghai ’s most green [ cuckolded ] man , whose wife gives birth to a black man ’s child ~ ~
Lou Jing ’s mother had a husband , then had an extramarital affair with a black man , then gave birth to Lou Jing , and then after her birth divorced .
And that black devil , after fucking ran back to his home in Africa .
It is unimaginable how that Shanghainese man [ husband ] , excited and anxious to see his own “ daughter ” , must have felt when he saw that she was black …
A response by Lou Jing on KDS :
I am DragonTV Angel Lou Jing , and here I make a statement !
My father is American , not African .
I am a born and bred Shanghainese person .
I should not have to bear my parents ’ mistake , I am innocent !
Sternly but strongly protest some people ’s racism , my skin color should not become a target of attack !
I reserve the right to take legal action !

Even going on television … what is this show trying to promote ?
Extra-marital affairs …?

Her mother ’s skin is pretty thick .
At the time finding foreigners was indeed a fad , but you still ca n’t pick blacks !

How come a zebra was n’t born … ?
黑丫子 :
Ugh .
Yellow people and black people mixed together is very gross…only black skin , not yellow skin , chocolate skin …
Not even knowing this common knowledge , ruining a child ’s life .
Lyna :
There are still a lot of this kind of women that would get involved with blacks ~
Her old mother at the time had courage , probably also did not know what color would she would give birth to , white , yellow , all possible , right … ?
K-I :
She does not have it easy either .
She ’s still better than those men and women these days who treat abortion like a trivial matter .
Moreover , her mother was not married .
If the men in this post are all so enthusiastic about attacking her ,
then you guys better take care of your own lives .
小艾Deryck :
Can that black person ’s home see DragonTV ? …
篮球暴男 :
Numb !
This bitch still has the audacity to appear on television !
I do n’t know what to say !
One can not be shameless to this kind of level !
手刹车 :
Black people actually have a pretty high standing internationally , many famous fashion models and stars are all married to black people .
However in China , this kind of thing is a little embarrassing / shameful .
Bblueye :
I think this mother is still very great / admirable .
Willing to face her own mistakes , I ask how many TF here would dare to face [ such mistakes ] .
A single mother able to bring up a daughter is already very difficult / impressive , much less one with a different skin color , the difficulties are imaginable .
Everyone has the ability to analyze what is right , what is wrong .
Everyone think about it , do n’t be so immature , opening your mouth to hurl abuse without thinking .
Be a bit more understanding with other people .
伐要弄管 :
I think Lou Jing should not be condemned , she herself did nothing wrong , and if her father was an American white person , she probably would not be discriminated against .
In the end , it is still racism .
包龙星 :
Black people ’s tools / weapons are big !
Her mother must have been very satisfied !
Even having the audacity to go on television !
Probably hoping that Africa can see [ the television show ] , and [ the father ] will come to recognize his daughter , haha !
另壺蔥 :
But you guys should not forget … black women ’s bodies are the best in the world …
The modeling industry and entertainment industry all have a lot of black women …

Having this kind of woman as a mother , truly lamentable .
老实人春生 :
There is nothing wrong with the daughter , but her mother is indeed a bitch / slut , married but still getting involved with a black person , probably for the great “ love ” too .
Too bad the black man treated her as a toy .
Chinese girls , please have a little more self - respect .
波小斯 :
The television channel is also shameless , using this kind of thing to hype / promote / attract attention [ to itself ] .
I imagine her mother is also feeling helpless , bringing out and talking about such a shameful past , and ultimately [ in hopes of helping ] her daughter .
Miss_Q :
I cannot help but say , those coming out of mixing yellow and black blood are all truly ugly , a dirty feeling [ appearance ] …
phoenix81 :
I do not know why ,
but after seeing these photographs , my mind is reminded of Japanese - made adult videos , with the final climax scene of the black man , where the black man ’s muscular body tightly pressed on the Japanese woman ’s white and tender skin , pulling out after shuddering from climax , and then so many seconds of close - up — of vaginal liquids and semen everywhere .
One or several times N years ago , this Lou Jing ’s mother along with a black person also played out such a scene .
This black girl is truly deserving of pity .
The mistake is not on her , but on her mother ’s and that black biological father .
GOLAKER1 :
Girls , you guys should know that even in America , which represents the highest level of black people , 60 % of black children are brought up by their mothers alone .
Do you understand what this means ?>
It means the men all fucked and ran , not taking responsibility for anything !
There are often black people who have had children with over 10 different women , that American netizens all ask that they be castrated …
藍天白雲輕風 :
When I first saw this week ’s show , I too was very shocked , so stunned .
Society ’s norms and values have n’t becomes so “ fei zhu liu “ , has it ?
As a post - 80s generation , I completely cannot accept this .
If I were that girl , I would be so low key that I could not be any more low key .
How could I possibly come out and expose my face , seeking attention and sympathy … it is difficult to understand .
美女也爱国 :
How much self - respect could the child of a shameless old woman be ?
And she still wants to find her American father .
Who knows if her father is in jail for being unable to repay his loans or dead from a gun fight on the streets .
Judging by her mother ’s story , it seems like her mother was not very familiar with her American black father anyway , so trying to find … America ’s already has a bunch of black children trying to find their own biological fathers .
yimihai :
I am not racist , but if her mother really was married first and got involved with a black person , then that is indeed low .
What more , not knowing to use contraceptives or abortion , could she have really been thinking of using a child to tie down a foreigner ?
Truly both low and deplorable .
The child is innocent …

I 'm feeling quite pleased with myself - apparently , I have the fitness level of a 30 - year - old , when I 'm actually 10 years older .
This was the judgement of a new free online tool , the National Fitness Test , which assesses your strength , aerobic fitness , flexibility and ' shape ' ( weight , height and body measurements ) , giving you an individual score for each component as well as an overall ' age ' .
I was faring even better ( a sprightly 27 ) until I completed the flexibility element of the test , for which my result read : ' Crikey , you 're stiff .
I do n't know how you put your socks on in the morning !'
The National Fitness Test is the brainchild of Dave Reddin , a fitness trainer for the Rugby World Cup squad and a consultant to Team GB .
" I wanted to show people how easy it is to take control of your fitness and get a fair assessment that is relative to age and sex , " he says .
The fact that the test is home - based and requires little more than a tape measure , a computer ( visual and written instructions appear on the screen as and when you need them ) , a watch with a second hand , and a set of weighing scales certainly make it accessible to all and maximises its appeal .
But is the test valid ?
Well , the aerobic fitness side of things is addressed using a four - minute step test - you simply step up and down a step of measured height to a designated rhythm ( provided as a sound clip ) and record your heart rate before , immediately afterwards , and then a minute later .
Reddin took elements from two existing well - validated fitness tests - the Harvard Step Test ( above ) and Canadian Home Fitness Test - to create this simple protocol .
" The combination of resting heart rate , the heart rate achieved after four minutes of exertion and your ability to recover within a minute are used to give a ' fitness index ' or score , ' he explains .
The step test is what 's known as a ' submaximal ' test - in other words , it does n't require you to reach exhaustion .
" In submaximal testing , fitness is n't being directly measured but estimated using the heart rate response , " explains Steve Hunter , an exercise physiologist at South Bank University .
" Recovery heart rate is generally a good measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and with repeated tests , a quicker recovery provides indirect evidence of an improvement in fitness level . "
While Hunter concedes that step tests are easy to administer , he points out that they carry a risk of tripping and , he says , can lead to an underestimation of fitness levels if the legs are weak .
He suggests the Rockport Walking Test ( above ) - a one - mile walk ( ideally on a smooth , level surface ) as briskly as you can manage .
Time taken to complete the mile , along with age , heart rate at the end of the test , and gender , are used to estimate ' VO2 max ' - or maximal aerobic capacity - widely seen as a ' gold standard ' measure of fitness .
" This test demonstrates good reliability in test / re-test measurements and offers an indication of improvement , " he says .
If you want a true measure of your aerobic fitness , you 'll need to don a nose clip and breathing tube while you run yourself ragged on a laboratory treadmill ( a crash mat is handily placed at the back , in case you go flying off ) .
Such tests are the norm for serious athletes , but there are also ' field - based ' maximal tests that can give you a good estimate without necessitating costly lab visits .
" The Multistage Shuttle Test [ or bleep test , above ] is one of the most accurate and reliable , showing a strong correlation with measured VO2 max , " says Hunter .
" However , it involves a large amount of stopping and turning , often at some speed , so I would not recommend it for the masses .
It 's best suited to young , active individuals , particularly those involved in team sports that require change of direction . "
A slightly less daunting alternative is the Cooper Test - a 12 - minute run in which you cover as great a distance as you can , or the 1.5 - Mile Run , in which you aim to complete the distance as fast as possible .
Hunter says such tests are useful for fit , healthy , active people but may be too challenging for the general ' apparently healthy ' population .
Reddin has incorporated the 1.5 - Mile Run into his ' Park Fitness Test ' , one of the forthcoming additions to the National Fitness Test website , geared towards fitter people .
But he believes that for the general public , the idea of having to go out and run , or measure a distance , could be off - putting .
" The idea with the home - based test was to appeal to the greatest number of people and get as many of them as possible to give it a go , " he says .
" Many people know they 're unfit - this gives them a chance to try the test without even having to tell anyone or leave their own home .
It 's a great awareness tool . "
My one gripe about the National Fitness Test is that when calculating your overall fitness score and ' age , ' equal weighting is given to aerobic fitness , flexibility , strength and shape .
While these are important components of fitness , it 's aerobic fitness that is the real key when it comes to heart health , disease prevention and combating obesity .
And this observation has nothing to do with the fact that I ranked ' poor ' in both strength and flexibility …
Whatever fitness test you 're undertaking , you need to follow the instructions to the letter if you are to get meaningful results .
The disadvantage with a home test is there is n't anyone watching you and it 's possible to cheat or do things slightly wrong .
( For example , the National Fitness Test uses the ' plank ' exercise , above , to assess strength .
And while I , of course , executed mine with perfect posture , it would be easy to do it badly and still score highly by holding the position for a long time . )
Recruiting a friend or partner to help with timing and technique is a good idea .
It 's also worth bearing in mind that unless you intend to repeat any fitness test in the future , the results merely provide a snapshot of where you are now .
" In terms of making tests reliable and repeatable , it is essential that the methods followed are precisely the same on each occasion , " says Hunter .
" For example , carry out the test at the same time of day , and if outside , try to do it when the environmental conditions are the same or as similar as possible to that of previous tests .
Otherwise , you may mask the effects - positive or negative - of your training programme . "
Hunter recommends repeating tests every six - 12 weeks .
" Do n't be tempted to repeat them too frequently , because it can be discouraging if you do n't see any improvement , " he says .

One boy was found unconscious near a wooded ravine
Two young brothers who lured two boys , aged nine and 11 , to a South Yorkshire ravine before carrying out a brutal attack have admitted the assault .
At Sheffield Crown Court the brothers , aged 10 and 12 , admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent .
One of the victims also had a sink dropped on to his head during the attack in Edlington , near Doncaster .
The brothers were arrested on 4 April after the younger victim , covered in blood , escaped and raised the alarm .
Attempted murder charges over the attack were dropped by prosecutors .
Reports are being prepared on the boys ahead of a sentencing hearing , expected to be held in November .
The victims met their attackers as they played football in a park .
Map :
Where the attack happened
They were lured away by the brothers , who promised they would show them a toad they had found , but instead they were subjected to a horrific assault .
Jenny Hill , BBC News , Sheffield Crown Court
The crimes that these brothers committed , the injuries they inflicted , were considered so severe that they were initially charged with attempted murder .
They pleaded not guilty to attempted murder but guilty to a lesser charge , grievous bodily harm .
The court has accepted that lesser charge .
The Crown Prosecution Service and South Yorkshire Police said they believe this is the right decision because of course it stops the victims having to relive the traumatic attack during a trial which would have taken certainly two or three weeks .
The decision was taken in accordance with the families of those victims , who say they are particularly relieved that the boys would not have to relive what had happened to them .
The maximum sentence for grievous bodily harm is the same as the maximum sentence for attempted murder , so the feeling here at the court is very much that the difference in charges really does n't actually affect the outcome of this .
The older boy had a sink dropped on his head , one had a noose put around his head and one was burned with a cigarette on his eyelids and ear .
The younger boy had a sharp stick rammed into his arm and cigarettes pushed into the wound .
He also tried to ram a stick down his own throat after he was told to " go away and kill himself " by one of his attackers .
The pair , who were both seriously injured , had bricks thrown at them and were repeatedly stamped on .
The nine - year - old managed to stagger to a nearby house to raise the alarm , covered in blood from wounds to his head and arm .
The 11 - year - old boy was later discovered unconscious in the nearby wood .
The brothers have each pleaded guilty to robbing one of the boys of a mobile phone and the other of cash .
They also admitted two counts of intentionally causing a child to engage in sexual activity .
The brothers were later charged with attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and making a threat to kill in connection with a separate attack on another 11 - year - old boy in Doncaster a week earlier .
The pair had denied these offences , but each have pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm .
The court heard the brothers picked a " discreet " location for the scene of their first attack , in trees by a stream .
I 'm gonna die , I 'm gonna die - that 's what I kept repeating in my head
Victim of first attack
But they were interrupted by a passer - by .
The victim of that attack said : " They got me into these bushes , and then the fat one punched me .
" They stamped on my head .
After , like , twenty minutes of them hurting me , this man came and said ' Oi , what you doing ?'... and they said ' You 've got twenty seconds to run ' so I ran as fast as my little legs could carry me .
" I 'm gonna die , I 'm gonna die .
That 's what I kept repeating in my head . "
A week later the brothers chose a " more isolated " place for the attack on the two boys .
The boys were led to a large mound of timber , described as a " den " , which was hidden from public view , where some of their injuries were inflicted .
The brothers then moved their victims to a second site , at the foot of a 15 ft ravine .
It was here that a broken sink was used to inflict the more serious head injuries on the 11 - year - old .

Det Supt Mick Mason said the victims suffered a " traumatic experience " but were " recovering well " .
" The victims are still suffering , certainly mentally , and also recovering from the physical wounds , " he said .
The mother of the eldest victim said she was " pleased " with the guilty pleas .
She said the families were not upset about the decision to accept pleas to lesser charges and she was happy the boys did not have to be put through a trial .
Nicholas Campbell QC , prosecuting , described the offences as " grave crimes " .
The prosecutor said on the day of the second attack , the two brothers should have been at the police station being questioned about the earlier assault .
He said : " Instead , they went out and attacked [ the two boys ] . "
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) said the decision not to pursue the attempted murder charges was taken in consultation with the victims ' families .
Doncaster Council said a serious case review was now under way to establish if there are lessons to be learned by any agency involved .
The judge , Mr Justice Keith , will visit the site of the attacks before the boys are sentenced .

Named for a Dutch physicist , the Casimir effect governs interactions of matter with the energy that is present in a vacuum .
Success in harnessing this force could someday help researchers develop low - friction ballistics and even levitating objects that defy gravity .
For now , the U.S. Defense Department 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has launched a two - year , $ 10 - million project encouraging scientists to work on ways to manipulate this quirk of quantum electrodynamics .
Vacuums generally are thought to be voids , but Hendrik Casimir believed these pockets of nothing do indeed contain fluctuations of electromagnetic waves .
He suggested , in work done in the 1940s with fellow Dutch physicist Dirk Polder , that two metal plates held apart in a vacuum could trap the waves , creating vacuum energy that , depending on the situation , could attract or repel the plates .
As the boundaries of a region of vacuum move , the variation in vacuum energy ( also called zero - point energy ) leads to the Casimir effect .
Recent research done at Harvard University , Vrije University Amsterdam and elsewhere has proved Casimir correct — and given some experimental underpinning to DARPA 's request for research proposals .
Investigators from five institutions — Harvard , Yale University , the University of California , Riverside , and two national labs , Argonne and Los Alamos — received funding .
DARPA will assess the groups ' progress in early 2011 to see if any practical applications might emerge from the research .
" If the program delivers , there 's a good chance for a follow - on program to apply " the research , says Thomas Kenny , the DARPA physicist in charge of the initiative .
Program documents on the DARPA Web site state the goal of the Casimir Effect Enhancement program " is to develop new methods to control and manipulate attractive and repulsive forces at surfaces based on engineering of the Casimir force .
One could leverage this ability to control phenomena such as adhesion in nanodevices , drag on vehicles , and many other interactions of interest to the [ Defense Department ] . "
Nanoscale design is the most likely place to start and is also the arena where levitation could emerge .
Materials scientists working to build tiny machines called microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) struggle with surface interactions , called van der Waals forces , that can make nanomaterials sticky to the point of permanent adhesion , a phenomenon known as " stiction " .
To defeat stiction , many MEMS devices are coated with Teflon or similar low - friction substances or are studded with tiny springs that keep the surfaces apart .
Materials that did not require such fixes could make nanotechnology more reliable .
Such materials could skirt another problem posed by adhesion :
Because surface stickiness at the nanoscale is much greater than it is for larger objects , MEMS designers resort to making their devices relatively stiff .
That reduces adhesion ( stiff structures do not readily bend against each other ) , but it reduces flexibility and increases power demands .
Under certain conditions , manipulating the Casimir effect could create repellant forces between nanoscale surfaces .
Hong Tang and his colleagues at Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science sold DARPA on their proposal to assess Casimir forces between miniscule silicon crystals , like those that make up computer chips .
" Then we 're going to engineer the structure of the surface of the silicon device to get some unusual Casimir forces to produce repulsion , " he says .
In theory , he adds , that could mean building a device capable of levitation .
Such claims emit a strong scent of fantasy , but researchers say incremental successes could open the door to significant breakthroughs in key areas of nanotechnology , and perhaps larger structures .
" What I can contribute is to understand the role of the Casimir force in real working devices , such as microwave switches , MEMS oscillators and gyroscopes , that normally are made of silicon crystals , not perfect metals , " Tang says .
The request for proposals closed in September .
The project received " a lot of interest , " Kenny says .
" I was surprised at the creativity of the proposals , and at the practicality , " he adds , although he declined to reveal how many teams submitted proposals .
" It was n't pure theory .
There were real designs that looked buildable , and the physics looked well understood . "
Still , the Casimir project was a " hard sell " for DARPA administrators , Kenny acknowledges .
" It 's very fundamental , very risky , and even speculative on the physics side , " he says .
" Convincing the agency management that the timing was right was difficult , especially given the number of programs that must compete for money within the agency . "
DARPA managers certainly would be satisfied if the Casimir project produced anything tangible , because earlier attempts had failed .
Between 1996 and 2003 , for example , NASA had a program to explore what it calls Breakthrough Propulsion Physics to build spacecraft capable of traveling at speeds faster than light ( 299,790 kilometers per second ) .
One way to do that is by harnessing the Casimir force in a vacuum and using the energy to power a propulsion system .
The program closed with this epitaph on its Web site : " No breakthroughs appear imminent . "
One of many problems with breakthrough propulsion based on the Casimir force is that whereas zero - point energy may be theoretically infinite , it is not necessarily limitless in practice — or even minutely accessible .
" It 's not so much that these look like really good energy schemes so much as they are clever ways of broaching some really hard questions and testing them , " says Marc Millis , the NASA physicist who oversaw the propulsion program .
The DARPA program faces several formidable obstacles , as well , cautions Jeremy Munday , a physicist at California Institute of Technology who studies the Casimir effect .
For starters , simply measuring the Casimir force is difficult enough .
These experiments take many years to complete , adds Munday , who recently published a paper in Nature ( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group ) describing his own research .
What 's more , he says , although several groups have measured the Casimir force , only a few have been able to modify it significantly .
Still , Munday adds , the exploratory nature of the program means its goals and expectations are " quite reasonable . "
Tang is pragmatic about his efforts , given the unlikelihood that Casimir force will ever provide much energy to harness .
" The force is really small , " he says .
" After all , a vacuum is a vacuum . "
Yet sometimes the best science can hope for is baby steps .
" To come up with anything that can lead to a viable energy conversion or a viable force producing effect , we 're not anywhere close , " Millis says .
" But then , of course , you do n't make progress unless you try .

Linda Peeno :
Former Humana Insurance Medical Examiner
Former Blue Cross / Blue Shield Medical Director
I 'm here today to make a public confession .
In the spring of 1987 , as a Physician , I denied a man a necessary operation , that would have saved his life .
And thus caused his death .
No Person , and No Group has held me accountable for this .
Because in fact what I did , was I saved the Company a half a million dollars , for this .
And furthermore , this particular act secured my reputation as ' a Good Medical Director ' , and it ensured my continued advancement in the Health Care field .
I went from making a few hundred dollars a week , as a Medical Reviewer , to an escalating 6 - figure income , as a Physician Executive .
In all my work I had one primary duty , and that was to use my medical expertise , for the financial benefit of the Organization for which I worked .
And I was told repeatedly that , ' I was not denying Care , I was simply denying Payment ' .
I know how Managed Care maims and kills patients .
So I 'm here to tell you about the ' dirty work ' of Managed Care .
And I 'm haunted by the thousands of pieces of paper , on which I have written that deadly word : Denied .
Michael Moore :
How did we get to the point that Doctors at Health Insurance Companies , actually being responsible , for the Deaths of Patients ?
Who Invented this System ?
How did this all begin ?
Where did the HMO 's start ?

Is Health Care a Commodity , or a basic Human Right ?
Well according to this former Health Insurance CEO , the Insurance Company he worked for , would routinely and actively look for " sick people to dump " .
And in their spare time , Insurance Company are very focused on " cost shifting " the " Payment for Care " from themselves , to the workers , and their employers .
MSNBC's Ed Schultz Interviews Wendell Potter
http://www.youtube.com/...
ED SCHULTZ : Welcome back to THE ED SHOW .
The Republican sound machine is in full force against health care .
We gave you the " Playbook , " in fact back on May 6th on this program , we went through the right wing ‘s messaging machine playbook ; it ‘s a 28 - page strategy memo from Republican pollster Frank Luntz .
He told the Republicans to hammer basically four things when it comes to reform ,
that reform would be : -- a " government takeover " by Washington bureaucrats .
--
It would " ration " your health care .
--
And get " between you and your doctor . "
[...]
ED SCHULTZ : Big insurance is lining is pockets of lawmakers .
Big insurance only cares about their profits .
They want lawmakers to protect their backyard , their profits .
They ‘re voting against reforms that would really be good for consumers .
But I do n‘t want you to take my word for it .
I want you to pay attention to this next interview .
We have a former insurance insider .
Joining me now is Wendell Potter .
He is a senior fellow on health care for the center for media and democracy .
He ‘s also a former vice president for the insurance giant Cigna .
Mr. Potter , good to have you with us tonight .
I appreciate your time .
Is the industry telling the truth to the American people and telling the truth to those in the Congress ?
WENDELL POTTER , SENIOR FELLOW , CENTER FOR MEDIA & DEMOCRACY : No , they ‘re not .
And that ‘s one of the reasons why I left my job at Cigna and why I decided to speak out .
I did n‘t want to be a part of that -- those lies and misleading statements once again .
I ‘ve been a part of them in the past and I just did n‘t want to do that again .
SCHULTZ : Where are the insurance companies making their big profits when it comes to health care ?
What are they doing to consumers ?
POTTER : What they ‘re doing to consumers is , number one -- they ‘re shifting a lot more of the financial burden from them and the employers onto the shoulders of working men and women .
And they also are very actively looking at claims when they ‘re submitted .
And they ‘re acting -- taking action to dump people when they ‘re sick , either in the individual market or in the small groups .
So a lot of small employers no longer can afford health care because of the actions taken by the insurance companies to get rid of them when their employees ‘ claims are a little bit higher than the underwriters expected .
SCHULTZ : Mr. Potter , do you think that there ‘s a lot of people in the industry that feel the same way you did but just did n‘t follow the action you took ?
POTTER : Absolutely , I know there are .
I ‘ve gotten just dozens , actually hundreds of e-mails from people that I have worked with in the past .
And most of them now former Cigna employees and employees of other companies who know me and have sent me communications to sell me , " I wish I had done that . "
[...]
SCHULTZ : How much do you think they want to defeat the public option ?
POTTER : Well , they ‘re pulling out all the stops .
That ‘s why you ‘re seeing the same talking points they ‘ve used over the years being trotted out again .
They ‘re ever green talking points .
They will say one thing on -- the industry is engaged in what I call the charm defense in saying that they ‘re all for reform ; but behind the scenes , working with their allies to gut it .
The public option is one of the things that they pretty much have drawn a line in the sand saying , " We can‘t accept that . "
[...]
POTTER : I think the president is winning .
I think the advocates for health care reform are winning .
It may not seem that way , when we see a headline like we saw the other day in the " Wall Street Journal , " about the CBO estimating that we can‘t afford it .
We can‘t afford not to do this .
I think the president can communicate that more as time goes by and as Congress really gets down to business .
I think that we‘ll see reform this time and meaningful reform .

Question : Are the Patients , who are Denied Care , to save the Insurance Companies Money -- DO those Patients have a RIGHT to their Health Care ?
Or are Those Patients simply a Commodity -- a " Cost Center " -- that must be placated , cajoled , and finally ignored ?
Mind you this Business of Care Denial is not just ancient history .
It is alive and well , to this day .
Although the same , probably can not be said , for the victims of these " behind the scenes " , real - life , Death - Panel - Deciders :
HMO claims - rejection rates trigger state investigation
By Lisa Girion , LA Times -- Sep 4 , 2009
California Atty . Gen. Jerry Brown is joining state regulators in scrutinizing how HMOs review and pay insurance claims submitted by doctors , hospitals and other medical providers .
His announcement came Thursday as regulators said they had stepped up scrutiny of the payment practices of the state 's seven largest health plans in response to complaints from physicians and hospitals .
The increased attention also comes on the heels of a first - of - its - kind report issued this week that said the California health insurers reject 1 in 5 medical claims .
Six of the state 's largest insurers rejected 45.7 million claims for medical care , or 22 % of all claims , from 2002 to June 30 , 2009 , according to the California Nurses Assn .'s analysis of data submitted to regulators by the companies .
The rejection rates ranged from a high of 39.6 % for PacifiCare to 6.5 % for Aetna for the first half of 2009 .
Cigna denied 33 % , and Health Net 30 % .
Anthem Blue Cross , the state 's largest for - profit health plan , and Kaiser , the state 's largest nonprofit plan , each rejected 28 % of claims .
Where is the ' Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval ' for these guys ?
Health Care and Profits do not mix .
Never have , Never will .
When Insurance ' Experts ' get bonuses , and raises , from Denying us Care -- something is definitely Wrong with our system .
When 1 out of 5 Health Care Claims get denied proper Payment -- something is definitely Wrong with our system .
The People do n't need 5 more years , to know there is something wrong with the Health Insurance system .
The Insurers may need such a Time Trigger , but the People DON'T -- The People have NEEDED Real CHANGE , FOR DECADES , now !
We do n't need a little more Time , to know that Private Insurers and HMOs do n't work ; that they will put their own Profits above paying for Treatment , when ever they can .
Murphy 's Law kind of " insures " that will happen !
Since they -- Private Insurance Companies -- can Choose to Deny us care , so systematically ,
We simply need a minor System " Tweak " , that lets US Choose to Deny THEM , their ' routine and customary ' payments , of our ever - increasing Health Insurance Premiums .
And giving us a Choice of Public Payment Plan , no fuss - no muss , similar to Medicare , ( aka the Public Option ) , does just that !
Having a strong Public Option , would LET US CHOOSE , a different Health Management Model --
One based on providing " Healthy Results " , NOT one based on providing " Healthy Profits " !
And is n't that what Health Care SHOULD be all about , " Healthy Results " ?
Is Health Care a Commodity , or a basic Human Right ?
Well according to these " Senate Watchers " -- the Senate " is finally starting to think of Health Care as a basic Human Right " ...
It 's just HOW TO deliver that Care , that is the " sticking point " ...
Is Health Care a Human Right ?
http://www.youtube.com/...
What do you think , is Health a just a Commodity , a Luxury , a Benefit , for ONLY those who can afford it ?
Or is it , like Education , a Basic Human Right -- a necessary Condition for simple Human Dignity ?
Despite the Scare Tactics funded by Industry Lobbies , that warn us of the " Dangers of a Government Run " Health Care system like Canada has -- the Canadian People who depend on their " No - Nonsense " Nationally - paid system , would tell you a different story ...
Canadians discuss the realities of their single payer health care system , and take exception to the American right wing 's insulting of it :

Americans spend more per capita on healthcare than any other country at more than $ 7,400 per person , according to a recent report by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .
Yet studies suggest Americans overall get poorer care than people in other industrialized countries .
Private insurance pays 35 percent of this ; [...] and 12 percent is paid out - of - pocket by patients .

The U.S. Census Bureau says 46 million Americans , or 15 percent of the population , have no health insurance .

If I tell you tomorrow --
[... 6:35 ] Anthony : ... you know , if you say to a 50 - year old laid - off guy -- 50 -- ' you 're going to get Medicare . ' -- he 's going to be pretty darn happy !
Because he can't get Private Insurance for anything affordable .
Medicare does n't have to go Advertise , they do n't have to put Profits into Administration ...
Joe : yeah , yeah , OK ...
Anthony : And Joe I asked you a Question : What is --
What are Health Insurance Plans doing to produce Health care ?
... just tell me ?
Health Insurance Companies ?
Joe : Again , the Question , ah ah , I do n't even understand the Question -- other than it 's you trying to make the point , that ' We do n't need Private Industry involved in Health Care , at all ' .
Anthony : Correct Joe :
You are advocating with us today a complete take over , complete Government take over ...
Anthony : Only if you think Medicare is a Government Take - over , do you ?

The United States claims to stand up for Human Rights around the World -- it 's just in our own Backyard , where we have a little problem spotting the Victims , and helping them avoid Exploitation !
True , the United States is Number One in a lot of important ways -- it 's just that we need to get over our own myopia , when it comes to Helping our own People !
Here somewhere , WHERE we , as a Naton , CAN NO LONGER AFFORD to be Number One Two :

US Health Care " Best " in the World -- in Per Capita Cost
Something must Change in the Business of Delivering Care !
Giving the Health Care Brokers , 5 more years to straighten up and " Clean Up their Act " , with a vague threat of a Public Option THEN -- Solves Nothing , NOW !
Especially considering the Quarterly Profit business " drivers " and all .
Profiteers will always cut corners , and they will look for Loopholes , to cut costs , and to increase Profits -- ALWAYS !
It 's what Capitalism is ALL ABOUT !
WELL , Somethings should NOT be Capitalized -- especially those things which are needed to provide for the " General Welfare of the People " .
The only real solution is to take extreme Profits OUT OF the Human Health Care Equation .
Providing a strong Public Option , similar to Medicare , is one small step in the right direction .
Is Health Care a Commodity , or a basic Human Right ?
Question : How can American Citizens even " pursue Life , Liberty , and Happiness " -- when Good Health , like a Good Education , is NOT a guarantee and just a given , an essential part of our cherished Citizenship ?

" Kevin Is Not a Name — It 's a Diagnosis ! "
We ’ve written extensively about the consequences of baby naming .
The name you choose for your children can affect his “ Google - ability ” or even get you in trouble with the law .
A new survey of 2,000 elementary school teachers in Germany finds that your children ’s names may also affect how teachers perceive them ( translation available here ) .
An overwhelming majority of the teachers surveyed associate “ traditional ” names with positive character traits and non-traditional names with weak performance and bad behavior .
The name Kevin has particularly negative connotations ; as one teacher wrote , “ Kevin is not a name — it ’s a diagnosis ! ” Astrid Kaiser , who conducted the study , said , “ The names with positive connotations are all traditional German ones .
What this shows is that children from a working class or immigrant background are clearly being discriminated against . ” ( HT : Herbert Engels ) [ % comments ]
Meet the Ovadiahs , the Allons , and the Cohens .
They 're new arrivals in Israeli neighborhoods where freshly laid red - tile roofs and toddler toys dotting green lawns are a picture of the Israeli equivalent of the American dream , minus the white picket fence .
But the sounds wafting through the air – the constant clank of construction , and the Muslim call to prayer from nearby Palestinian villages – speak to the larger context in which their new homes are located .
All three families have recently bought homes in West Bank settlements , where the rate of population growth – three times that of Israel alone – is the subject of great global dispute .
For the past decade , an annual average of more than 10,000 newcomers have settled in this disputed territory – a portion of that growth was babies born to growing families .
In the years 2006 through 2008 , a yearly average of 14,100 new residents of West Bank settlements were registered by Israel 's Central Bureau of Statistics – the biggest growth spurt , in sheer numbers , in recent Israeli history .
That growth has vastly different meaning locally , nationally , and globally .
To Palestinians , it means an expansion of the occupation .
In the Israeli narrative – in which the world 's censure of settlement growth seems to have been reduced to background noise for families like the Ovadiahs , Allons , and Cohens – the growth is beginning to look like little more than suburbanization .
They came in search of quiet bedroom communities that boast ample space , pretty landscapes – and some of the best home values in Israel .
Through the lens of the international community , West Bank growth impedes renewed efforts to bring about a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Bridging that disconnect is a major challenge for President Obama , who is expected this week to try to restart Middle East peace talks at the UN General Assembly , where he 's scheduled to meet with Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
This is the latest chapter in the on again , off again drama that has played out between Jerusalem and Washington for decades : Every US president since Lyndon Johnson has urged Israel not to build or expand settlements in the territories it occupied in the 1967 Arab - Israeli conflict .
But with more than 300,000 Israeli settlers living in some 120 settlements – and Mr. Netanyahu exempting nearly 3,000 housing units from a six - month freeze – the settlement issue has only become more formidable .
( Read a full briefing page on Israeli settlements here . )
BUT WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD CHOOSE to settle in the midst of such unsettled conflict ?
It is not necessarily the well - armed ideologues who have characterized the settlement movement over the years .
The bulk of settlers today , according to various surveys , come mostly for economic or " lifestyle " reasons .
About 30 percent of those are ultra-Orthodox Jews for whom the primary goal is living in an affordable religious com-munity , irrespective of whether it lies beyond the Green Line , Israel 's pre-1967 borders .
New immigrants , such as Americans and those from the former Soviet Union , make up a smaller portion .
Generally most do n't like to be called settlers because , as one settlement council head says , settlers have been made out to be the world 's " pariahs . "
But they might agree to be called the new settlers , if the word were to be used in the most positive sense , as in the early American pioneers .
With the West Bank in Israel 's hands for 42 years , many middle - of - the - road Israelis see little reason not to move there – particularly to long - established , larger settlements , or those close to the Green Line .
They 're educated , often upper - middle - class , and not exclusively from right - wing backgrounds .
They 're more likely to be armed with an iPod than an Uzi .
And unlike the settlers who tend to grab headlines , they 're not interested in using force or violence to stop another evacuation of settlements , largely expected to be a feature of any Israeli - Palestinian peace treaty .
But why take the risk of investing in a home on disputed territory ?
Among other reasons , settlers are bearish on the prospects of the peace process leading anywhere soon – if ever .
" THIS AREA IS NOT LIKELY TO EVER BE EVACUATED , " says Moti Ovadiah , who moved to Kiryat Netafim a year ago , shortly after his wife , Vered , gave birth to their son , Ishai .
Kiryat Netafim , tucked into a comely , mountainous area – from which the Tel Aviv skyline is visible – is next to the settlement of Barkan and its large industrial park .
It 's a sleepy area with little tension between the Jewish settlement and neighboring Palestinians villages , whose men work in Barkan .
The community of 100 - plus families identifies itself as a national - religious community – a stream of Israeli society that includes serving in the army and participating in the larger political and social fabric – making them distinct from most ultra-Orthodox .
And the price is right : The Ovadiahs paid $ 292,000 for a 1,300 - square - foot , three - bedroom home .
A comparable property would cost at least triple in any of the outlying Tel Aviv neighborhoods where Moti and Vered both grew up .
" It 's a settlement lite , " Moti says somewhat jokingly .
" It 's not like moving to East Jerusalem , to the heart of an Arab neighborhood , or into Hebron .
We heard a lot of positive things about the area , came and looked , and just really loved it . "
Vered is less in love .
She 's not quite as enthusiastic about the location of her new home , mostly because – 20 miles from Tel Aviv and one checkpoint from the Green Line – it feels too far from the center of the country .
Her own mother , who still lives in a Tel Aviv suburb and is concerned about the safety of the area , avoids visiting .
Likewise , some friends wo n't visit .
" But everyone loves the whole bit about the big house and the yard , and the magical view , " Vered says , looking at her watch and then down the slope toward the nursery where she 's due to pick up Ishai in a few minutes .
She 's pregnant with their second child .
" I just want to live my life , " she shrugs .
" Ideology does n't interest me . "
But it does Moti .
After studying journalism , he 's been working as an aide to a Knesset member from the right - wing Yisrael Beytenu Party .
The party 's leader , Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , also happens to live in a settlement .
( Moti did n't vote for them , but cast his ballot for another right - wing party . )
" I do n't go to demonstrations ; I do n't believe in them , " says Moti , who identifies himself as a right - wing moderate .
" And it 's hard for me to believe that they 'll evacuate any of us , or that a Palestinian state is ever going to be formed , " he says .
" I do n't think the Palestinians have the ability to run a state now , as divided as they are .
And if an Israeli leader came home from negotiations with such a plan , I do n't think there will be enough of a majority for it to pass in the Knesset .
There 's no political solution :
We 'll say it 's all our land , they 'll say it 's all theirs , and we 'll never get anywhere . "
Outside , his street looks like a planned community anywhere : the look - alike homes with the perfect coat of paint , and the bare yard awaiting landscaping .
Then the street gives way to unfinished houses in progress that Peace Now – a left - wing Israeli group that keeps a vigilant eye on settlement growth – says have been built illegally .
Moti , though , is not worried ; he thinks the courts will reject Peace Now 's petition to have 15 of these houses destroyed .
" I had three priorities in choosing where to live , " he explains .
" The first was finding a good place to bring up kids .
The second was financial .
Third comes ideology , " he says .
" It 's in that order .
To think of only one of these is not the right approach to life .
It 's a mixed salad .
But I 'm also concerned that Vered be happy .
I think she will be . "
Vered , a cosmetician and manicurist , raises her shaped eyebrows and does n't answer .
It 's time to pick up Ishai .
OF 7.4 MILLION ISRAELI CITIZENS , the West Bank 's 300,000 settlers constitute 2.4 percent of the overall population .
Settlement leaders say more would move in if they could find the housing .
Their critics inside Israel see other reasons to stay away .
Why move one 's family to an area where one seems more likely to be a target of violence from the neighboring population – one that views you as a legitimate target of the occupation ?
Why put yourself in a reality where you have to pass through checkpoints as a matter of daily life ?
And who would sign up for the possibility of being forced out and made homeless by one 's own government – as 8,000 Gazan settlers were in 2005 – as part of a political decision ?
Ideology was what brought the first waves of settlers into the land Israel captured on the west bank of the Jordan River in the 1967 war , some of them keen to return to earlier settlements they 'd lost in the 1948 Arab - Israeli war that led to Israel 's establishment .
In the early 1970s , a socioreligious movement called Gush Emunim , or bloc of the faithful , drew to settlements people motivated by the concept that Israel 's success in 1967 was divinely inspired , that the Jewish people 's return to their biblical homeland signaled the coming of the messianic age .
While that worldview continues to attract some , the majority of today 's new arrivals come primarily for practical considerations .
" Around 1981 , many Israelis started moving out for better housing and the general environment – quality - of - life settlers – and that represents the majority who are coming now , " says Michael Feige , a sociologist and anthropologist at Ben-Gurion University and author of the recently published " Settling in the Hearts : Jewish Fundamentalism in the Occupied Territories . "
" Economically , it 's a good deal to go to the settlements .
It always has been , " he says .
But whereas moving to a settlement once meant living a slightly more precarious existence , it 's now becoming a largely safe , suburban one .
Settlements in commuting distance to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are particularly popular .
" There are places where the metropolis is moving east , " says Professor Feige .
So settlements feel so close for commuters that " people moving there do n't think they 're moving to the West Bank . "
More recently , he points out , even ultra-Orthodox Israelis have been moving to settlements for economic reasons more than for ideological ones .
The two largest settlements in the West Bank are now Modiin Illit and Beitar Illit , ultra-Orthodox minicities where growth last year was 9.3 percent and 8 percent respec - tively .
This brings with it a shift in how settlements figure in the Israeli psyche .
" The ideological tension today is much lower than it was 20 or 30 years ago , " notes Feige , " [ when ] it threw the whole future of Zionism and Israel 's raison d'être into question .
And today , it 's seen as just one issue .
After so many years of arguing on the subject , Israelis are tired of it . "
What 's more , says Ephraim Yaar , a pollster and analyst at Tel Aviv University , Israelis feel less certain about whether pulling out of the territory brings peace – particularly after the withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 , followed by a rain of low - tech Palestinian rockets on southern Israel .
" [ T ] his had a profound effect , including on those on the Israeli left .
There is a hardening of the position of Israelis , undoubtedly related to what happened in Gaza , " Professor Yaar says .
And yet , when questioned about the bigger picture , the majority of Israelis , he notes , support a two - state solution , along with the concomitant expectations of settlement evacuations .
" Broadly , the Israeli public would be willing to evacuate all the settlements that are outside a major block , provided the Palestinians would reciprocate . "
Tel Aviv University 's latest War & Peace Index , released Sept. 8 , found that 72 percent of Israelis believe the need to find a solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is " very urgent or moderately urgent . "
AND SO , AS THE CONFLICT CHURNS , people get married , have kids , start nesting .
To the Ovadiah , Allon , and Cohen families , the politics of where to live was secondary to space , affordability , and being close to family .
Buying homes in the settlement of Kiryat Netafim in the northern West Bank ( known in Israel as Samaria ) or in Tekoa in the southern West Bank ( known as Judea ) became a logical decision for them – not a radical one .
Their move to settlements is a choice being made by thousands more Israelis every year .
Netanyahu attributes most of the increase to " natural growth " – an increase due to the high birthrates among existing residents .
Since 2001 , Israeli government statistics show that natural growth is the largest driver of population increases .
But critics suggest that 's a cover for a building boom that is encouraging more Israelis to sink roots in land threatened to be lost to the creation of a Palestinian state .
The head of the Yesha settlers council , Daniel Dayan , says the growth of West Bank Israeli population is due to rapid population increase – couples having large families – and not because of a building boom .
" We do n't have enough houses to provide for natural growth , " he said in a meeting earlier this month with foreign reporters .
This lack of housing , he said , amounted to a " quiet expulsion " of young people who have to leave the settlements because they can't find houses there .
ONE OF THE FASTEST - GROWING SETTLEMENTS in the West Bank is Tekoa , which in 2008 grew by 11.6 percent .
That 's even more rapid growth than in the ultra-Orthodox settlements of Modiin Illit and Beitar Illit .
Tekoa , which appears in the Bible , is southeast of Bethlehem and has natural attractions :
It sits atop a hill that provides breathtaking views of the desert mountains and , on a clear day , of Jordan .
It also has man-made draws : a public swimming pool and an intentional progressive mix of religious and secular families – Israel 's main social divide .
Its official Orthodox rabbi has an unconventional habit of meeting with local Islamic figures , including members of Hamas .
Until recently , Tekoa was slightly isolated in the midst of Palestinian villages .
Settlers driving to Tekoa had a 40 - minute drive from Jerusalem that led them through two villages , where Palestinians would often stone their cars .
But a new road , opened last year , gets residents to Jerusalem in 15 minutes .
" Sometimes I find myself going into Jerusalem three times a day , " says Shelly Allon , an art therapist who grew up in Syracuse , N.Y. , and whose well - read American upbringing is evidenced by the copies of The New York Times Book Review lying around the house .
She and her husband , Jeff , an artist , had lived together in Israel for many years before returning to the US to live in Philadelphia for 11 years .
They returned to Jerusalem a year ago and discovered that an affordable home there to house them and most of their eight children – the youngest is 7 and the oldest , 22 , is a student at the University of Pennsylvania – proved impossible .
So they took the leap , buying a five - bedroom , multistory house for $ 210,000 – a quarter of the cost of an equivalent apartment in Jerusalem .
Shelly felt surprised that some of her Jerusalem friends were critical of her choice , and that some of her kids ' new friends were told there 'd be no West Bank play dates .
Her sister back in the US teased , " Have fun being a settler . "
" I had this moment of ' Wow , that 's how the world sees me , ' " Shelly says in a conversation in her airy , not - yet - unpacked living room , where she 's rounding up her kids to do back - to - school shopping .
" I came here for more space and a good community , but I had to realize that I was doing something politically that many people do n't agree with . "
Forced to give it more thought , she realized that her outlook did n't clash with living here : " I 'm not one that says we should get rid of the Arabs ; I so completely disagree with that attitude .
I 've always supported a two - state solution .
But I do n't think it 's really going to happen ....
[ I ]t became clear to me [ after the Gaza rocket attacks ] that giving away land and cutting back our borders is not the answer . "
One thing about the rapid growth in Tekoa is surprising .
It lies outside the security barrier , or separation wall , that Israel has been building since 2002 to keep suicide bombers out of Israeli cities .
The popular perception is that settlements beyond the wall are more likely to be evacuated in a peace deal , whereas those inside the wall would be annexed .
For that reason , buying a home in a settlement would seem to be risky business .
Anyone considering such a move knows that many of the 8,000 Gazan settlers evacuated in August 2005 are still living in temporary housing all over Israel .
SHLOMIT AND BOAZ COHEN , HOWEVER , say they 've hardly given their investment in a five - bedroom home in Tekoa a second thought .
" We 've never really talked about it , " says Boaz , a counselor at a school in a nearby settlement .
" I 'm a man of faith .
God will decide what he decides . "
Shlomit , a research psychologist , has a similar outlook : " It 's not that [ an evacuation ] could n't happen , but it 's not a question that occupies our thoughts . "
They have plenty else to be busy with – in particular , two toddler girls , and another child due in a few months .
They 're in the middle of trying to move in , but quite a bit of work is left to be done , which means negotiating with the team of Palestinian workers putting the final details on the house .
Shlomit grew up in nearby Efrat , a large established settlement where her parents and a host of siblings and cousins still live , and where she and her husband rented for three years waiting to find a house to buy .
As such , they 're part of the much disputed " natural growth " trend .
" It was very important for us to be close to our parents , " says Shlomit .
What does worry them is the threat of a total settlement freeze , including natural growth :
The Obama administration has insisted on a total freeze – a prerequisite Palestinians have set for renewing peace talks .
It 's clear that the US views all settlement growth as an impediment to peace .
" I do n't quite understand the point of a settlement freeze , " says Shlomit .
" There are so many people having kids and they need new classrooms .
People like us want to be near family .
To stop natural growth is impossible , and I hope Netanyahu wo n't give in to the pressure to do that . "
But there are expectations that a freeze is coming : Netanyahu says he has n't issued new tenders since his government came into power in March , but on Sept.
7 he gave permission for more than 450 new homes in various settlements .
About 2,500 places in 700 buildings already under construction will be exceptions to the freeze , which Netanyahu proposes to last six months .
Those with a permit in hand are rushing to start building before it 's too late .
" People are worried that if you do n't start now , all building will be stopped , " Shlomit says .
" And if you hurry up and start now , you have a chance that they 'll let you finish . " •
Police say a man wanted over the murder of a self - described vampire and male prostitute in Melbourne six years ago may have fled interstate and assumed a new identity .
A reward of $ 1 million is on offer for help finding Mark Adrian Perry , wanted over the murder of Shane Chartres - Abbott .
Mr Abbott was shot dead in Reservoir in 2003 on the day he was due to face court over a violent rape .
He was accused of leaving a woman lying unconscious in a South Yarra hotel room after raping her and biting off part of her tongue .
A man was given a life sentence for Mr Abbott 's murder last year but police have now issued an arrest warrant for Perry , who will also face a murder charge .
Perry is the former boyfriend of the woman Mr Abbott allegedly raped and assaulted , and detectives reportedly believe Mr Perry ordered Mr Abbott 's execution .
Deputy Commissioner Ken Jones says a number of people know Perry 's whereabouts and police are keen to close the case on the killing .
" [ Mr Abbott ] was murdered in broad daylight on a street and you imagine the collateral damage that could have been inflicted on families around that area at the time , " he said .
It is believed Perry is living interstate and he has been seen in Queensland , the Northern Territory and Western Australia since he left Victoria in 2007 .
Deputy Commissioner Jones says a number of people know where Perry is .
" They know his movements and his whereabouts and I would urge them to come forward , " he said .
Mr Abbott 's murder was at the centre of a 2007 police integrity inquiry into allegations high - ranking police officers leaked details about the investigation .
There was also an allegation that a police officer gave his address to a hitman .
Anyone with information on Perry 's whereabouts can call CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000 .
Tom ,
How old are you ??
If you are under the age of 19 , what the heck are you thinking .
You know if you get this girl pregnant your lives would be ruined , her droppping out and parent comming after you , as well as you could get a std , herpies , or any other stuff from her .
Condoms can break so wait til your older if you are already older than dont listen to above statement
What is your rash is contagous oral can go in her mouth as well ...
The best thing to do is not have any type of sex , I hate people who have sex before marrige its discusting and horrible .
If you have never had sex , then why are you anting to think she would do this ??
How long have you been going out ?
IF your still in school shame on you , if you are just wanting to do a one night stand shame on you again and if you havent known her long at all less than 4 years your just plain dumb .
Now if your in your 23 or older , than just put oinment on it and just because someone was taken to a resteraunt , of all wendys doesn mean she is going to do anything ...
Introduction
This is the follow - up post to my GitHub Contest Recap post that I promised .
As mentioned , I submitted two entries for the GitHub contest , starting with Ruby and then rewriting in Java .
This post summarizes why I ultimately dropped Ruby in favor of Java for this particular task .
I apologize for its length , but it is divided into discrete sections and can be read in chunks without great loss of continuity .
Things that Worked Well with Ruby
Very quick and easy text processing
Overall , Ruby excelled at the tasks I knew it would excel at .
Principally , I was able to write fairly clean code that produced results in short order .
Its text processing capabilities are solid and were a big boon in processing the data files supplied as part of the contest .
Likewise , generating a results file was a trivial matter .
Class re-opening
I generally shy away from monkey - patching unless absolutely necessary , but having the ability to do it easily is always nice .
I found myself working around limitations in AI4R , a Ruby - based artificial intelligence library , and adding basic statistics functions to Array .
Being able to call [ x , y , z ]. mean or [t , u , v ] .sum was an extremely concise way to represent terms in some of my equations .
Things that Did Not Work Well with Ruby
I had thought that I understood Ruby fairly well , but this project taught me otherwise .
Much like Java and the JVM , there are a lot of subtleties in Ruby I was either blissfully unaware of or have n’t had to worry about in any great detail .
From the seemingly inane , such as the three different methods of object equality , to the surprising , such as the lack of a Float : : Infinity constant .
Marshalling circular relationships
One of my earliest setbacks was related to marshalling .
Given that I was dealing with processed datasets and a large number of objects , I thought marshalling the data to and from disk would be an appropriate thing to do in order to save start - up time .
I had written my code such that a Watcher class and a Repository class maintained bi-directional references to one another .
By using a set for the associations , I avoided creating infinite loops when establishing the relationships .
However , the marshalling library does not know how to deal with circular references .
Thus , an attempt to marshal resulted in an infinite loop .
This seems quite odd to me as the problem of persisting a graph of objects is not intractable and thus I consider the limitation to be a bug in the marshalling library .
To be fair , Ruby does provide means of manually controlling marshalling , but I did not pursue this path .
Ultimately , I was using Ruby because it was supposed to make my development faster .
Getting drawn into the nuances of marshalling was something I did n’t have time for and had no interest in doing .
Creating large number of objects
An early design decision I made was to keep as much data in memory as possible .
This was because I was planning on running a large number of computations and wanted data access to be as quick as possible ; faulting in from disk or DB would have been too slow .
A consequence of that decision was that in my very first pass at the program I had 750,000 objects in memory .
I never grew significantly beyond that because I managed to make the garbage collector in MRI segfault several times .
For about a week I tried to clean up my memory space : I dropped the bi-directional relationships between a watcher and a repository ; I removed memoized calculations ; and I did away with local copies of data at both the method and instance levels in favor of effectively global data .
Essentially , I tossed away any legibility my code once had .
In the end , however , the program was able to run without crashing the garbage collector , albeit several multitudes slower .
This prompted me to attempt profiling the application .
My first attempt at profiling was with perftools.rb , which uses Google ’s profiling tools .
I had read good things about it from people that I generally hold in high regard .
Alas , I was unable to run it .
On both my MacOS X 10.5.7 laptop using prefixed Gentoo ’s Ruby ( 1.8.7p174 ) and Ubuntu 9.04 ’s Ruby ( 1.8.7p72 ) the profiler segfaulted almost immediately .
I believe this had to do with the large object graph , but the error message was n’t terribly helpful and I had little interest in analyzing the coredump .
Profiling with ruby - prof
Having failed to accomplish anything with profile.rb , I fell back to the venerable ruby - prof .
This profiler worked , but was extremely slow .
After several hours of running , I finally relented and sent it a SIGTERM .
I was pleasantly surprised to see that it maintained intermediary stats and output them upon application exit .
Unfortunately , it had n’t moved beyond my initial data loading code , so the reported information was of limited value .
Memoizing at class method level
At one point my back - of - the - napkin calculation was that I was performing 13 MM point comparisons in my instance space , many of them duplicating internal computations .
This was an easy target for optimization just through caching , so I decided to try out the memoize gem .
The general lack of code examples for it leads me to believe that it is not in widespread use .
All examples I found , including the one in “ The Ruby Way , ” use the library outside of any class structure .
After searching news groups for a while and studying the source , I managed to get memoization going for instance methods on an object .
However , I was unable to figure out how to get the library to work on class methods without code modification ; another irritating setback .
Memcache only storing 1MB files
Having had issues with the MRI garbage collector and hoping to save costly calculations between data runs , I turned to the quintessential memory caching tool , memcached .
I was running version 1.4.0 , which sports a new binary protocol for compressed communication .
Although I was connecting to localhost , I wanted to reduce latency as much as possible .
Unfortunately , the memcache - client library had not yet been updated to use the new protocol , forcing me to use the older , less efficient protocol .
As it turned out , fretting over the application protocol was not time well spent ; unbeknownst to me , memcache has a 1 MB limit on the size of an object being stored and I was storing rather large hashes .
Although the limit can be configured at compilation time , preliminary research indicated this was not a recommended practice .
Even if it worked , the memcache - client lib has the 1 MB limit hardcoded to avoid network traffic for large data , so the gem would also have to be patched and recompiled .
Alternative Ruby Implementations
Throughout the course my Ruby implementation I used three of the major Ruby implementations .
I began with MRI ( 1.8.7p174 ) and moved to YARV ( 1.9.1p129 ) and ended up with JRuby 1.3.1 ( 1.8.6p287 compatible ) .
Most of the discussion up until now has focused on my use of MRI .
The following sections describe my experiences with alternative Ruby implementations .
YARV
I was excited at the prospect of being able to use Ruby 1.9 for a project .
My contest entry had a small number of dependencies to cope with so I thought my potentials for failure were limited .
Generally , things seemed to work well with YARV .
I definitely saw a speed improvement over MRI .
However , the ruby debug gem has not been updated for 1.9 .
Not having a debugger is not acceptable for development , so I had to abandon this path .
JRuby
After having experienced issues with MRI & Ruby 1.9 , JRuby ended up being my runtime of choice .
It was remarkably faster than MRI and did not suffer from the garbage collection issues .
Likewise , it had the full debugger support that Ruby 1.9 lacked .
However , there were several issues I ran into with JRuby .
Breaking the debugger with optimizations turned on
In order to maximize execution speed , I used the –fast flag , which performs some bytecode optimizations especially suited for Fixnum operations at the cost of compatibility with Ruby ’s stacktrace format .
Generally , this was acceptable because I could largely deduce what a problem was by unraveling the stacktrace by inspection .
The problem is that the Ruby debugger apparently relies quite heavily on its stacktrace format .
I was astonished by this finding , but I was unable to use the debugger until the -- fast flag was removed , forcing me to have to bounce from one to the other .
Discovering the source of massive heap use was difficult due to the lack of profiling tools for JRuby .
None of the standard Ruby ones seemed to work at all .
I tried to use YourKit for Java , which technically worked , but the class names did not match the Ruby ones and I think I was profiling more JRuby proper rather than my application .
Unable to make much use of the results , I abandoned the profiling effort and resorted to manual code analysis , something humans are notoriously bad at .
Debugger issues
I wrote most of my Ruby implementation using the RubyMine IDE .
RubyMine has an integrated graphical debugger , which worked fairly well .
I found that often , however , the debugger would detach itself from the process forcing me to start debugging from scratch .
It appears that this may be a problem with the ruby - debug - ide gem .
I noticed that the issue occurred more frequently with the 1.5 beta of RubyMine than it did with the stable 1.1.1 release , so I suspect it may have to do with RubyMine itself to some degree .
I also found it happened much more frequently with JRuby than it did with MRI .
The Switch to Java
Unhappy with the progress I had made with my Ruby - based contest entry , I made the decision to port the whole project over to Java .
It was something I was extremely remiss to do , but ultimately I wanted to see the performance impact would be .
Static type checking
Dealing with generics in Java is an abomination , but static type checking was of enormous use when porting the Ruby code over to Java .
One of the biggest headaches I had in Ruby was related to my used of the property named “ id . ”
When I had a rich object model , it was n’t a problem , but when I had to decompose that model I ran into all sorts problems because every object in Ruby has a default “ id ” property .
It became hard to keep track of what were domain model objects and what were simple Strings .
When porting over to Java , the distinction was quite clear and the IDE let me know immediately if I was using the wrong type .
Granted it was more verbose , but when running an application with long runtime characteristics , relying on runtime type checking can be a brutal cycle of run - wait - fix - repeat .
Fast execution
My initial data load went down from about 2.5 minutes in JRuby ( the fastest Ruby implementation I tried ) to about 8 seconds in Java .
The gain was so great that I was convinced I had made a mistake somewhere .
Fortunately , I had a test suite to help indicate otherwise .
My best explanation for the difference in execution times is that Java must handle object creation much faster than JRuby can , despite both of them running on the JVM .
All this particular section of code did was iterate through the data files and create my watcher and repository representations .
That is to say , at this stage no “ real work ” had yet been performed .
Handling large object graph easily
During my translation from Ruby to Java I migrated back to a rich object model .
Whereas I had to break down true bi-directional associations into hash lookups just to make my Ruby implementation run , Java could handle my full object graph quite easily .
As a result , the code was much more straightforward .
Additionally , I was able to cache values in memory judiciously without eating up the entire heap or breaking the garbage collector .
This helped in making the overall solution faster .
Built - in thread pooling with producer / consumer model
In my Ruby implementation I wrote my own poor man ’s thread pool , used in conjunction with JRuby ’s native thread pool .
The former allowed me to do concurrent execution of point comparisons while the latter allowed me to reuse discarded native threads .
While my pool did work , I did n’t abstract it very well and had to drain it frequently lest I ran out of stack space .
I ’m still amazed I could n’t find anything in the Ruby standard library or even a widely used third party gem for thread pooling .
While constructing threads in Java is not as nice as in Ruby , Java 5 introduced a set of concurrency APIs that remove a lot of the pain with thread management .
Creating a thread pool and using a producer / consumer model backed by the pool was trivial to do .
It was a small thing , but it meant I did n’t have to worry about managing the pool in my code and I had a high degree of confidence that the JDK ’s implementation was correct .
The JVM ’s native threads scheduling on multiple cores and the easy - to - use thread pool helped increase the throughput of my contest entry .
The JVM makes it very easy to profile a running Java application .
I used YourKit for Java on my entry early on when it felt slow .
I found a few problems areas and addressed them , allowing the program to run an order of magnitude faster .
This whole process did n’t take much more than a couple hours in contrast to the many hours I spent , with minimal results , trying to do the same thing by inspection with my Ruby implementation .
Debugger
Debugging applications in Java is quite simple .
The tools for doing so have been around a long time and are generally quite solid .
I used IntelliJ IDEA as my primary development tool for the Java - based solution and relied on its graphical debugger for solving various problems .
Not having a debugger that disconnects from its process should be a given , but happened all too frequently with RubyMine & JRuby .
Conclusion
After three days of porting , my first run of the Java implementation yielded a 36 % prediction accuracy and ran in less than 10 minutes .
My best Ruby implementation , after weeks of development , only had a 31 % prediction accuracy and took almost 7 hours to compute it .
With a few more hours of work the Java implementation broke 40 % accuracy and ran in less than 3 minutes .
Unfortunately , at this point I became ill and by the time I recovered the contest had ended .
My takeaway from the project is that Ruby is a great language hampered by a terrible execution environment .
When writing Rails apps , this usually is n’t a problem .
I ’d even go so far as to say for most types of applications it should n’t be a problem .
For anything that ’s heavily CPU bound or dealing with large object graphs , however , I do n’t think Ruby is a suitable option .
In these cases , Ruby may best serve as a rapid prototyping tool .
By writing the code in Ruby first I had a clear approach to use when translating to Java .
This was the first Java project I had written start to finish in a while .
Most of my Java work is on existing codebases .
I was pleasantly surprised to see how few issues I had with the maven build system and it was nice to have a real profiler at my disposal ; for much of my Ruby work I must rely on a hosted service for my profiling needs , which is less than ideal .
The Java language was n’t even that bad to write in .
I ’m convinced that if there were easier syntax for collection access and proper language property support that writing in Java may even be a pleasant experience .
It seems Ruby and Java have become the two representatives for the dynamic versus static language debate .
It would be nice if some of the vitriol could be removed from the discussion and the two languages evaluated on their merits for particular tasks .
It should go without saying that every language has its place .
This exercise has given me a clearer understanding of where Ruby should and should not be used .
It also helped reassert to me what Java ’s strengths and weaknesses are .

Scary .
Like aliens .
That is how Kerry Mastera remembers her twins , Max and Wes , in the traumatic days after they were born nine weeks early .
Machines forced air into the infants ’ lungs , pushing their tiny chests up and down in artificial heaves .
Tubes delivered nourishment .
They were so small her husband ’s wedding band fit around an entire baby foot .
Having a family had been an elusive goal for Jeff and Kerry Mastera , a blur of more than two years , dozens of doctor visits and four tries with a procedure called intrauterine insemination , all failures .
In one year , the Masteras spent 23 percent of their income on fertility treatments .
The couple had nearly given up , but last year they decided to try once more , this time through in - vitro fertilization .
Pregnancy quickly followed , as did the Mastera boys , who arrived at the Swedish Medical Center in Denver on Feb. 16 at 3 pounds , 1 ounce apiece .
Kept alive in a neonatal intensive care unit , Max remained in the hospital 43 days ;
Wes came home in 51 .
By the time it was over , medical bills for the boys exceeded $ 1.2 million .
Eight months later , the extraordinary effort seems worth it to the Masteras , who live in Aurora , Colo .
The babies are thriving and developing their own personalities 
Wes , the noisy and demanding ; Max , the quiet and serious .
Like many other twins conceived through in - vitro fertilization , the Mastera boys will go down in the record books as a success  both for the fertility clinic that helped create them and the neonatologists who nursed them to health .
“ We believe the existing program is a fine program , ” he said .
The panel issued a 12 - page summary last week , and Mr. Augustine said it would try to complete the report this month .
Committee members agreed with Mr. Augustine on a central conclusion of the panel : NASA needs about $ 3 billion more a year  increasing the spending over the next decade on human spaceflight to $ 130 billion from $ 100 billion  or it will not be able to accomplish the goals of Constellation or any alternative program .
Without an increase , Mr. Augustine said , NASA could continue to operate the International Space Station and develop some new technology , but it would not get out of Earth orbit for the foreseeable future .
“ It will be a program that will inspire very few people , ” he said .
A smaller increase of $ 1.5 billion a year was also insufficient , the panel concluded .
In addition , it said that none of the options appreciably shortens the gap between the retirement of the shuttles  when the United States will rely on Russia for transportation to and from the International Space Station  and the development of the Ares I .
The Ares , the first of the Constellation rockets , will not be ready for use until at least 2015 , and the panel predicted that the schedule would slip to 2017 .
Mr. Augustine , who spent two hours before the House committee , will be questioned by the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee on Wednesday .
Also testifying to the House committee on Tuesday were Michael D. Griffin , the former NASA administrator who stepped down in January with the change in administrations , and Joseph W. Dyer , a retired vice admiral who is chairman of the aerospace advisory panel at NASA .
Colin Powell and Lessons of My Lai In an Aug. 28 editorial , The New York Times applauded a belated “ note of personal regret ” from former Lt. William Calley for his role in the massacre of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai in 1968 .
But neither the Times nor any other leading U.S. news outlet has ever suggested that remorse might also be due from Colin Powell , who as a young Army major helped cover up the crime .
Email
Printer friendly Powell ’s role in rebuffing an early appeal from a GI for an investigation of Americal Division abuses of Vietnamese -- encompassing My Lai -- was an important early marker in Powell ’s career as he climbed the ladder of Pentagon and Washington success by never standing up for a principle that made a superior uncomfortable .
That pattern continued through the Iran - Contra scandal in the 1980s and culminated in the deadly falsehoods that Powell presented to the United Nations in 2003 justifying the invasion of Iraq .
For his part , Calley told a Kiwanis Club gathering in Columbus , Georgia , that “ there is not a day that goes by that I do not feel remorse for what happened that day in My Lai . …
I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed , for their families , for the American soldiers involved and their families . ”
Calley ’s remorse may be decades overdue but at least he has paid a price for his role as the senior officer on the ground during the massacre .
By contrast , Powell , who helped keep the slaughter under wraps several months after the fact , has enjoyed a long career of endless praise as an American hero .
In view of Calley ’s recent remorse and the Times editorial , we are republishing below a part of a series on Powell ’s real record that I co-authored with Norman Solomon in 1996 .
The story deals with Powell ’s two tours in Vietnam .
( For more details on Powell 's biography , see the book , Neck Deep . )
Early Days in Vietnam On Jan. 17 , 1963 , in South Vietnam 's monsoon season , U.S. Army Capt .
Colin Powell jumped from a military helicopter into a densely forested combat zone of the A Shau Valley , not far from the Laotian border .
Carrying an M - 2 carbine , Capt .
Powell was starting his first -- and only -- combat assignment .
He was the new adviser to a 400 - man unit of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) .
Across jungle terrain , these South Vietnamese government troops were arrayed against a combined force of North Vietnamese regulars and local anti-government guerrillas known as the Viet Cong .
The 25 - year - old Powell was arriving at a pivotal moment in the Vietnam War .
To forestall a communist victory , President John F. Kennedy had dispatched teams of Green Beret advisers to assist the ARVN , a force suffering from poor discipline , ineffective tactics and bad morale .
Already , many U.S. advisers , most notably the legendary Col. John Paul Vann , were voicing concerns about the ARVN 's brutality toward civilians .
Vann feared that the dominant counterinsurgency strategy of destroying rural villages and forcibly relocating inhabitants while hunting down enemy forces was driving the people into the arms of the Viet Cong .
But as Colin Powell arrived , he was untainted by these worries .
He was a gung - ho young Army officer with visions of glory .
He brimmed with trust in the wisdom of his superiors .
Capt .
Powell also felt the deepest sympathy for the ARVN troops under his command , but only a cold contempt for the enemy .
Soon after his arrival , Powell and his ARVN unit left for a protracted patrol that fought leeches as well as Viet Cong ambushes .
From the soggy jungle brush , the Viet Cong would strike suddenly against the advancing government soldiers .
Often invisible to Powell and his men , the VC would inflict a few casualties and slip back into the jungles .
In My American Journey , Powell recounted his reaction when he spotted his first dead Viet Cong .
" He lay on his back , gazing up at us with sightless eyes , " Powell wrote .
" I felt nothing , certainly not sympathy .
I had seen too much death and suffering on our side to care anything about what happened on theirs . "
While success against the armed enemy was rare , Powell 's ARVN unit punished the civilian population systematically .
As the soldiers marched through mountainous jungle , they destroyed the food and the homes of the region 's Montagnards , who were suspected of sympathizing with the Viet Cong .
Old women would cry hysterically as their ancestral homes and worldly possessions were consumed by fire .
" We burned down the thatched huts , starting the blaze with Ronson and Zippo lighters , " Powell recalled .
" Why were we torching houses and destroying crops ?
Ho Chi Minh had said the people were like the sea in which his guerrillas swam .
...
We tried to solve the problem by making the whole sea uninhabitable .
In the hard logic of war , what difference did it make if you shot your enemy or starved him to death ? "
For nearly six months , Powell and his ARVN unit slogged through the jungles , searching for Viet Cong and destroying villages .
Then while on one patrol , Powell fell victim to a Viet Cong booby trap .
He stepped on a punji stake , a dung - poisoned bamboo spear that had been buried in the ground .
The stake pierced Powell 's boot and quickly infected the young soldier 's right foot .
The foot swelled , turned purple and forced his evacuation by helicopter to Hue for treatment .
Although Powell 's recovery from the foot infection was swift , his combat days were over .
He stayed in Hue , reassigned to the operations staff of ARVN division headquarters .
As part of his work , he handled intelligence data and oversaw a local airfield .
By late autumn 1963 , Powell 's first Vietnam tour ended .
On his return to the United States , Powell did not join Vann and other early American advisers in warning the nation about the self - defeating counterinsurgency strategies .
In 1963 , Vann carried his prescient concerns back to a Pentagon that was not ready to listen to doubters .
Then , when his objections fell on deaf ears , Vann resigned his commission and sacrificed a promising military career .
In contrast , Powell recognized that his early service in Vietnam put him on a fast track for military success .
He signed up for a nine - month Infantry Officer Advanced Course that trained company commanders .
In May 1965 , Powell finished third in a class of 200 and was the top - ranked infantryman .
A year later , he became an instructor .
In 1966 , as the numbers of U.S. servicemen in Vietnam swelled , Powell received a promotion to major , making him a field - grade officer before his 30th birthday .
In 1968 , Powell continued to impress his superiors by graduating second in his class at Fort Leavenworth 's Command and General Staff College , a prestigious school regarded as an essential way station for future Army generals .
Recognizing Powell as an emerging " water - walker " who needed more seasoning in the field , the Army dispatched Powell to a command position back in Vietnam .
But on his second tour , Powell would not be slogging through remote jungles .
On July 27 , 1968 , he arrived at an outpost at Duc Pho to serve as an executive officer .
Then , to the north , at the Americal headquarters in Chu Lai , division commander Maj.
Gen. Charles Gettys saw a favorable mention of Powell in the Army Times .
Gettys plucked Powell from Duc Pho and installed him on the general 's own staff at Chu Lai .
Gettys jumped the young major ahead of more senior officers and made him the G - 3 officer in charge of operations and planning .
The appointment made " me the only major filling that role in Vietnam , " Powell wrote in his memoirs .
But history again was awaiting Colin Powell .
The Americal Division was already deep into some of the cruelest fighting of the Vietnam War .
The " drain - the - sea " strategy that Powell had witnessed near the Laotian border continued to lead American forces into harsh treatment of Vietnamese civilians .
Though it was still a secret when Powell arrived at Chu Lai , Americal troops had committed an act that would stain forever the reputation of the U.S. Army .
As Major Powell settled into his new assignment , a scandal was waiting to unfold .
My Lai On March 16 , 1968 , a bloodied unit of the Americal Division stormed into a hamlet known as My Lai 4 .
With military helicopters circling overhead , revenge - seeking American soldiers rousted Vietnamese civilians -- mostly old men , women and children -- from their thatched huts and herded them into the village 's irrigation ditches .
As the round - up continued , some Americans raped the girls .
Then , under orders from junior officers on the ground , soldiers began emptying their M - 16s into the terrified peasants .
Some parents used their bodies futilely to shield their children from the bullets .
Soldiers stepped among the corpses to finish off the wounded .
The slaughter raged for four hours .
A total of 347 Vietnamese , including babies , died in the carnage .
But there also were American heroes that day in My Lai .
Some soldiers refused to obey the direct orders to kill and some risked their lives to save civilians from the murderous fire .
A pilot named Hugh Clowers Thompson Jr. from Stone Mountain , Ga. , was furious at the killings he saw happening on the ground .
He landed his helicopter between one group of fleeing civilians and American soldiers in pursuit .
Thompson ordered his helicopter door gunner to shoot the Americans if they tried to harm the Vietnamese .
After a tense confrontation , the soldiers backed off .
Later , two of Thompson 's men climbed into one ditch filled with corpses and pulled out a three - year - old boy whom they flew to safety .
Several months later , the Americal 's brutality would become a moral test for Major Powell , too .
A letter had been written by a young specialist fourth class named Tom Glen , who had served in an Americal mortar platoon and was nearing the end of his Army tour .
In the letter to Gen. Creighton Abrams , the commander of all U.S. forces in Vietnam , Glen accused the Americal division of routine brutality against civilians .
Glen 's letter was forwarded to the Americal headquarters at Chu Lai where it landed on Major Powell 's desk .
" The average GI 's attitude toward and treatment of the Vietnamese people all too often is a complete denial of all our country is attempting to accomplish in the realm of human relations , " Glen wrote .
" Far beyond merely dismissing the Vietnamese as ' slopes ' or ' gooks , ' in both deed and thought , too many American soldiers seem to discount their very humanity ; and with this attitude inflict upon the Vietnamese citizenry humiliations , both psychological and physical , that can have only a debilitating effect upon efforts to unify the people in loyalty to the Saigon government , particularly when such acts are carried out at unit levels and thereby acquire the aspect of sanctioned policy . "
Glen 's letter contended that many Vietnamese were fleeing from Americans who “ for mere pleasure , fire indiscriminately into Vietnamese homes and without provocation or justification shoot at the people themselves . ”
Gratuitous cruelty was also being inflicted on Viet Cong suspects , Glen reported .
“ Fired with an emotionalism that belies unconscionable hatred , and armed with a vocabulary consisting of ' You VC , ' soldiers commonly ' interrogate ' by means of torture that has been presented as the particular habit of the enemy .
Severe beatings and torture at knife point are usual means of questioning captives or of convincing a suspect that he is , indeed , a Viet Cong . ...
“ It would indeed be terrible to find it necessary to believe that an American soldier that harbors such racial intolerance and disregard for justice and human feeling is a prototype of all American national character ; yet the frequency of such soldiers lends credulity to such beliefs .
...
“ What has been outlined here I have seen not only in my own unit , but also in others we have worked with , and I fear it is universal .
If this is indeed the case , it is a problem which cannot be overlooked , but can through a more firm implementation of the codes of MACV ( Military Assistance Command Vietnam ) and the Geneva Conventions , perhaps be eradicated . "
In 1995 , when we questioned Glen about his letter , he said he had heard second - hand about the My Lai massacre , though he did not mention it specifically .
The massacre was just one part of the abusive pattern that had become routine in the division , he said .
Powell 's Response
The letter 's troubling allegations were not well received at Americal headquarters .
Major Powell undertook the assignment to review Glen 's letter , but did so without questioning Glen or assigning anyone else to talk with him .
Powell simply accepted a claim from Glen 's superior officer that Glen was not close enough to the front lines to know what he was writing about , an assertion Glen denies .
After that cursory investigation , Powell drafted a response on Dec. 13 , 1968 .
He admitted to no pattern of wrongdoing .
Powell claimed that U.S. soldiers in Vietnam were taught to treat Vietnamese courteously and respectfully .
The Americal troops also had gone through an hour - long course on how to treat prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions , Powell noted .
" There may be isolated cases of mistreatment of civilians and POWs , " Powell wrote in 1968 .
But " this by no means reflects the general attitude throughout the Division . "
Indeed , Powell 's memo faulted Glen for not complaining earlier and for failing to be more specific in his letter .
" In direct refutation of this [ Glen 's ] portrayal , " Powell concluded , " is the fact that relations between Americal soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent . "
Powell 's findings , of course , were false , though they were exactly what his superiors wanted to hear .
It would take another Americal hero , an infantryman named Ron Ridenhour , to piece together the truth about the atrocity at My Lai .
After returning to the United States , Ridenhour interviewed Americal comrades who had participated in the massacre .
On his own , Ridenhour compiled this shocking information into a report and forwarded it to the Army inspector general .
The IG 's office conducted an aggressive official investigation , in marked contrast to Powell 's review .
Confirming Ridenhour 's report , the Army finally faced the horrible truth .
Courts martial were held against officers and enlisted men who were implicated in the murder of the My Lai civilians .
But Powell 's peripheral role in the My Lai cover - up did not slow his climb up the Army 's ladder .
After the scandal broke , Powell pleaded ignorance about the actual My Lai massacre .
Luckily for Powell , Glen 's letter also disappeared into the National Archives -- to be unearthed only years later by British journalists Michael Bilton and Kevin Sims for their book , Four Hours in My Lai .
In his best - selling memoir , Powell did not mention his brush - off of Tom Glen 's complaint .
Powell did include , however , another troubling recollection that belied his 1968 official denial of Glen 's allegation that American soldiers " without provocation or justification shoot at the people themselves . "
After a brief mention of the My Lai massacre in My American Journey , Powell penned a partial justification of the Americal 's brutality .
In a chilling passage , Powell explained the routine practice of murdering unarmed male Vietnamese .
" I recall a phrase we used in the field , MAM , for military - age male , " Powell wrote .
" If a helo spotted a peasant in black pajamas who looked remotely suspicious , a possible MAM , the pilot would circle and fire in front of him .
If he moved , his movement was judged evidence of hostile intent , and the next burst was not in front , but at him .
" Brutal ?
Maybe so .
But an able battalion commander with whom I had served at Gelnhausen [ West Germany ] , Lt. Col .
Walter Pritchard , was killed by enemy sniper fire while observing MAMs from a helicopter .
And Pritchard was only one of many .
The kill - or - be - killed nature of combat tends to dull fine perceptions of right and wrong . "
While it 's certainly true that combat is brutal and judgments can be clouded by fear , the mowing down of unarmed civilians in cold blood does not constitute combat .
It is murder and , indeed , a war crime .
Neither can the combat death of a fellow soldier be cited as an excuse to murder civilians .
Disturbingly , that was precisely the rationalization that the My Lai killers cited in their own defense .
But returning home from Vietnam a second time in 1969 , Powell already had begun to prove himself the consummate team player .
Those skills were tested again when Powell was drawn into another Vietnam controversy involving the killing of civilians .
In a court martial proceeding , Powell sided with an Americal Division general who was accused by the Army of murdering unarmed civilians while flying over Quang Ngai province .
Helicopter pilots who flew Brig . Gen. John W. Donaldson had alleged that the general gunned down civilian Vietnamese almost for sport .
In an interview , a senior investigator from the Donaldson case told us that two of the Vietnamese victims were an old man and an old woman who were shot to death while bathing .
Though long retired -- and quite elderly himself -- the Army investigator still spoke with a raw disgust about the events of a quarter century earlier .
He requested anonymity before talking about the behavior of senior Americal officers .
" They used to bet in the morning how many people they could kill -- old people , civilians , it did n't matter , " the investigator said .
" Some of the stuff would curl your hair . "
For eight months in Chu Lai during 1968 - 69 , Powell had worked with Donaldson and apparently developed a great respect for this superior officer .
When the Army charged Donaldson with murder on June 2 , 1971 , Powell rose in the general 's defense .
Powell submitted an affidavit dated Aug. 10 , 1971 , which lauded Donaldson as " an aggressive and courageous brigade commander . "
Powell did not specifically refer to the murder allegations , but added that helicopter forays in Vietnam had been an " effective means of separating hostiles from the general population . "
Mysterious Interview Powell apparently was questioned by Army authorities about his knowledge of Donaldson 's alleged atrocities .
But his answers may be lost to history .
In his memoirs , Powell provides a brief -- and incorrect -- description of the 1971 interview in the context of the My Lai massacre .
" I was serving in the Washington area , and was called to appear before a board of inquiry conducted by Lt. Gen. William Ray Peers at Fort Belvoir , Virginia , " Powell wrote .
" The board wanted me to give a picture of fighting conditions in the Batangan Peninsula in 1968 [ where the My Lai massacre had occurred ] .
I knew it had been a hellhole , a rough piece of territory inhabited by VC sympathizers . "
Powell 's account of the interview is itself a bit of a mystery .
While it 's true that in 1971 , a commission headed by Gen .
Peers was investigating the My Lai cover - up , all the Peers interviews were conducted at the Pentagon , not at Fort Belvoir .
Also , by 1971 , the Army knew a great deal about the " fighting conditions in the Batangan Peninsula " and would not need the opinion of an officer who arrived months after the My Lai massacre .
Further , when we examined the Peers Commission records at the National Archives branch at Suitland , Md. , we found no indication that Colin Powell ever had been interviewed by the board .
There was , however , an investigation at Fort Belvoir conducted in the same time frame by the Army 's criminal investigation unit .
It was examining the murder allegations against Powell 's friend , Gen. Donaldson .
The retired Army investigator told us that Powell was questioned in that case .
But the investigator said Powell volunteered little knowledge about the atrocities .
The investigator doubted that any record was made of the interview .
Nevertheless , the investigator claimed that " we had him [ Donaldson ] dead to rights , " with the testimony of two helicopter pilots who had flown Donaldson on his shooting expeditions .
Still , the investigation collapsed after the two pilot - witnesses were transferred to another Army base and apparently came under pressure from military superiors .
The two pilots withdrew their testimony , and the Army dropped all charges against Donaldson .
" John Donaldson was a cover - up specialist , " the old investigator growled .
While thousands of other Vietnam veterans joined the anti-war movement and denounced the brutality of the war , Powell held his tongue .
To this day , Powell has avoided criticizing the Vietnam War other than to complain that the politicians should not have restrained the military high command .
With the My Lai cloud dissipated , Major Powell 's career advanced smartly .
Powell often says he learned many lessons from Vietnam .
One lesson he does n't mention is that a military bureaucrat succeeds best by sidestepping controversy and keeping quiet when superiors screw up .
As the years unfolded , that proved to be a very valuable lesson indeed .

Because the majority of advertising materials in the USSR were of a political propagandizing nature , the many examples of simple commercial advertising are often overlooked .
These ads for goods and services were pervasive , with many having been published during the New Economic Politics ( NEP ) period ( 1921 -1928 ) .
Later on , various government enterprises produced their own advertisement campaigns .
Word of mouth advertising campaigns were also spread less formally by private masters and “ hack workers ” while radio ads were fairly common .
While many of the ad slogans produced in this era were rather uniform , ( All smoke the certain brand ’s cigarettes , Ask for that everywhere , Eat , Drink , Keep , Fly … ) , there are some rather interesting if not entertaining quips such as , “ Nowhere but in Mosselprom ” , “ You are not a USSR citizen if you are n’t a Dobrolet ’s stockholder ” , and the everlasting slogan of Mayakovsky : “ Better pacifiers do n’t exist that ’s why I ’ll suck them till I get old ” .
These ads present a wonderful collection of the type and style of art that was produced under the creative repression of the times .

[ There 's actually a lot of Gamasutra content we do n't reprint , but here 's one I felt was very GSW - able .
After Titan Quest dev Iron
Lore shut down , ex-employees formed Crate Entertainment .
Now , the small studio has shelved a console RPG to focus a Diablo - style PC game , and founder Arthur Bruno tells our own Kris Graft why going indie -r works better . ]
The founders of Crate Entertainment are nothing if not adaptive .
Founded in 2008 by Arthur Bruno and Eric Campanella , Crate resulted from the collapse of Titan Quest developer Iron Lore Entertainment , where Bruno and Campanella respectively served as lead designer and art director , working on the PC - only action RPG .
The new , small studio had a big idea -- purchase the rights to Iron Lore 's next project , the console - based RPG Black Legion , and find a publisher .
Turns out that original plan did not come to fruition , but Crate is moving forward , thanks in large part to the latest developments in digital distribution and new trends that are changing PC gaming as we 've known it .
Bruno revealed that Crate had to shelve the console - based Black Legion , and is returning to his roots with a " thematically darker " PC - based action RPG that , like Titan Quest , is in the vein of Blizzard 's Diablo .
The decision to shelve Black Legion was the result of two factors , Bruno said .
" The first is the state of the economy .
Yeah , I went there ! " joked Bruno .
" Hey , it ’s a great scapegoat and it would be a shame if nothing positive came out of this economic crisis .
All jest aside though , the timing was just terrible . "
Crate was shopping Black Legion around to publishers earlier this year , right when companies like THQ and Electronic Arts were handing out piles of pink slips .
It was an environment less than ideal for a small startup to pitch a console - based action RPG that required substantial outside funding .
" We were looking for funding on a risky venture at a time when the U.S. was in financial crisis and the world economy was destabilized , " said Bruno .
" Some of our best prospects in terms of publishers were in the process of massive layoffs and project cancellations . "
It was time again to adapt .
With Black Legion 's future highly in doubt , Crate turned to its roots -- the PC - based action RPG , Bruno and Crate 's comfort zone .
With just five core people , a few contractors , and even some volunteers , Crate licensed Iron Lore 's Titan Quest engine and toolset , and began work on a new project .
" In this case , Crate Entertainment ’s small size works to its advantage , " Bruno explained .
" We do n’t need a big publishing deal to sustain us and PC , more so now than ever , presents a lot of opportunity for smaller titles .
Our ability to work out a very reasonable deal for the Iron Lore Engine and toolset was another huge enabler .
So we put together a project that we could begin developing without reliance on outside funding . "
Success In The Niche
Cambridge , Mass .- based Crate operates very modestly .
Aside from having a very small staff , most of the work is also done remotely .
By having such a restricted budget , the studio , like others of its ilk , finds it necessary to be lean and mean .
While it may not have been Crate 's initial intention , the structure could facilitate a highly efficient way to do business : keep operations small , and focus on a specific target audience .
" I think we ’ve reached a point in the PC market with digital distribution where it is possible for a small developer to be profitable catering to a relatively niche audience , " said Bruno .
" Titan Quest did not generate enough early sales for Iron Lore to earn royalties , but I ’ve learned that [ publisher ]
THQ recovered their investment and even made a small profit off the game .
Titan Quest together with the Immortal Throne expansion have purportedly broken a million units sold . "
Crate 's new project will be " small - scope , " and will launch at a price " significantly below normal retail , " Bruno said .
It may be exclusively digitally distributed , and by now you may have guessed that there will be no massive marketing campaign for the game .
Crate holds no big hope that the unannounced title will have the same kind of sales as Titan Quest .
But while big sales are desirable , Crate 's project does n't need to be a huge hit by any means , Bruno said .
" With no publisher and a very small development budget , if we can even capture 10 percent of [ Titan Quest 's total ] sales , we ’ll be doing OK . "
Crate could keep revenue flowing through " frequent expansions and optional content . "
" I believe our small size , independence , and desire to avoid starvation will give us the agility and incentive to succeed in this area , " Bruno surmised .
A High Barrier For Console Development
Thanks to services like Xbox Live Arcade , PlayStation Network , and WiiWare , smaller developers are getting smaller , unique games in front of more eyeballs .
Even amateurs and hobbyists can get their games onto Xbox Live Indie Games , as advocates herald the " democratization of game development . "
But for developers who feel their games are a better fit for retail shelves , the barrier is still as high as ever .
And that 's another reason why Crate abandoned Black Legion .
" I think it ’s difficult for any developer without prior console experience to jump into the retail console market , " Bruno said .
" There are additional development costs and the most effective console marketing channels are more expensive .
If the developer requires publisher funding , they ’ll most likely need to demonstrate proof of their technology running on console . "
He continued , " Publishers do n’t seem to be very interested in low - budget console titles , and a small studio that needs to staff up significantly for a larger project would be seen as a significant hiring risk .
To justify larger budgets , it is also likely that publishers will want development to be multiplatform , which introduces additional technical challenges .
Finally , there is the issue of certification .
This can be difficult even for large , experienced companies . "
Can Diablo III Rejuvenate Action RPGs And PC Gaming ?
Diablo - style action RPGs are n't popular on consoles .
But it is n't the most prolific genre these days even on PC , where social gaming , MMOs , simulation , online - centric , and strategy games can flourish .
That could change , Bruno hopes , with the release Diablo III .
" I think the anticipated release of Diablo III may even act in our favor , so long as we do n’t release close enough together that we ’re totally eclipsed , " he said .
" I think Diablo III will help revitalize the action RPG subgenre , and PC gaming in general . "
He added , " I ’m sure there will be a certain segment of the hardcore audience that buys Diablo III and plays it exclusively for the next 3 years -- I may even be one of those people .
However , I think a majority of players will put 2 - 6 months into it and , if they ’ve really enjoyed it , go look for the next closest thing .
If we position ourselves correctly , we should be able to attract some of these players .
If we ’re able to release first and do a good job , then I think we ’ll have fans going off to play Diablo III and recommending our game to new players there . "
While Bruno and Crate seem to be level - headed in their goals and aspirations , mitigating risk where possible , a substantial question mark still stands .
How will they get the word out about the new game ?
Will there be enough money to launch it at the appropriate quality level ?
How can they best take advantage of digital distribution ?
Will people like game ?
Should they be pursuing a PC - only action RPG right now ?
" This unknown path we ’ve chosen to take wo n’t be easy , but I think if we come out the other side alive and not too badly mangled , it will be very rewarding , " said an optimistic Bruno .
" It ’s an opportunity to fulfill a labor of love working on the type of game we ’re most passionate about with an unprecedented level of creative freedom .
Hopefully we wo n’t fuck it up . "
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Indian government doctors Thursday eased the protruding heart of a 10 - day - old baby boy back into his body in what they called a critical but successful surgery .
Surgeons in New Dehli , India , operate on a 10 - day - old baby whose heart was outside his chest .
A.K. Bisoi , cardiothoracic surgeon at New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences , told CNN that his 13 - member team did not stop the child 's heartbeat as they performed the 3½ - hour operation .
The dangling organ has been successfully placed in a space surgically created between the chest and the abdomen , he said .
" The baby is stable .
He may not require any other surgery , " Bisoi said .
Nonetheless , the doctors will keep him under observation and will not comment on when he can be discharged .
Bisoi explained that surgeons had to displace organs including the lungs and the liver as they created a space for the heart .
" We will have to keep a watch on how those organs respond , " he said .
Watch more on the surgery »
The baby was born August 25 in a remote village in India 's eastern state of Bihar along the border with Nepal .
He was admitted to the hospital the next day with acute dehydration and infection that doctors say he probably caught during a 683 - mile ( 1,100 - kilometer ) journey in a rickety train compartment .
Specialists replaced the baby 's infected blood and covered his heart with a synthetic membrane .
Bisoi described the case -- called ectopia cordis , which only affects five to eight cases in 1 million live births -- as a " lifetime opportunity " that might shed light on how to deal with similar conditions in the future .
" You are daring to correct a defect of Mother Nature , " he told CNN a day ahead of the surgery .
All India Institute of Medical Sciences , a state - run hospital , carried out the operation free of cost .
The child 's 24 - year - old father , Chander Majhi , is a laborer in Bihar , one of India 's most impoverished states .
He said he felt indebted to the doctor in his home state as well as the hospital specialists .
The Bihar doctor had not only referred the baby to the hospital but also financed the trip .

Four giant stone hand axes were recovered from the the dry basin of Lake Makgadikgadi in the Kalahari Desert .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A giant African lake basin is providing information about possible migration routes and hunting practices of early humans in the Middle and Late Stone Age periods , between 150,000 and 10,000 years ago .
Oxford University researchers have unearthed new evidence from the lake basin in Botswana that suggests that the region was once much drier and wetter than it is today .
They have documented thousands of stone tools on the lake bed , which sheds new light on how humans in Africa adapted to several substantial climate change events during the period that coincided with the last Ice Age in Europe .
Researchers from the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford are surveying the now - dry basin of Lake Makgadikgadi in the Kalahari Desert , which at 66,000 square kilometres is about the same size of present day Lake Victoria .
Their research was prompted by the discovery of the first of what are believed to be the world ’s largest stone tools on the bed of the lake .
Although the first find was made in the 1990s , the discovery of four giant axes has not been scientifically reported until now .
Four giant stone hand axes , measuring over 30 cm long and of uncertain age , were recovered from the lake basin .
Equally remarkable is that the dry lake floor where they were found is also littered with tens of thousands of other smaller stone - age tools and flakes , the researchers report .
Professor David Thomas , Head of the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford , said : ‘ Many of the tools were found on the dry lake floor , not around its edge , which challenges the view that big lakes were only attractive to humans when they were full of water .
' As water levels in the lake went down , or during times when they fluctuated seasonally , wild animals would have congregated round the resulting watering holes on the lake bed .
It ’s likely that early human populations would have seen this area as a prolific hunting ground when food resources in the region were more concentrated than at times when the regional climate was wetter and food was more plentiful and the lake was full of water . ’
This work is part of an ongoing project investigating the complex history of major changes in climate in Africa .
Co-researcher Dr Sallie Burrough has dated the sediment and shorelines of the lake basin , which has shown that the mega lake was filled with water on multiple occasions in the last 250,000 years .
The research team has also investigated islands on the floor of the lake - remnants of former sand dunes - which suggest the region ’s climate has also been both windier and markedly drier than it is today .
Professor Thomas said : ‘ The interior of southern Africa has usually been seen as being devoid of significant archaeology .
Surprisingly , we have found and logged incredibly extensive Middle Stone Age artefacts spread over a vast area of the lake basin .
' The record the basin is revealing is one of marked human adaptation in the past .
Early humans saw the opportunity to use the lake basin when it was not full of water , but at least seasonally dry .
It shows that humans have adapted to climate change and variability in a sustained way . '
Many archaeologists believe that equivalent lakes in the North African Sahara desert played an important part in the ‘ Out of Africa ’ human expansion theory , as the ancestors of all modern humans would have chosen a wet route out of Africa .
The new research is the first time that this giant Botswanan lake basin in southern Africa has been the focus of scientific research , and these findings could provide new evidence to support the theory about a hominid migration through and expansion from Africa .
Professor Thomas and Dr Burrough are planning further research into how the lake was formed and how it came and went .
They say that the most likely explanation is that sustained periods of greater rainfall in the Angolan Highlands resulted in much greater flow in the Zambezi River , with the water being diverted into the lake basin due to a quirk of geology .
New research , beginning in 2010 and funded by the Leverhulme Trust , will investigate possible links between the lake basin and the Zambezi River , while initial discussions are in hand for setting up a major international geo-archaeologist programme to further unravel the complexities of human - climate - environment interactions in this important and under - researched region .

Hill is president of the British Racing Drivers ' Club , which looks after Silverstone
Former Formula 1 champion Damon
Hill says the future of next year 's British Grand Prix is far from certain because of competition from around the world .
With contracted venue Donington Park struggling to find the cash to redevelop its circuit , Hill is trying to move the event to Silverstone .
But he fears F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone may look elsewhere .
" F1 can go anywhere in the world and get a huge amount of money , " Hill told BBC Radio 5 live .
" That 's what Bernie 's wrestling with .
But it 's not his job to give a discounted job to the UK . "
The British GP has been held every year since 1948 and has a rich history , while recently English drivers Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button have won 2008 and 2009 world titles respectively with Brackley - based Brawn also clinching this year 's constructors ' crown .
Ecclestone can get a value globally that is far in excess of what he can get for the UK
Damon Hill
" There 's a whole load of reasons why it should happen here , " Hill added .
" But ultimately you are competing against countries which are able to inject public money into their infrastructure and into the contract of the grand prix .
And that seems to be the stumbling block here . "
The proposed move to Donington Park on a long - term contract was announced in July 2008 , but a deadline passed on Monday for the company redeveloping the circuit to prove it had the £ 135 m funding required .
In June , Ecclestone has said there would definitely be a British GP in 2010 and that it would be at Silverstone if Donington failed to come through .
But more recently he has backtracked and said it is not certain there will be a grand prix in Britain next year at all .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He said on Friday : " I want a British Grand Prix , of course , but we are not going to do special rates for Britain .
" If they [ Silverstone ] can't make it work then do n't do it .
If that happens , there wo n't be a British Grand Prix .
Simple as that . "
Hill , 1996 F1 world champion , is now president of the British Racing Drivers '
Club which is negotiating a deal to take the race back to Silverstone , although he is not directly involved in those talks .
But he believes Ecclestone , who has long criticised the lack of investment in upgrading Silverstone , could take up the chance to earn more money elsewhere by giving the slot in the calendar to a country such as Korea , which is on the provisional grand prix list for 2010 .
" He [ Ecclestone ] can get a value globally that is far in excess of what he can get for the UK , " Hill said .
" We can respect that it is a difficult position for him to be in .
He has to answer to his shareholders .
606 : DEBATE
This leaves Donington with no F1 , no MotoGP and a half - built track and no money
Readbetween " There are options on the table .
There are discussions taking place and I 'm hopeful something can be sorted out . "
The British GP was almost was dropped in 2005 because of a dispute between Ecclestone and the BRDC , which refused to pay the race fee he had demanded .
The race was left off the provisional race calendar but was reinstated after negotiations produced an agreement .
Silverstone has hosted every British Grand Prix since 1987 , while Donington , which is synonymous with MotoGP , has held only one F1 race , the European Grand Prix in 1993 .

Last week , a 25 - year - old communications worker died in an " apparent suicide " after losing track of a prototype iPhone built by Foxconn , his employer , for one of the most secretive companies in technology .
It was only a matter of time .
Advertisement
First , a recap : Sun Danyong 's death came after a case of prototype iPhones he was charged with shipping to Apple 's headquarters in Cupertino ended up short by one .
Sun could n't produce the device and claimed not to know what had happened ; security officials at Foxconn , the manufacturer of Apple 's iPhone and Sun 's employer , did n't buy his story .
At all .
Advertisement
In the days following the incident , Sun quite possibly went through hell .
He confided in his university friends — he had just graduated — that his house had been searched repeatedly and without announcement , that he had been endlessly interrogated , that he'd been held in solitary confinement , and even that he'd been outright tortured by security guards .
Soon after , he was found dead at the base of his apartment building , having fallen 14 stories .
He died , one way or another , for a phone .
Yeah , no , you 're right :
This is fucking crazy .
A common snap response is that this is just symptomatic of poor labor regulations in China , a sentiment seemingly backed up by Foxconn 's tellingly honest statement on the issue :
Regardless of the reason of Sun 's suicide , it is to some extent a reflection of Foxconn 's internal management deficiencies , especially in how to help young workers cope with the psychological pressures of working life at the company .
Advertisement
They 've since suspended one security guard without pay , and turned over the investigation to police .
But to put this incident in that broad context is n't useful , either to explain what happened or to know how to deal with it .
To a certain extent , Apple does own Sun 's death , and it 's almost shocking that something like this had n't already happened .
Apple 's history of secrecy is long and storied , but hardly seen as scary by itself .
We spend a lot of time trying to crack it for stories , and just as much laughing at how extreme it is — even Apple 's office employees in California are constantly monitored by cameras , forced to pass through absurdly complex security gates on a daily basis , carrying prototypes in black cloaks and flipping on warning lights in rooms when the cloaks are removed from the devices of idolatry .

Apple 's Internal Secrecy Protocol
Is Ridiculous
Apple is known for being secretive to the extreme , but did you know some of their employees look …
Read more
But there 's a lot at stake for Apple , so to an extent their paranoia is understandable : keeping a device like the iPhone secret keeps their strategy out of competitors ' view , and more importantly ensures an all - out media eruption when it goes public on schedule .
There is no more secretive company in tech , and there is no device more important to keep secret than the iPhone .
Advertisement
Apple 's also had , since the early days , a punitive attitude towards those who betray them .
Stories of Steve Jobs not giving his best friend and early employee Dan Kottke pre-IPO stock because of disagreements , or banning difficult journalists from having access to the company 's products or briefings come to mind .
( Disclaimer : But not all . )
I 'm hardly saying that killing is in the character of the company , but there has sometimes been a price to pay for crossing Apple .
This ethos becomes dangerous when combined with billions of dollars and the dubious values at Chinese manufacturing companies like Foxconn , which 've placed profit above human rights in the past .
— Note : Foxconn is headquartered in Taiwan , but does the vast majority of manufacturing in China — specifically at the 270,000 - employee plant in Shenzhen .
Advertisement
Foxconn may be huge , but they 're not unique , and if they can't keep Apple 's hardware plans quiet , it 's easy to imagine another manufacturing conglomerate stealing their contracts worth untold billions .
It 's a scary and very real threat to a solid business relationship , and a subtly tyrannical one .
But the stakes are much higher at Foxconn 's campus ( to use a generous word ) than at Apple's .
If an Apple employee leaks a product , he could lose his job , and Apple would lose what amounts to some free advertising — after all , leaks are n't a bad way to build buzz either .
If a Foxconn employee does the same , he endangers thousands of jobs , billions of dollars in contracts and a vital relationship for his company .
That 's an unrealistically , recklessly high responsibility to ask each employee — Sun and his alleged torturer — to shoulder .
Imagine yourself in Sun 's shoes :
You have just lost a prototype of the world 's most coveted gadget , built by the world 's most unforgivingly secretive electronics maker .
Would you like your life to be hung against the balance of billions of dollars , in a country with lax labor laws and a history of running its citizen over with tanks ?
Advertisement
But wait , Apple says , let us be clear :
Apple Responds , Confirms Foxconn Employee Suicide
The fact that a Foxconn employee committed suicide or that mistreatment by Foxconn security did n't …
Read more
We are saddened by the tragic loss of this young employee , and we are awaiting results of the investigations into his death .
We require our suppliers to treat all workers with dignity and respect .
Advertisement
They require every last line worker to keep secrets worth billions of dollars ; they require Foxconn bosses to make sure these employees keep their mouths shut ; they require that suppliers treat their workers well .
Of those , requirement they 're most willing to talk openly about also sound the most like an afterthought , and to " require " something does n't necessarily mean you really expect it .
( As an aside , who 's to say that the case did n't leave China with all the devices , and through the many handlers in the shipping and airline companies , ahem , lose a little weight during the complicated transit ?
And why were n't such valuable prototypes delivered by hand ?
Art museums do this , and they do n't even have industrial spies to deal with . )
Advertisement
Rightly or not , Sun was the only guy Foxconn felt it could hold accountable for the mess it found itself in , a judgment which probably cost him his life , and which his employer felt tremendous pressure to make .
But this scenario could have easily been foreseen , and the matter of how much human risk Apple calculated it could take before a 25 - year - old man ended up dead is at least as important a question as how they respond to it .

In many ways we ’ve come along way since the Ultimate Fighting Championship was launched back in November of 1993 .
In recent years Mixed Martial Arts has , in the United States at least , begun to reach an increasingly mainstream audience .
The historic UFC 100 event was a turning point .
Covered by many of the major networks in the states it brought in an estimated 1.7 million pay per view buys – a number that sees it rubbing shoulders with the biggest boxing PPV ’s of all time .
Fast forward a few months and YouTube sensation Kimbo Slice has sent the viewing figures for the latest series of The Ultimate Fighter reality show to new heights , with some 6.3 million viewers tuning in to see his fight with Roy Nelson .
Meanwhile one of the sports biggest names Chuck Liddell has just finished a four week stint on the hit ABC show ‘ Dancing With The Stars , ’ whilst also finding time for a guest appearance on the longest running and most successful cartoon series of all time , ‘ The Simpsons ’ in an episode based around the sport .
To cap it all off , Dana
White recently guaranteed that within the next year the UFC will be on network television in the U.S .
Whilst there are still barriers to break down – some states like New York for instance , have yet to sanction the sport , MMA is well on it ’s way to establishing itself as a mainstream sport in the U.S .
In other countries around the world , there is more work still to be done .
Though the first UFC event in the United Kingdom occured back in July 2002 , it was n’t until UFC 70 , some five years later , that it became a regular destination for the promotion .
Since then the sport has certainly grown in the UK .
Events are now broadcast live on ESPN UK , whilst mainstream station Channel Five airs ‘ The Ultimate Fighter ’ series and shows highlights of key UFC events .
Despite this the UK should n’t be seen as keeping pace with their U.S counterparts in terms of mainstream acceptance just yet .
Though popular newspapers such as The Sun and The Telegraph now cover the sport , some are still trying to get their head around the idea of mixed martial arts , as can be seen in articles published in The Daily Mail and The Guardian in the past week .
Others , such as The Guardian ’s Martin Kelnar , are quick to mock , and offer uneducated opinions :
“ With the best will in the world , cage fighting does look ridiculous .
I am sure you have to train hard and be extremely fit…but , especially at the lower weights , it just looks like a fight in a school playground . ”
It will take more time before for the MMA is fully understood and appreciated in the UK .
Even in Brazil , a hot - bed of mixed martial artists since the early days of the UFC when Royce Gracie reigned supreme , there is still work to be done .
Despite modern day stars like middleweight champion Anderson Silva and light heavyweight belt holder Lyoto Machida climbing to the very top of the sport , only now are they starting to gain the respect and recognition that they deserve .
Mauricio ‘ Shogun ’ Rua , who will fight his fellow countryman Lyoto Machida for the light heavyweight title later this month , recently stated in an article for SI .
Com :
“ People are understanding the sport more .
We ’re getting more famous and recognized in Brazil .
We used to get greeted much more abroad .
Now it ’s starting to get even in some sense .
I think people are beginning to respect this as a profession , as a sport .
In the past when you said you were a fighter , people made faces . ”
Though there are still obstacles to overcome , countries like the U.K and Brazil are further along the path to acceptance than others who have yet to experience the sport on a large scale .
Take Australia for instance .
With the news that the UFC will be arriving on their shores next year , the mainstream media are already up in arms at the prospect and busy digging into their book of cliches .
“ Cage Rage Coming Here ” the headline in the Sydney Morning Herald warned just a few days ago .
“ The sport described by critics as “ human cockfighting ” is coming to a stadium near you , despite warnings that US - style cage fighting will fuel more violence on the city ’s streets . ”
Having fought through the same ill - informed articles before in other countries ( In their first trip to Germany in June , an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung , one of the countries leading papers , stated that everything is legal in MMA except for biting and gouging ) , such headlines will not come as a surprise to the UFC .
It has largely become accepted as an inevitable by - product of their expansion plans , and they are becoming increasingly aware of how to deal with it .
They know from past experience that regardless of how the media portrays the sport , almost everywhere the UFC goes they fill venues and regularly set attendance records .
As Dana
White himself says , they have only scratched the surface of how big this sport can become .
Take Mexico for instance .
When the UFC secured a TV deal with Grupo Televisa in time for UFC 100 they were met with instant success as some 25 million people tuned in to see the event .
With up and coming fighters of Mexican descent like Cain Velasquez and Efrain Escudero on their roster it is only a matter of time before there is an event held in the country .
Other locations around the world will soon follow .
“ We ’re going everywhere ” Dana White says .
“ When I say everywhere , I mean everywhere .
We ’re mapping out next year right now .
Figuring out the dates , we ’re gonna go to a lot of new places . ”
In many of these places they will meet resistance and have to break down barriers .
The belief however is that as mixed martial arts continuing to grow in popularity around the world , we will eventually reach a point where it will come to be accepted by the media around the world for what it is – not as ‘ cage fighting ’ or ‘ ultimate fighting , ’ but as a legitimate sport , just the same as basketball , boxing or badminton .

During field studies in Mexico two years ago , Christopher J. Meehan , then a student at Villanova University , spent time watching a jumping spider on an acacia plant .
The plant was swarming with ants , as ants and acacias constitute a well - known example of mutualism  the insects provide protection for the plant and in return the acacia produces nutritious leaf tips for the ants to eat .
Mr. Meehan figured that the spider was hunting dinner .
“ I was waiting for it to do something like prey on an ant , ” he said .
Instead , to his surprise , the spider , Bagheera kiplingi , darted around the ants and plucked off a one of the leaf tips , called a Beltian body .

Netflix ’s second $ 1 Million prize Contest will have scientists take on the even more difficult problem of recommending movies for customers that rate few movies , and this time will use demographic and behavioral data to predict customer rentals .
“ The new data set , providing more than 100 million data points , will include , among other things , information about renters ’ ages , genders , ZIP codes , genre ratings and previously chosen movies .
As with the first Netflix Prize , all data provided is anonymous and cannot be associated with a specific Netflix member . ”
The second Netflix $ 1 Million prize will be broken into two awards , with the leading team at 6 months and 18 months winning a $ 500,000 progress prizes .
While the first prize focused on customers that rated more than 50 movies , the second contest will enable Netflix to more accurately recommend movies to customers that are just getting started or rate movies infrequently .
More information will be available on the Netflix Prize website soon .
Groundbreaking Stem Cell Surgery Gives Boy New Cheekbones Brad Guilkey gets surgery that allows him to grow cheekbones .
Oct. 12 , 2009  -- Brad Guilkey , 15 , was born without cheekbones and , for him , a typical sporting activity such as basketball carries tremendous risks .
Brad suffers from Treacher Collins syndrome , a rare genetic disorder in which the bones and other tissues in the face do n't develop .
So , for Brad , a shot to the face during a game of basketball could crush his eyeball .
His mother , Christine Guilkey , said the lack of bone meant the lack of vital protection .
But the Cincinnati teen has undergone groundbreaking experimental surgery that is allowing him to grow new cheekbones , a procedure that could help others who have lost bone as a result of similar genetic conditions or traumatic injuries .
Brad had an experimental eight - hour operation in May at the Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center , where doctors implanted cadaver bone into his face .
They then injected Brad 's own stem cells into the donor bone .
From a medical standpoint , the results were miraculous .
" Lo and behold , the bone has come back to life , " said Dr. Jesse Taylor of the Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center .
" I 've been really pleasantly surprised by the results of this . "
Brad now has solid bone in his cheeks , and said on " Good Morning America " today that he 's happy with the results .
Taylor said the surgery could have significant implications for millions of people .
" Certainly , as we 're engaged in conflicts abroad , more and more young men and women come back with really severe facial disfigurement from a lack of bone , " he said .
Statistics on the Disorder
People with Treacher Collins syndrome typically have eyes that slant downward , as well as absent , small or unusually formed ears , according to the National Institutes of Health .
They have sparse eyelashes and some even have eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss .
The disorder affects about 1 in 50,000 people , according to the National Institutes of Health .
Many reconstructive surgeries that use implanted material often have high failure rates because the recipients ' bodies reject the donor material .
In Brad 's case , though , there is no rejection risk because the his own cell 's are growing in the cadaver bone .

Exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer has thanked Australia for standing up to Chinese pressure and allowing her to champion the cause of her people .
The leader of the World Uighur Congress ( WUC ) made the comments during an address to the National Press Club today .
Ms Kadeer also used the forum to jokingly thank the Chinese Government for giving her publicity after it had pressured the Government and the Press Club not to allow her visit , or let her speak .
The National Press Club says Chinese officials tried to persuade it not to go ahead with the speech , saying Ms Kadeer was " not credible " .
The Chinese Government also tried to stop her visit to Australia and has accused Ms Kadeer of instigating deadly ethnic riots in the country 's west in July .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith defended his Government 's decision to grant her a visa , saying Ms Kadeer was not a terrorist .
Today Ms Kadeer was typically defiant and energetic during her address in Canberra .
" I deeply appreciate the support of the Chinese Government in raising my profile , " she joked though an interpreter when asked about the Chinese pressure .
" I could not have spent millions of dollars in getting this sort of publicity , but thanks to the Chinese Government for raising my profile and informing Australians of the plight of the Uighurs . "
Ms Kadeer says the number of people who were killed or injured during July riots is much higher than the 200 cited by the Chinese Government and wants the Australian Government to become involved .
" It 's extremely important for the Australian Government to urge the United Nations to send an investigation team to find out what has transpired - how many people were killed , " she said .
" Because the actual number of people killed , we believe , is much higher than the one reported by the Chinese media . "
The Chinese embassy released a statement following the speech saying it was perfectly within its rights to make its voice heard concerning Ms Kadeer 's visit .
The embassy says Ms Kadeer is a convicted criminal who is playing separatist politics with the tragic events of July 5 in Urumqi .
" At a time when the Chinese public are mourning the innocent victims from different ethnic groups in the highly violent crimes in Urumqi , the person who is responsible for the crimes is allowed to visit Australia and engage in anti-China separatist activities , " the statement said .
" Rebiya has an obvious political agenda by choosing to visit Australia shortly after the July 5 incident . "
Show of support
Ms Kadeer said she had received a lot of support from Australians during her visit , and she urged Australians to continue to resist Chinese pressure to limit debate on human rights abuses .
She dismissed arguments that Australia should be cautious in case it damaged its trade relationship with China , saying that the Asian giant needs Western investment as much as the West needs Chinese investment .
Ms Kadeer repeated her strong criticisms of the Chinese Government , saying it had violated human rights during riots in the city of Urumqi , in Xinjiang Province in July .
She urged the Chinese Government to stop referring to her as a terrorist and return to dialogue with her about the self - determination of the Uighur people .
Uighurs live predominantly in the west of China in the Xinjiang Autonomous Province and Ms Kadeer says the Chinese Government has pursued an active agenda of oppression and cultural genocide for decades .
The Chinese Government has dismissed her comments , saying she is a terrorist trying to foment unrest and violence and break away from China .
Ms Kadeer says the Chinese Government is " obsessed with control of a strategic and resource - rich region " .
The WUC leader came to Australia to attend the showing of a documentary about her life - 10 Conditions of Love - at the Melbourne International Film Festival .
She said the film was very moving and brought tears to her eyes .
I cannot believe that this is even happening , but apparently someone ( someone being Jessica Manafort and Paul Schiff ) had this incredibly terrible idea to remake the classic Thelma and Louise .
This remake , which will also be renamed to Cowgirl Bandits ( Are you kidding me !!!??? ) will star Gossip Girl ’s Leighton Meester and Amber Heard from Remember the Daze which Manafort also wrote and Pineapple Express .
This remake is an incredibly bad idea , especially considering the title Cowgirl Bandits is enough to make your brain explode , but we ’re not even staying in the same age group here .
Does everything really need a remake starring women half the age of the original actresses ?
In my opinion , the age difference alone makes this remake completely unbelievable .
Not everything needs a remake , Hollywood !
Thelma and Louise is completely iconic , why not go play around and ruin a movie that did n’t work out the first time ?
What do you think ?
Terrible idea or completely awesome ?
Seven former heads of the CIA formally requested that President Obama halt an ongoing inquiry into suspect abuse ( aka torture ) by the agency , arguing that important CIA work would be hampered by such an investigation .
Obama did n’t bite , claiming that “ nobody ’s above the law . ” Except George W. Bush , it seems .
— JCL
The BBC :
President Obama has rejected a request by seven former heads of the CIA to end the inquiry into allegations of abuse of suspects held by the agency .
“ Nobody ’s above the law , ” Mr Obama said in an interview with the American CBS television programme Face The Nation .
The US Attorney General Eric Holder last month named a prosecutor to examine whether the CIA had gone beyond approved interrogation methods .
The former heads wrote to Mr Obama saying the probe would hamper CIA work .

Teh stoopid , it hurts :
On Mike Gallagher 's radio program yesterday , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) offered a novel theory as to why Democrats want her out of office :
They do n't want her to become the first woman president .
BACHMANN : Also with women politicians , they want to make sure no women , no woman becomes president before a Democrat woman , and so they 're doing everything they can to , I think , sabotage women like Sarah Palin , perhaps women like myself , or similarly situated women , to make sure that we do n't have a prominent national voice .
But the thing is , the people in our country , they do n't care who the voice is , they just want someone , they want to know that someone is speaking out for them against what will certainly bring about the destruction of our great country if we continue to go down the Obama path .
I swear , you just can't write this level of stupid .
Hate to break it to you , Michelle , but Dems do n't need to sabotage you when you do such a fine job of it on your own .
Shall we take a little walk down Memory Lane ?
Remember when you told Glenn Beck that the census was used to round up Japanese Americans during WWII ?
or when you said that health care reform was undesirable because if everyone had access , lines at her doctors ' office would be too long ;
or when you claimed that " Flying Imams " attended a victory party for Keith Ellison
or when you complained about " re-education camps for young people "
or when you introduced a bill blocking the US from ever joining a global currency .
Media Matters has even more gloriousness of Bachmann .
As for running for president , all I can say is : Baby , bring .
it. on .

Courtesy producers of TAPPED .
Tapped , a new documentary about the bottled water industry from director Stephanie Soechtig and the producers of Who Killed the Electric Car ? , is a pretty damning look at how consumers have been tricked into spending too much money on water packaged in plastic and quite often not as clean as what ’s available from the faucet .
I knew bottled water sucks , but I did n’t know it sucks this much .
Not only is it a clear waste of resources ( only 20 percent of plastic water bottles used in the United States are recycled , and far too many of the rest probably end up in the Pacific Garbage Patch ) , it ’s an incredible waste of money for consumers , who pay more than the price of gasoline for water that ’s marketed as “ pure , ” but in reality is largely unregulated , full of harmful toxins like BPA , and far less safe for drinking than free tap water .
( In fact , 40 percent of the time , bottled water is nothing but municipal tap water , freed from the government oversight that keeps it safe . )
Tapped , which began a one - week run at the IFC Center in New York on Friday , traces the evolution of bottled water from its hoity - toity Perrier days to its present ubiquity , and succeeds at making the industry reps look like total jerks .
A few too many mid-interview cutaways to Soechtig looking concerned came off as a little journalistically self - important , but Tapped does a solid job of covering every aspect of this damaging industry and inspiring more outrage than despair .
It features interviews with the likes of Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin and Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) , not to mention some footage of Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) tearing into an FDA rep at a government hearing .
I will never look at bottled water with anything less than loathing from now on .
Watch the trailer :
The film ’s website lists where you can see it in the theater .
So far , it will be screened in a smattering of cities on the East and West costs .
There ’s also a Facebook page for the film .
Allan , I can think of so many other more important things one has to learn without using hands , like cooking , tying shoes , getting dressed , driving a car , writing , even touching a loved one .
Thank him for serving , now make sure he gets the best medical care out there .

Old / used soccer equipment wanted for my kid .
Will drive to pick up anywhere near Malvern .
No calls , email only : ************@verizon.net From Me to ************@verizon.net :
Hello ,
I have a bunch of old soccer equipment that would be perfect for your daughter .
I have soccer balls , nets , cleats , etc .
Let me know specifically what you need and we can talk prices .
Thanks ,
Mike
From ************@verizon.net to Me :
Actually the stuff is for my son because I want to get him started in soccer .
I 'm in need of a practice net , soccer ball and kids size 6 cleats if you have them .
Thanks .
From Me to ************@verizon.net :
My mistake , I assumed it was for your daughter because it is soccer .
If that is the way you want to raise your son , I have some other items you may want to buy for him .
I have a pink twirling baton with silver ribbons , and a cheerleader set consisting of two pom-poms , pink cheerleader bloomers , and a toy megaphone .
I 'm charging $ 100 for the practice net , $ 20 for the ball , $ 25 for the baton , and $ 30 for the cheerleader set .
I do n't have kids size 6 cleats , but you do n't really need cleats for soccer anyway .
Your son could probably just use his bunny slippers .
Let me know if you are interested .
Mike
From ************@verizon.net to Me :
Well I 'm definitely interested in kicking your fucking ass .
One question , asshole : if you think soccer is so gay , why do you have soccer equipment , and a cheerleader set and baton ?
From Me to ************@verizon.net :
Please , you are n't kicking anyone 's ass .
The fact that you are getting your son started in soccer instead of football says a lot about you as a man .
To answer your question , I have the baton and cheerleader set as trophies .
When I was a kid , I used to go around the neighborhood and beat up all the other kids who played soccer and steal their stuff .
I acquired the cheerleader set and baton from this one kid in the neighborhood , Caleb .
I always knew that kid was n't right - he used to ride around on a pink bike and always wanted to have tea parties with the other kids .
I tried to help him by beating him up and stealing his baton , but I do n't think it worked .
I saw him in Philly a few years ago , blowing some guy in an alley .
Anyway , I kept my gatherings in my shed out back as a testament to my manliness , but I need to make room for my new shotgun and power saw .
So do you want the stuff or not ?
I also have Brokeback Mountain on DVD .
I ordered Die Hard , but that was sent to me in error .
It sounds like a movie that you and your son would enjoy watching .
From ************@verizon.net to Me :
You must be so proud of what a big man you are with your shotgun and power saw .
From Me to ************@verizon.net :
You 're goddamn right I am .
It 's just part of being a man , which you apparently know nothing about .
Tell you what - forget the baton and cheerleader set .
I want to help you .
I 'll sell you my shotgun for $ 1,700 .
It is a 10 - gauge Remington that 'll put some hair on your chest .
Take your son hunting with it .
There is nothing more manly than blowing a deer 's head off and eating the raw venison from its neck .
Then , after you are done manning up , you can come back and I 'll sell you some football equipment for your son .
I 'd hate to see him blowing Caleb in an alley in Philly some day .
From ************@verizon.net to Me :
How about you take your shotgun and stick it up your ass and pull the trigger ?
Go fuck yourself .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
A wave of attacks against top security installations over the last several days demonstrated that the Taliban , Al Qaeda and militant groups once nurtured by the government are tightening an alliance aimed at bringing down the Pakistani state , government officials and analysts said .
More than 30 people were killed Thursday in Lahore , the second largest city in Pakistan , as three teams of militants assaulted two police training centers and a federal investigations building .
The dead included 19 police officers and at least 11 militants , police officials said .
Nine others were killed in two attacks at a police station in Kohat , in the northwest , and a residential complex in Peshawar , capital of North - West Frontier Province .
The assaults in Lahore , coming after a 20 - hour siege at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi last weekend , showed the deepening reach of the militant network , as well as its rising sophistication and inside knowledge of the security forces , officials and analysts said .
' To you zealots and bigots and false patriots who live in fear of discourse .
You screamers and banners and burners .

The common cold is a major cause of visits to a doctor in high - income countries and of absenteeism from work and school .
There are over 200 viruses which can cause the common cold symptoms including runny nose , congestion , sneezing , sore throat , cough , and sometimes headache , fever and red eyes .
Symptoms vary from person to person and cold to cold .
Since the common cold is usually caused by one of the respiratory viruses , antibiotics are useless and therefore other potential treatment options are of substantial public health interest .
Vitamin C has been proposed for treating respiratory infections since it was isolated in the 1930s .
It became particularly popular in the 1970s when Nobel laureate Linus Pauling concluded from earlier placebo - controlled trials that vitamin C would prevent and alleviate the common cold .
Over two dozen new trials were undertaken thereafter .
Vitamin C has been widely sold and used as a preventive and therapeutic agent .
This review is restricted to placebo - controlled trials testing 0.2 g/day or more of vitamin C. Regular ingestion of vitamin C had no effect on common cold incidence in the ordinary population , based on 29 trial comparisons involving 11,306 participants .
However , regular supplementation had a modest but consistent effect in reducing the duration of common cold symptoms , which is based on 31 study comparisons with 9745 common cold episodes .
In five trials with 598 participants exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress ( including marathon runners and skiers ) vitamin C halved the common cold risk .
The published trials have not reported adverse effects of vitamin C .

In 1649 , 360 years ago this year , an experiment in communal land holding and cultivation began on St. George 's Hill in Surrey , England , as the principles of a communist society were put into practice by the Diggers -- followers of Gerrard Winstanley , a visionary and writer of radical political tracts .
This experiment marked an important phase in the development of socialist tendencies in the struggle to defeat the Stuart monarchy in the 1640s .
This essay attempts to analyse the dynamics of the revolutionary struggle in England during the 1640s civil war and its aftermath .
It concentrates on the emergence and development of left - wing tendencies in the revolutionary movement , and attempts to provide an explanation for the defeat of the aspirations of those tendencies .
Modern socialism as a doctrine and a movement owes much to the contributions of popular movements in the era of the great bourgeois - democratic revolutions .
It should never be forgotten that it was the ordinary people who did the fighting and the sacrificing that won the gains of these revolutions , even if the most direct beneficiaries were in fact merely a different stratum of property owners .
If the idea of a 17th century ``Puritan '' revolution , propounded by the venerable S.R. Gardiner , is ``in eclipse ' ' [ 1 ] , and if the entire framework supporting the ``Whig '' interpretation of English history has been undermined [ 2 ] , then a corresponding increase in concern by modern historians with the role of the left - wing of the English Revolution has become manifest .
This growth of interest in the broader social forces and movements accompanying more immediately visible developments in church and state before and during the revolution has been one consequence of the demise of the ``religio - constitutional '' approach to English history . [ 3 ]
The fruits of research undertaken by scholars working under the newer disciplines of sociology and social psychology have enabled historians to approach the English Revolution , and the mass movements associated with it , armed with techniques and insights hitherto denied them . [ 4 ]
The results have already begun to overthrow long - established orthodoxies .
For example , the millenarianism ( chiliasm ) traditionally associated exclusively with extremist sects far removed from the mainstream of pre-revolutionary English religious life is now increasingly regarded as having been widespread in the Puritan opposition and even in the pre-Laudian High Anglican Church .
[ 5 ]
In some aspects , as with the doctrine of ``Antichrist ' ' , it has been seen as a ubiquitous phenomenon . [ 6 ]
The period between 1645 -- the year of the Self - Denying Ordinance , the formation of the New Model army and the Battle of Naseby -- and 1653 -- the year that saw the dissolution of the Rump Parliament and the onset of the Protectorate [ 7 ] -- forms the background to the rise and fall of the Leveller movement .
The major preceding political events can only be briefly reviewed here .
Shift to the left
The course of events from the calling of the Long Parliament ( 1640 ) until 1645 was characterised by a progressive shift to the left on the part of the forces opposed to the king .
The leftward movement proceeded through a series of splits and regroupments .
Once the initial acts of the Long Parliament ( impeachment of Archbishop William Laud and the Earl of Strafford , and the dismantling of prerogative government machinery ) [ 8 ] were completed , differences developed over the question of the future of episcopacy between the Presbyterian Root and Branch men ( radicals ) , led by Pym and Hampden , and the moderate party favouring limited episcopacy . [ 9 ]
The ``Grand Remonstrance '' of November 1641 [ 10 ] marked the decisive break between Royalists and Parliamentarians , with the episcopalian party soon deserting to the king .
[ 11 ]
Once the war was underway the parliamentary forces divided , with the rise of a militant Independent opposition -- the ``Win the War ' ' party . [ 12 ]
The new opposition found its most powerful ally in the Parliamentary army , where the Presbyterian religious settlement , imposed as a condition of the Scots alliance [ 14 ] was a major point of contention .
Oliver Cromwell 's policy of religious toleration deserves emphasis here , inasmuch as it explains to some extent his popularity in the ranks of the army , above and beyond that consonant with mere military prowess ; the two aspects were in fact combined in this ``servant of God ' ' . [ 15 ]
The conflict resolved itself with the Self - Denying Ordinance , [ 16 ] which dissolved the rights of peers to command the army .
A popular , national ``New Model ' ' army was mobilised and finances were reorganised . [ 17 ]
The Royalist forces were soon thereafter destroyed at the Battle of Naseby ( June 1645 ) .
A new conflict later arose between the army leadership ( Grandees ) and the rank and file : the Levellers were to play an important role throughout the course of this new conflict .
We have picked out a rough outline of the salient points in the struggle between king and parliament from 1640 to 1645 , noting how each successive development moved the struggle to a higher level of intensity .
These developments took place alongside a growing radicalisation of the masses , reflected in the incidence of sectarianism in the New Model . [ 18 ]
This radicalisation process frightened the social classes promulgating the war effort ( primarily the gentry and the commercial bourgeoisie ) [ 19 ] to such an extent that they became more concerned with preserving their property and privileges than with prosecuting the war with any fervour [ 20 ] , the split between Presbyterians and Independents turned fundamentally around this point .
Origins of the Levellers
The origins of the Leveller movement ( which in Brailsford 's view was not formed as a party until 1647 , with the publication of A Remonstrance of many Thousand Citizens ) [ 21 ] may best be traced by reviewing the activities of its most prominent leaders .
John Lilburne ( 1614 - 57 ) , the most widely known of these men , was whipped and pilloried for smuggling anti-prelatical literature at the age of 22 . [ 22 ]
He joined the Parliamentary army at the outbreak of war [ 23 ] and left it at the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant with the Scots ( 1643 ) .
William Walwyn was generally regarded as the dominant intellectual force in the Leveller movement . [ 25 ]
It was he who postulated the concept of the ``state of nature ' ' .
Richard Overton was responsible for the publication of a series of satirical pamphlets viciously lampooning the Presbyterians . [ 26 ]
John Wildman possessed considerable legal knowledge , and was one of the draftees of the first ``Agreement of the People ' ' . [ 27 ]
All were agreed on the idea of liberty of conscience in religious matters .
Continued attempts at press censorship , along with the introduction of an intolerant ``Directory of Worship '' in 1645 , [ 28 ] plunged these four men into ``pamphlet warfare ' ' , and Walwyn , Overton and Lilburne published the Marpriest tracts , lampooning religious intolerance . [ 29 ]
Lilburne was arrested in July 1645 [ 30 ] and his new pamphlet , England 's Birthright Justified , [ 31 ] written in jail , marked an increase in concentration on social and economic issues .
Tithes were challenged in Overton 's The Ordinance for Tithes Dismounted [ 32 ] and , in the opinion of the propertied classes , this tack implied assault on all property rights .
The unstable balance of social forces in the post - war situation of 1646 - 7 provided an opportunity for Leveller ideas to gain strength in the New Model .
A Remonstrance of Many Thousand Citizens [ 33 ] contained the germs of a popular program , demanding the abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords .
Lilburne 's London 's Liberty in Chains Discovered , written in prison , denounced the commercial oligarchy of the City of London and called for unity among small craftsmen .
Royal Tyranny Discovered [ 35 ] demanded the execution of the king for treason and utilised the well - worked myth of the Norman Yoke . [ 36 ]
The ``Large Petition '' of March 1647 [ 37 ] contained the most fully worked - out program to that date , calling for the abolition of monarchy and lords , full religious toleration , abolition of tithes and monopolies , and legal reforms .
This document appeared alongside growing Leveller organisational efficiency and influence among the rank and file of the New Model army . [ 38 ]
The Presbyterian parliamentary majority 's fears of growing radicalism in the army led it to attempt the demobilisation of the New Model army without payment of arrears , in March 1647 . [ 39 ]
The army rebelled , elected representatives ( called agitators ) to an Army Council [ 40 ] and published the famous declaration of June 14 , 1647 :
We shall before disbanding proceed in our own and the kingdom's behalf to propound and plead for some provision for our and the kingdom 's satisfaction and future security ... especially considering that we were not a mere mercenary army , hired to serve any arbitary power of a state , but called forth and conjured by the several Declarations of Parliament to the defence of our own and the people 's just rights and liberties . [ 41 ]
The army 's declaration concided with the publication of the Leveller 's ``Large Petition '' , the June ``Solemn Engagement ' ' , [ 42 ] authored by Henry Ireton , was the product of a compromise worked out between moderate Grandees and radical agitators . [ 43 ]
An uneasy alliance between these two groups lasted through the summer , until the Leveller - inspired agitators compelled the Grandees to break off negotiations with the king and project a march on London . [ 44 ]
The financial oligarchy of the City of London had been pressuring the Presbyterian MPs to withdraw concessions made to the New Model commanders , and the king was subsequently invited to London . [ 45 ]
Independent members fled to the New Model lines , and the Presbyterian City oligarchy prepared to defend London .
The city was captured , however , without a fight . [ 46 ]
Autumn 1647 saw the nascent conflict between Grandees and agitators develop into open hostility .
The Levellers demanded an end to the continuing negotiations with the king , and the release from prison of Lilburne and Overton . [ 47 ]
The Case of the Army Truly Stated , published in October 1647 , [ 48 ] called for the restoration of enclosed common lands and of other ``ancient rights and donations belonging to the poore ' ' [ 49 ] .
Shortly afterwards appeared the first ``Agreement of the people '' [ 50 ] summarising the basic principles of the Levellers on constitutional issues , and forming their negotiating document at the famous debates with the Grandees held at Putney in October 1647 [ 51 ] .
These debates , turning mainly around Leveller proposals for an extended franchise , [ 52 ] were inconclusive .
The flight of the king to the Isle of Wight in November ( which might have been engineered by Cromwell ) [ 53 ] played into the Grandees ' hands .
The discussions in the army were broken off by Cromwell and , after a rebellious regiment stationed at Ware was subdued , [ 54 ] discipline was effectively restored .
The Ware events marked a major setback for the Levellers as `` ... all subsequent attempts to revive the Agitator movement were promptly suppressed ' ' . [ 55 ]
Under the changed circumstances the Leveller party had to resort to the strategy of petitioning parliament .
The ``Earnest Petition '' of January 1648 , [ 56 ] called for decentralisation measures and for local election of magistrates .
The latter was a frontal attack on the prerogatives of justices of the peace , and through them on landed property and its priorities .
The brief , so - called ``Second '' Civil War was resolved in parliament 's favour with the defeat of the Scots at Preston ( 1648 ) . [ 57 ]
In the interests of unity and discipline there was a lull in Leveller criticism of the Grandees during the hostilities .
The Levellers ' campaign revived with the ``September Petition ' ' . [ 58 ]
Although this document called for the execution of the king , the Grandees ' position on this issue had in any case hardened . [ 59 ]
On constitutional questions , particularly those relating to the franchise , there is evidence that the ``September Petition '' represents a compromise with the Grandees .
On their part the Grandees adopted to some extent sections of the Leveller program , perhaps partly as a result of negotiations with Leveller representatives .
The Levellers had demanded some guarantee against military dictatorship before they would consent to a trial of the king .
[ 60 ]
Ireton 's Remonstrance of the Army , [ 61 ] presented to parliament in November , contained some radical proposals : biennial parliaments ; abolition of monarchy and House of Lords , and the establishment of a constitution based on some kind of contract or agreement of the people .
Continuing negotiations between the parliamentary Presbyterians and Charles I resulted in Ireton ordering the king 's arrest , and on December 6 , Colonel Pride excluded the Presbyterian members from parliament . [ 62 ]
The remaining Independent ``Rump '' parliament passed three resolutions : that original power resided in the people ; that supreme power rested with the House of Commons ( representing the people ) and that Acts of the House of Commons were law even without the consent of king or peers . [ 63 ]
The Levellers drew up a new ``Agreement of the People ' ' [ 64 ] and presented it to the Rump ; it was by then obvious , however , that they had been gulled and that the new republic had no intention of acting upon Leveller principles .
Soon , from Lilburne , came denunciations of the trial , under a new High Court , of five royalist peers [ 65 ] -- and of martial law .
In February 1649 a new pamphlet , England 's New Chains Discovered [ 66 ] attacked the Grandees and the new Council of State . [ 67 ]
The army was , however , in the main loyal to Cromwell .
It is an indication of the Levellers ' waning influence that their literature from this period becomes increasingly unrealistic , calling for armed rebellion against the rule of the Rump , and even at times flirting with Royalist sympathies -- as the ``lesser evil ' ' . [ 68 ]
Overton 's pamphlet The Hunting of the Foxes contained outspoken calls to armed rebellion .
Essentially accepting Christopher Hill 's analysis , I have identified the Leveller movement with the radicalised petty bourgeosie .
Obviously this is a far from unanimous opinion among historians [ 70 ] and so a brief examination of the social composition of the movement is perhaps necessary to demonstrate the accuracy of that analysis .
By so doing it may also be possible to provide some understanding of the factors behind the defeat of Leveller aspirations .
Levellers ' social composition
There is a general consensus that the Levellers ' popular base was neither primarily among the large population of landless agricultural labourers and dispossessed , nor with the wealthier property - owning classes as such , but with the intermediate layers -- small proprietors , poorer yeomen farmers , urban craftspeople and traders .
Lilburne himself described the Levellers ' main area of support as stemming from the ``the middle sort of people ' ' . [ 71 ]
As one consequence of a range of economic tendencies at work through the previous century , this intermediate social layer was going through a process of transformation .
These tendencies included an increase in agricultural production for the market [ 72 ] and a concomitant steady erosion of medieval survivals in the social relations of agricultural production . [ 73 ]
There had been continuing attacks on the rights of copyhold , the manorial system of land tenure , throughout the 16th and continuing into the 17th centuries .
The triumph of freehold land tenure [ 74 ] and extended enclosures of common land [ 75 ] were two aspects of this process .
In the towns was witnessed the slow transformation of the medieval guilds into structures dominated by the concentrated wealth of burgher oligarchs . [ 76 ]
The continuing widespread social distress that had necessitated the adoption of the Tudor Poor Laws , combined with a steep rise in prices , [ 77 ] and a conjunctural economic crisis and a series of poor harvests , [ 78 ] conspired to make the years between 1620 - 50 ``among the most terrible in English history , bringing extreme hardship for the lower classes ' ' . [ 79 ]
The long - term effect of these economic developments was to pauperise large sections of the petty bourgeoisie , while converting a small percentage of it into more or less successful capitalists . [ 80 ]
It is basically due to the extension of these tendencies into the 18th century that the yeoman class , which formed the backbone of Cromwell 's army , had by 1750 virtually disappeared .
[ 81 ]
The contradictions within Leveller ideology may also be traced , in the last analysis , to these fundamental antagonisms embodied in long - term socioeconomic trends .
The characteristics , and fate , of petty proprietorship also provide an explanation for Christopher Hill 's paradoxical view , expressed in rather uncompromising terms in 1940 , that ``in Puritan social ideas and Leveller ideology , there is a trend that is medieval and even reactionary ' ' . [ 82 ]
Leveller ideology
Turning to the concrete issues of Leveller ideology , there are two important points of controversy that deserve special attention .
The question as to whether the Levellers ' ideas were religious or secular in inspiration [ 83 ] is in my view a non-issue .
Political opposition of every hue in early 17th century England was invariably expressed in religious terms : the official church had a monopoly in ideas until the revolutionary events of the 1640s .
As Hill points out :
The Independent and Sectarian congregations were the way in which ordinary people organized themselves in those days to escape from the propaganda of the established Church and discuss the things they wanted to discuss in their own way . [ 84 ]
Religion and politics were in fact inseparable .
The question of lineage in discussing Leveller ideas is largely an irrelevant one ; inevitably they were religious , inevitably they were connected with militant Puritanism , with Anabaptism and antinomianism .
For only with the rise of a free press during the revolutionary years did there arise secular ideologies [ 85 ] or ideologies that were close to a secular position ( e.g. pantheism ) .
To claim that Puritanism was a two - edged sword , that it had an inherent tendency to split into sects once the common enemy was removed [ 86 ] is really to beg the question ; for it was the propertied classes of all shades who consistently opposed the concept of freedom of ideas or conscience , because these classes understood the importance of a centralised religious orthodoxy as the essential bulwark of a system based on inequality and exploitation .
Cromwell 's supposed ``religious toleration '' may easily be seen as having been based on opportunism , as perhaps his and Fairfax 's acceptance of doctorates from the Royalist stronghold of Oxford University indicates . [ 87 ]
The position of the Levellers on the franchise ( expressed in the ``Agreement of the People ' ' and other documents ) has been the subject of controversy , especially since the publication of Professor C.B. Macpherson 's study of the problem in his book The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism ( 1962 ) .
Macpherson 's thesis is that underlying Leveller statements about ``manhood suffrage '' , ``the people '' , ``freedom ' ' , etc. , are assumptions that limit their application and , in terms of modern understanding , deny their content . [ 88 ]
MacPerson argues that these assumptions are shared in common with other 17th century political theorists , including Hobbes and Locke , so that concepts of natural rights , political obligation and representation ( where present ) are refracted through a limited bourgeois view of society .
The social relations of the ``possessive market '' society being hidden ( reified ) , have been either restructured artificially in some form of contract theory of obligation ( as in Locke ) or , in the case of the Levellers , identified with the personal attributes of individuals :
The propriety of the person .
The Leveller writers saw that freedom in their society was a function of possession .
They could therefore make a strong moral case for individual freedom by defining freedom as ownership of one 's person . [ 89 ]
On the franchise issue , discussed at Putney , the Levellers ' ``possessive market assumptions '' led them to exclude servants and wage labourers from those who should be granted the right to vote , as these people had ``sold their birthright ' ' -- or their labour ( ``right ' ' ) was included in that of their master .
Macpherson 's thesis has been attacked on some points .
He has been accused of misreading the Putney documents and criticised over his interpretation of population statistics . [ 90 ]
If Macpherson 's views do hold good , and they are now increasingly accepted , then the view of the Levellers as a radical plebeian or petty - bourgeois current must gain credence , while that of their position as ancestors of popular democracy [ 91 ] must be thrown into doubt ( according to Macpherson 's reading of the statistics , under the Leveller proposals at Putney only an extra one sixth of the population would have received the vote ) . [ 92 ]
The last prominent act of the Levellers before their final defeat was to oppose Cromwell 's Irish campaign . [ 93 ]
This they did from an ethical standpoint .
In The English Soldier 's Standard , [ 94 ] by recognising the right of the Irish to self - determination , the Levellers could be seen as having made a further significant contribution to a secular political creed based on formal democratic criteria .
Political arraignment among the army rank and file was renewed and , in May 1649 , six regiments elected agitators . [ 95 ]
This attempted mutiny was put down by the Grandees at Burford . [ 96 ]
The Burford defeat marked the eclipse of the Levellers .
My standpoint on the question of Leveller decline and collapse has perhaps emerged fairly clearly from the preceding analysis ; nevertheless , differing viewpoints need some examination if a rounded conclusion on the Levellers ' place in history is to be reached .
In my view the basic dialectic of the Civil War was laid bare by Christopher Hill in his 1940 essay ( building partly from the contributions of previous socialist historians , such as Eduard Bernstein and Karl Kautsky ) : [ 97 ]
[ Hill ] ... there were really three classes in conflict .
As against the parasitic feudal landowners and speculative financiers , as against the government whose policy was to restrict and control industrial expansion , the interests of the new class of capitalists , merchants and farmers were temporarily identical with those of the small peasantry and artisans and journeymen .
But conflict between the two latter classes was bound to develop , since the expansion of capitalism involved the dissolution of the old agrarian and industrial relationships and the transformation of independent small masters and peasants into proletarians . [ 98 ]
This broad dialectic was narrowed to a fine edge in the events of 1647 - 48 , when the future of England seemed to balance precariously between two possible outcomes : either victory to the Grandees and the consolidation of the gains of a strictly bourgeois revolution , or the sweeping changes outlined in Leveller manifestos , consonant with a victory to the army rank and file .
But was the latter variable ever a serious possibility ?
If we allow that it was , then the outcome of the Civil War could obviously have been far different from that of the dictatorship of the Rump , followed by the Protectorate and , after Cromwell 's death , by the Stuart restoration .
But what if , without admitting into our analysis so much as a hint of determinism , such an outcome was not on the cards , and that the rule of the Rump and Cromwell -- the dictatorship par excellence of the bourgeoisie -- was the only logical outcome of an extremely limited number of possibilities inherent in this particular historical conjuncture ?
After all , the apparently wide and powerful influence of the Leveller party among the rank and file of the New Model army may be seen as having been largely illusory .
As the historian H. Shaw points out :
... their influence grew or diminished according to the prevailing political situation .
Thus , in 1648 , just before Pride 's Purge , when the Grandees wanted allies , the Levellers appeared powerful ; at Ware and Burford , when the Grandees wanted to exert their authority , the party 's real weaknesses are exposed . [ 99 ]
Why was this ?
For such a vocal and apparently widespread movement to be so treated must imply that something was seriously amiss with its internal cohesion .
Brailsford can of course claim , perhaps a little sentimentally , that the Levellers never really died at all , but merely faded away , and were in fact still at the height of influence in 1649 . [ 100 ]
We can list factors behind the defeat : the consolidation of power in the Rump ; mitigation of economic hardship to some extent , thus relieving the plight of the urban and rural poor ; programmatic weaknesses ( and the partial co-option of their program by the Grandees in 1648 ) ; exclusion of the wage - labouring class ( if we accept Macpherson 's thesis ) from the Leveller franchise ; lack of unity -- and behind that the disparity of the social forces that the party was supposed to represent .
All these factors have truth in them ; they are , however , at root variations on the same theme -- the peculiar weaknesses in social composition of the Levellers .
It was , as Hill maintains , a movement that represented an exceptionally amorphous class -- the petty bourgeoisie ; a class congenitally incapable of organising itself effectively , because of the fragmented and diversified character of its role in production .
[ 101 ]
The Levellers ' primary stronghold was among the rank and file of the New Model .
This point is crucial -- for this was precisely an artificial environment produced by the wholly unusual circumstances of the Civil War .
Here radical political ideas could flourish among an amorphous class temporarily unified .
[ 102 ]
However , the New Model army was not mobilised to fight the class battles of the small proprietor , but those of the bourgeoisie .
Thus the Leveller movement , although extremely articulate , and possessed of capable , even brilliant , leaders , could not win hegemony over the social forces that made the English revolution .
For much of their political lives , the Levellers were limited to petitioning the existing regime ( the bourgeois Grandees ) , staging flamboyant court appearances , [ 103 ] and organising elaborate funerals for their martyred followers .
They were , in short , a party of protest . [ 104 ]
The demise of the Levellers left the field in the New Model army to increasingly wild and improbable millenarian sects .
The most prominent of these were the Fifth Monarchists , who believed that the reign of Christ was shortly to begin . [ 105 ]
The ascendancy of such tendencies in the rank and file of the army marked a trend away from political organisation and activity , towards reliance on the ``second coming '' -- it was the signal of defeat for the whole radical left wing of the English revolution .
Apart from a few sporadic risings during the 1650s , [ 106 ] the dominant movement was towards quietism , as with the Quakers .
After 1660 , this movement became even more pronounced as Puritanism turned into non-conformity .
Diggers
One group deserves special attention however -- the Diggers , or True Leveller movement -- which developed possibly the most sophisticated political philosophy of any of the left - wing tendencies , through the thought of Gerrard Winstanley .
Although expressed in ``the Biblical idiom which Winstanley shared with almost all his contemporaries '' , [ 107 ] his ideas mark a distinct departure from Leveller ``possessive - market ' ' assumptions , to the standpoint of the propertyless , agricultural labourer .
Winstanley 's program called for the settlement of common land by the poor , and its collective cultivation .
[ 108 ]
A small Digger colony was established in April 1649 on St. George 's Hill in Surrey .
The colony did not operate for long before it was driven off the land , [ 109 ] but the writings of Winstanley , published as Digger manifestos , survive as significant political tracts .
Winstanley postulated a primitive libertarian communism . [ 110 ]
He regarded the clergy as propagandists in the service of the exisiting property system . [ 111 ]
Winstanley 's profound idea of economic equality , based on a communal organisation of society , formed the important legacy handed down by the Diggers to the working - class movements of the future .

This issue has been the subject of a number of books and articles .
The politico - religious dichotomy is discussed by J.C. Davis , `` The Levellers and Christianity ' ' , in Brian Manning ( ed. ) , Politics , Religion and the English Civil War ( London , 1973 ) : religion is considered primary .
See also D.W. Robertson 's The Religious Foundations of Leveller Democracy ( New York , 1951 ) , which comes to the rather vacuous conclusion that ``Levellerism was not a religious movement strictly speaking , but the movement got its impetus and much of its sustained strength from the Christian faith ' ' , p.122 .

85 . Another important factor was the rise of empirical science in the 17th century .
See Hill , Intellectual origins of the English Revolution ( Oxford , 1965 ) : `` In the eighty years before 1640 England , from being a backward country in science , became one of the most advanced ' ' , p.15 .
This development was obviously not unconnected with the rise of capitalism .
Hobbes was the first to systematically apply empiricist methodology to political theorising : see Hill , ``Thomas Hobbes and the Revolution in Political Thought ' ' , in Puritanism and Revolution , pp.267-89 .
By the time of Locke , the theorist of the Whig Revolution , one could say that the bourgeoisie had effectively harnessed secular political theory for its own purposes .
86 . Two historians of the Levellers , at least , have implied this : J. French , The Levellers ( Harvard , 1955 ) notes the ``centrifugal tendency '' inherent in Calvinism ( and thus the explanation for the tendency to split ) , p.4 . Shaw , The Levellers , notes its ``dual nature ' ' , p.3 .
87 . Hill , Century of Revolution , p.121 .
Brailsford , The Levellers and the English Revolution considers that ``Cromwell was never the pioneer of toleration .
To his opponents ... Cromwell was never tolerant .
What he felt , in spite of unessential differences , was a sense of fraternity for all his fellow Puritans .
The name for that state of mind is not tolerance . ''
Hill disagrees , estimating Cromwell as on the left on religious issues : see God 's Englishman , p.75 .

90 . A.L Morton 's critique , ``Leveller Democracy -- Fact or Myth ? '' , in The World of the Ranters : Religious Radicalism in the English Revolution ( London , 1970 ) makes a few useful points , e.g. that the Leveller documents were not `` ... merely abstract statements of political theory -- they were party programmes , weapons in an active political campaign and modified from time to time in accordance with the changing situation and the practical needs of the struggle .
It is therefore necessary to look at them not only from the standpoint of political theory , as Professor Macpherson seems too inclined to do , but in relation to the events then actually taking place ' ' , p.202 .
This comment includes a necessary thrust against Macpherson 's methodological standpoint .
The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism is not a work of history as such , but a book attempting to re-evaluate 17th century political ideology by means of close logical argument and textual exegesis .
Any limitations the book has are definitely suffered in general by empiricist ``political science ' ' .
In other points he raises , Morton seems to misunderstand Macpherson 's arguments , and his final position is a mere statement of faith : ``I find it impossible to believe , with the whole evidence of their lives and writings before me , that when they spoke of ' the people ' , or the ' free - born commons of England ' or ' the poorest that lives ' , these men intended in principle the tacit exclusion of any part of the English nation , whatever exceptions might in practice be demanded by existing circumstances '' , p.219 .
Morton appears to be quite unaware that at least one half of that ` English nation ' was not only most certainly excluded from the Leveller franchise , through all its phases ( see Macpherson , The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism , p.296 ) , but also from his own consideration -- women .

For an uncritical view of the Levellers in this light , see A.D. Lindsay , The Essentials of Democracy ( Oxford , 2nd ed. , 1935 ) , pp.11 - 19 , and compare this view with Ashley 's remark that they ``left practically no intellectual mark upon subsequent political thinking '' , Oliver Cromwell and the Levellers , p.539 .

The director James Cameron is six feet two and fair , with paper - white hair and turbid blue - green eyes .
He is a screamer — righteous , withering , aggrieved .
“ Do you want Paul Verhoeven to finish this motherfucker ? ” he shouted , an inch from Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s face , after the actor went AWOL from the set of “ True Lies , ” a James Bond spoof that Cameron was shooting in Washington , D.C. ( Schwarzenegger had been giving the other actors a tour of the Capitol . )
Cameron has mastered every job on set , and has even been known to grab a brush out of a makeup artist ’s hand .
“ I always do makeup touch - ups myself , especially for blood , wounds , and dirt , ” he says .
“ It saves so much time . ”
His evaluations of others ’ abilities are colorful riddles .
“ Hiring you is like firing two good men , ” he says , or “ Watching him light is like watching two monkeys fuck a football . ”
A small , loyal band of cast and crew works with him repeatedly ; they call the dark side of his personality Mij — Jim backward .
The pressures on Cameron are extreme , never mind that he has brought them on himself .
His movies are among the most expensive ever made .
“ Terminator 2 ” was the first film to cost a hundred million dollars , “ Titanic ” the first to exceed two hundred million .
But victory is sweeter after a close brush with defeat .
“ Terminator 2 ” earned five hundred and nineteen million around the world , and “ Titanic , ” which came out in 1997 , still holds the record for global box - office : $ 1.8 billion .
Cameron is fifty - five .
It has been twelve years since he has made a feature film ; “ Avatar , ” his new movie , comes out on December 18th and will have cost more than two hundred and thirty million dollars by the time it ’s done .
He started working on it full time four years ago , from a script he wrote in 1994 .
“ Avatar ” will be the first big - budget action blockbuster in 3 - D ; Cameron shot it using camera systems that he developed himself .
He is a pioneer of special effects : the undulating water column of “ The Abyss ” and the liquid - silver man of “ Terminator 2 ” helped to inspire the digital revolution that has transformed moviemaking in the past two decades .
The digital elements of “ Avatar , ” he claims , are so believable that , even when they exist alongside human actors , the audience will lose track of what is real and what is not .
“ This film integrates my life ’s achievements , ” he told me .
“ It ’s the most complicated stuff anyone ’s ever done . ”
Another time , he said , “ If you set your goals ridiculously high and it ’s a failure , you will fail above everyone else ’s success . ”
George Lucas popularized space opera ; Steven Spielberg has perfected awe .
Cameron ’s movies , soaked in sweat and blood and scorched by apocalyptic flames , have romance at their molten cores .
Some of his most memorable characters — Sarah Connor , the heroine of the “ Terminator ” movies ; Ellen Ripley , of “ Aliens ” — are mothers .
The writing is a genre of its own : “ tech - noir , ” Cameron called it after “ Terminator ” ; his late - period style is more like gear - head schmaltz .
“ IN THE BLACKNESS we hear the lonely ping of a bottom sonar , ” the beginning of his treatment for “ Titanic ” reads .
“ Then two faint lights appear , close together . . . growing brighter .
They each resolve into clusters of lights , which are soon revealed to be two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES , falling toward us .
We are somewhere in the ocean deep , looking up at two subs freefalling like express elevators .
. . .
Soon they are fireflies , then stars .
Then gone . ”
Spielberg says , “ He gets a lot of points for being a techno - brat , but he is a very emotional storyteller . ”
“ With ‘ Avatar , ’ I thought , Forget all these chick flicks and do a classic guys ’ adventure movie , something in the Edgar Rice Burroughs mold , like John Carter of Mars — a soldier goes to Mars , ” Cameron told me .
The hero of “ Avatar , ” Jake Sully ( Sam Worthington ) , is a paraplegic ex-marine who travels to Pandora , a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system , where there is a human colony .
Humans ca n’t breathe the air on Pandora ; Jake lies in a casket - like vessel , while his consciousness , projected into an “ avatar ” — Vishnu - blue and nine feet tall , like the native population , the Na’vi — explores Pandora ’s rich interior .
It is a fantasy about fantasy , about the experience of sitting inert in the dark while your mind enters another world .
Set roughly a hundred and twenty - five years in the future , “ Avatar ” is , like most speculative science fiction , a cautionary tale .
Humans have turned Earth into a wasteland and , in their pursuit of a precious superconductor called Unobtanium , are beginning to do the same to Pandora .
Jake , through his avatar , falls in love with a Na’vi princess , who teaches him to live in harmony with nature , and then he leads her people in an insurrection against the colonists .
“ Of course , the whole movie ends up being about women , how guys relate to their lovers , mothers — there ’s a large female presence , ” Cameron said .
“ I try to do my testosterone movie and it ’s a chick flick .
That ’s how it is for me . ”
This summer , addressing an auditorium filled with thousands of teen - age boys at Comic - Con , in San Diego — an annual convention of science - fiction , action - adventure , and fantasy fans — he made his identification with the fair sex complete .
When someone in the audience asked about his next movie , he replied , “ You know , it ’s not a great time to ask a woman if she wants to have other kids when she ’s crowning . ”
Cameron behaves as if he were the embattled protagonist of one of his own films — an ordinary Joe beaten on the anvil of extraordinary trials .
“ The words ‘ No ’ and ‘ That ’s impossible ’ and phrases like ‘ That ca n’t be done ’ — that ’s the stuff that gives him an erection , ” the actor Bill Paxton , who has worked with Cameron since the early eighties , says .
Cameron reserves a special quotient of his anger for suits who get in his way .
“ Tell your friend he ’s getting fucked in the ass , and if he would stop squirming it would n’t hurt so much ” was the message he once told a Fox producer to deliver to an executive at the studio .
He sees himself as essentially outside and other and alone ; he bites the hand that feeds .
“ Even though he knew I was on his side , nobody ’s ever on his side , ” Bill Mechanic , who ran Fox Studios during the making of “ Titanic , ” said .
“ It ’s like you ’re in the trenches and your infantry - mate is shooting at you , even if you ’re the only one there who can save his life . ”
There is a chivalric aspect to Cameron ’s antagonism ; he figures his struggles in heroic terms .
“ I try to live with honor , even if it costs me millions of dollars and takes a long time , ” he says .
“ It ’s very unusual in Hollywood .
Few people are trustworthy — a handshake means nothing to them .
They feel they ’re required to keep an agreement with you only if you ’re successful , or they need you .
I ’ve tried not to get sucked into the Hollywood hierarchy system .
Personally , I do n’t like it when people are deferential to me because I ’m an established filmmaker .
It ’s a blue - collar sensibility . ”

Cameron was born in Canada , and grew up in a small town not far from Niagara Falls .
( He revoked his application for American citizenship after Bush won the election in 2004 . )
His father was an engineer for a paper company ; his mother brought up five children , and told stories of racing stock cars and joining the women ’s auxiliary of the Canadian Army .
Jim was the oldest , the ringleader of his siblings and the other kids in the neighborhood .
“ There was always some new thing that absolutely needed to get done , whether it was building a fort or an airplane or launching rockets , ” he told me .
“ We made it in the papers once , for a U.F.O. sighting over a hot - air balloon that we built and launched at night that was powered by candles . ”
His hero was Jacques Cousteau , and although he lived four hundred miles from the ocean , he became obsessed with scuba .
He learned to dive in Buffalo one February in a Y.M.C.A. pool .
At fourteen , Cameron saw the movie that made him want to make his own : Stanley Kubrick ’s “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey , ” the first cinematically exquisite treatment of what had traditionally been B - movie material .
“ I saw all these cool spacecraft and I wanted to know how the visual effects were done , ” he said .
“ I started building my own models of spaceships , from the ‘ 2001 ’ model kit and the ‘ making - of ’ book , which was quite thick and well researched . ”
After he finished making “ True Lies , ” Cameron called Kubrick , by then a recluse , and invited himself over .
They spent a day , in the basement of Kubrick ’s house in the English countryside , watching “ True Lies ” at Kubrick ’s flatbed editing station .
Cameron went over the shots — Schwarzenegger in a Harrier jet firing a missile , with the villain attached to it , through an office building and into a helicopter : boom !— so that Kubrick could learn how the effects were done .
When Cameron was seventeen , his father was transferred to Southern California , and the family moved to Brea , a small city in Orange County .
He had left Canada without a high - school diploma , and started taking classes at Fullerton Junior College , supporting himself by working as a precision tool - and - die machinist .
“ My dad was a college graduate , ” he said .
“ But , see , I did n’t want to do the things he thought I should — you know , something good , like engineering . ”
He dropped out , and , when he was twenty - three , married a woman who worked as a waitress at a Bob ’s Big Boy .
For a while , he drove a truck for a local school district .
In archetypal terms , this was his period of exile and self - denial , the refusal of the call .
“ I just became this blue - collar guy , ” he said .
“ But I was constantly thinking as an artist , so I ’m painting , drawing , writing , thinking about visual effects and filmmaking . ”
In Brea , Cameron met William Wisher and Randall Frakes , who also wanted to make movies , and who are still his two best friends .
Eventually , they raised the money to make a short film , “ Xenogenesis , ” starring Wisher as a futuristic man in an orange jumpsuit who battles an armored robot with a metal pincer for a hand .
It got Cameron a job sculpting models for Roger Corman in L.A .
Corman ’s studio — a training ground for filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola , Martin Scorsese , and Jonathan Demme — specialized in low - budget genre films .
Cameron distinguished himself immediately , and soon he was designing sets .
He was focussed — often working through the night — and he was scrappy .
“ He ’d take all these random parts — Winnebago parts , industrial dishwashing racks , Sonotubes , a lot of paint — and turn them into an incredible set , ” Paxton , who worked for Corman as a set dresser , recalled .
For “ Battle Beyond the Stars , ” Corman ’s takeoff on “ Star Wars , ” Cameron was asked to design the spaceships .
“ His sketches were brilliant , ” Corman said .
“ The best of that type of work that I had ever seen . ”
Each spaceship reflected the character of its pilot , and also Cameron ’s instinct for the iconic , literal image ; to the mother ship , Nell , he gave a curvaceous shape and a pair of heaving breasts .
James Cameron does n’t go to the bathroom ; he goes to the head .
In his universe , there is no front and back , right and left , just fore and aft , starboard and port .
He is still an avid scuba diver ; when there are sharks in the water , he says , he ’s the first one in .
Free - diving , he has held his breath for more than three minutes and reached a depth of a hundred and ten feet .
( “ You feel like a denizen of the deep , if only for a second , ” he says .
“ Plus , diving below the scuba divers , I like just to see the look on their faces . ” )
He used to have a JetRanger helicopter , and owns a slew of dirt bikes , three Harleys , a Ducati , and a Ford GT — “ basically a race car with a license plate ” — in classic blue - and - white livery .
In Corvettes , he has favored triple black — black body , black interior , black top .
For pleasure , he designs submersibles ; the one he ’s working on now can go to thirty - six thousand feet , and he hopes to use it to explore the Mariana Trench , the deepest spot on earth .
He signs his missives “ Jim out , ” and , when he ’s working , a deep mechanical roar , like a Navy klaxon , summons him to the stage .
“ Dive ! dive ! dive ! ” he said , an intent look in his eyes , when I asked him what the signal meant .
I first met Cameron in April of 2008 .
“ Avatar ” was in its third year of production .
For much of that time , Cameron had been working out of a couple of hangars in Playa del Rey , south of Los Angeles .
He was sitting in his office , a small room at the edge of one of the hangars , beside a bust of a feline - looking blue alien covered in bioluminescent spots : Neytiri , the Na’vi princess .
“ Our leading lady , ” Cameron called her , or just “ the blue chick . ”
He was wearing a T - shirt that said “ Scubapro ” and had a pair of earphones around his neck .
Despite moviegoers ’ associations of 3 - D with schlocky horror films and animated stuff for kids , Cameron said he was resolved to work in the medium : “ It gives you more of a sense of participation , involvement , and immersion .
You feel like you ’re bearing witness , and that makes the journey feel more real . ”
It was also a business decision .
Having developed the camera technology , he knew that only a high - profile movie , such as “ Avatar ” promises to be , would accelerate the conversion of theatres .
“ I said , ‘ They know the product .
They better get ready . ’
It was a little bit cheeky — a leap of faith that the screens would be there for us . ”
That spring , there were about fifteen hundred 3 - D screens in the United States ; by December , there will be three times that many .
( “ Avatar ” will also have a wide release in 2 - D. )
There was a knock at the door .
“ I have to go make a shot , ” Cameron said .
He walked swiftly toward the floor of the hangar , a vast industrial space that he referred to as “ the performance - capture volume . ”
The stage floor , furnished with just a low riser , had been painted battleship gray .
Zoë Saldana , who plays Neytiri , stood among a group of actors wearing black unitards covered with reflective white dots : a retro vision of the computer age , Pilobolus style .
The ceiling was studded with black - and - white surveillance cameras that tracked the actors ’ movements and positioned their performances inside a digital set — in this case , a Na’vi battle camp deep in the rain forest , where Jake ’s avatar is preparing the warriors to fight with bows and arrows against the high - tech human war machines .
Saldana wore a special head rig fitted with a tiny camera that floated inches from her face , to capture her expressions in minute detail : the movements of her facial muscles , the contractions of her pupils , the interaction of her teeth , lips , and tongue .
The data uploaded to a dozen computers banked around the room , which translated the movements of the actors onto the physiques of their digital characters , and fed the images , along with the digital set design , into the eyepiece of Cameron ’s “ virtual camera ” — essentially , a viewfinder with a monitor .
For him , it was like directing a live - action shoot on Pandora .
Saldana , who is five feet seven , performed in his eyepiece as a nine - foot alien in a rain forest .
On cue , the actors began to make strange trilling sounds , ejectives and glottal stops and rolled “ r”s : Na’vi .
Cameron stopped the scene .
“ When Jake goes ” — Cameron uttered a mellifluous sentence in Na’vi — “ you go , ‘ Whoop !
Whoop ! ’ ”

Back in his office , Cameron played an unfinished scene from “ Avatar ” on a large screen .
The renderings were crude , like paper cutouts : the graphic sophistication of a nineteen - nineties video game .
Neytiri — hipless , lean , with proportions to make Barbie look like a Cabbage Patch Kid—crouched on a tree limb high above the forest floor .
She spotted Jake ’s avatar for the first time , and took aim .
The next shot was much more evolved .
Neytiri ’s skin was tactile and radiant ; her eyes were huge and green and flecked with light , like five - dollar marbles from Conran .
“ This is ninety or ninety - five per cent done , ” Cameron said .
“ By the way , we did n’t have the equipment when we started this .
It took nine months to build the computer model and to get it right .
It ’s incredibly computationally complex , but now we ’re able to replicate the interaction of muscle under skin . ”
He stopped the footage on a closeup of Neytiri ’s face .
“ She exists only as a big string of ones and zeroes , ” he said , as if he could not quite believe it himself .
“ Computing a single frame of this takes thirty hours . ”
He paused .
“ Everybody in this building has had more college than I have . ”
All directors have a God complex ; Cameron takes his unusually seriously .
For “ Avatar , ” he worked with a linguist to develop the Na’vi language , inspired by fragments of Maori he picked up in New Zealand years ago .
He based Pandora , and its myriad flora ( spike tears , cliff slouchers , stinger ivy ) and fauna ( direhorses , banshees , slinths ) , partly on the creatures of the coral reefs and kelp forests he has seen at the abyssal depths .
He hired a team of artists to execute his ideas , but reserved one creature for himself : the thanator , a six - legged black pantherlike beast , twenty - four feet long , covered in plate scales , with a reptilian double set of jaws and a threat display resembling that of a fan lizard .
“ The thanator is the baddest , meanest predator the planet had to offer , ” Neville Page , the lead creature designer , said .
“ As Jim put it in the treatment , a thanator can eat an Alien for dessert .
He wanted to outdo himself , outdo the Alien Queen . ”

The UK alone produces 400 million tonnes of waste each year , most of which ends up festering in landfill sites .
Packaging ( mainly plastics , paper , glass and aluminium ) makes up a large chunk of this waste , but so much of it used these days is unnecessary .
With climate change now a priority for so many , it ’s perhaps surprising that the amount of packaging used each year is on the rise .
A preoccupation with cleanliness , however , is fuelling ever - greater demand for packaged food products and other goods .
While wrapping meat , for example , demonstrates good hygiene , packaging individual bananas and dried fruits is clearly insane !
Most are not isolated incidents , but evidence of the systemic overuse of packaging materials by many of the biggest multinationals .
Above all , over - packaging is an environmental problem , but lest we forget it ’s the consumer who must pay for its disposal and spending 15 minutes needlessly unwrapping a tiny item is unbelievably frustrating !
Below you ’ll find 10 examples of packaging gone mad .
1. Bananas
Image : Scrapthispack
The only thing that ’s bananas about these bananas is the ridiculous way in which they ’ve been packaged .
The best thing about a banana is that it comes with its own biodegradable shrink - wrapping , so why on Earth would anyone want to wrap each one again in plastic and polystyrene ?
2. Sunsweet Prunes
Image : 365 Healthy Eats
In case you did n’t already know , a prune is a dried fruit .
Yes , that ’s right , it ’s a fruit devoid of moisture , meaning it takes absolutely ages to go off !
Packaging individual prunes is not only a complete waste of plastic and time ( both for the wrapper and the un-wrapper ) , it ’s a waste of money too .
3. Memory Card
Image : Boltron
Order a new memory card off the internet and you expect it to arrive in a nice , little envelope , padded for protection .
You certainly do n’t expect it come in a 4ft long cardboard box , surrounded by wrapping paper , as if it were a priceless artefact … or a landmine .
4. Roses
Image : TimShoesUntied
I can’t quite put my finger on it , but there ’s something very sad about this image .
Perhaps it ’s that these plastic - smothered roses are unable to share their beauty and scent with the world ; or maybe it ’s that the image symbolises the oppression of nature by manmade materials .
Either way , it ’s a ridiculous use of packaging !
5. 2GB Flash Drive
Image : Consumerist ( bottom image )
Imagine the excitement you ’d experience if the postman greeted you one morning with this enormous Dell box .
You ’d think you ’d been sent a new laptop by mistake , or at least an external hard drive !
No , it ’s just that 2GB flash drive you ordered last week , dwarfed by its enormous box .
6. Power Cord
Image : Technabob
Without doubt , this is one of the most absurd examples of over - packaging we ’ve ever seen .
Not only has this power cord been shipped by HP in a box fit for a fridge , it ’s been sent on a 10kg wooden pallet .
7. 32 Sheets of Paper
Image : The Register
HP is to blame , yet again , for this woeful waste of cardboard .
The order : 16 software licenses .
The packaging : 17 boxes - one massive box with 16 smaller ones inside , each containing 2 measly pieces of paper .
8. Mouse
Image : The Register
This mouse completes our HP trilogy of waste .
Note the lengths ( and expense , no doubt ) that HP has gone to , to ensure this mouse , an item measuring no more than 12 cm in length , arrives in one piece .
Not only is it packaged in its own box , which provides quite sufficient protection in itself , but it ’s bound to a wooden pallet by a plastic sheet .
9. Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade
Image : Microsoft
Unfortunately for software manufacturers , their products are often very tiny and very dull to look at .
To make up for this , such companies tend to package their goods in massive , brightly coloured boxes in an attempt to attract the eyes of consumers .
The Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade , for example , is nothing more than a serial code in a big shiny box .
It does come with a CD as well , but you do n’t really need that either .
10 . Apple DisplayPort Adaptor
Image : Gizmodo
When it comes to overpackaging , and despite their best efforts , Apple can be every bit as wasteful Microsoft .
Note the size of the box they use to ship their Mini- Diplay Port - to - DVI adapter in .
It ’s bigger than the MacBook’s !
two million
,
If there 's one thing that struck me deep with the Ondoy experience is the thought that there are simply too many Filipinos .
We 're hitting 98 million , and will reach the 100 million mark in less than two years .
That 's more mouths to feed and more bodies to shelter .
How can our 300,000 square - kilometer country possibly handle the stress ?
According to the CIA website , our birth rate is approximately 26 births per thousand people .
Our death rate is approximately 5 deaths per thousand .
Doing simple math , we 're piling up aboutnew Filipinos a year .
Two million is more or less the population of Taguig , Las Pinas , Paranaque and Mandaluyong combined .
The average age of the Philippine population is 22 years old .
This means most of our population is either still in college , trying to find jobs , or starting out in their careers .
If they can't find jobs , they 'll be among the seven million who are unemployed .
( Seven million is over half the population of Metro Manila . )
Plus , when these people are able to afford homes , where will these homes be ?
During the week after the flooding , a man on the radio made a comment about the tragedy that beset Provident Village in Marikina City .
The man said that maybe the river was reclaiming what was rightfully hers .
Another friend said that Eastwood City , which was n't spared by the rising waters , should not have been built there in the first place .
And what about those subdivisions buried by landslides ?
More people translates to more trash and more land use .
If we do n't curb population growth , reduce waste , and free up the land that Nature requires for her to breathe , we should expect to see more nature - related tragedies .
Nature has been good to usbut we 've taken her kindness for granted and are paying for it .
The simple solution is to reduce our population growth rate to a negative .
Right now we stand at approximately 1.96 % .
( Countries like Japan , Russia , Germany and Italy have negative growth rates . )
Reducing our population growth rate will be a tremendous undertaking , but we do n't have much of a choice .
I had imagined a child asking her parents , " If you 're having a hard time taking care of me , why did you make me ? "

Was our oldest ancestor a proton - powered rock ?
We may never be able to prove beyond any doubt how life first evolved .
But of the many explanations proposed , one stands out – the idea that life evolved in hydrothermal vents deep under the sea .
Not in the superhot black smokers , but more placid affairs known as alkaline hydrothermal vents .
This theory can explain life ’s strangest feature , and there is growing evidence to support it .
Earlier this year , for instance , lab experiments confirmed that conditions in some of the numerous pores within the vents can lead to high concentrations of large molecules .
This makes the vents an ideal setting for the “ RNA world ” widely thought to have preceded the first cells .

If life did evolve in alkaline hydrothermal vents , it might have happened something like this :
1 .
Water percolated down into newly formed rock under the seafloor , where it reacted with minerals such as olivine , producing a warm alkaline fluid rich in hydrogen , sulphides and other chemicals – a process called serpentinisation .
This hot fluid welled up at alkaline hydrothermal vents like those at the Lost City , a vent system discovered near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in 2000 .
2 .
Unlike today ’s seas , the early ocean was acidic and rich in dissolved iron .
When upwelling hydrothermal fluids reacted with this primordial seawater , they produced carbonate rocks riddled with tiny pores and a “ foam ” of iron - sulphur bubbles .
3 .
Inside the iron - sulphur bubbles , hydrogen reacted with carbon dioxide , forming simple organic molecules such as methane , formate and acetate .
Some of these reactions were catalysed by the iron - sulphur minerals .
Similar iron - sulphur catalysts are still found at the heart of many proteins today .
4 .
The electrochemical gradient between the alkaline vent fluid and the acidic seawater leads to the spontaneous formation of acetyl phosphate and pyrophospate , which act just like adenosine triphosphate or ATP , the chemical that powers living cells .
These molecules drove the formation of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – and nucleotides , the building blocks for RNA and DNA .
5 .
Thermal currents and diffusion within the vent pores concentrated larger molecules like nucleotides , driving the formation of RNA and DNA – and providing an ideal setting for their evolution into the world of DNA and proteins .
Evolution got under way , with sets of molecules capable of producing more of themselves starting to dominate .
6 .
Fatty molecules coated the iron - sulphur froth and spontaneously formed cell - like bubbles .
Some of these bubbles would have enclosed self - replicating sets of molecules – the first organic cells .
The earliest protocells may have been elusive entities , though , often dissolving and reforming as they circulated within the vents .
7 .
The evolution of an enzyme called pyrophosphatase , which catalyses the production of pyrophosphate , allowed the protocells to extract more energy from the gradient between the alkaline vent fluid and the acidic ocean .
This ancient enzyme is still found in many bacteria and archaea , the first two branches on the tree of life .
8 .
Some protocells started using ATP as well as acetyl phosphate and pyrophosphate .
The production of ATP using energy from the electrochemical gradient is perfected with the evolution of the enzyme ATP synthase , found within all life today .
9 .
Protocells further from the main vent axis , where the natural electrochemical gradient is weaker , started to generate their own gradient by pumping protons across their membranes , using the energy released when carbon dioxide reacts with hydrogen .
This reaction yields only a small amount of energy , not enough to make ATP .
By repeating the reaction and storing the energy in the form of an electrochemical gradient , however , protocells “ saved up ” enough energy for ATP production .
10 .
Once protocells could generate their own electrochemical gradient , they were no longer tied to the vents .
Cells left the vents on two separate occasions , with one exodus giving rise to bacteria and the other to archaea .

Was our oldest ancestor a proton - powered rock ?
I am in possession of an early build of DS game Scribblenauts and an imagination .
I mixed the two yesterday morning to try to clear one of the game 's levels .
It required multiple re-thinkings .
Advertisement
To set this up you need to know that Scribblenauts is a Nintendo DS game developed by 5th Cell and published by Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment , slated for release in the U.S. on September 15 .
The 2D game 's hook is that it allows players to type in just about any kid - safe concrete noun ( no proper names ) , and the game will render it .
Objects rendered can be used by the game 's hero , Maxwell .
Living things that are created have rudimentary intelligence , so a vampire might attack , say , a police man .
Advertisement
The game has puzzle levels and action levels , both of which involve collecting a star piece called a Starite .
In the action levels , the Starite is shown in the level and the player has to figure out how to get it for Maxwell .
In the puzzle levels , which this post is about , the Starite will appear only when each level 's condition is met .
I uploaded a video to show you a fly - through of Scribblenauts ' 11th level in its first world .
The goal was to collect three flowers without dying , destroying the flowers or letting a girl who is holding a basket and awaiting the flowers die .
Attempt 1 : Created bear to attack bee buzzing over first flower , so I could safely grab the flower .
Bear killed bee .
Bear then killed Maxwell .
Level failed .
Attempt 2 : Made bear ; bear killed bee .
Laid down bear trap .
Died .
Level failed .

Attempt 8 : Made gun .
Shot bee dead .
Gun disappeared .
Made gun again .
Approached piranha lake .
Attempted to shoot piranha dead .
Bad shooting angle and touchy controls prevented this .
Either was too far away and shooting into ground ( game was connecting Maxwell 's gun to fish in straight line ; allowing me to select a " shoot " prompt when tapping on piranha , even though trajectory was blocked .
New idea : Made corpse .
Threw corpse into piranha lake .
Piranha attacked corpse .
Dove for flower .
Piranha finished corpse and ate Maxwell .
Level failed .
Attempt 9 : Made gun .
Shot bee dead .
Made hand grenade .

Jumped out .
Put lake flower in basket .
Starite found !
Success !
I had fun figuring this one out .
It was ranked as being of mid-level difficulty .
The interface impressively recognized whatever I typed into it .
Maxwell 's touch - based movement controls took some getting used to ... better to touch the part of the ground where you want him to stop then just touching the general direction you want him to move .
And item - wielding sometimes turned into accidental item - tossing , since both using and tossing are based on tapping the screen .
Small frustrations .
The level was a delight .

I just wish beekeepers were braver people .
The UN climate change treaty , signed in 1992 , committed the world to avoiding " dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system " .
Yet , since that time , greenhouse gas emissions have continued to soar .
The US has proved to be the biggest laggard in the world , refusing to sign the 1997 Kyoto protocol or to adopt any effective domestic emissions controls .
As we head into the global summit in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto protocol , the US is once again the focus of concern .
Even now , American politics remains strongly divided over climate change – though President Barack Obama has new opportunities to break the logjam .
A year after the 1992 treaty , President Bill Clinton tried to pass an energy tax that would have helped the US to begin reducing its dependence on fossil fuels .
The proposal not only failed , but also triggered a political backlash .
When the Kyoto protocol was adopted in 1997 , Clinton did not even send it to the US Senate for ratification , knowing that it would be rejected .
President George Bush repudiated the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and did essentially nothing on climate change during his presidency .
There are several reasons for US inaction – including ideology and scientific ignorance – but a lot comes down to one word : coal .
No fewer than 25 states produce coal , which not only generates income , jobs and tax revenue , but also provides a disproportionately large share of their energy .
Per capita carbon emissions in US coal states tend to be much higher than the national average .
Since addressing climate change is first and foremost directed at reduced emissions from coal – the most carbon - intensive of all fuels – America 's coal states are especially fearful about the economic implications of any controls ( though the oil and automobile industries are not far behind ) .
The US political system poses special problems as well .
To ratify a treaty requires the support of 67 of the Senate 's 100 members , a nearly impossible hurdle .
The Republican party , with its 40 Senate seats , is simply filled with too many ideologues – and , indeed , too many senators intent on derailing any Obama initiative – to offer enough votes to reach the 67 - vote threshold .
Moreover , the Democratic party includes senators from coal and oil states who are unlikely to support decisive action .
The idea this time around is to avoid the need for 67 votes , at least at the start , by focusing on domestic legislation rather than a treaty .
Under the US constitution , domestic legislation ( as opposed to international treaties ) requires a simple majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to be sent to the president for signature .
Getting 50 votes for a climate change bill ( with a tie vote broken by the vice president ) is almost certain .
But opponents of legislation can threaten to filibuster ( speak for an indefinite period and thereby paralyse Senate business ) , which can be ended only if 60 senators support bringing the legislation to a vote .
Otherwise , proposed legislation can be killed , even if it has the support of a simple majority .
That will certainly be true of domestic climate change legislation .
Securing 60 votes is a steep hill to climb .
Political analysts know that the votes will depend on individual senators ' ideologies , states ' voting patterns , and states ' dependence on coal relative to other energy sources .
Based on these factors , one analysis counts 50 likely Democratic yes votes and 34 Republican no votes , leaving 16 votes still in play .
Ten of the swing votes are Democrats , mainly from coal states ; the other six are Republicans who conceivably could vote with the president and the Democratic majority .
Until recently , many believed that China and India would be the real holdouts in the global climate change negotiations .
Yet China has announced a set of major initiatives – in solar , wind , nuclear , and carbon - capture technologies – to reduce its economy 's greenhouse gas intensity .
India , long feared to be a spoiler , has said that it is ready to adopt a significant national action plan to move towards a trajectory of sustainable energy .
The two nations have agreed to co-ordinate efforts on renewable energy and research , and the US is under growing pressure to act .
With developing countries displaying their readiness to reach a global deal , could the US Senate really prove to be the world 's last great holdout ?
Obama has tools at his command to bring the US into the global mainstream on climate change .
First , he is negotiating side deals with holdout senators to cushion the economic impact on coal states and to increase US investments in the research and development , and eventually adoption , of clean coal technologies .
Second , he can command the Environmental Protection Agency to impose administrative controls on coal plants and automobile producers even if the Congress does not pass new legislation .
The administrative route might turn out to be even more important than the legislative route .
The politics of the US Senate should not obscure the larger point : America has acted irresponsibly since signing the climate treaty in 1992 .
It is the world 's largest and most powerful country , and the one most responsible for the climate change to this point , it has behaved without any sense of duty – to its own citizens , to the world , and to future generations .
Even coal state senators should be ashamed .
Sure , their states need some extra help , but narrow interests should not be permitted to endanger our planet 's future .
It is time for the US to rejoin the global family .

I 'd love to be able to say Dragon Age is a sure thing , because I truly want the game to be good , but I have serious doubts about the game .
In your case , it 's probably especially sketchy , since this game has always been touted as the spiritual successor to the Infinity Engine games ( Baldur 's Gate ) , though I would say it looks quite a bit different from what little gameplay I 've watched .
The combat looks like a cross between that and games like KOTOR , though those were really old videos , and I 've made it my goal since to avoid seeing the game too much so as to not spoil the experience .
$ 40 is tough to pass up , though .
I 'm sure the game wo n't be bad , it just might not be the masterpiece it 's trying to be built up to be .
The other thing you should consider is what comes in the packaging , and what you'd be missing out on with a digital - only download .
Also , thanks for reminding me .
I 've got to start thinking about pre-ordering , myself .

Australia has moved into second position , behind the United Kingdom and ahead of the United States , in the World Economic Forum 's ranking of global financial centres .
The forum released its second annual Financial Development Report on Friday , ranking 55 of the world 's leading financial systems and capital markets .
The forum said global financial centres still led the rankings , but the effects of the global financial crisis had pulled down most countries ' scores compared to last year .
'' The United Kingdom , buoyed by the relative strength of its banking and non-banking financial activities , claimed the index 's top spot from the United States , which slipped to third position behind Australia largely due to poorer financial stability scores and a weakened banking sector , '' the forum said .
Australia rose to second place in 2009 , from 11th in 2008 and was the only country in the top five to record a rise in its score .
Once again the bonuses paid to bankers have made the headlines , this time with the chancellor 's speech to the Labour party conference .
Pay in the financial sector has always been an emotive issue , and now it is a political issue as well , but beyond the public pronouncements much work has already been done to create a significantly better regime here in the UK .
Although pay is one of the hot - button issues this party conference season , the real reasons for the credit crunch are widely understood among the politicians .
International standards were n't resilient enough , complex products were incorrectly rated , regulators both here and elsewhere did not catch the problems and economies were grown on debt using cheap credit from the east .
We would not deny that bonuses need to be addressed , but we would make a plea that the public be offered a wider perspective on how the credit crunch happened and how we can best ensure it does not happen again .
As an industry , we agree that change must be made .
In fact a great deal of change has taken place already , and in the UK that includes the regulation of bank pay structures .
Our Financial Services Authority has already introduced regulation on pay , which is more than any other country has done .
And it has won commitments from the major UK banks that no bonuses will be paid in the coming year unless the bonus structure has been agreed with the regulator .
This regulation includes important things like linking pay to long - term performance , meaning that staff only get rewarded if the right job is done .
We agree that remuneration and bonuses need to be tied to the long - term success of the business and not for rewarding foolhardy risk - taking or flash - in - the - pan results .
We do not agree that this means imposing an arbitrary ceiling on bonuses .
The UK industry needs the flexibility to attract , reward and retain the best talent there is .
Banking is after all a global business and the brightest can – and will – move to where the best deals are found .
It is a pity that bankers ' remuneration has become such a political dog - whistle issue because if the UK is serious about remaining at the forefront of the world 's financial services industry , we need to work together to ensure pay deals reflect the need to reward success .
We do not want to create holes through which talent can drain away to our competitors .
Other countries want what we have got .
It is important to remember that although bank - bashing may win politicians votes , it will not keep Britain its jobs .
On Date 2 , Taxpayer had a physician advised double mastectomy to address medical conditions X and Y .
On Date 3 , Taxpayer gave birth to a healthy child .
Due to her double mastectomy , Taxpayer was unable to breastfeed her child and had to purchase infant formula to meet the baby 's nutritional needs .
...
Rev. Rul .
55-261 , 1955 -1 C.B. 307 , holds that the cost of special foods and beverages qualifies as a deductible medical expense if the foods or beverages ( a ) are prescribed by a physician for alleviation or treatment of a specific illness , ( b ) are in addition to the taxpayer 's normal diet , and ( c ) in no way are a part of the nutritional needs of the patient , and if a statement as to the particular facts and to the food or beverage prescribed is submitted by a physician .
However , when that special food or beverage is taken as a substitute for food or beverage normally consumed by a person to satisfy normal nutritional requirements , the expense is personal and is not deductible as a medical expense
Rev. Rul . 2002 - 19 , 2002 -16 I.R.B. 778 , holds that individuals participating in a weight loss program may not deduct the cost of purchasing reduced - calorie diet food because the foods are substitutes for the food the individual would normally consume to satisfy nutritional requirements .
Rev. Rul. 2002 - 19 cites to and restates the holding of Rev. Rul. 55 -261 .
In Massa v. Commissioner , T.C. Memo 1999 - 63 , aff'd without published opinion 208 F.3d 226 ( 10th Cir. 2000 ) , the Tax Court found that the petitioner , who suffered from Crohn 's disease , failed to establish that his special diet was other than a substitute for a normal diet .
The court was not convinced that his diet , although followed for medical reasons , differed from the diet of an ordinarily health conscious individual .
The court rejected taxpayers ' claims for deductions for special foods which were found to be merely substitutes for foods normally consumed by an individual .
The court held that the petitioner was not entitled to a medical expense deduction for his diet .
In the instant case , Taxpayers ' child is a healthy baby .
The formula satisfies the baby 's normal nutritional needs .
Therefore , the infant formula is properly viewed as food that the infant would normally consume and use to satisfy its nutritional requirements .
Unless the formula meets the criteria under Rev. Rul. 55 - 261 , the expense of the formula is a nondeductible personal expense under § 262 .
Therefore , the infant formula is properly considered food for the infant , and is not a medical expense as that term is defined under § 213 .
Accordingly , Taxpayer 's request to treat expenditures for infant formula for a healthy infant as a medical expense under § 213 is denied .
Lessons in Disaster
There ’s an unofficial book club in the White House these days , George Stephanopoulos reported late last month , and the manuscript in question could not be more pertinent .
As the Obama administration rethinks its strategy in Afghanistan , officials are turning to Gordon M. Goldstein ’s Lessons in Disaster — an account of analogous moments of decision in the Vietnam War .
And though most historical comparisons are approximations at best , the resemblance between those crucial Vietnam inflection points and today are uncanny : Casualties are rising , public opposition is growing , the host government ’s legitimacy and effectiveness is in doubt , and the U.S. commander in the field is calling for more troops to stave off defeat .
Surely , if Obama has a Vietnam moment , it will come in Afghanistan .
And that ’s precisely what Goldstein ’s White House readers might be trying to avoid .
Below follows an excerpt of one lesson they might learn , which Goldstein calls " Never Deploy Military Means in Pursuit of Indeterminate Ends " :
In the spring of 1995 , McGeorge Bundy asked me to collaborate with him on a retrospective analysis of the American presidency and the Vietnam War during his tenure as national security advisor to presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson .
We envisioned the book to be both a memoir of Bundy ’s experience with Kennedy and Johnson as well as a reconstruction of the pivotal presidential decisions about American strategy in Vietnam between 1961 and 1965 .
But the project was fatefully interrupted .
Bundy died of a heart attack a year and half into our collaboration .
A front - page obituary in the New York Times called Bundy " the very personification of what the journalist David Halberstam … labeled ‘ The Best and the Brightest ’ : the well - born , confident intellectuals who led the nation into the quagmire of Vietnam . "
Although the McGeorge Bundy who reigned as a legend of the establishment was reputed to be brisk , quick , calculating , and overconfident , the retrospective Bundy of 30 years later — the one with whom I spoke so many times — was in many ways the opposite : patient , reflective , curious , and humble .
In fact , on the question of Vietnam Bundy appeared tentative and unsure — maybe on some level even mystified .
Although he never said so explicitly , he seemed to be as perplexed by the disaster of Vietnam as any of the historians who studied the decisions in which he had been a central participant .
Three decades after his own role in the war ended — he left the White House in 1966 to head the Ford Foundation — he was still asking himself questions about its lessons .
" What can we say is the most surprising ? "
Bundy wondered in a fragment he composed on February 3 , 1996 , as he and his wife Mary returned from a holiday in the Caribbean .
His answer : " The endurance of the enemy . "
It was a dynamic of the war that fascinated him .
Bundy marveled at the leadership of the insurgency , its political strength inside South Vietnam , the stamina of the armed forces of the Vietnamese communists , and the social cohesion that bound these variables together into an equation that allowed a small power , among the poorest countries in the world , to triumph over the United States .
When I began working with him on our book project , Bundy was still struggling to understand how the Johnson administration had committed itself to a strategy that would devolve into a contest of endurance Americans were destined to lose .
Beginning in 1965 the United States deployed considerable and escalating numbers of ground combat forces in a protracted effort to grind down the enemy — depleting its numbers , breaking its will , and compelling its surrender or negotiated settlement on terms favorable to the United States .
That strategy was , of course , a great failure .
And Bundy later asked himself , " Do we discuss whether we are in fact well - equipped to conduct a war of attrition ?
I do n’t think that question is ever presented to Lyndon Johnson in the whole of the year in which that strategy is adopted . "
***
It was June 14 , 1965 , and Johnson reached out to former President Eisenhower for his counsel on the Vietnam War .
A decision was looming over whether to expand the U.S. troop commitment to the conflict .
Eisenhower advised not only supporting South Vietnamese forces in action but also urged direct offensive action by American troops .
" We have got to win , " he said .
Meanwhile , the debate among Johnson ’s advisors was growing .
" In raising our commitment from 50,000 to 100,000 or more men and deploying most of the increment in combat roles we are beginning a new war — the United States directly against the Viet Cong , " Under Secretary of State George Ball warned President Johnson .
" Perhaps the large - scale introduction of American forces with their concentrated fire power will force Hanoi and the Viet Cong to the decision we are seeking .
On the other hand , " he presciently cautioned , " we may not be able to fight the war successfully enough — even with 500,000 Americans in South Vietnam — to achieve this purpose . "
Ball confronted President Johnson with lessons from recent history .
" The French fought a war in Viet - Nam , and were finally defeated — after seven years of bloody struggle and when they still had 250,000 combat - hardened veterans in the field , supported by an army of 205,000 Vietnamese . "
Ball ’s dissent was aggressively countered by the administration ’s hawks .
Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara strenuously argued that if South Vietnam fell , Thailand would be lost , too .
Rusk envisioned a wave of falling dominoes — even India would collapse under the control of the Chinese communists .
The top U.S. commander in Vietnam , Gen. William Westmoreland , delivered a bleak report from the front .
" The struggle has become a war of attrition , " he declared on June 24 .
" Short of decision to introduce nuclear weapons against sources and channels of enemy power , I see no likelihood of achieving a quick , favorable end to the war . …
I am becoming more convinced every day that U.S. forces in appropriate numbers must be deployed to permit the Vietnamese with our help to carry the war to the enemy . "
The next day , guerrilla fighters launched one of their most spectacular terrorist acts yet , exploding a bomb in the My Canh floating restaurant and killing 44 .
Against this backdrop of gathering anxiety , McNamara circulated a draft memorandum that would set the terms of debate over further escalation .
He formally joined the Joint Chiefs in urging the president to approve General Westmoreland ’s proposed expansion to a 44 - battalion force in South Vietnam — 34 U.S. maneuver battalions and 10 third - country maneuver battalions totaling approximately 175,000 men .
A major escalation of U.S. forces , he argued , would force the insurgents " to accept a situation in the war in the South which offers them no prospect of an early victory and no grounds for hope they can simply outlast the US . "
Gen . Earle Wheeler , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , asked General Westmoreland directly if the escalation would be sufficient to break the insurgency .
The " direct answer to your basic question is ‘ no , ’ " he replied , admitting that the 44 battalions would not " provide reasonable assurance of attaining the objective . "
Thus on the eve of the largest and most fateful expansion of the U.S. ground force commitment to Vietnam , the architect of that troop surge told the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that it simply would not be sufficient to achieve the stated American goal of persuading the insurgency that its victory was impossible .
The stage was set for what should have been the seminal debate of the Vietnam War .
Ball seized on the inherent uncertainty surrounding the 44 - battalion deployment and its implicit strategic assumptions .
McNamara had thrown his support behind an enormous expansion of the American commitment .
And General Westmoreland , the principal advocate of the 44 - battalion strategy , clearly conceded that the new American combat commitment could not assure the achievement of its stated objective .
Where was Bundy positioned at this juncture ?
Frustrated by a deteriorating relationship with President Johnson , he was on the precipice of resigning as national security advisor .
Ironically , the national security adviser ’s differences with Johnson had little to do with the substance of Vietnam policy .
For Bundy , icon of the establishment and the administration ’s fiercest debater , silence in response to criticism of the White House policy in Vietnam and Southeast Asia was untenable .
The critics of the war , Bundy recalled , " were feeling deliberately cut off from and rejected by an administration with whom they were trying to communicate in good faith . "
So although he knew that Johnson would be infuriated , Bundy agreed to appear on a one - hour primetime television debate to be broadcast without commercial interruption by CBS News on the evening of June 21 .
" I informed him after the decision had been made and told him I just could n’t live with myself if I did n’t do it , " Bundy explained in a 1969 oral history .
What Bundy never said but should have retrospectively acknowledged was that his decision to go around Johnson ’s back to appear on the CBS Vietnam debate was tantamount to submitting his letter of resignation .
When he read in the press that Bundy had agreed to the CBS debate , Johnson was enraged .
LBJ told his aide , Bill Moyers , that he should inform Bundy that the president would be " pleased — mighty pleased , " to accept his resignation .
Moyers did not act on the president ’s instruction .
Johnson ’s resistance to explaining and defending the administration ’s policy exasperated Bundy .
If the new offensive were not " more quickly decisive than we had any clear reason to expect , " Bundy said , there would be disturbing consequences when the public " looked back and asked themselves if they had been led openly into this war or somehow bamboozled into it . "
Bundy acknowledged that every president , including giants like Lincoln and Roosevelt , sought to communicate in a way that achieved the greatest political impact .
Yet Johnson aspired for more .
The president had " this really quite funny internal belief " that he could reshape facts to serve his interests .
Johnson believed that " if he could get it stated his way in the papers it would be that way . "
Although the national security advisor had reached the breaking point in his relationship with President Johnson , neither man could afford a public dustup , particularly as a major escalation decision loomed .
Just six days after appearing on CBS , Bundy was back advising the president .
" The commitment " to Saigon , Bundy explained on June 27 , " is primarily political and any decision to enlarge or reduce it will be political .
My own further view is that if and when we wish to shift our course and cut our losses in Vietnam we should do so because of a finding that the Vietnamese themselves are not meeting their obligations to themselves or to us . "
Bundy ’s support for the war was balanced with nuanced skepticism .
On the one hand , he dismissed critics who believed the United States was now emulating the disastrous course France followed in Vietnam .
Still , on June 30 , Bundy confided his concerns about the Westmoreland plan to Secretary of Defense McNamara .
Bundy challenged the assumption that conventional combat forces would be effective in containing the insurgency .
" I see no reason to suppose that the Viet Cong will accommodate us by fighting the kind of war we desire . "
Moving to " a 200 thousand - man level " of support , Bundy warned , was " a slippery slope toward total US responsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the Vietnamese side . "
The impact of Bundy ’s critique , however , was largely vitiated by the fact that it was directed toward McNamara rather than the president or the broader team of advisors responsible for strategy in Vietnam .
So as the two stark choices confronting Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam crystallized — the 44 - battalion plan advocated by Westmoreland and McNamara or the withdrawal option espoused by Ball — a third course was proposed .
It was the so - called middle way envisioned by Bill Bundy , the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and McGeorge ’s brother , who proposed a force level of 18 battalions and 85,000 men .
" In essence , " he explained , " this is a program to hold on for the next two months , and to test the military effectiveness of US combat forces and the reaction of the Vietnamese Army and people to the increasing US role . "
Anticipating Johnson ’s response to the three options , McGeorge Bundy wrote to the president , advising him to choose between the two levels of escalation , rejecting Ball ’s suggested pullout .
Bundy had a reputation for skillfully aborting dissent when he deemed it necessary , and he was a practiced expert at maneuvering for advantage among competing bureaucracies .
Bundy had , for example , previously undermined the secretary of state .
" He is not a manager , " Bundy advised the president about Rusk in early 1965 .
" He has never been a good judge of men .
His instincts are cautious and negative .
… the Secretary has little sense of effective operation . "
Johnson , meanwhile , continued to reach out to key constituencies , probing where the balance of opinion could be found .
Just minutes before meeting with his senior Vietnam advisors on July 2 , the president consulted Eisenhower .
" Do you really think we can beat the Vietcong ? " Johnson asked .
Eisenhower advised Johnson to proceed with a troop buildup as soon as possible .
" We are not going to be run out of a free country we helped to establish , " Eisenhower declared .
By July 14 , with a decision yet to be made , McNamara departed for South Vietnam .
His mission , Bundy retrospectively concluded , was to negotiate a deal with the U.S. military commander in Saigon on the minimum size of the forthcoming escalation .
Johnson ’s overarching priority was to achieve agreement , absent a fractious debate , on a course of action that would sustain South Vietnam from collapse but not disrupt his legislative agenda in Congress .
Political stagecraft — creating the appearance of deliberation when a decision had already been made — was the presumptive purpose of a White House meeting Johnson convened on the morning of July 21 .
Addressing the administration ’s war council , McNamara concluded that the United States had only three strategic options , two of which would leave the United States in a deplorable geopolitical position .
President Johnson could choose to " cut our losses and withdraw under the best conditions that can be arranged — almost certainly conditions humiliating the United States and very damaging to our future effectiveness on the world scene . "
Alternatively , Johnson could hold steady at roughly the current level of 75,000 troops , but that would leave the United States terminally weakened and " almost certainly would confront us later with a choice between withdrawal and an emergency expansion of forces , perhaps too late to do any good . "
The only viable choice , McNamara argued , was a substantial expansion of offensive U.S. military pressure against the Vietcong and Hanoi — supplemented by vigorous diplomacy .
Such an approach , he predicted , " would stave off defeat in the short run and offer a good chance of producing a favorable settlement in the longer run , " although it would also render " any later decision to withdraw even more difficult and even more costly than would be the case today . "
McNamara was vague , however , in delineating the causal logic of his proposed strategy , positing the escalation not as the military means to a military objective but simply as an end in itself .
Preliminary discussion among the president ’s advisors seemed to anticipate that McNamara ’s recommendation would be accepted .
President Johnson , eager to project a ruminative state of mind , arrived after 40 minutes of discussion and unleashed a wave of questions ranging from the existential to the logistical .
Then he asked , " Is anyone of the opinion we should not do what the memo says ? "
This was Ball ’s cue to register his dissent .
" I can foresee a perilous voyage , " he said , " very dangerous — great apprehensions that we can win under these circumstances .
But let me be clear , if the decision is to go ahead , I ’m committed . "
Rusk regretted the failure to act earlier .
" We should have probably committed ourselves heavier in 1961 , " he said .
Henry Cabot Lodge , who would return as the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam at the end of the summer , bemoaned the dysfunctional nature of the regime .
" There is no tradition of a national government in Saigon , " he said .
" I do n’t think we ought to take this government seriously . "
When discussion resumed that afternoon , Ball was given the floor to present his challenge to the Pentagon escalation plan .
" We ca n’t win , " he contended .
" The most we can hope for is a messy conclusion . "
Continuing to prop up the Saigon regime , he also warned , was tantamount to " giving cobalt treatment to a terminal cancer case . "
Ball proposed that the United States devise a political strategy to stimulate a withdrawal of its military forces from South Vietnam .
" The worst blow , " Ball replied , " would be that the mightiest power in the world is unable to defeat guerrillas . "
Bundy refused to engage Ball ’s counterargument , once more invoking the credibility imperative .
" The world , the country , and the Vietnamese would have alarming reactions if we got out , " he said .
Achieving victory was apparently less important than the perception of pursuing it .
" There will be time to decide our policy wo n’t work after we have given it a good try , " Bundy insisted .
" We wo n’t get out , " Ball retorted .
" We ’ll double our bet and get lost in the rice paddies . "
Reviewing Ball ’s prediction three decades later , Bundy conceded : " He ’s right . "
What struck Bundy most in looking back on the discussion of July 21 , 1965 , he told me , was a quality of unreality to the deliberations , because Johnson had already communicated his approval of Westmoreland ’s 44 - battalion strategy to McNamara on July 17 .
The essential decision had already been sealed .
Johnson " wants to be seen having careful discussions , " said Bundy .
One of the consistent themes of Bundy ’s Vietnam counsel as national security advisor was his support for deploying military means in pursuit of indeterminate and primarily political ends .
Bundy wanted a military commitment that evinced U.S. credibility even if it did not hold real promise of winning the war .
The adoption of attrition as the de facto U.S. military strategy was determined , in part , by the absence of other viable options .
And by that metric , U.S. forces did in fact succeed in imposing severe losses on the insurgency .
The United States presumed that a crossover point would be reached , when the accumulated pain of war would compel the insurgents to relent .
But in practice this coercion strategy simply created an endurance contest .
In that competition it was not the will of the Vietnamese communists that was broken .
For each year of combat from 1965 to 1973 , Bundy observed , the United States inflicted far greater casualties on the enemy than it absorbed .
Yet despite this dramatic disparity , it was the United States that withdrew its forces " home without victory . "
As Bundy starkly confessed , " We had followed a losing strategy — one that led us not to success but to the acceptance of failure .
Attrition is a brutal measuring stick , " he affirmed .
" Its use is not advertised and its authorship not eagerly claimed . "
How far would Bundy have gone in holding himself accountable for the lack of rigor that characterized the evaluation of military strategy ?
Bundy was often bluntly critical of himself , and he was equally critical of Johnson for authorizing a muddled military mission .
He proclaimed his " deep conviction " that in the pursuit of a flawed strategy in Vietnam , " the decisive errors were those made or approved by the president as commander - in - chief . "
When in 1995 he finally decided to address the unresolved questions of the Vietnam War , Bundy registered a starkly different point of view from his years in power .
He called Vietnam " a war we should not have fought " and conceded that " on the overall issue — are you for the war or against it , in 1965 and after , the doves were right . "
Bundy would therefore try to explain " the ways in which the executive branch continuously got that great choice wrong — not because it wanted the long , hard war it got , but because it would repeatedly reject the hard alternative of ‘ losing to the Reds . ’ "
Bundy in retrospect had embraced a quality he had lacked when in high office three decades earlier .
He had finally learned humility .

In hill country from Iowa to the Scottish Highlands , sky - gazers have reported some strange , ominous - looking clouds of late .
Dubbed undulatus asperatus ( turbulent undulation ) , the atmospheric anomaly could be headed where only 80 - odd clouds have gone before : into the International Cloud Atlas .
If it makes the cut , asperatus will be the first new addition in more than 50 years .
Where did it come from ?
Gavin Pretor - Pinney , president of the UK - based Cloud Appreciation Society , has a theory : " It 's warmer , moister air above and colder , drier air below , with an abrupt boundary in between . "
Add wind passing over rolling terrain and " you get the same wavy effect as on the surface of water . "
The formation has probably been around for a long time , but it 's only now getting attention : " Before the Internet and digicams , people might have mentioned it to a few friends and that would be it , " Pretor - Pinney says .
" Once the news got out , I was inundated with emails saying , ' I saw it three years ago ; here 's the picture ! ' "
He 's charting those images against atmospheric conditions to document the cloud 's unique characteristics .
The next step : Storm Geneva to seek formal recognition from the World Meteorological Organization .

Back in June , when the PS3 Slim was just a theory and Firmware 3.0 was a distant dream , conjecture and rumors where flying around as to what features would be included in the update .
While most of them seemed rather vague and untrustworthy , British gaming site VG247 announced , with unprecedented confidence , that “ grief reporting , reputation system , background patches , multiple audio outputs and more ” would be coming to the PS3 in a “ huge overhaul ” , which was compared to the Xbox 360‘s NXE in some respects .
September 1st came and passed , gamers eagerly downloaded Firmware 3.0 , but unfortunately most of these features where not included .
Now , new evidence has been uncovered that points to these features having been merely delayed or possibly included in firmware 3.0 .
On the Uncharted 2 European Multiplayer Beta terms and conditions page it says “ to report any other breach of the PSN Terms of Service or these terms , please let us know by using the in - game grief reporting facility or at http://ps3reporting.com”.
Often terms of service for betas are taken from the final version of the game , one that may have been created with the new firmware in mind .
While grief reporting alone may not be one of the most requested and wanted features , the possible addition of a reputation system and background patches should be a welcome extra for PlayStation users .
It is very possible that in - game grief reporting may have already been placed as a background feature in the 3.0 update which must be utilized by developers , much like 2.40 ’s in - game music option .
Adding further credence to this supposition , is the fact that the multiple audio outputs feature was rumoured by VG247 , and then secretly released by Sony .
On the other hand , in their haste to bring Firmware 3.0 out at the same time as the PlayStation 3 Slim launch , it is entirely possible that all these features where delayed as they where not sufficiently ready .
Law enforcement sources directly connected with the death of DJ AM tell us that his death was the result of an accidental overdose and not a suicide -- and there is a tragic , ironic twist of fate .
Our sources say DJ AM , a recovering addict , developed a dependency to Xanax and other benzodiazepines ( a group of drugs used to treat anxiety ) as a direct result of the plane crash a year ago .
We 're told AM ( aka Adam Goldstein ) developed a tremendous anxiety over flying -- something he had to do frequently for his job .
We 're told doctors began prescribing Xanax and other anti-anxiety medications to relieve his fear , but the benzos triggered a relapse into addiction .
We 're told benzos are particularly dicey for recovering addicts .
Our sources say DJ AM 's relapse was " recent " -- he was not abusing for a prolonged period of time before his death .
We 're also told the OD had " absolutely nothing to do with his recent breakup . "
Our sources say the evidence strongly indicates cause of death will be a combination of crack cocaine and benzos .
For a lower - middle class boy from Liverpool , a plate of egg and chips at five o'clock was not the done thing , recalls Laurie Taylor in his weekly column .
It was the egg and chips which first made me realise that Jim lived in a different world .
We 'd gone back to his terrace house in Bootle one day after school and were sitting at the table in the back room when his dad came home from a long shift on the railways .
I remember him saying " Hello " as he saw his son and me at the table but he then vanished into the tiny kitchen .
FIND OUT MORE Hear Laurie Taylor 's Thinking Allowed on Radio 4 at 1600 on Wednesdays or 0015 on Mondays
Or listen to it here on the iPlayer Jim and I went on chatting for a few minutes about school and Liverpool 's chances in the coming Saturday game until suddenly his dad re-appeared and without a single word placed a big plate of egg and chips and a steaming sugary mug of tea in front of each of us .
The egg and chips were delicious .
No doubt about it .
And the tea was just great .
But even as I followed Jim 's example and finger dipped my chips in the runny yolk I felt confused by their sudden appearance .
Had Jim exchanged some hidden sign with his dad that said he was ready for egg and chips and tea ?
And why had I been automatically included ?
And why had it been so readily assumed that I wanted or even liked egg and chips ?
And why had no one even asked how much sugar I wanted in my mug of tea ?
And why , come to think of it , were we so happily wading into such a substantial meal at just after five in the afternoon ?
Of course , the answer to all these questions was quite straightforward .
Jim and his dad were working class .
And members of the working class at that time thought it completely natural to eat five o'clock in the afternoon .
But even more , as members of the working class they took it for granted that everyone else ate at that time and would happily regard egg and chips and tea as the perfect meal for the occasion .
Terraced life
How different from my own dear lower middle - class home where eating a heavy meal in the late afternoon would have been regarded as dangerously close to a satanic rite .
Neither would my mother have ever tolerated egg and chips on her dinner table , or , even , in her wildest dreams , have allowed any member of the family to accompany any meal at all with a mug of steaming tea .
Reading Hoggart did make me wonder why not one of my Bootle friends had ever expressed any personal pleasure at the way they lived their lives
The more time I spent with Jim the more I came to realise the taken - for - granted aspect of so much of the terraced life around him .
In Jim 's road everyone seemed to smoke Woodbines , read the Daily Mirror , take coach trips to Blackpool to see the lights , have a regular flutter on the horses , eat tins of assorted biscuits , drink mild and bitter ( " mixed " ) , and finish off any evening out with a bag of fish and chips .
No - one I knew in my road in Crosby did any of these things .
I realised , of course , that it was hard cash which determined some of these choices , but I also sensed that everybody did much the same as everybody else because that was a way of saying that you were n't too posh or stuck up or different .
When I went on from school to college in Kent and began to talk in this way about working class life in Liverpool I was accused of being sentimental and romantic .
My new friends pointed out the sins of the working class - their drunkenness and violence and sexism .
At the time I was snobbish enough to accept much of this argument .
I began to wonder how I could ever have seen life in Bootle as somehow worth celebrating .
But at the end of my first year I came across a copy of Richard Hoggart 's Uses of Literacy .
I read every word , placing ticks in the margin to record the similarities between life in my Bootle and his Hunslet .
And I insisted on reading out chunks to my snooty new friends .
Compare this , I said imperiously , with your own isolated , miserable , bourgeois lives .
But reading Hoggart did make me wonder why not one of my Bootle friends had ever expressed any personal pleasure at the way they lived their lives .
Had they been no more able than I was to see its great strength and vitality ?
And then one day in the early 70s I heard the perfect answer .
The Liverpool sculptor , Arthur Dooley , was talking on the radio about the destruction of even more Liverpool terraces .
The architect who was responsible for this latest bout of demolition sought to justify his action by telling Dooley that not one of the residents had complained about being moved out to the new tower block estates on the edges of the city .
Dooley was not convinced .
" Let me tell you this , " he said in his strong Liverpool accent , " there 's no - one as easy to rob of their culture as those folks that do n't know they 've got one . "
Here is a selection of your comments .
My mother came from a strong working - class background and chips and egg were at staple part of our diet in the 1980s , eaten between 5 - 6 pm .
I 've always found it shocking that people turn their noses up and such delights .
Clearly they do n't know what they 're missing out on .
Chips and egg always remind me of that scene in the film Shirley Valentine : classic .
Jonathan Taylor , Bury , Lancs , UK Jim 's life in Bootle sounds very similar to my upbringing , although my mother made it very clear that I was n't to talk about eating " tea " at 5 pm ( it was " dinner " , not " tea " ) outside of the house .
In an example of this , on one occasion , when I was about seven or eight years old , my mother and I went to visit a friend of her 's and we stayed for tea ( egg and chips ! ) and there was bread and butter on the table to go with it .
When it came to clearing up I innocently asked , " should I leave the bread on the table " and when asked why , I replied " well , for pudding " .
In our house " pudding " was very often bread and butter with jam .
My mother was mortified and made lots of noises about me being " silly " and " fanciful " and " I do n't know where she came up with that one ! " .
I , completely unaware at my faux pas , protested vehemently and got a spanking for my trouble .
Nowadays I eat " dinner " between 7 - 8 pm and only have " tea " when I go to my friends ' houses .
I suppose my mother 's attitude must have rubbed off on me more than I realised .
Charlie Boyd , Edinburgh I could n't help but notice that the fried egg in the picture had been given a middle - class makeover .
Rather than chips and brown sauce it is served on wholemeal bread , accompanied by mushrooms and sprinkled with black pepper .

The 5 pm " tea " ( on a weekly rota , I especially fondly remember the jacket spuds and corned beef with iceberg lettuce / cucumber / tomato salad on a Thursday ) at my grandparents was timed because it was just after my Granddad had got in from a hard days " graft " and was ravenous .
It makes sense , he would be heading to bed at about 9 pm for a 5 am start so eating later would lead to indigestion and a poor sleep .
I often think my husband and I eat too late now and would prefer to eat earlier .

This article reminds me of the linguistic nuances of growing up in London in the 80s and 90s : the kids on the estates used to refer to both lunch and the evening meal as " dinner " ; the lounge ( as it was to me ) was the " front room " ; at home was " indoors " .
Karl Chads , London Growing up , I was always given my tea ( evening meal ) at around the 5 - 6 pm time , a time I thought was very natural for tea .
I then moved in with friends from south Liverpool who thought it was very uncouth to dinner at this hour .
I now starve myself until later in the evening to fit in .
Ian , Liverpool , UK Sweetened tea actually makes me sick , but egg and chips was my favourite meal when we had it at home ( a once a week treat in my house ) .
However I was a bit shocked when invited to a friend 's house and fed the same meal to find that , unlike my mother who used vegetable oil cooled , strained and filtered back into a bottle kept in the fridge , my friend 's family allowed the fat to solidify in a pan which they kept on the cooker and simply reheated every night .
The food tasted just fine but ... yuk .

When I was five , back in 1969 , my wealthy middle class family had some sort of crisis which prevented anyone from getting me from school , so I was met by their cleaner Mrs O'D - who took me back to her house , put me in her garden with a football ( a treat for a girl ) and then brought out fried egg , chips and a cup of sweet tea .
" Poor mite , " she said , " they jus do n't feed your proper . "
It was wonderful - food completely banned at home , plus a football .
My mother utterly disapproved , but the automatic kindness of Mrs O'D and that delicious meal has long stayed with me .
I knew it was a different world - and I knew too , that " ours " was n't better then hers either .

My father stoked boilers at a coal pit - but on summer evenings we went on family walks in a local park or nearby countryside .
My sister and I felt socially deprived because we could n't sit on the pub steps waiting for crisps and lemonade like our pals - while the air was filled with the sound of the piano and singing - and the " madeleine " smell of beer and cigarette smoke .
ChrisJK , UK I am " working class " , at least I used to be .
Grew up in a council house on a rough estate that 's been pulled down now , and thank god for that .
It 's very easy to see the romance in a life style that you are not required to take part in , unless you want to .
Of course there is a " culture " but it is not always a good one .
Working class environments can be choiceless , hopeless and dark , with few ways out .
I would like to know what happened to Jim ?
Did he go to college ?
Get to debate cultural and bourgeois issues ?
I was lucky enough to pass the 11 + and work my way out of a lifestyle that none of my family willingly stayed within , once they had a choice .
Choice is the key , and being " middle class " , with all the baggage the term carries with it , gave more choice than a traditional working class life .
I think its funny that so many people carry on about how wonderful the old working class lifestyle was , but so very few people want to live it .

Five o'clock tea - egg and chips and a mug of tea perfectly sum up what life was like growing up in working class Liverpool .
Tea time was governed by my fathers arrival at home which you could set the clock by , after his walk home from the factory .
We used to stand at the front door of our terraced house , look up the long road and once we saw Dad appear in the distance , give the signal to Mum to get the chip pan on .
Yes , we all had tea at 5 o'clock in our road , we had never heard of having a meal later than this , and as for calling it " dinner " ...

U.S. Woman Wins ' Best Experience in the World , ' Then Vanishes No sign of the U.S. who won Australia 's " best experience in the world . "
LONDON , Oct. 15 , 2009  --
Would you pass up the " best experience in the world ? "
One woman is close to doing so .
On Oct. 9 , a U.S. woman beat out more than 23,000 contestants to win Tourism Queensland 's Best Experience in the World competition in which she and three friends would enjoy an all - expenses paid vacation to the Queensland islands in Australia 's Great Barrier Reef .
But the woman is nowhere to be found and the trip of a lifetime may still be up for grabs .
" Tourism Queensland has sent her e-mails and has tried to call her several times since the draw on Friday but has n't made contact yet , " Steve McRoberts , Tourism Queensland 's marketing director , said in a news release .
Tourism Queensland officials are giving the U.S. winner until Oct. 23 to claim her prize or else they will be forced to redraw .
The competition began at the end of August and generated tremendous enthusiasm abroad .
Tourism Queensland said entries closed last Wednesday and were received from more than 150 countries around the world including Venezuela , Bosnia , Guatemala , Costa Rica and Trinidad .
The competition was created to spur interest in island caretaker Ben Southall 's blog .
Southall was a winner of another one of Tourism Queensland competitions , the Best Job in the World .
Southall 's prize would be to live in a fantastic house on a paradise island in Australia 's Great Barrier Reef for six months and get paid $ 110,000 to do it .
His only requirement would be to write a weekly blog on his experience .
Southall was one of 34,000 people to apply for the role of island caretaker .
In his application video , Southall expressed a love for adventure , and featured photographs of himself riding an ostrich , running a marathon , scuba diving and kissing a giraffe .
Southall 's sense of adventure and passion for the job paid off and wowed the Australian tourism bureau .
" From the time he was announced in the Top 50 , and then the Top 16 , Ben has excelled in showing a true passion for Queensland , " Queensland Tourism Minister Peter Lawlor said in a statement .
" His ideas for how he will make the role his own ... plus his initiative and ability to rise to a challenge impressed the selection panel and secured his place in the top job . "
Tourism Queensland : Competition Hype Helping Australian Economy
Before assuming the role as blogging beach bum , Southall told ABC's Nick Watt , " Well , it 's going to be tough .
Yes , it 's going to be horrible learning how to sail , how to dive , to go bush walking . "
Since Southall began blogging in July , the 34 - year - old charity fundraiser has kept himself busy exploring the wonders down under .
The idea of creating the island caretaker role has helped inject millions of dollars into the Australian tourism industry during a tough economy , Tourism Queensland CEO Anthony Hayes said .
" We think we 've just ticked over $ 110 million in international publicity and probably another , hopefully , $ 20 or $ 30 million coming this week , " he said .
Likewise , the Best Experience in the World competition has been successful in drumming up interest in Australian tourism .
" Since the competition was announced , we 've seen a spike in visitation and interest in Ben 's blog , with more than 180,000 people visiting www.islandreefjob.com since the competition was launched " Aug. 26 , Tourism Queensland 's McRoberts said .

Rep. Ron Paul has been an opponent against the Democrat ’s plan to reform health care .
Paul believes that programs like Medicaid , Medicaid , and Veteran ’s care could be better provided by private insurance .
“ It does n’t make any sense .
It ’s a total failure to run anything by a bureaucracy , it always costs more and the services are always less favorable , ” Paul told CNN ’s Kiran Chetry .

“ I would like to see with the government out completely because that would be a much better system , ” said Paul .
But he knows the reality is that government will continue to provide some health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid .
“ You do n’t want to cut under these [ economic ] conditions medical care from poor people who have been dependent or the elderly .
I would cut from overseas spending I would cut from these trillions and trillions of dollars that we have spent over the years and bring our troops home so that we can finance it . ”

Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) said Friday that it was the " correct move " for House lawmakers to investigate Countrywide , the beleaguered mortgage lender from which he received several loans .
Critics have targeted Dodd and other lawmakers for more than a year for receiving special treatment from Countrywide .
As part of a broader investigation , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said Friday that it would subpoena documents about loan practices from Countrywide .

" I welcome a fair examination of Countrywide ’s business practices and those of other lenders , " Dodd said in a statement .
The Senate Ethics Committee earlier this year said Dodd did not violate any ethics rules in the case .
" In my case , the bipartisan ethics committee found that my rates and terms were standard and that there was no special deal , " Dodd said .
" It 's clear that this once - respected company has not had the cleanest track record , and I believe it 's important that we have a better understanding of their business practices .
This is the correct move by the House Oversight Committee .
"
The oversight committee is investigating a wide range of companies , including Bank of America , which now owns Countrywide ; Wells Fargo , JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup , Residential Capital ( GMAC ) , and U.S. Bank Home Mortgage .
Rep. Darrell Issa ( Calif. ) , the ranking Republican on the oversight committee , has strongly pushed the committee to investigate Countrywide for the VIP program run by former chief executive Angelo Mozilo .
"
We need to clarify unanswered questions about Countrywide Financial 's VIP program , so I am issuing a subpoena to gather information about how that program worked and whether it provided special benefits to government officials , " said Rep. Edolphus Towns ( D - N.Y. ) , chairman of the oversight panel .
The oversight panel late on Friday evening issued a subpoena to Bank of America for documents related to the VIP program at Countrywide .
Towns said he intends to pursue the investigation in a " bipartisan fashion . "
Issa indicated that there had been differences about how to draft the subpoena , but he said the move on Friday night would allow the investigation to proceed .
The subpoena is for a wide range of documents related to the VIP program .
The subpoena indicates that the documents must be released by Nov. 6 .
Bank of America said it discontinued the VIP program when the bank acquired Countrywide in July 2008 .
" While we place the highest priority on customer confidentiality , we are obliged by Congress to respond to this subpoena , " Bank of America said in a statement .
" We will continue to cooperate with the committee as it discharges its oversight responsibilities . "

For example , if you want to browse website anonymously you will need to install a web browser which uses TorProxy such as Shadow ( see below ) .
Shadow is an Android application that allows you to browse the Web anonymously from your mobile phone .
The Shadow browser requires TorProxy ( see above ) to do this .
In addition to using the Tor network to anonymously retrieve information from the Web , Shadow also helps you manage any " cookies " sent to Shadow by Websites to protect your browsing history .
The source code of TorProxy and Shadow are available under the GPL v2 license .
Details on how to access our SVN repository to obtain the source code are further down this page .
We are happy to answer questions via email .
How to use TorProxy and Shadow
Install TorProxy and Shadow by downloading them from the Android Marketplace .
Start the TorProxy application .
Select a profile for TorProxy : off — do not connect to the tor network .
— do not connect to the tor network .
on - demand — only connect to the tor network if a program ( e.g. Shadow ) needs it .
This profile is probably the best choice if you only want to make occassional use of an anonymous Internet connection .
— only connect to the tor network if a program ( e.g. Shadow ) needs it .
This profile is probably the best choice if you only want to make occassional use of an anonymous Internet connection .
always on — maintain an anonymous connection whenever the phone is actively in use .
Once a connection to the Tor network is requested , a notification of the state of the connection appears in the notification bar .
A countdown will appear with an estimate of the time remaining before an anonymous connection becomes available .
This will take approximately one minute in the first instance , and around 35 seconds when reconnecting after the phone has woken up from a sleep state .
To browse the Web , start the Shadow web browser .
Shadow works in a very similar way to the normal Android Web browser .
The Menu button reveals the usual browser options .
Typing in a URL will initiate an anonymous connection over the Internet via Tor .
Frequently asked questions
Why is the Google Website frequently displayed in a foreign language ?
Google determines the language you want from the internet address of your device .
When browsing anonymously , the Tor network may provide an internet address from another country .
You can click on the " Google.com in English " link to see the website in English .
Why does TorProxy sit with a red dot over the tor icon in the notification bar when connecting via a mobile data connection ( i.e. 3G or GPRS ) ?
Sometimes it takes longer to connect via a mobile data connection than it does when using WiFi .
Please be patient and wait until the red dot disappears before trying to connect anonymously via Shadow .

Documentation for application developers
Overview
In order to anonymize your application 's Internet communication :
1. Import TorProxyLib.jar into your project
2. Connect to the TorProxy control service
3. Register for the TorProxy status change broadcast
4 . When the Tor connection is available , create your socket and tunnel it through SocksProxy
1. TorProxyLib
This library contains everything you need to allow your application to anonymize its sockets .
Add TorProxyLib.jar to your build path .
2. Connect to the TorProxy control service
The TorProxy service exports an interface which you can use to check the availability of the anonymous connection and register your desire to use it .
Example :
// Keep track of the control service private ITorProxyControl mControlService = null ; private final IntentFilter torStatusFilter = new IntentFilter ( TorProxyLib .
STATUS_CHANGE_INTENT
) ; //
Service connection to TorProxy service private ServiceConnection mSvcConn = new ServiceConnection ( ) { @ Override public void onServiceConnected ( ComponentName name , IBinder service ) { mControlService = ITorProxyControl .
Stub .
as Interface ( service ) ; // Connected to Control Service // Perhaps check
Tor status here } @ Override public void onServiceDisconnected ( ComponentName name ) { mControlService = null ; // Connection to Control Service lost } } ; @ Override protected void on Resume ( ) { // ... //
Register to receive
Tor status update broadcasts registerReceiver ( mBroadcastReceiver , torStatusFilter ) ; //
Bind to the TorProxy control service bindService ( new Intent ( ) .
setComponent ( new ComponentName ( TorProxyLib .
CONTROL_SERVICE_PACKAGE
, TorProxyLib .
CONTROL_SERVICE_CLASS ) ) , mSvcConn , BIND_AUTO_CREATE ) ; // ... } @ Override protected void onPause ( ) { // ... //
Registered in onResume so unregister here unregisterReceiver ( mBroadcastReceiver ) ; unbindService ( mSvcConn ) ; // ... } private BroadcastReceiver mBroadcastReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver ( ) { @ Override public void onReceive ( Context context , Intent intent ) { if ( TorProxyLib .
STATUS_CHANGE_INTENT
. equals ( intent . getAction ( ) ) ) { //
TorProxy has broadcast a Tor status update // Check
Tor status here } } } ;
Using the control service
The control service has a current profile .
The anonymous data connection has a current state .
The profiles are :
PROFILE_OFF - the anonymous data connection is turned off
PROFILE_ONDEMAND
- you may have to register your interest to get an anonymous connection
PROFILE_ON - the anonymous data connection will be made available ( automatically ) if possible
The states are :
STATUS_UNAVAILABLE
- the anonymous data connection is currently unavailable
STATUS_REQUIRES_DEMAND
- the anonymous data connection is currently off but may be available if you register your demand
STATUS_CONNECTING
- the anonymous data connection is being set up
STATUS_ON - the anonymous data connection is available for use
You can get the current profile using :
mControlService . getProfile ()
You can get the current status using :
mControlService . getStatus ()
Tunneling a socket through SocksProxy
Preventing Overheating of Classic Car
It is really important to prevent overheating of cars through sufficient care of the engine .
It is great for great extension to prevent heat damage as well as overpressure of components that happen due along with loss of coolant .
There are some techniques and tools that prevent overheating through typical shortcomings of older cars in comparison to anything else .
The typical shortcomings that belong to older cars can be overcome with care and vigilance .

Most engines are designed to run extended steam for excellence and efficacy .
But then when these get overheated , they really do n’t overcome the shortcomings .
Engines which are totally stuck and steaming with use would not work for long .
It is important to prevent your engine from overheating while it is still new and in good condition .
For adequate cooling system to work it is important that you check your car ’s make and ensure during the selection stage that there is no overheating problem .
This might be a bit difficult and would not guarantee complete satisfaction but then you would be able to prevent a lot of problems later through this process .
Certain cars react more during the heat .
If you are in a place which is usually hot it is important to have tested your car which is suited to hot climates .
This could be one of the most important decisions that you could be taking .
For a car that is ok for a cold area would not be quite the same thing during summer months .
Maintenance and overall radiation problem , engine blocks , car part dissipation , etc. may be quite a problem coming through here .
If your car is aging there might be many things that would not be working .
So checking through belts and different parts is really important along with regular maintenance and efficacy in the checking with constant upgrades and replacing .
The temperature changes can be gauged through different indications as well as engine problems with running problems .
Different cars come to be of different makes while some are good for several short trips , some are indeed better for long tours .
When you are taking your car keeping these things in mind these are really great aspects for choosing it .
Since classic cars require a whole lot of extra care , usually a series of tests and preventive measures for your car can help you assess the temperature gauges as well as the better of the short or long of the trips that you are going to make .
With these tests you are sure of what you are aiming for .
There are several preventive as well as curable measures that help you make choices best for keep you classic car on the cooler end .
The following are some of the items that one should keep in check with regularity , in case of classic cars .
Belts and hoses :
These are items that become subject to fraying quite easily and thereby noticing for them so that they do n’t get constant withering away as well as cracking or slipping off are really important to note .
Keeping them under check so that they do not come under leaking or signs of wear and tear are important parts of it all .
Every oil change would bring to your notice if there is any problem .
Make sure that regardless of how fine your car stays in , these are signs that must be checked through from time and time again .
Change as well as replace the belts as well as hoses from time to time in order to have your car in top shape over everything else !
Radiator :
The radiator is an item that must be checked through against excessive heat damage as this is always one of the most vulnerable areas of a car .
Checking this against pressure and resistance would be one of the most important things that you can bring as gift to your car and help it sustain engine damages in the long run .
Inspecting this part against a removed nozzle of any garden pipe and put under pressure will definitely let you know the extended power through which it is going to be accessed to .
Sign of any leak would be quite important to note as any such problem or even blockages could be disconnecting enough to leave your radiator excessively heated and seeking to need greater , immediate attention .
Opening the blocks in cooling tubes will definitely lead to back flushing and thus would do very well in processing the radiation problem with redistribution of pressure throughout the radiator .
These are back flushing problems that can be tackled with ease can be reconnected and remodeled all over again .
These problems can again be sealed through taking care of radiator core .
The wearing down of pumps can be reduced if these are checked well enough .
Good repairing of radiators may also be required in order to make them work consistently enough .
The thousands of detentions by Israel is a major Palestinian grievance Israel holds hundreds of Palestinians without trial or any way to clear their names , say two Israeli rights groups which urge an end to such detentions .
The groups say currently 335 prisoners are held in " administrative detention " under rules dating back to 1945 when the area was under British control .
They add it is only meant for extreme circumstances and Israel 's extensive use breaks international law .
Israel says the detentions are used as a last resort to prevent future attack .
Detention orders last for six months without the Israeli military having to bring a prosecution against the detainee .
After six months the orders can be extended by a judge , but the campaign groups , B'Tselem and HaMoked , say this only gives an impression of fairness .
KEY FACTS 7,150 Palestinians in Israeli custody : 5,000 serving sentences and 1,569 awaiting trial 335 Palestinians in administrative detention Nine Palestinians are detained as " illegal combatants " Source : B'Tselem
In the vast majority of cases , the report Without Trial says , judges declare the evidence secret and rely on intelligence reports that are never shown to the detainee or defence lawyers .
" Consequently , it is impossible for the detainee to refute the allegations or to present alternative evidence , " the report says .
The groups call on Israel to release the administrative detainees or prosecute them in accordance with standards of due process that are set forth in international law .
Burden of proof
An Israeli army statement stressed administrative detention was used to " remove terror activists regarding whom there is concrete information concerning a clear and present danger posed by them " .
It added that efforts were being made to decrease the use of detention without trial .
The B'Tselem - HaMoked report acknowledges a decline in numbers such case .
B'Tselem says overall Israel currently holds 7,150 Palestinians in custody .
Of these some 5,000 are serving sentences and 1,569 were awaiting trial , with 335 under administrative detention .
There are also nine people detained under a 2002 law regarding " illegal combatants " .
The joint B'Tselem - HaMoked report also calls for an immediate end to such incarcerations , which they say offers " fewer protections " to internees than offered to administrative detainees .
They argue that " illegal combatant " internees are only released if they can prove they will not harm state security " thus switching the burden of proof onto the shoulders of the internee , who can never refute the allegations " .
The army insisted that such interments - along with administrative detention - were " fully consistent with international law and with the rulings of the Supreme Court " .

Montevideo , Uruguay
362,000 pupils in Uruguay now have the distinctive laptops .
Uruguay has joined the small number of nations providing a laptop for every child attending state primary school .
President Tabaré Vázquez presented the final XO model laptops to pupils at a school in Montevideo on 13 October .
Over the last two years 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers have been involved in the scheme .
The " Plan Ceibal " ( Education Connect ) project has allowed many families access to the world of computers and the internet for the first time .
Uruguay is part of the One Laptop Per Child scheme , an organisation set up by internet pioneer Nicholas Negroponte .
His original vision was to provide laptops at $ 100 ( £ 61 ) but they proved more expensive .
The Uruguay programme has cost the state $ 260 ( £ 159 ) per child , including maintenance costs , equipment repairs , training for the teachers and internet connection .
The total figure represents less than 5 % of the country 's education budget .
Around 70 % of the XO model laptops handed out by the government were given to children who did not have computers at home .
" This is not simply the handing out of laptops or an education programme .
It is a programme which seeks to reduce the gap between the digital world and the world of knowledge , " explained Miguel Brechner , director of the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay and in charge of Plan Ceibal .
In a similar project , every child in the tiny South Pacific nation of Niue has an OLPC laptop .
In 2008 , Portugal committed to giving Intel Classmate laptops to every six - 10 year old in the country .
" A revolution "
In the run up to Uruguay 's general election on 25 October , the project is being promoted as an achievement of the Tabaré Vázquez government .
" It 's been a revolution , which has helped us enormously , but it has n't been easy , " explained Lourdes Bardino , head teacher of School 173 in Las Piedras .
Ms Bardino said that some teachers were originally opposed to the introduction of the XO laptops .
" We have a lady who 's been teaching for 30 years and when they gave us the computers and the training , she asked for leave because she did n't want to have anything to do with the programme .
Later she changed her mind and now computers have changed the way she teaches . "
All the teachers have been given training , but the extent to which they use the laptops in the classroom is up to them .
Research carried out recently by the State Education authorities revealed that some teachers have chosen not to include computer - related work in their lesson plans .
Costs and criticisms
The laptops have an open source Linux operating system with a user interface called Sugar .
It has attracted some criticism from detractors for not being mainstream .
However Mr Brechner believes that children should learn computer skills regardless of the software available .
Blind children were being taught on a Microsoft Windows operating system , he said .
The annual cost of maintaining the programme , including an information portal for pupils and teachers , will be US $ 21 ( £ 13 ) per child .
The future Its a culture shock scenario - many countries are simply too scared to put it into practice
Miguell Brechner , head of Plan Ceibal Now that all the schoolchildren have their computers , the authorities say that they will endeavour keep the schools connected , particularly those in rural areas , where many still do not have internet access .
There are plans to extend the scheme to secondary schools and pre-school children next year .
Organisers of the Plan Ceibal have set up a consultancy in order to advise other countries wishing to replicate the Uruguayan experience .
Mr Brechner said that Rwanda , Haiti , El Salvador , Paraguay , some provinces in Argentina and Colombia have been in touch although they have not yet decided to contract their services .
" We would help them with tenders , planning , evaluation , which software to use , how to spread the word , training , all the " know how " we have developed .
We do n't have a manual .
It ´s a culture shock scenario - many countries are simply too scared to put it into practice . "

A selection of the trends we wish could be consigned to the waste bin - the most annoying things on the web .
1 ) ' Worse than the Nazis '
" As an [ online ] discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches . "
So states Godwin's Law , the observation first made in 1990 that still stands today .
Many online communities counter this moronic rhetorical device by ruling that the first person to make a Hitler comparison loses the argument by default .
2 ) Lazy activism
Joining a Facebook group is the new going on a march , just substantially less effective .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's regime did not buckle under the onslaught of green - tinted Twitter avatars .
3 ) Messages alerting you to messages
Email inboxes are becoming clogged with non-urgent alerts from Facebook , Twitter and other social media websites .
How long before someone invents an app to alert Twitter and Facebook users when they receive an email , creating a never - ending spiral of needless messages ?
4 ) CAPTCHAs
Only the internet asks its users to prove that they are human .
CAPTCHAs , the word recognition puzzles designed to prevent robots from accessing protected websites , may be a necessary evil but even their inventor has said that he regrets their drain on human time .
Assuming that each one takes ten seconds are solve , it has been estimated that we waste 150,000 hours a day squinting at distorted letters .
Anecdotal evidence also suggests that CAPTCHAs are getting harder , with some effectively indecipherable .
5 ) Social media gurus
Knowing how to tweet should not be a career in itself .
6 ) The next big thing (s )
Remember Friends Reunited ?
Friendster ?
Faceparty ?
The shelf life of social networking websites seems to be around two years , forcing members to transplant their internet personas just to keep up speed with their contacts .
This would be easier to stomach if it was n't so tough to differentiate between next big things and white elephants .
7 ) Blogs
Not blogs themselves , but the negligence anxieties that come with having one .
They just take far too much writing .
8 ) Pop -up adverts
Websites need to make money and static adverts do n't bring in enough revenue .
But that knowledge does n't make invasive pop-ups - particularly those that hide their close buttons - any less annoying .
9 ) The bedroom invasion
First it was in the living room , then the bedroom and now - thanks to wi-fi and laptops - the internet is in your bed .
10 ) Amazon pigeonholing
Years after purchasing a book about self - harm for university research , I still receive emails recommending titles related to suicide and depression .
Some straight man with eclectic tastes in fiction have complained that Amazon appears to have convinced itself that they are gay .
11 ) YouTube speech bubbles
If there 's one thing we 've learned in the four year history of YouTube , it 's that literacy cannot presumed .
So while the " annotations " feature launched last year should allow filmmakers to produce richer videos , in practice it has led to clips being marred by intrusive gibberish .
The equivalent of an excitable child forcing his parents to sit through his favourite cartoon : " Dad , did you see that bit ?
Did you see it ?
It was funny , huh ?
Oh Dad , you were n't paying attention . "
12 ) Rickrolling
Hugely over this , now .
13 ) Everything has been done before
Had an idea ?
Well someone in San Jose had it last year , got VC - funding and has already launched Beta testing .
Presumably this must also have happened before the internet , but in those days you could remain in happy ignorance .
14 ) Comment pedantry
If the US Constitution had been published online , you can be sure that the first comments would have picked apart the spelling mistakes , and blamed the slapdash attitude of Adams , Jefferson et al for undermining the prospects of the nation .
Some commenters seem blinded to the essence of online offerings by their irresistible urge to mark .
15 ) It 's always on
If we all agreed to shut down the internet for a few hours a week - perhaps on Sunday evenings - long - suffering parents and grand - parents might get a few more phone calls .
16 ) MySpace and Bebo
Far too hard on the eyes .
Proof , if it were needed , that graphic design should be considered a profession .
17 ) Companies wanting us to ' join the conversation '
A direct result of the ascendancy of No 5 is the insufferable chattiness of previously faceless corporations .
But a social media presence is no alternative to swift , helpful customer service .
18 ) Corporate email signatures
Would anyone have assumed that the jottings of a junior account executive reflected the views of an entire multinational company , or that her winking emoticon sign - off was legally binding ?
19 ) Websites that are too wide for the browser
A less common problem these days , as web design and browsers become more sophisticated .
20 ) Cross - platform conversations
A very modern communication habit and one for which an etiquette has yet to emerge .
If you are speaking to the same person over email , Facebook , MSN Messenger and SMS , is it acceptable to " cross the streams " and discuss work topics on Facebook , or continue an email thread on SMS ?
Very confusing .
21 ) Domain / username squatters
To the frustrated latecomer , a " squatter " is anyone with their name who registers with a website first .
People left to scrape the bottom of the username barrel - Jane_Brown_77@hotmail.co.uk and JohnSmith555@gmail.com , to give two random examples - will testify to the resulting loss of dignity .
22 ) Viruses , scams and spam
Obviously .
23 ) Virus and scam alerts
Hardly a morning goes by without reports of new phishing or malware scams popping up in your RSS reader , complete with exhortations to strengthen passwords and update anti-virus protection .
While the threats are real and the warnings well meant , it can't be healthy to dwell on attacks that almost certainly did n't affect you .
The internet , like life , is best approached with a little derring - do .
24 ) PDFs
The information could usually have been presented much more accessibly on a web page .
25 ) Frame bars
The leash used by recommendation websites like Digg to keep hold of logged - in users while showing them external sites .
Ugly , clunky , and of little benefit to the user .
26 ) This website
( When you start to get angry , hold down the " Esc " button to skip to the end )
27 ) WrItInG In A MiXtUrE Of UpPEr CaSe AnD LoWeR CaSe
It 's not useful , attractive or funny .
How on earth did it take off ?
28 ) Patently absurd abbreviations
While it 's perfectly conceivable that the other person may indeed have LOL'd at your joke , one struggles to picture them ROFLMAOing , given that there was no break in their typing .
29 ) Comedians on Twitter
Talk about having your illusions crushed .
Comedians who join Twitter tend to fall into one of two groups .
First , those like Stephen Fry and Eddie Izzard who post the same mix of whimsy , opinion and self - promotion as " non-famous " users .
While not laugh - a- minute stuff , it 's generally sincere and charming .
Then there are those who see Twitter as an opportunity to spew forth every half - baked joke idea that enters their heads , providing the strongest argument for the continued need for script editors .
30 ) Filth , everywhere
A few years ago the actor Jack Nicholson announced that he was disconnecting his computer from the internet .
His reason ?
" There 's so much porn out there that I never get out of the house " .
31 ) Websites that do n't support a browser 's back and forward features
We have become so accustomed to navigating with the two buttons , that it 's difficult to manage without them .
32 ) Hard - to - find login buttons
Some websites are so keen to make themselves appealing to new users that they forget about their existing members , hiding the login buttons in tiny fonts at the extremities of the screen .
Only logout buttons are given less prominence .
33 ) Transport planning websites
Transport websites can be reluctant to let you go anywhere in the without taking at least one bus .
34 ) Compulsory fields on forms
" You did not fill out these required fields : home phone number , mobile phone number . "
The more hoops companies make people jump through , the less willing they are to hand over their money .
35 ) National restrictions
There are compelling legal reasons why some online content - such as Olympics footage , which is sold on different terms to many national broadcasters - has to be nation - specific .
But in an era of free - flowing information , it comes as a shock to be told that you cannot watch a video because of where you live .
36 Unwitting disclosure of data
Think that you are in control of your online footprint ?
The chilling website What the Internet knows about you might throw up some surprises .
37 ) Lists
Fun to read , easy on the eye , and everywhere .
38 ) The history function on browsers
Surely the cons outweigh the pros ?
39 ) Try - hard websites
People do not come to websites for an experience , they come for information .
Anything that gets in their way , like slow - loading Flash graphics or counter - intuitive navigation tools , just makes them angry .
40 ) Post - 1990 bias
Almost every crappy blog post , news story and website published in the last twenty years can be brought up with a quick Google search .
But obtaining contemporaneous information from previous decades remains difficult , despite projects to bring newspaper archives , books and records online .
The result is an internet that gives undue weight to modern ephemera .
41 ) Fake viral clips
They would n't be annoying if they were n't so effective .
Two particularly infuriating examples are the video that purported to show mobile phones popping pop corn , which was subsequently exposed as a stunt by a bluetooth headset retailer Cardo , and another claiming to show an onion charging an iPod .
42 ) The gradual erosion of your moral boundaries
Tasteless jokes , obscene images and websites devoted to fetishes you 've never even heard of are only ever a few clicks away .
Even if you never indulge , their taboo is diluted by ease of availability .
43 ) Buffering
Tick , tock .
44 ) Memorial websites
As almost every social activity moves online it's to be expected that mourning will take place on the web .
Facebook tribute groups are set up within hours of a young person 's death , providing an outlet for their friends ' grief .
But anyone who has stumbled across one of these sites can't help but notice that many of the tributes come from people who have tenuous - or non existent - connections to the deceased .
Would n't a private message to the family be more appropriate ?
45 ) Hostility to ' newbies '
The most successful online communities are united by narrow shared interests , but the boorish insistence that new arrivals adhere to archaic forum rules is self - defeating .
46 ) Password stipulations
One site demands eight characters , another a mix of letters and numbers , and a third says that the term you 've been using for years is now too weak .
The only way to keep track of all the combinations is to note them down , making your accounts even more vulnerable .
47 ) Auto - run videos
In fact any audio that plays without the explicit consent of the user .
Who has n't scrabbled to shut down a browser window as office colleagues look round for the source of the blaring Barbra Streisand ?
48 ) Get - rich - quick schemes
If the foolproof share picking formula actually worked , why are its inventors hawking CDs and books online for € 19.99 a pop rather than sunning themselves in Bermuda ?
49 ) Council websites
Local authorities are starting to put significant effort into improving their websites , but they 're starting from a pretty low base .
Too many are cluttered and confusing , especially for residents with limited internet expertise .
50 ) Chris Crocker
He who did this .

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he would only give Panorama a formal interview for our programme , Why Hate Ryanair ? , if we promised to run it totally unedited .
We were not prepared to agree to this , but promised Ryanair we would be balanced and fair .
Reporter Vivian
White went to Dublin and grabbed a few minutes with Mr O'Leary on his way out of Ryanair 's Annual General Meeting last month .
Mr O'Leary said the exchange would be cut to " suit the Panorama agenda " .
Here is the full , uncut , unedited version of the entire encounter .
Panorama : Why Hate Ryanair ? , is on BBC One tonight , 12 October at 8.30 pm
Conspiracy theories – I ca n’t get enough of them !
Fortunately there are so many floating about that we have been able to give you not one , not two , but now three lists of theories that many people believe with all their might .
Be sure to read the earlier lists if you have n’t already and feel free to add any conspiracies missing from all three to the comments here .
10 Area 51
It makes the list because it appears in almost every alien or UFO conspiracy theory ever devised .
The fact is Area 51 is real .
It ’s a popular target on Google Earth .
Another fact is that the FAA has confirmed that no air routes go over or anywhere near Area 51 , by direct order from the USAF .
There are television shows purporting to explain just what goes on there , one even including an interview with “ a disgruntled employee , ” who is provided with black - out lighting , but no vocal distortion , and who states that “ it is a testing ground for experimental aircraft .
It ’s as simple as that . ”
I considered putting the Aurora Aircraft on this list , but since its existence is tied so closely to Area 51 , I use Area 51 as a catch - all of sorts .
It is verifiable now , that the F - 117 Stealth Fighter , the B - 2 Spirit Stealth Bomber , and the SR - 71 Blackbird were all invented at Area 51 .
This may account for all the strange lights people have recorded near the base through the years .
But the conspiracy theory goes on to claim that humans were unable to come up with these technologies .
They were , instead , reverse engineered by studying the technology of the flying saucer that crashed at Roswell , NM , in 1947 .
In fact , there may have been other alien aircraft recovered or even shot down in the area over the years , all of which have led to the USAF ’s mighty power of innovation .
The theory claims that the flying saucer is still there , housed in a secret bunker or hangar , as are the corpses of the three or four aliens who crashed it and died .
9 The Clinton Body Count
This one at least seems plausible , as it has nothing to do with science fiction .
This theory states that Bill Clinton , while he was president and before , was quietly assassinating his associates ( ostensibly anyone who got in the way of his career , such as Vince Foster ) .
The Clinton Body Count is a list of about 50 - 60 associates of Clinton who have died “ under mysterious circumstance . ”
The list began circulating over the Internet starting in the mid-1990s .
The list grew out of a 1993 list of about 24 names prepared by the pro-gun lobby group American Justice Federation , which was led by Linda Thompson .
The list was posted to the group ’s bulletin board system .
The facts concerning Vince Foster ’s death are that he died untimely , on July 20 , 1993 , of apparent suicide by gunshot in the mouth .
His body was found in Fort Marcy Park , Virginia .
Gunshot residue was found on the hand which had held the gun .
Foster and Clinton were boyhood friends , both lawyers , and it is believed by the theory that Foster got too close to uncovering some embarrassing truth about Clinton , probably of a sexual and / or dishonest nature , and that Foster was assassinated , less than a year after joining Clinton ’s White House staff .
The theorists argue that it is unlikely that a man with a wife and three children , and an extremely lucrative law practice , earning him $ 300,000 a year , would have manic depression , but Foster was diagnosed with it and prescribed anti-depressants .
8 The Christ Myth Theory
Yes , you read that right .
According to this conspiracy theory , the man himself never existed .
His life story , his ministry , his status as the divine Son of God , is a fabrication of the Roman Catholic Church .
Those who have proposed one form or another of this theory have documented the similarities between stories of Jesus and those of Krishna , Adonis , Osiris , Mithra , and a pre-Christian cult of Jesus ( Joshua ) within Judaism .
Some authors attribute the beginning of Christianity to a historical founder who predates the time Jesus is said to have lived .
The theory appears to have been originated by two French Enlightenment thinkers , Constantin - Francois Volney and Charles Francois Dupuis , in the 1790s .
The theory has always been largely dismissed by academic circles and biblical historians , in which case , the theorists simply elaborated on the theory .
Not only did Jesus never exist , his presence in the New Testament is utter fiction , created by the Roman Catholic Church sometime in the very early 3rd Century AD , or late 2nd Century , as a means by which to control people .
The authorities passed down the idea to their successors until Constantine considered it a very good means of control and called the Council of Nicaea to organize the Church into global domination .
Despite all of the historical proof that Jesus did exist – and there is plenty of it – there are still many people who would like to think he did n’t .
That is the source of this bizarre revisionist theory .
7 The Antichrist
Satan is alive on Earth , and has created the Antichrist , who is , at this moment , not quite old enough to seize power , but will in only a few years .
He will do so in a very political manner , taking over some powerful organization , such as the United Nations .
Every generation , since St. John the Divine wrote the Revelation , has sworn that it would witness the Great Tribulation , Armageddon , and the second coming of Jesus .
“ The end is near , ” everyone has been saying .
Now , though , with the advent of global communications , especially the Internet , the theory has swelled exponentially .
Christians who previously did n’t think much of it have changed their minds .
It can be argued that the worldwide availability of press coverage only serves to heighten fear of terrible things happening at any moment .
9/11 was the most well covered , watched tragedy in human history .
Wheneer a tragedy occurs , people who believe in the Christian end - times scenarios flock to church to pray away their fear .
But now , with the ability to control the entire world actually conceivable , the paranoia of the Antichrist showing up has become quite the pandemic .
Most terrorists believe he will be male , will arise in Europe , probably Western Europe , and some even swear that he will be French .
Plenty are sure , however , that President Barack Obama is in fact the Antichrist .
Numerologists believe that the Antichrist is not yet old enough , but will make his appearance at the age of 30 , symbolically equal to Jesus beginning his ministry .
Worldwide terrorism , the current U. S. led war on it in the hotbed of political unrest , and the fact that almost every Arab nation seems to be threatening an invasion of Israel at every second , all serve to make this one feel very real .
Every day CNN is loaded with horror stories about the Holy Land , and it just seems to keep getting worse .
“ The end is near . ”
6 The electric car
It is a verifiable fact that the human land speed record was set in 1899 at 65 mph by an electric car .
Steam and gasoline - powered automobiles could not achieve this for another 20 to 25 years .
Today , technology has progressed immensely , and yet , we still have no electric cars .
The best production model is the Toyota Prius , which gets 50 mpg .
This only intensifies the theory that the U. S. oil companies currently possess the technology for purely electric cars , which you can plug into an ordinary , American wall outlet at night and charge up to a cross -country trip by morning .
But because this would , in truth , bankrupt the oil companies , they refuse to release the technology , and have even put out successful hits on various geniuses since the 1960s , none of whom became very famous , because he was killed before he could make his publish his discovery .
A documentary in 2006 , “ Who Killed the Electric Car ? ” fueled the fire that if the technology is documented to have existed as early as the 1830s , why did it appear to hits its peak at the turn of the 20th Century , and then decline ?
Why are we still waiting for electric cars ?
Edison patented one in 1913 .
All the electrical pioneers of that time tinkered with the idea , and plenty of reasonable examples were produced .
5 HAARP
The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program does exist .
It is a research project funded jointly by the USAF , the US Navy , the University of Alaska , and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
When you put that many government organizations into one sentence about new technology , conspiracy theorists come running .
Did you see the 2003 movie “ The Core ” ?
It concerns a stall in the earth ’s magnetic field , allowing the sun ’s microwave radiation to cook the planet , until a team goes into the core of the planet and jumpstarts it spinning again , so the magnetic field will resume .
The movie explains that the stall was caused not on its own , but accidentally by HAARP , which is researching the ability to create earthquakes for use as a weapon .
The official description of the program , given by the program , is “ to provide a research facility to conduct pioneering experiments in ionospheric phenomena… used to analyze basic ionospheric properties and to assess the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for communications and surveillance purposes . ”
This sounds like the opposite of deep - Earth experiments , but conspiracy theorists believe the program is a cover for a kind of particle - beam weapon , first invented by Nikola Tesla , which has in fact been perfected , or brought close to perfection , by HAARP .
The theory also claims that the ionospheric research is not a lie , but is being developed for use as a weapon to shoot down enemy spacecraft , or ballistic missiles , the latter popular especially given that HAARP ’s facilities are all in Alaska , close to Russia .
It even speculates that the weapon could become Tesla ’s most infamous invention : “ the Death Beam , ” able to project a beam of extremely powerful electricity from the facility to any point on the planet and create an explosion as devastating as a hydrogen bomb .
4 The Vril Society
It has been suggested that there is a secret form of energy , called Vril , which is used and controlled by a secret subterranean society of matriarchal socialist utopian superior beings .
Yes , you read that correctly .
It is similar in this respect to the # 2 theory .
It also claims that Nazi Germany discovered this race , and its technology , at Shambhala , Tibet , and used it to create flying saucers ( pictured above ) .
The whole theory is based on an 1871 sci - fi novel by Edward Bulwer - Lytton , titled , “ Vril : The Coming of the Race . ”
It is generally considered an early example of science fiction , but because this genre was just getting off the ground at the time , it was seen by many as a non-fiction account of the subterranean race and their technology , a theory which persists today .
The theory really took off in the 1960s .
3 The suppression of Free Energy
This one actually sounds plausible .
Nikola Tesla claimed that free energy was indeed possible , and worked for most of his career to achieve it .
The theory claims that he did , in fact , succeed , just before his death in 1943 , in discovering the mathematics and mechanics involved , but that the FBI immediately broke into his home and seized all his papers and work , and has never released any of it to the public .
The concept of free energy is , in very general terms , the ability to input x amount of energy into a machine , which will output x + 1 amount of energy .
This seems to conflict with the law of conservation of energy , which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed .
Tesla believed the law to be incorrect .
He invented the Tesla Coil as an attempt to create free energy .
If it is possible , free energy could be perfected and result in the entire planet being powered by a single power source , such as a nuclear power plant , and output all the energy anyone could ever need .
An infinite supply of energy at our fingertips , all based on electric output .
You can see how this would irritate the oil companies .
They are the cause of the suppression , the theory claims , as no one would have to depend on fossil fuels anymore .
Electric input is just as viable as coal input , or gasoline input .
Thus , the electricity required to power a lightbulb could be all we need to power the whole world , invent spacecrafts capable of interstellar travel , anti-gravity , etc .
2 Jesus was a different species
This theory is a lot of fun .
It has been alleged that the U. S. and Israeli governments led archaeological digs in the past , which discovered the True Cross , on which Jesus Himself was crucified ( along with many others , as crosses were reused ) .
The theories disagree on the location , most claiming Jerusalem , many claiming Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland , or various places in England .
Minute traces of blood were discovered on the cross and analyzed .
The DNA was of several strains , and one was encoded not on a double helix , but on a triple helix !
Is this good stuff or what ?!
The DNA is unlike any other known , and was labeled as a new species , Homo superioris .
The theory continues that there are other people of this species currently living underground in various places around the world , including most of the major cities , and they have been around as long or longer than Homo sapiens .
Jesus made the unprecedented decision to come up to the surface and live among us , and try to teach us to be good , and kind and peaceful .
His species possesses phenomenal supernatural abilities , including telekinesis , levitation ( walking on water ) , telepathy ( knowing people ’s thoughts ) , healing , etc .
They are also very difficult to kill , and when no one was looking , presumably during the freak storm and earthquake , Jesus got down off the cross and disappeared , having done his job .
This ties in with the Jesus bloodline theory .
1 The Montauk Project
In the annals of paranoia , no conspiracy theory is more labyrinthine , more convoluted , more encompassing of other conspiracy theories as the Montauk Project , based out of Camp Hero , Montauk Point , Long Island , New York .
At the extreme northeastern tip of the island there is a massive AN / FPS - 35 radar dish that has long since been decommissioned , but has been saved from demolition by a petition from the local civilian residents , who find it a better sea-faring landmark than the nearby Montauk Lighthouse .
This dish features prominently in all the theories surrounding a hyper - top secret military research facility which supposedly operated from 1967 to the early 1980s .
Some theories claim that research still goes on there , deep underground in a facility that was frequently expanded since its inception .
But the theories involving what went on in Camp Hero from the 1960s on are the best stuff you ’re likely to hear in terms of science fiction realism .
The Project began on US Government initiative in 1952 - 53 , when a secret committee was organized to discuss possible research into time travel .
The methods by which this could be achieved have never been adequately explained in the theory , but are based primarily on the work of the two favorite scientists of conspiracy theorists : Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla .
Einstein ’s general relativity theory is considered the only plausible jumping - off point to a Unified Field Theory , which has so far not been discovered .
Or so the public thinks .
The Montauk Project resulted directly from the Philadelphia Experiment , which topped a previous list of conspiracy theories and is claimed by the theorists to be the accidental discovery of time travel .
Nikola Tesla , who supposedly died in 1943 , did not die , but perfected Einstein ’s theory , and invented the mechanics required to stabilize a wormhole , a rip in the fabric of space - time .
The Montauk Project furthered this research , funded initially by $ 10 billion in Nazi gold bullion , stolen by American soldiers from an underground railroad tunnel in Switzerland in 1945 .
Some theories include Tesla as the immortal head of the project , traveling through time to cheat death .
The base is said to have created and stabilized a time tunnel into the past , enabling anyone to go into it and arrive at any programmed point in the past .
But then something terrible happened .
No one can agree on precisely what , except that a mechanical failure in the 1980s resulted in a horrible monster from a foreign world ( and perhaps from the past or future ) , which came through the underground tunnel without warning and severely destroyed the base , before being killed by unknown means .
The government immediately scrapped the Project , having learned how to travel through time , and sealed off the entire base , which had grown so large that it actually extends , to this day , under the town of Montauk itself , several square miles .
The massive radar dish was used to transmit messages to alien worlds in various times through the history of the Universe .
Today , Camp
Hero is now a state park where anyone may go and picnic or hike , and yet there are verifiable reports of backpackers and campers being suddenly accosted by men with automatic assault rifles in the middle of the night and threatened with death if they did n’t leave .
In all these reports , the men have been said to wear olive drab uniforms with no insignia of any kind .
The film “ Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ” was filmed in the area , but not in the state park itself , because the local authorities charged exorbitant fees , apparently to dissuade the production from accidentally uncovering any secrets .
The theories all converge at a brilliant end : there is a concrete - sealed door in the side of a building on Camp Hero grounds , which leads down , and which no one is allowed to go near .
In 2004 , a Florida woman made U$ 28,000 after selling a toasted cheese sandwich that appeared to show the face of the Virgin Mary on internet auction site eBay .
She had kept the half - eaten snack for 10 years and said it was " miraculous " it had not shown any signs of mould or crumbling in that time .
Note :
The $ 28000 bid was later determined to be not legitimate .
The highest legitimate bid was $ 71 .
( CNN ) --
The United States has formally asked Switzerland to extradite film director Roman Polanski , Swiss authorities said Friday .
Director Roman Polanski fled the U.S. more than 30 years ago and was detained in Switzerland in September .
The Academy Award - winning director was arrested in Switzerland last month on a U.S. arrest warrant stemming from a 1977 sex case involving a 13 - year - old girl .
He is fighting extradition .
The U.S. Embassy in Berne submitted the formal extradition request to Switzerland 's Federal Office of Justice on Thursday night , Swiss justice officials said .
Swiss justice officials said they will now forward the extradition request to the Canton of Zurich , where Polanski is being held , so an extradition hearing can be held .
If a decision is made for Polanski to be extradited , the director may appeal to the Federal Criminal Court , justice officials said .
Earlier this week , a Swiss court refused a request to release Polanski on bail pending an extradition battle , saying that he posed a high flight risk .
He was given 10 days to appeal the decision .
The Academy Award - winning director was arrested in Switzerland last month on a U.S. arrest warrant stemming from a 1977 sex case .
Polanski pleaded guilty in August 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13 - year - old girl five months earlier .
He was 43 at the time , and is now 76 .
Los Angeles , California , prosecutors dropped other charges in exchange for his guilty plea .
But Polanski fled the country before he was sentenced , after he learned the judge might not go along with the short jail term he expected to get from the plea agreement .
Polanski remained free -- mostly living in France -- before he was arrested in Switzerland on a 31 - year - old arrest warrant .
Los Angeles authorities said they sought his arrest when they learned he would be traveling to Switzerland for a film festival last month .
Polanski agreed to pay his sexual assault victim $ 500,000 to settle a damage claim she filed against him nearly 12 years after the crime , according to court papers released October 2 .
Polanski still owed the money -- plus another $ 100,000 interest -- three years after the 1993 settlement , according to the documents .
The victim sought money for damages suffered when Polanski had sex with her .
She claimed Polanski plied her with alcohol and quaaludes during a photo shoot at the Hollywood Hills home of actor Jack Nicholson .
It 's not clear if Polanski ever completed paying the debt to the woman , although the court papers document efforts by her lawyers to garnish residuals and other payments owed to Polanski by the Screen Actors Guild , movie studios and other Hollywood businesses .
The victim came forward long ago and made her identity public -- saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled .
Samantha Geimer , now 45 , a married mother of three , called in January for the case to be tossed out .
Polanski's arrest has divided public opinion , even in Hollywood .
Some high - profile filmmakers , such as Woody Allen , Martin Scorsese and Pedro Almodovar , have called for his release .
Others , including actors Kirstie Alley and Paul Petersen , refuse to defend him .
Polanski won an Academy Award for Best Director in 2003 for " The Pianist . "
He was nominated for a best director Oscar for " Tess " and " Chinatown , " and for best writing for " Rosemary 's Baby , " which he also directed .

Three bald eagles lock talons as they plunge to the ground in mid-air battle
Locked in desperate mid-air battle , the three eagles plunge towards the ground in a contest to see who will let go last .
Between their claws lies a gasping fish freshly plucked from an Alaskan lake , now the target of fearsome talons as each eagle grapples for supper .
This is not so much a desperate bid for food - instead it 's a macho show of strength between three birds who want to show who 's who in the pecking order .
The three hungry bald eagles lock talons in a vicious mid-air battle for a fish supper
The eagles remain locked together in a three - way show of dominance
As they reach the end of their dive , one eagle breaks off , leaving the remaining two holding ' hands '
Amateur wildlife photographer Harry Eggens said the fight was over in a matter of seconds and all three escaped unscathed .
He said : ' One of the eagles was able to pick up a small fish - but there were between 150 and 300 other eagles around and it can end in a fight .
' It was n't that the other two could n't get their own fish but I think , as males , they wanted to show off and prove who was the strongest and smartest .
' It always is an impressive sight to see these majestic birds fight in mid air with their talons hooked .
' This happens like you can see in a fight over fish and also in courtship - they hook their talons for a couple of seconds and stop flying while they let themselves fall down close to the ground before they unhook the claws .
' In this case I did see the whole thing happen and the birds came off unscathed .
' I was lucky to witness it because usually there are just two and not three eagles involved in a fight like this . '
Mr Eggens captured the impressive scene at the ' Homer Spit ' in Alaska , America .
The 56 year old , from Groningen , in the Netherlands , was there to photograph the scores of eagles , which , until recently , visited the spot every year to be fed by eagle enthusiast Jean Keene - also known as the ' Eagle Lady . '
Mr Eggens said : ' Jean fed the birds every winter .
But sadly she passed away in January this year and there will be no more visits . '

We live in exciting times .
We make no complaints .
We are used to battle , for out if it we came .
We will plant our feet firmly in our earth , and no attack will move us .
You will stand with me , should such a time come !
You will stand before me , at my side , and behind me , holding our flags high !
Let our old enemies attempt to rise up once more !
They may wave their Soviet flags before us — but our flag will win the battle !
The one thing that we can all count on is that we are going to die .
I know you are only in 1st grade , but it could happen to you .
For all I know your daddy could come home ans shoot you all tonight .
That would make him a Republican , and that 's why I want to take away his guns .
Your doctor is also probably a Republican .
That 's why I want to be able to tell him what he can do for you after Daddy shoots you all .
I also want you to enjoy a ride in a " green vehicle " when you are going to the hospital - it 's better for the planet .
Not that you 'll care as you bleed out from you mean Republican daddy 's gunshot wound .
Remember - Republicans are evil .
If you think your mommy or daddy is a Republican call 1 800 SUCKITGOP to report them .
Now lets close with the new pledge of allegiance :
I pledge allegiance ,
to Obama ,
and to his advisers
and for the ideals for which they stand ,
One nation

Spurning Tory affections
He was 100 or so miles away in Westminster , but David Cameron made overtures to the Lib Dems ' gathering by the seaside in Bournemouth .
Over breakfast last Sunday , perhaps Lib Dem hearts skipped a beat with the news of the Tory leader 's affections .
He claimed there was " barely a cigarette paper " between him and Mr Clegg on touchstone Lib Dem issues such as the environment and civil liberties .
On Monday Eric Pickles , the Renato of the Tory party , asked Lib Dem voters to save their love for a " progressive alliance " with Conservatives .
Savaged by his party
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
If only Lib Dem MPs were as amorous as the Tory chairman and Mr Cameron .
Mr Clegg 's declaration that " savage cuts " were needed for public spending triggered scorn among his MPs .
They did n't like his warning that the long - standing pledge to scrap tuition fees was being put on hold .
Charles Kennedy said the policy was a " defining feature of a Liberal Democrat society " .
Because of the state of the economy , policies were being downgraded to mere " aspirations " .
By last Sunday night , just one day into his five - day conference , Mr Clegg surely had an aspiration to go home .
Cable infallibility
The rebellious mood did not stop there .
Vince Cable , variously labelled the party 's saint , sage and soothsayer , suddenly had to deny he was Stalin after he failed to tell fellow frontbenchers about his plans for a " mansion tax " on homes worth more than £ 1 m .
Mr Cable found he could not walk on water in an angry showdown with MPs on Tuesday morning .
They told him his plans were " codswallop " and " suicidal " .
Pensions spokesman Steve Webb then embarrassed Mr Cable on stage by saying if Martin Luther King had been a Lib Dem he would have said : " I have a nightmare . "
Life 's a beach
As the honourable members of Britain 's third party fought it out in the conference hotel , outside , at the bottom of the cliff , a young northern bottlenose whale was found dead .
It was either a metaphor or an omen ; no one could quite decide which , so it was named Gilbert .
But it seemed to send a message to Mr Cable that even revered and majestic creatures can end all washed up .
Later that day , he agreed to be more consensual .
The autumn sunshine also brought happier scenes to the Bournemouth beach : Mr Clegg and his aides playing a game of cricket for the cameras , and Miriam , his wife , taking a morning jog free from photographers and press officers .
Miriam 's song at the sea
If you had such a glamorous surname as Gonzalez Durantez , and you married someone named Clegg , well ... what would you do ?
Miriam can be forgiven for keeping her maiden name .
Despite this , Mr Clegg and his wife were a picture of happiness as they shared an espresso on the seafront for the benefit of the cameras .
Miriam even carried off what appeared to be a pair of dungarees , but are probably the height of fashion .
During her husband 's speech on Wednesday , we learnt it was their ninth wedding anniversary .
Miriam also thinks her husband is nothing like Brad Pitt , the Lib Dem leader told us .
And after the speech , as she joined Mr Clegg for a walkabout in the audience , she showed insouciance by pulling up a slipping bra strap .
For this , but perhaps in the absence of other contenders , she was the star of the conference .
Vote yellow – go turquoise
The moment was historic , but was barely noticed by commentators .
Which is perhaps what the party wanted .
Before Mr Clegg 's speech , his warm - up man Tim Farron made a joke about yellow not matching his blond hair , clicked his fingers , and suddenly the yellow we associate with the Lib Dems was replaced by a turquoise backdrop and the words " a fresh start for Britain " .
Turquoise : the colour of warm Caribbean seas ; a place where whales do not meet unedifying and chilly ends but swim for ever .
For psychologists and brand experts , it is supposed to evoke calm and compassion .
Maybe Mr Clegg and his PR people are sending us a subliminal message : the Tories have the slogan " vote blue , go green " but we are actually delivering the beautiful marriage of these two colours .
The problem is , in photographs and on TV it looked blue and is therefore indistinguishable from the Tories .
What others said
" The speech sounded bizarre and suggested Mr Clegg had succumbed to the delusion that his party is going to win at the next general election . "
Andrew Gimson , The Daily Telegraph
" His speech was delivered with poise .
But much of it was the most tremendous hooey .
Prime Minister , indeed ! " Quentin Letts , Daily Mail
" It was a decent performance , his most assured in a leader 's most awkward gig of the year .
But it was not the speech of a prime minister in waiting . "
Michael White , The Guardian

Mr Clegg said he wanted to be Prime Minister , which was a good start .
He made a commitment to raise the income tax threshold to £ 10,000 , reduce class sizes and offer apprenticeships for young people within 90 days of losing their job .
Britain should not withdraw from Afghanistan but there should be a new strategy .
Bathed in calming turquoise , the audience loved it .
But then he asked us to imagine a " Liberal Democrat Cabinet " .
Beyond Vince Cable , Chris Huhne and Mr Clegg himself , it was difficult to imagine .
The conference started badly and threatened to get worse , but Mr Clegg rescued the week with a confident performance .
We will have to wait for the end of conference season to see if voters noticed .

From Stavig v. Stavig , No. 05-0464 ( S.D. Cir. Ct. Aug. 28 , 2008 ) , recently affirmed by the South Dakota Supreme Court :
[ Father ] is a little more able to [ provide for the 6 - year - old son ’s “ temporal , mental and moral welfare ” ] than [ mother ] … .
Both have the ability to give [ son ] love , affection , guidance , education and to impart the family ’s religion or creed .
[ Father ] is inclined to impart the family ’s religion or creed , as he regularly takes the child to Sunday school and at one time enrolled [ son ] in a church - sponsored pre-school .
Conversely , [ mother ] does not take the child to church or Sunday school , and without any apparent reason or explanation , removed the child from a church - sponsored pre-school to send him to an Interlakes Community Action Program .
Father gets physical custody even though mother had been the “ primary caretaker since birth , ” a factor that would normally cut in favor of the mother .
And , as the court said , the decision was close ; the father ’s greater religious observance thus may well have changed the result .
Note also that the court was n’t talking about enforcing some agreement between the parties , which might have called for a particular kind of religious upbringing ; the court was asking what was most conducive to the child ’s “ temporal , mental and moral welfare , ” and apparently concluded that regular churchgoing is better for the child .
Now it might well be that regular churchgoing is indeed in a child ’s best interests .
Or maybe regular churchgoing is against a child ’s best interests .
It seems to me , though , that the First Amendment keeps the government — including courts — from taking a stand on this in deciding people ’s parental rights , at least in the absence of actual evidence of imminent harm to the child ( as opposed to speculation about whether religiosity is good or bad ) .
For more examples of this happening in other states , see this set of posts .
For more general thoughts on the Constitution in child custody cases , see this post .
If you ’re really interested , you could have a look at my article on Parent - Child Speech and Child Custody Speech Restrictions , 81 NYU L. Rev. 631 ( 2006 ) , which discusses the Religion Clauses issues as well as the Free Speech Clause issue .
Finally , for cases holding ( in my view correctly ) that a parent ’s lack of religiosity generally ought not be a factor in custody decisions , see Placencia v. Placencia , 3 S.W.3d 497 , 502 ( Tenn. Ct. App. 1999 ) ; In re Marriage of Oswald , 847 P.2d 251 , 253 ( Colo . Ct. App. 1993 ) ; Burrows v. Brady , 605 A.2d 1312 , 1317 ( R.I. 1992 ) ; Elbert v.

Among those in Britain already using the drugs and hoping for a change in the way they are viewed is Anna Jones ( not her real name ) , a 35 - year - old university lecturer , who takes LSD once or twice a year .
She fears that without an occasional dose she will go back to the drinking problem she left behind 14 years ago with the help of the banned drug .
LSD , the drug synonymous with the 1960s counterculture , changed her life in a day , she says .
'' For me it was the catalyst to give up destructive behaviour - heavy drinking and smoking .
As a student I used to drink two or three bottles of wine , two or three days a week , because I did n't have many friends and did n't feel comfortable in my own skin .
Then I took a hit of LSD one day and did n't feel alone any more .
It helped me to see myself differently , increase my self - confidence , lose my desire to drink or smoke and just feel at one with the world . ''
Many others are using the drugs to deal with chronic anxiety attacks brought on by terminal illness such as cancer .
Research was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s into psychedelics .
In some places they were even used as a treatment for anxiety , depression and addiction .
But a backlash against LSD - owing to concerns that the powerful hallucinogen was becoming widespread as a recreational drug , and fear that excessive use could trigger mental health conditions such as schizophrenia - led to prohibition of research in the 1970s .
Under Britain's Misuse of Drugs
Act it is classified as a Class A , schedule 1 substance , which means not only is LSD considered highly dangerous but it is deemed to have no medical research value .
Now , though , distinguished academics and highly respected institutions are looking again at whether LSD and other psychedelics might help patients .
Psychiatrist Dr John Halpern , of Harvard Medical School in the US , found that almost all of 53 people with cluster headaches who illegally took LSD or psilocybin , the active compound in magic mushrooms , obtained relief from the searing pain .
He and an international team have also begun investigating whether 2 - Bromo - LSD , a non-psychedelic version of LSD known as BOL , can help ease the condition .
Studies into how the drug may be helping such people are also being carried out in Britain .
Amanda Feilding is the director of the Oxford - based Beckley Foundation , a charitable trust that investigates consciousness , its altered states and the effects of psychedelics and meditation .
She is a key figure in the revival of scientific interest in psychedelics and expresses her excitement about the initial findings of two studies with which her foundation is heavily involved .
'' LSD is a potentially very valuable substance for human health and happiness , '' she said .
In a Swiss trial , the drug is given alongside psychotherapy to people who have a terminal condition to help them cope with profound anxiety .
A trial in the US is examining whether psilocybin can aid psychotherapy for those with substance addiction .
Professor Colin Blakemore , a former chief executive of the UK Medical Research Council , said the class - A status of psychedelics should not stop them being explored as potential therapies .
A Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency spokeswoman said : '' These products , if approved , are likely to be classified as a prescription - only medicine and also likely to remain on the dangerous - drug list , which means that their supply would be strictly controlled . ''

The experience
Douglas FROM the age of eight I suffered frequent and severe headaches , usually three or four a week , which caused acute pain and interfered with work and games .
I first tried 200 micrograms of LSD in 1970 .
I had no headaches for three weeks .
I then had another headache , though not as severe as usual , and the next day took another 200 micrograms .
This time the headaches disappeared for six months .
After that , whenever I had a bad headache I took a dose of LSD , usually 100 micrograms .
My headaches have since become very rare , perhaps one or two a year .
Philip FIVE years ago I had just finished my third chemotherapy session for leukaemia , which was the worst experience of my life .
I did n't eat for 21 days , my weight dropped to eight stone and I was bald .
I took acid at a party .
I was n't in remission , so I should n't have taken it , but it was an amazing experience .
It made me euphoric .
I 'm not religious but I had a wonderful experience , like angels coming over the walls and white clouds out of a blue sky .
I thought , '' I 've got to live ' ' ; it gave me the will to carry on .
It gave me the strength that I could do it .

WASHINGTON  The Transportation Security Administration plans to install 150 security machines at airport checkpoints that enable screeners to see under passengers ' clothes .
The installation will vastly expand the use of the controversial body scanners , which can reveal hidden bombs and knives .
But the devices have been labeled as intrusive by some lawmakers .
The House of Representatives in June overwhelmingly passed a measure that would restrict their use by the TSA to passengers flagged by other types of screening , such as metal detectors .
The measure is pending in the Senate .
TULSA : Passengers try out body scan TSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee said the machines are " critical " to stopping terrorists with homemade bombs that may elude metal detectors .
The agency has n't decided which airports will get the machines , Lee said .
The $ 100,000 scanners shoot low - intensity X - rays that penetrate clothing , bounce off a person 's skin and create images that show solid objects as dark areas .
The TSA machines have privacy additions to create images that look like etchings .
Screeners view them on a monitor in a locked room near a checkpoint and delete them immediately after viewing .
" Body imaging is a total invasion of privacy , " said Rep. Jason Chaffetz , R - Utah , who proposed the restriction .
" You do n't need this kind of scrutiny . "
Although the machines use X -rays , a 2003 report by the National Council on Radiation Protection & Measurements , which Congress created to develop radiation guidelines , said people can safely be scanned by the machines up to 2,500 times a year .
" Imaging technology is safe , " Lee said .
The TSA used $ 25 million from the federal stimulus package to buy the scanners from California - based Rapiscan Systems .
The agency is using an additional $ 22 million to buy 500 upgraded machines that scan bottles for liquid explosives .
The TSA has been testing scanners since early 2007 , mostly on passengers who set off a metal - detector alarm and are taken aside for additional screening .
The new scanners will be installed beginning early next year and will be used in place of metal detectors at checkpoints .
Passengers may choose to avoid the scanners and be screened by a metal detector , but those who do will be pulled aside for a pat - down , Lee said .
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Christopher Calabrese said using the scanners in place of metal detectors " is unquestionably a step in the direction of having these machines be mandatory . "

Hollywood hypocrisy :
Why would anyone trust celebrities for financial advice ?
Will Ferrell and a gaggle of other Hollywood stars are now appearing in a MoveOn.org video that knocks executives of medical insurance companies .
Let ’s just set aside the fact that it ’s even less funny than Ferrell ’s last couple movies and proceed to more important issues .
LIke is it fair and well - researched ?
Is it even good advice ?
Or is it just more half - baked Hollywood hypocrisy ?
The clips are actually just a smoothly - produced bit of propaganda for government - run healthcare .
And modicum of research reveals that the healthcare industry has extremely thin profit margins ( ranked 86th ) and that medical insurance executives are n’t paid any higher than , let ’s say , entertainment executives and far less than comedians who think they ’re economic experts .
But what damaged part of the American psyche makes us believe celebrities , especially when it comes to financial and economic matters ?
Why would we want to believe , for instance , a guy who made millions by starring in Land of the Lost .
A movie , by the way , that cost $ 200 million to make and made , like , forty cents at the box office .
( How many people could that piece of cinematic garbage have insured ? )
Why should we value the opinion of people who are paid millions of dollars and who feel the need to increase taxes on their biggest fans –the middle class ?
Here ’s a better solution :
If all the Hollywood Obama backers and the celebrities who star in these MoveOn.org flicks are flush with cash , comps , bonuses and gift baskets and feel they could do a better job at providing medical insurance , why do n’t they pool their money together , create a venture capital pool , and create a new medical insurance provider ?

Some things are more entertaining than politics Former police officer Barry Cooper ( author , " Never Get Busted Again " ) is so disgusted with the War on Drugs that he came up with an idea for a reality TV show called " Kop Busters . "
In a clever sting operation , police ended up raiding a house where nothing illegal was going on -- most likely because their illegal FLIR cameras detected indoor grow lights :
" KopBusters rented a house in Odessa , Texas and began growing two small Christmas trees under a grow light similar to those used for growing marijuana , " claims a release from NeverGetBusted.com
" When faced with a suspected marijuana grow , the police usually use illegal FLIR cameras and / or lie on the search warrant affidavit claiming they have probable cause to raid the house .
Instead of conducting a proper investigation which usually leads to no probable cause , the Kops lie on the affidavit claiming a confidential informant saw the plants and / or the police could smell marijuana coming from the suspected house . "
" The trap was set and less than 24 hours later , the Odessa narcotics unit raided the house only to find KopBuster 's attorney waiting under a system of complex gadgetry and spy cameras that streamed online to the KopBuster 's secret mobile office nearby .
" The attorney was handcuffed and later released when eleven KopBuster detectives arrived with the media in tow to question the illegal raid .
The police refused to give KopBusters the search warrant affidavit which is suspected to contain the lies regarding the probable cause .
" It is not illegal to grow plants under a light in your home but it is illegal to lie on an affidavit and plant drugs on a citizen .
This operation was the first of its kind in the history of America .
Police sometimes have other police investigating their crimes but the American court system has never dealt with a group of citizens stinging the police .
Will the police file charges on the team who took down the corrupt cops ?
We will keep you posted . "
Here 's the video :
Here 's the video : Cooper says that he targeted the Odessa police because marijuana was planted on a young woman which resulted in an eight year sentence : Cooper chose the Odessa police department for baiting because he believes police there instructed an informant to plant marijuana on a woman named Yolanda Madden .
She 's currently serving an eight - year sentence for possession with intent to distribute .
According to Cooper , the informant actually admitted in federal court that he planted the marijuana .
Madden was convicted anyway .
Video here : I wish Cooper had made more of these videos , but he seems to be busy running for Attorney General on the Libertarian ticket .
More power to him , and may he fight the good fight , etc .
I hate to sound cynical , but history shows that Libertarian Party candidates do n't win .
However , it 's nice to know that people who do n't like police tactics in the drug war at least have an outlet , because they 're not going to find it in either of the two major parties .
For reasons that are not entirely clear to me , the drug war seems to have been ruled off limits for discussion by mutual agreement of both parties .
What I think would be truly inspiring would be for Cooper 's Republican opponent Ted Cruz ( praised by NRO 's Jay Nordlinger as well as Eugene Volokh ) to join Cooper in denouncing the war on drugs .
I say this not in any way as criticism of Cruz , who is obviously a fine man , and for whom I would have no trouble voting if I lived in Texas .
The war on drugs is so institutionalized and ingrained in both parties that it 's just part of the way the system works .
As un-budgeable as big government itself .
Voting does not change these things .
Any real change in policy cannot come from the top , but has to come from below , in the form of people getting outraged .
I think Cooper could accomplish more by going back to making these sting videos than he ever could by running as a Libertarian .
Never mind the fact that polls show more public support for marijuana legalization -- and against cruel mandatory minimum sentencing laws -- than for gay marriage .
Polls , platforms , facts and figures do n't work nearly as well as seeing a video showing people something that could actually happen to them .

“ WHEN history calls , history calls . ”
Those were the words uttered by Olympia Snowe just before she cast her vote in favour of a long - awaited health bill in the Senate 's Finance Committee on Tuesday October 13th .
Ms Snowe apart , the committee voted strictly on party lines : 13 Democrats in favour and nine Republicans against .
It was a closer - run battle than that tally suggests , as several Democrats wavered until the last moment , angry that the proposal does not contain a provision for a government - run insurer , or “ public plan ” .
In the end they voted for the proposal because it would advance , in imperfect fashion , several liberal goals .
Over the coming decade it is supposed to increase the proportion of Americans with health insurance from 85 % or so ( over 46 m now lack cover ) to perhaps 94 % .
And it would forbid insurers from dropping sick customers for having “ pre-existing conditions ” or costly illnesses that blow through caps on lifetime costs .
The bill aims to accomplish all this through a tangle of new regulations , taxes , subsidies and bureaucratic creations .
Individuals will be forced to get cover and new subsidies will be offered to the less well off .
Insurance markets will be restructured so that the uninsured , small businesses and those buying pricey individual plans today can switch to affordable but adequate plans .
All this will cost $ 829 billion over the next decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , a non-partisan agency .
Crucially , that is below the $ 900 billion threshold set by Barack Obama .
By imposing taxes on the most expensive insurance plans and planning swingeing cuts in Medicare , the state health scheme for the elderly , the CBO says the bill will not increase the government deficit .
The bill 's passage is certainly good news for Mr Obama .
Max Baucus , the chair of the committee , not only won a veneer of bipartisanship with Ms Snowe 's vote , he also crafted a bill that is more moderate than the four other bills already passed ( by the Senate 's Health Committee , and by three House committees ) .
The two current Senate bills will be reconciled into a version for the upper chamber to vote on soon , and the outcome of that process will itself be reconciled with whatever merged bill passes the House .
The Baucus bill may yet serve as the template for reform .
But challenges remain .
One will come on the floor of the Senate from Oregon 's Ronald Wyden , whose laudable efforts to reform the tax distortion that favours employer - provided health insurance was not given a fair hearing by the Finance Committee .
To secure Mr Wyden 's vote Mr Baucus promised to help him with an amendment from the floor .
Another potential snag is that the left will now try to tack - on the public option as an amendment on the Senate floor .
A proposal that would let states decide whether they want such a scheme is gaining support among even moderate Democrats .
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House , has made it plain that some version of the public option is a must for her chamber .
Horrified by the coming reconciliation process , Orrin Hatch , a Republican senator , declared after this week 's vote that “ it 's going down from here . ”
Not everyone accepts this view .
Jonathan Gruber , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , argues that the Finance Committee bill may benefit from the coming merger with the Senate Health Committee 's more generous bill .
He thinks the Baucus bill is too stingy when it comes to subsidies and too lenient with the fines imposed on those who violate the individual mandate .
This penny - pinching approach keeps the bill 's apparent cost under $ 900 billion this coming decade but risks undermining the effort to achieve universal coverage .
Insurers this week kicked up a fuss over the matter and Mr Gruber acknowledges that they have a legitimate grouse .
The Baucus bill forces them to cover everyone but does not have enough carrots or sticks to enforce universal coverage .
That leaves the industry exposed to adverse selection , whereby young and healthy ( read : inexpensive ) customers avoid buying cover until they are sick , at which point new regulations will force the industry to provide them with cover .
The biggest problems with this imperfect bill arise from cost .
It does too little to tame health inflation , as Douglas Elmendorf , head of the CBO , hinted this week .
And the bill is likely to cost far more than currently advertised , because of two wheezes .
One is a lethargic implementation plan , which means that the full annual cost will not kick in for a few years yet ( thus making the CBO 's mandatory ten - year cost estimate misleadingly low ) .
The second is the assumption of heroic cost savings from Medicare and big cuts in payments .
Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think - tank , scoffs that “ this legislation is an example of the triumph of budgeting hope over experience . ”
Sunshine Coast drivers will be hit with $ 40 fines for leaving their cars unlocked at the beach this summer .

NEW HAVEN , Connecticut ( CNN ) -- Police said Tuesday night they have a Yale University employee in custody in connection with the killing of Yale student Annie Le .
Authorities took Yale University employee Raymond Clark into custody late Tuesday night .
A judge has issued a search warrant and a body warrant on Raymond Clark , 24 , said New Haven , Connecticut , Police Chief James Lewis at a news conference .
The search warrant allows for an examination of his home , Lewis said .
The body warrant allows police to collect DNA from Clark , who will be arrested if he does not comply , Lewis said .
Results of DNA tests could take a day or longer , according to Lewis .
Others have voluntarily given up their DNA samples , he said .
Earlier Tuesday , the Yale technician 's home in Middletown , Connecticut , was the scene of a large police presence .
Investigators have collected about 150 pieces of evidence , reviewed about 700 hours of video and interviewed more than 150 people , some twice , Lewis said .
They have yet to arrest anyone in Le 's slaying , whose body was found Sunday in a basement wall of a medical research building off campus .
A senior police official that spoke with CNN disputed Yale University President Richard Levin , who had indicated that the suspect pool would be a " limited number " of people who had been in the basement the day Le disappeared .
" We know everyone that was in the basement ... and we passed that on to police , " Levin said .
" There is an abundance of evidence . "
Watch latest on person in custody »
But the police official , whom CNN is not naming because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation , said investigators believe dozens of people could have had access to that area of the building .
Watch how Le 's body was found »
Le , 24 , disappeared September 8 .
She was last seen on surveillance video as she entered the four - story lab at 10 Amistad Street , about 10 blocks from the main campus .
After going over hours of tapes , authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building .
Watch timeline leading up to Le 's death »
The police official said that investigators were unlikely to make any arrest until DNA evidence is returned from analysis and that the probe could take days .
Police have not released information on what DNA evidence may have been found , although investigators said earlier that bloody clothing was found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling in another part of the building .
Authorities have not described the clothes that were found , nor said to whom they might have belonged .
Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the bloodstained clothes .
But Thomas Kaplan , editor in chief of the Yale Daily News , said a Yale police official told the paper that the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building .
On Sunday , New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said that Le 's killing was not a random act but would not elaborate .
Watch report on police saying killing was no random act »
Le , a graduate student in Yale 's pharmacology program , was to have been married Sunday on New York 's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky , a graduate student at Columbia University .
Her friend Vanessa Flores said Le was overjoyed about getting married .
" She was just so excited about this wedding and everything from , you know , her flowers to her wedding dress and just certain details about it , " Flores told HLN 's Nancy Grace .
" We talked about this back in 2008 .
She was already thinking about the weather , whether June , July was going to be too hot , August , so September , would it be nice ? "
Watch Flores describe Le 's plans for " her dream day " »
Le was from Placerville , California , and seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town .
In February , she compared crime and safety at Yale with other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine , published by the medical school .
Among the tips she offered : Keep a minimum amount on your person .
When she walked over to the research building on September 8 , she left her purse , credit cards and cell phone in her office .
CNN 's Tom Foreman , Mary Snow , Susan Candiotti , Katie Ross and LaNeice Collins contributed to this report .
All About New Haven • Federal Bureau of Investigation • Yale University
To all budding philanthropists in America :
If you are worried about things like a decline in reading , an inability to express oneself well verbally , a general lack of knowledge about the past or its significance , or the emergence of a thoughtless populist politics , then take note :
You ca n’t expect people to dedicate themselves fully to being rational if they have to work 2 jobs just to pay tuition and 2 more jobs after school to pay off the debt .
What ’s frightening is the cost UD students pay for this sort of education .
Yeah , they come out having covered at the least Plato ’s Republic and Symposium , Aristotle ’s Ethics , the Federalist , Homer ’s Iliad and Odyssey , Virgil ’s Aeneid , Dante ’s Divine Comedy , Milton ’s Paradise Lost , Shakespeare , the Bible , Augustine ’s Confessions , in addition to 2 semesters of American and 2 of World History .
By way of comparison with Rutgers , where I went to undergrad : none of the above was required , except an American history requirement , and if any of the above were covered in any way , it was in a matter of days or a week or two ( this was the case with the Republic .
People here spend most of the semester on it ) .
But the cost is n’t just the immediate financial cost , which can be 6 figures over 4 years if no aid from the school is forthcoming ( meeting someone in this situation yesterday pushed me to write this post ) .
The cost is also that to study so intensely , one ’s energies can’t really be devoted to anything else .
We have this ridiculous idea that if something is really worth a lot , we have to work independent of that thing for it .
For example : if we really want to study Latin , what we have to do is work every other single job for years until we have a ton of cash , or take out massive loans which will require us to work the next 20 years of our lives to pay off , and then go study .
I can safely tell you that if you want to complain about why it looks like the world is getting dumber as we get more and more technology , look no further than the enormous incentives we place on practical learning .
Mass media is a form of practical learning : as much as I love reading the paper and keeping up with the news , the idea that I can be an expert on a topic by keeping up with a news flow on it is pretty preposterous .
Principles , methods of analysis and the ability to work with arguments need to be formed and experienced at a far deeper level : the news is only good if people know how to be informed .
What ’s remarkable , of course , is that plenty of people do go to school , do take on these burdens , and do come out knowing more while having tons of debt .
For all the complaining about how English majors know nothing or how philosophy is useless , there are plenty of people in schools all over the US who try , despite how problematic everything is .
Some of those people , of course , are being forced to get a degree .
They ’re being told a degree of any sort is good by people that could probably use a formal education themselves .
Our modes of learning are utter chaos right now : we ’re imposing on intellectual virtues what is left of the moral virtues ( hard work and frugality are n’t strictly speaking virtues .
Criminals can have both ) .
Until this changes , we will continue to do a massive injustice to the life of the mind , our own heritage , and our future .
Obama finds himself at that same lonely decision point now .
Though he came to the presidency declaring Afghanistan a “ war of necessity , ” circumstances have since changed .
While the Taliban thrives there , Al Qaeda ’s ground zero is next - door in nuclear - armed Pakistan .
Last month ’s blatantly corrupt , and arguably stolen , Afghanistan election ended any pretense that Hamid Karzai is a credible counter to the Taliban or a legitimate partner for America in a counterinsurgency project of enormous risk and cost .
Indeed , Karzai , whose brother is a reputed narcotics trafficker , is a double for Ngo Dinh Diem , the corrupt South Vietnamese president whose brother also presided over a vast , government - sanctioned criminal enterprise in the early 1960s .
And unlike Kennedy , whose C.I.A. helped take out the Diem brothers , Obama does n’t have a coup in his toolbox .
Goldstein points out there are other indisputable then - and - now analogies as well .
Much as Vietnam could not be secured over the centuries by China , France , Japan or the United States , so Afghanistan has been a notorious graveyard for the ambitions of Alexander the Great , the British and the Soviets .
“ Some states in world politics are simply not susceptible to intervention by the great powers , ” Goldstein told me .
He also notes that the insurgencies in Afghanistan and Vietnam share the same geographical advantage .
As the porous border of neighboring North Vietnam provided sanctuary and facilitated support to our enemy then , so Pakistan serves our enemy today .
Most worrisome , in Goldstein ’s view , is the notion that a recycling of America ’s failed “ clear and hold ” strategy in Vietnam could work in Afghanistan .
How can American forces protect the population , let alone help build a functioning nation , in a tribal narco - state consisting of some 40,000 mostly rural villages over an area larger than California and New York combined ?

Even if we routed the Taliban in another decade or two , after countless casualties and billions of dollars , how would that stop Al Qaeda from coalescing in Somalia or some other criminal host state ?
How would a Taliban - free Afghanistan stop a jihadist trained in Pakistan ’s Qaeda camps from mounting a terrorist plot in Denver and Queens ?
Already hawks are arguing that any deviation from McChrystal ’s combat - troop requests is tantamount to surrender and “ immediate withdrawal . ”
But that all - in or all - out argument , a fixture of the Iraq debate , is just as false a choice here .
Obama is not contemplating either surrender to terrorists or withdrawal from Afghanistan .
One prime alternative is the counterterrorism plan championed by Biden .
As The Times reported , it would scale back American forces in Afghanistan to “ focus more on rooting out Al Qaeda there and in Pakistan . ”
Obama ’s decision , whichever it is , will demand all the wisdom and political courage he can muster .
If he adds combat troops , he ’ll be extending a deteriorating eight - year - long war without a majority of his country or his own party behind him .
He ’ll have to explain why more American lives should be yoked to the Karzai “ government . ”
He ’ll have to be honest in estimating the cost .
( The Iraq war , which the Bush administration priced at $ 50 to $ 60 billion , is at roughly $ 1 trillion and counting . )
He will have to finally ask recession - battered Americans what his predecessor never did :
How much  and what  are you willing to sacrifice in blood and treasure for the mission ?
* FDA objects to Latisse website
* Company downplayed risks , FDA says
* Allergan says working to address concerns ( Adds FDA and company comments , byline , share price )
WASHINGTON , Sept 16 ( Reuters ) - An Allergan Inc AGN.N website for a drug to lengthen eyelashes downplayed potential side effects such as redness and changes in eye color , U.S. health officials said in a letter released on Wednesday .
The website and other promotional material developed by Allergan “ are misleading because they omit and minimize risks associated with Latisse , ” the Food and Drug Administration said in a Sept. 10 letter to the company .
Latisse is a once - a- day prescription drug approved in December 2008 for lengthening and thickening eyelashes .
The FDA said certain pages on a Latisse website for consumers failed to mention risks such as a bacterial infection if the drug or applicators become contaminated .
The web pages also minimized eye redness and itching because they suggested those conditions were not associated with allergic reactions related to the treatment , the FDA said .
Allergan ’s website also “ misleadingly suggests that only ‘ similar ’ medications have been associated with the risk of increased iris pigmentation , ” which causes eye color to become more brown , the agency said .
The FDA asked Allergan to immediately stop using the materials .
The company is “ working closely with the FDA to address all their concerns , ” Allergan spokeswoman Heather Katt said .
One set of promotional material that drew FDA objections , an exhibit that described the evolution of lash enhancers , is no longer being used , Katt said .
Allergan , maker of wrinkle - fighting injection Botox , has forecast peak sales for Latisse topping $ 500 million a year .
Allergan shares gained 2.6 percent to close at $ 58.55 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange .

Print this article FDA Protects Pharma Profits , Not Health - Argues new Book " Fight for Your Health " by Byron J. Richards is a new book about the FDA , the agency that has been hailed as the archetype of a protector of public health , a model of success to be emulated in countries all over the world .
But the rosy picture is about to lose its shine .
The agency that is supposed to control food and drugs in the USA is increasingly seen as a willing protector of industry policies and profits - to the detriment of the health of the American public .
Fight for Your Health - Exposing the FDA 's Betrayal of America Byron Richards , who is a certified clinical nutritionist , has pulled together and documented the disturbing reality of an agency that is supposed to protect the public from harm but that is now under the control of those pharmaceutical corportaions it is supposed to be policing .
Much of the FDA 's financing comes directly from the pharmaceutical industry , but those dollars have strings attached .
Pharma executives want new drugs approved fast and they insist that " their " money be earmarked for only that purpose .
That means safety of medicines is way down on the ladder of priorities , while speed of drug approval and protection of pharma 's immense profits are at the top .
- - -
Executives of the agency are directly connected with pharmaceutical interests , and have stated that their priority is the health and well being of their industry .
They pit the fact that people die of disease against the " problem " of there being a drug approval process , as if more drugs automatically meant more health .
FDA - approved medical procedures including drugs have become the leading cause of death and injury in the US , but the number two man at the agency , Scott Gottlieb , who is a former Wall Street insider promoting hot biotech stocks to investors , says doctors are to blame when medicine kills the patient : " In many cases , in many corners of medicine , it is not a drug that hurts someone , but the wrong decision making .
A drug that is lifesaving in one context can be deadly in another .
And separating the two scenarios sometimes turns on the slimmest amounts of hard - to - glean information and the very hardest and most personal of medical decisions .
That is why all medical decisions to use powerful medicines , all of which have certain side effects , are fraught with a certain amount of risk .
Whether it 's advanced age , or other co-morbidities - there are many reasons why the risks sometimes outweigh the benefits of even the best medicines ...
And that 's not to say that we ever know everything there is about particular drugs .
In fact , we seldom do .
Even some of the oldest medicines still harbor certain mysteries . "
With that justification , the killing - of patients - continues .
Drug company profits are more holy than the lives and health of you and me .
Image credit : Emma Holister Collusion of the watchdog with industry is widespread and obvious , but the book sets these corrupt practices in a wider context , giving us a glimpse of what the future may hold .
A public health plan has all Americans ' personal health data registered in a government owned database , children being screened for their mental health and " appropriate " medication dispensed .
Implantable computer chips are part of the plan , as well as human experimentation of new drugs right in the doctor 's office .
The right to sue drug companies in case of harm is being restricted and DNA will be collected to forward a new eugenics agenda .
Of course natural alternatives to pharmaceutical medicines are under attack by the very agency that is supposedly protecting the public .
Byron 's book is a wake - up call , not only for Americans but also for those in other countries who who have been conditioned to look at the FDA as the most reliable source of information for drug safety .
That is certainly the biggest lie and the one that does the most damage .
We cannot and must not rely on the decisions and pronouncements of an agency that is clearly dominated by the industry it is supposed to regulate .
Fight for Your Health makes it quite clear that consumers , but also medical doctors and health officials in America and indeed in every country , are on their own .
The system is corrupt and will not help us - unless we succeed in changing the way it works .
If we value our health , we must inform ourselves of dangers and pitfalls as well as good , simple ways of keeping healthy .
And our legislators must find a workable alternative to the FDA 's clearly biased and - according to Byron Richards - treasonous approach .

January 31 , 2006 - Sepp Hasslberger Doctors : Eliminate Corrupting Pharma Influence
Is it time for doctors to sever their close and often corrupting ties with pharmaceutical manufacturers ?
A group of prominent physicians associated with the George Soros - funded Institute on Medicine as a Profession ( IOMP ) proposes to eliminate even the smaller gifts such as lunches and office material the pharmaceutical companies are offering doctors routinely in an effort to promote the sale of their drugs over those of the competition .

Some worked , others not ...
Sepp
I lack words to appreciate your efforts to deliver mankind from this health bondage .
Africa now is the breeding ground for all sorts of pharmaceutical products from the West , and the government is being paid to propagate it .
I am a pastor with the street children , who are victims of circumstances and are always in perpetual sickness .
I am standing with you to help sensitize the public of what the drug industry has been doing to their health for this long .
If there is any way to be part of this movement my street children and I are ready to give our best .
I wish to hear from you soonest .
God bless you all , and more divine insight .

Jealous boyfriend stabbed partner to death after she changed Facebook status to ' single '
A jealous boyfriend who knifed his partner to death after she changed her Facebook status from ' married ' to ' single ' has been jailed for life .
Mother - of - four Hayley Jones , 26 , was found stabbed by her young children just days after altering her status on the popular social networking site .
She and Brian Lewis had been teenage sweethearts since Hayley was 13 and regarded themselves as man and wife even though they never married .
Lewis , 31 , killed the care worker after telling friends he could not bear losing her to another man after she started spending more and more time online .
Jealous : Brian Lewis , left , stabbed Hayley Jones , his partner of 13 years , to death after she changed her status on Facebook from ' married ' to ' single '
Enraged Lewis used a kitchen knife to stab Hayley through three layers of clothing and two sleeping bags .
Lewis - also known as Charlie - then fled the house while two of their children were standing at the top of the stairs listening to the row .
Son Kian gave video evidence how he heard his mother screaming : ' No Charlie , no Charlie , I love you ’ .
The jury heard that Kian heard his father call the police to say : ' I have killed my girlfriend . '
Kian , who was sitting on the top of the stairs with brother Jordan , seven , said : ' Then it all went quiet .
' I called if I could go for a wee .
There was no answer so we went downstairs and saw mam lying on the floor .
' There was blood in her mouth and on her T - shirt .
I was pushing her but she would n't wake up . '
Judge Mr Justice Roderick Evans jailed Lewis for life and ordered he serve at least 14 years .
He said : ‘ It was a murderous attack .
There was no provocation - this arose because you were frustrated , angry and hurt .
You had been building up your anger .
' She did nothing or said nothing which could have acted as a trigger for this . ’
Mark Evans , for the prosecution , said that the couple had been teenage sweethearts since Hayley was 13 and regarded themselves as man and wife even though they had never married .
He added : ' Hayley started to expand her social life and was spending a lot of time on internet sites in particular Facebook .
' She was quite secretive about this , preventing Lewis from using the site and turning the computer off - it is quite clear this rankled with him .
' On March 2 , she changed her Facebook relationship status from married to single and she made it clear their relationship was over .
' A week after she Hayley changed her profile Lewis was heard telling drinking friends : " If I ca n't have her no f** * er else will because I 'll kill her first . " '
The court heard that after the killing Lewis fled the scene to leave children Jordan , Cory , Kian and Tia to find their mother 's body on the settee .
He later gave himself up to police .
Standing in the dock , he said : ' I was n't happy about the way she was always on the computer .
I was suspicious of her pulling the lid down on the laptop .
' I did n't think she was seeing anybody but I was suspicious about who she was talking to and who was sending her stuff on the computer . '
He denied murder , saying he was acting in self - defence after a disagreement , but a jury took just three hours to find him guilty .
The next state general election will not occur until November , but backers of a ballot proposal to legalize the use of medical marijuana in Arizona claim to be well on their way to qualifying the measure for the 2010 ballot .
Andrew Myers , a manager for the Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project , said the campaign so far has collected approximately 125,000 voter signatures from 450 independently contracted collectors .
That ’s still below the needed 153,365 required signatures due with the Arizona Secretary of State ’s Office by next July .
But plenty of time remains .
“ This is going incredibly well and better than I would have anticipated , ” said Myers , who was a staffer for former Governor Janet Napolitano .
Myers expects the group ultimately will amass 250,000 signatures .
Under the proposal , Arizonans with qualifying medical conditions and symptoms would be permitted by Arizona Department of Health Services to obtain limited amounts of marijuana for personal use from state - regulated dispensaries .
The Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project would protect patients , doctors and caregivers of patients that suffer from diseases such as cancer , AIDS , HIV , Alzheimer ’s , Hepatitis C and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from prosecution under state and federal law .
Glaucoma patients and others ailing from diseases or medical treatments that cause severe and chronic pain , nausea , seizures , muscle spasms and severe loss of muscle mass also would be permitted to use marijuana with the recommendation of a doctor and department consent .
The Arizona ballot proposal follows the spirit of California ’s Proposition 215 , the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 , which legalized medical - marijuana use and ultimately led to the formation of hundreds of pot dispensaries throughout the state .
Since then , the Marijuana Policy Project has emerged as the nation ’s primary advocate and cash register for pro-marijuana laws and initiative efforts .
The Washington , D.C. - based nonprofit has an estimated 23,000 contributors and operates an annual budget of approximately $ 5 million , according to Guidestar , a private corporation that monitors charities .
Theoretically , the campaign for medical marijuana use in Arizona , which includes the multi-state marketing firm Reister , could be forced to compete for donations with a recently launched ballot effort to decriminalize all adult use of marijuana in California .
The California drive is supported by the Marijuana Policy Project , and the two entities are engaging in discussions about what role the national group will play in the drive to legalize marijuana , said Doug Linney , a campaign coordinator for the Regulate , Control , and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 .
The national group so far has contributed $ 110,000 to the Arizona ballot effort , although the committee has not received a contribution for several months .
Signature collections in California would begin Sept. 24 , said Linney , adding most of the group ’s funding has come from marijuana dispensary owner Richard Lee , who is also managing the campaign .
In California , ballot initiative committees are not required to disclose their financial sources until a measure qualifies for the ballot .
Backers of the marijuana initiative must turn in 433,971 signatures of registered California voters by Feb. 18 to qualify for the 2010 ballot .
Linney said initial polling indicates 56 percent of the state ’s residents favor legalizing marijuana ; a conclusion he said is indicative of a belief that criminalization of marijuana has been needlessly expensive and misguided .
“ The challenge is to show that this is a workable solution , ” he said , predicting California will turn into the national “ battleground for the move to tax and regulate cannabis . ”
The signature threshold means high costs for ballot initiative committees , but Myers said he is not worried the Arizona drive to legalize pot for medical purposes will be crowded out by California ’s more expansive effort .
“ All we have to do is make a phone call and then more money comes in , ” Myers said .
“ It ’s not a situation that we are sweating at all .
Arizona is their number one priority . ”
Myers claim that his organization has collected 125,000 signatures was partially validated by Andrew Chavez , owner of Petition Partners , an Arizona firm hired to ensure that signers of petitions to support the Arizona initiative are registered Arizona voters .
Chavez said that he had not kept a running count of signatures his firm has examined , but added Myers ’ tally “ seemed about right . ”
Que siempre no .
García Márquez y sus putas tristes no serán placeados por Puebla .
Se canceló .
Las voces se alzaron : filmar esta película podía entenderse como una " forma de promoción de un delito como la pederastia " ; y la suerte estaba echada .
Por lo menos en Puebla , y por lo menos ahora , no se filmará .
" La censura espera con ilusión el día en que los escritores se censurarán a sí mismos y el censor podrá retirarse " , dice J.M. Coetzee en Contra la censura .
Y , ¡carajo ! , qué fácil es caer en tentaciones censoras , aún en aras de las mejores causas .
La historia es breve : el estado de Puebla , en México , sería locación para la filmación de Memorias de mis putas tristes , obra de Gabriel García Márquez en adaptación de Jean - Claude Carrière y dirigida por Henning Carlsen .
García Márquez no necesita presentación ; Carrière tiene una carrera como guionista cuyos cimientos llegan hasta los diálogos creativos con Luis Buñuel ; Carlsen es un sólido director de cine sueco , con obra que habla por sí misma .
La novela referida es para muchos posiblemente una de las menos logradas de García Márquez : la historia de un anciano que para su cumpleaños 90 se regala una noche de sexo con Delgadina , una adolescente virgen .
Tiene sus raíces en obras previas , como La casa de las bellas durmientes de Y. Kawabata , que -es cierto - resuelve de manera mucho más sutil la paradoja del deseo maduro por la inocencia puberta .
El escenario elegido para la filmación no es muy virgen que digamos ; y no porque Puebla haya sido localización ya de muchas películas en la historia del cine .
Lo que hace especial a este estado - cuyo gobierno cofinanciaba el filme - , y sobre todo por el tema de esta obra de García Márquez , son los escándalos de los últimos años que ligan al gobernador , Mario Marín , con un empresario acusado de pederastia y con amenazas abiertas a periodistas que han buscado desenmascarar el tráfico sexual de menores en el sur mexicano .
Es posible que el anuncio de financiamiento de esta película respondiera más a un deseo publicitario por asociar el nombre de García Márquez a un gobierno vilipendiado por la intelectualidad mexicana .
Porque la reacción a las denuncias de posible fomento a la pederastia fueron casi de resorte : sin chistar se retiró la oferta de financiamiento .
Fin de la historia : que no se le haga más ruido .
Y casi logra enterrarse en el barullo de las convulsiones políticas que vive México ; además de que una parte de quienes opinan profesionalmente no le entraron demasiado al tema , porque la ecuación ' García Márquez - libertad de expresión - pederastia - Mario Marín ' no es fácil de resolver .
Algo de lo aquí sucedido no me gusta nada , porque me temo que en aras de una buena causa se tocó a la puerta de la censura .
Un mal manejo de las autoridades locales , esencialmente desprestigiadas , y una reacción purista de quienes defienden causas respetables : la suma de infortunios y la cancelación de la expresión .
Además a priori ; nadie ha hablado de la calidad de la adaptación , no sé siquiera si se conoce .
Fue una reacción precautoria : para evitar lo que pudiera llegar a suceder .
Y ya sabemos que eso no le salió bien ni al Tom Cruise de Minority Report .
Desprecio profundamente la pederastia y apoyo todo esfuerzo por combatirla .
Secundo también las denuncias de quienes han sido atacados por ventilar el tráfico de niños en la parte sur de México .
Pero justo por todo eso se activan mis señales de alarma cuando quienes han luchado por la libertad de expresión ahora piden que no se filme una película porque podría promover la pederastia .
¿ Los espectadores somos incapaces de entender la diferencia entre realidad y ficción ?
¿ No hay grandes obras que evidencian las miserias humanas ?
¿ Quién traza la línea divisoria entre lo que sí estamos en condiciones de consumir y lo que no ?
Eran los años 80 .
Un profesor de literatura nos narró su encuentro con el diablo .
Escribía una novela , y a uno de sus personajes - hombre cuarentón - le gustaban las niñitas .
Para retratarlo mejor , mi profesor se sentó en la banca de un parque y mientras veía jugar a unas pequeñas , imaginó lo inimaginable .
El sólo narrárnoslo nos descubrió también al diablo .
Y no recuerdo que ninguno de nosotros saliera del aula , corriendo , a cometer actos de pederastia .
Lolita de Nabokov ; la publicidad de Calvin Klein ; las fotografías de Benetton ; el manga y su gráfica perturbadora ; ¿cuántas obras conocemos que han provocado la reacción airada de algunos que ven en la materialización de la sexualidad infantil , la peor de las perversiones sociales ?
Quienes abogaron por cancelar la filmación de la película que sería ( ¿o será ? ) de Carlsen argumentaron que la obra de García Márquez hace menos daño porque se lee menos , y una película llega a más personas .
¡ Vaya argumento chabacano y paternalista !
Dejemos la explicitación de las miserias humanas a los libros de unos pocos , y resguardemos de ellas a las masas indefensas : ¿así va a ser ?
Ahora bien , si todo el numerito se armó para cobrarle al gobernador Marín sus vínculos con empresarios acusados de pederastia y por la persecución de periodistas , entonces se echó mano de lo mismo que se defendía para atacar al villano .
La libertad de expresión no está a merced del juicio de unos cuantos , ni pueden esos cuantos decidir lo que otros debemos consumir .
Existe el principio de elección .
Y en tal caso habríamos debido darle el beneficio de la duda a la calidad probada de Carrière y Carlsen .
Yo espero que lo sucedido se quede sólo en episodio , y no se vuelva tentación reiterada .
Pero , por ahora , ni García Márquez ni sus putas tristes se placearán por Puebla .
Se canceló .
click above for a better viewAutoblog reader Brad sent us a link to the J - Body forums where we found this extraordinarily unique form of self mutilation .
Reading through this forum post 's comments proves this is a real tat , forever scorched with vivid Technicolor into the arm of this young man , known as zsquee24 , who loves his slightly modded J - Body Cavalier a bit too much .
About the odd location , the owner says , " I wanted it on my forearm so if anyone pisses me off , I can hit them with my car and not get vehiclular assault . "
Classy , and smart , too .
Of course , the owner 's friends in the J - body.com forums have been vigorously debating whether their friend is a total idiot or if everyone should just live and let live .
Some of their comments , however , had us rolling on the floor laughing .
" I would have gotten it on a hoodie or something .
Cheaper and not soo permanate . " " oh my word .
how are you going to explain that when you are 40 ? " " What could be cooler , than a cavalier with hair growing out of it !
" " You realize you will never .... EVER .... get laid again ... " " First the Z24 shoes , now this .... you really kicked it up a notch . " [ Source : J- Body.org ]
Bad food and sloth ooze over our planet like hot fudge mixed with giblet gravy .
Fast food speeds us to our doublewide coffins , and we gave up exercise when watches started winding themselves .
But the battle to deliver mankind from its bad habits rages .
Leading the charge , as he has for 80 years , is the Bay Area 's gift to world health , Jack LaLanne .
He 's 95 , in fabulous shape although no longer the slab of muscle who inspired a nation via his daily exercise TV program .
The brain is still cooking , and that 's always been LaLanne 's most effective tool .
Jack 's wife , Elaine , says she fell in love with him a half century ago not for his muscles .
" I was not interested in his body , " says Elaine LaLanne , also in super shape at 84 .
" I was attracted to his mind .
I thought , ' He 's got a brain .
He 's got a brain . ' "
" And he 's sittin ' on it , " LaLanne whispers , squeezing the biceps of an interviewer , who suddenly regrets skipping his morning push - ups .
The LaLannes were in town Wednesday for a party in honor of Jack 's 95th birthday , at John 's Grill , where the Jack LaLanne Salad never goes off the menu .
Teaming with wife
They 're a team , Jack and Elaine .
When the subject of doughnuts comes up , Elaine says , " Jack , tell him what the healthiest part of the doughnut is . "
" The hole ! " LaLanne says .
When the interviewer mentions that he watched LaLanne 's TV show in the ' 50s , because his mom tuned in daily , LaLanne gives the interviewer 's biceps another firm squeeze and confides , " I spent a lot of time on the floor with your mother . "
But seriously , folks .
Beneath the jokes and whimsy is a man as serious as a heart attack mixed with a stroke .
He 'll make you smile , but he 'll also grab you by the arm , and by the head and the heart , and lead you to a better life .
LaLanne has made a fortune , but he wo n't retire .
He carries on his crusade with the zeal of a man whose jumpsuit is on fire .
" If you believe something , live it ! " LaLanne barks .
He recently wrapped up a tour promoting his 11th book , " Live Young Forever : 12 Steps to Optimum Health , Fitness & Longevity . "
One reason to trust what the man preaches :
He has seen the dark side .
A reformed sugarholic
LaLanne at 15 was " a miserable goddamn kid .
It was like hell . "
He was a sugarholic , gorging on sweets then barfing to make room for more .
He was constantly sick , underweight , had zero energy , headaches so bad he would bang his head against a wall .
He had an explosive temper , severe depression and a head full of demons when he dropped out of Berkeley High .
Then a neighbor gave Jack and his mother tickets to a lecture by clean - eating advocate Paul Bragg .
Boom !
Jack LaLanne was born .
Says LaLanne , " Bragg said , ' My dear friends , it matters not what your physical condition is .
If you obey nature 's laws , you will be born again . '
I went home and prayed , ' Dear God , give me the willpower to refrain from those foods that are killing me . ' "
Soon LaLanne was healthy beyond his dreams .
He became a football star , a wrestling champ and a babe magnet .
At 22 , he opened a gym in downtown Oakland , and when business did n't boom - maybe because in 1936 nobody knew what the hell a gym was - he told himself , " Jack , people are not coming to you .
You gotta go to them ! "
He trained cops and firefighters , he recruited at high schools , and in 1951 , he began hosting a daily exercise show on KGO ( Channel 7 ) - where he met Elaine - that became a network smash , running until 1985 .
Using his personality and pep - with his muscles serving as his background singers - he bullied a nation into rethinking its nonapproach to nutrition and exercise .
He invented and pioneered the fitness industry .
" My whole life , " LaLanne says , " is , ' How can I help people like that man ( Bragg ) helped me ? ' "
Now Jack and Elaine sell their juicers on infomercials , the book is out , and he 's still preaching the gospel .
The seeming futility of shaping up the world does not daunt him .
" I never think about that , " LaLanne says .
" I think about things that I can improve . "
Still working out
One thing he can always improve is himself .
LaLanne works out two hours a day , mostly swimming and lifting weights , at the LaLanne mansion on the Central Coast .
" I work at living , " he says , leaning close and squeezing an arm .
" Most people work at dying .
Dying 's easy . "
One of LaLanne 's most effective sales devices has been his amazing feats of strength .
When Arnold Schwarzenegger came to America in 1968 and became an instant sensation on the Southern California muscle scene , LaLanne challenged the kid to a duel at Muscle Beach .
The Austrian Oak was 21 ; the Oakland Oak was 54 .
" I beat him in chin-ups and push - ups , " LaLanne says .
" He said , ' That Jack LaLanne 's an animal !
I was sore for four days .
I could n't lift my arms ! ' "
At age 70 , handcuffed , LaLanne towed 70 loaded boats 1.5 miles in Long Beach Harbor .
Now LaLanne 's most outrageous publicity stunt is kicking life 's butt on a daily basis .
" What feat are you going to do this year ? "
Elaine asks , lobbing another softball to her slugger hubby .
" I 'm going to tow Elaine across the bathtub ! "
Coming Friday
In Datebook : Legendary fitness guru Jack LaLanne gives a Chronicle reporter a real workout .
The removal of two men from a holiday flight on the grounds that fellow passengers feared they were terrorists was condemned yesterday .
The pair , thought to be in their 20s and of Middle Eastern or Asian appearance , were removed from a flight to Manchester from Malaga , Spain , after passengers became suspicious of their behaviour .
In the early hours of Wednesday a number of passengers on Monarch Airlines flight ZB613 left the plane , refusing to fly unless the two men were removed , causing a three - hour delay .
Passengers are reported to have become suspicious after the men were overheard apparently speaking Arabic and seen repeatedly checking their watches , although this has not been confirmed by the airline .
Muslim MP Khalid Mahmood described the incident as " hugely irrational " .
" People need to get their senses back into order .
You can't just accuse anybody who's of Asian appearance and treat them like a terrorist , " said the Labour MP for Birmingham .
" If somebody is threatening anybody it 's understandable , but when they are just travelling for their own needs it 's not .
People just need to calm down . "
These sentiments were echoed by Ghayasuddin Siddiqui , of the Muslim Parliament of Britain , who described the incident as " sad and shocking " .
" We have got to find a better way where somebody 's look is not the basis for this kind of action - it has to be more intelligence - led , " he said .
And , warning that the incident was an example of what the Metropolitan police chief superintendent Ali Dizaei called a new offence of " travelling while Asian " , he said : " The greatest danger is that the extremists have succeeded in convincing Muslims and Arabs that the war on terror is n't a war on terror but a war on Islam and Muslims . "
The Islamic Human Rights Commission said " ever- increasing Islamophobia " related to the " war on terror " was to blame for the removal of the men , who were questioned by police and forced to fly back to Manchester later in the week .
A Monarch Airlines spokesman said the men attracted attention because " they were apparently acting suspiciously " , although he would not say what they had done .
" The flight attendants were sufficiently concerned to alert the crew , who in turn informed the security authorities at Malaga airport , " he said .
It is the latest in a number of scares since an alleged plot to bomb transatlantic flights was foiled .
Last week a flight from London to Washington was diverted to Boston because a female passenger was carrying a screwdriver , matches and hand cream , which are banned .
On Thursday morning , US authorities evacuated an airport in West Virginia after explosive residue was found on two containers in a passenger 's hand luggage .
Initial reports that the liquid inside the bottles had tested positive were later withdrawn .
Meanwhile , the transport secretary , Douglas Alexander , has revealed that airport security restrictions are to be made more " manageable " within days .
He plans to meet representatives of airports operator BAA to resolve outstanding issues .
Holidaymakers could face further disruption over the bank holiday weekend if present measures remain in place .
Almost two million people are expected to travel at what is usually one of the busiest times of the year .
There was a slow return to normal services last week , after the government reduced the threat level from " critical " to " severe " .
Although restrictions on hand luggage were relaxed , airport staff are still required to search half of all passengers .
People travelling through Stansted airport over the bank holiday weekend may find their plans disrupted by a two - day strike rather than security checks .
About 500 baggage and check - in staff employed by airport services group Swissport have voted to take industrial action over a pay dispute .
There were talks with the reconciliation service Acas yesterday to try to avert action .
The GMB union predicts that Stansted flights are likely to be " severely disrupted " if the strike goes ahead .
