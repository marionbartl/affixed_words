Baby - faced Canadian teenager Justin Bieber has scored a nomination for a 2010 Black Entertainment Television ( BET ) award .
Bieber , 16 , will compete in the best new artist category .
The BET awards typically honour black singers , actors , actresses and athletes , but officials described the white Bieber as a cross -over artist .
" Bieber has crossed the colour boundaries the same way hip - hop has crossed the boundaries the other way for a number of years , " said Stephen Hill , BET 's president of music programming and specials .
Bieber was signed to a music label with the help of Usher , who has drawn a nomination for best male rhythm and blues artist .
" He 's had rhythm in his music , " said Hill of Bieber .
" He makes the type of music our audience likes . "
The awards ceremony will be held on Los Angeles on June 27 .
Rapper Jay - Z leads the field with five nominations .
His wife Beyonce scored four .

Espionage aficionados - regardless of if you prefer the spaceship or real - world variety - should immediately read Malcolm Gladwell 's article in this week 's New Yorker about the WWII British caper ' Operation Mincemeat ' .
Mincemeat was judged by its masterminds to be an astonishing success , but as Gladwell points out , it is impossible to prove if Mincemeat made any particular impact upon the German distribution of forces due to the regressive nature of the ' expression game ' .
The expression game will be instantly familiar to anyone involved in EVE espionage , and thankfully for us the expression game does n't have ugly real - world consequences attached to it when we screw it up .

style = " font - style : italic ; " > Spymasters try to get inside their enemy 's head .
Mincemeat ( greatly simplified ) was based around planting false invasion plans on the dead body of a bum dressed up like a British agent , dumped in the waters off the coast of Spain .
The idea was to have the Spanish leak the plans to the Germans to give them an air of authenticity , and induce Hitler to redeploy some of his divisions away from Italy and into Greece .
The Spanish did behave as the British had hoped , and the Germans did actually redeploy divisions to Greece .
But did Mincemeat actually pave the way for the successful Allied invasion of Italy , as the spymasters claimed ?
Here we run across the nasty causality problems at the heart of espionage itself .
Did the Germans assign the planted information any credibility ?
Did they move to defend Greece with additional divisions because of the alleged invasion , or because of its obvious lack of military defenses ?
When confronted with the invasion plans , did the Germans assume it was a legitimate document and move the divisions to Greece because of it , or did they assume it was an illegitimate plant designed to be obviously fake , to draw the divisions away from Greece , and thus implying that Greece was actually the target all along , and needed defense ?
This murky rabbit - hole is the expression game .
In EVE , we are confronted with the expression game every time an agent forwards a piece of information about an alliance - level plan or operation .
Gladwell points out that in the real world , critics can make the case that the expression game renders espionage itself almost pointless , if not a deadly waste of life ( an argument with some teeth , for those who 've read Legacy of Ashes or The Sword and the Shield )
Yet in the context of an online spaceship game where no one can really get hurt , the endless twists of the expression game - trying to parse the intentions of your foe , navigating blinds , double - blinds , and one 's own illusions thereof - is one of the most rare and satisfying types of gameplay available .
An example .
An agent reports that in a matter of days , your enemy alliance will be invading a neighbor - but the target could well be you .
You have several alliance mails , but they are all opaque - or , depending , they explicitly mention a target that is n't you .
Here we dive into the woods ; surprise attacks are a crucial part of an alliance leader 's arsenal , and it is all too often that the leadership announces a hit on target X only to hit Y .
As a spymaster , your job is to somehow determine whether the announcement of the invasion is real .
You try to get inside your enemy 's head , compiling what you can about the leader 's personality , the leadership structure of the alliance , the gossip of the line troops , everything .
If you successfully warn of an impending attack , you may have saved the day ; if you warn your troops and the attack did n't occur , is it because the enemy noticed your readiness , and attacked a different target instead ?
At each stage of the analysis the uncertainties multiply .

Reporting Agents were one of the most critical kinds of spies before Dominion .
This brings us to one of the more unfortunate aspects of the state of the spy game today : the near - removal expression games from the realm of reporting intelligence .
Before the release of Dominion , the reporting agent was perhaps the most critical type of spy in a nullsec alliance 's arsenal .
These sleepers functioned as information siphons , relaying operations announcements and hostile communications to their handlers .
This data was absolutely critical because of the nature and risks of the pre-Dominion sovereignty system .
Since sov was held by control towers , and control towers had to be stront - timed correctly or else territory could be lost , the reporting agent was essentially the only defense against a catastrophic first strike .
Without foreknowledge from an agent and coordination with a logistics team , an enemy fleet could steamroll an outpost system using a massive capital fleet and ensure that the towers there were either kited into a vulnerable hour , or hit into reinforced before they had a chance to be timed .
This system of territorial control was widely criticized ( and I added to this chorus vehemently ) due to the possibility of having a system of region lost to an attack outside of one 's normal timezone , while the members of an alliance were asleep or trapped at their day jobs unable to log in .
I doubt that anyone will truly mourn the passing of the pre-Dominion sov system , yet at the time of that patch it was n't obvious what kind of consequences it would have on other types of gameplay .
In the past six months , we have seen the reporting agent reduced in status to that of a useful accessory .
Because the new system is based around fixed timers which only have to be set once by the alliance leadership , many of the ' early warning ' functions of reporting agents are carried out by covert ops pilots .
Any invasion is predicated by a minimum of three hours of warning time by onlining SBU's , followed by multiple 24 and 48 hour timers on infrastructure hubs and outposts .
There 's no longer any need for spies to liaise with logisticians , save for the odd mining tower or CSAA .
Because of the removal of the risk of first strikes , there 's no longer any need to bother with the ' maze of mirrors ' which characterizes the expression game .
There are still some expression games to play in the realm of counterintelligence ; spyhunting remains a place of paranoia , conjecture , and attempting to outwit and uncover hostile spies .
But it 's a tragic loss to see reporting intelligence minimized so , when it was once the most preeminent and complicated field of espionage gameplay in EVE .
Should it somehow return , it would add much needed vibrancy to the visibly stagnating nullsec metagame .

A mysterious ad that accuses a candidate for governor in Alabama of supporting the theory of evolution and questioning the Bible has triggered a dizzying and nasty shouting match in the state 's hotly contested Republican primary race .
The ad -- part of a campaign against Republican candidate Bradley Byrne by a group called the True Republican PAC -- questions Byrne 's faith and accuses him of being a " liberal . "
Referencing Byrne 's time on the state school board , where he was first elected as a Democrat in the 1990s before switching parties , the ad's narrator says in a quizzical voice :
" On the school board , Byrne supported teaching evolution , said evolution best explains the origin of life -- even recently said the Bible is only partially true . "
Another voice closes the ad by saying Byrne is " trying to look conservative . "
That and other ads triggered an all - hands - on - deck response from the Byrne campaign , which launched a " truth team " website , issued a series of statements denying the group 's charges , accused a GOP opponent and Democratic operatives of being in cahoots against him , and launched an ad of its own .
The campaign also released a lengthy statement calling the faith ad " despicable . "
In the statement , Byrne said he believes " every single word " in the Bible is true and that , to the contrary , he fought to get creationism taught in Alabama 's schools .
Byrne campaign spokeswoman Marty Sullivan said the ad's creators took local newspaper quotes out of context in leveling the claims about the candidate 's faith .
She said Byrne 's longstanding position is that both creationism and evolution should be taught in schools .
" Bradley 's faith is very important to him and this has been very painful to him to have this kind of attack launched on him , " Sullivan told FoxNews.com .
" There 's nothing about it that 's even remotely true . "
The Byrne campaign has tried to turn the tables , saying that recently disclosed campaign finance transactions prove that a top Democratic official in Alabama -- state Democratic Party vice chairman and teachers union head Paul Hubbert -- is colluding with Republican candidate Tim James to fund the True Republican PAC .
According to a report in the Montgomery Advertiser , the teachers union PAC spread out $ 500,000 to various committees that in turn contributed to the True Republican PAC .
The Advertiser reported that $ 250,000 from those committees was sent to the new PAC the day it was formed , and that more money passed through two other political committees operated by a James fundraiser on its way to the new PAC .
Hubbert could not be reached for comment by FoxNews.com .
James ' campaign , though , has vigorously denied the charge .
After the Byrne campaign launched an ad accusing James of conspiring with Democrats to fund the " phony PAC , " James ' campaign launched its own ad accusing Byrne of spreading " despicable , outright lies about Tim James " because his poll numbers are dropping .
The campaign said the " fight " was only between Byrne and the Alabama Education Association , and that James had " nothing to do with it . "
James said in a statement to FoxNews.com that he would " stand tall " against the teachers union if elected .
James , who is the son of former Alabama Gov. Fob James , gained national attention last month when he ran a separate ad declaring that he would allow the state 's driver 's license test to be conducted only in English if he 's elected .
The race is tight .
Byrne had been leading the crowded GOP primary field , but the Press - Register reported last week that it obtained an internal James campaign poll showing James jumping ahead of both Byrne and former Judge Roy Moore in the primary race .
A poll released Thursday by Public Strategy Associates , a local firm , showed Byrne leading James by 1 point -- 24 percent to 23 percent , with Moore at 18 percent .
The poll of 1,005 Republican primary voters was conducted May 10 - 11 .
On the Democratic side , Rep. Artur Davis is facing off against state Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks .
But general election match - ups have shown the Republican candidates ahead in November .
Sullivan claimed that Democrats are trying to attack Byrne and take him out of the race because they oppose his policies the most .

Tell Me Sweet Little Lies
In less than two years , Obama rumor - mongers have had nearly twice the output that their Bush counterparts managed in eight years – 87 to 47 .
And while the Bush rumors split almost evenly true - false , false Obama rumors dwarfed the true ones .
The false rumors about Obama outnumbered the total number of rumors about Bush .
And while the lies about Obama are almost all negative , some of the false rumors about Bush are quite flattering , along the lines of the George Washington cheery tree rumor – like the rumor that had Bush paying for the funeral of a boy who had drowned near the Crawford ranch .
Looking closer at the mixed rumors , Bell reports that :
I delved down to the stories that the site designates as a mixture of truth and falsehood .
For Obama , in most cases the truth is innocuous while the lie reflects poorly on the President , particularly photographs that are misrepresented or show behavior that produced no complaints when his predecessors did the same .
In contrast , in this mixture of truth and falsehood about George W. Bush praying with an injured soldier , the lie reflected well on that President …
Looking at the last two Presidential candidate losers reveals the same pattern : more false rumors about Kerry than McCain .
Was the prophet Muhammad a pervert and a tyrant ?
Does Islam promote terrorism and enslave women ?
Does Islam oblige its followers to wage jihad on Westerners whose roots lie in the secular Enlightenment ?
Should Muslims consider converting to Christianity ?
For the Somali - born writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali , the answer to all these questions is a resounding “ Yes ! ” Hirsi Ali , who renounced Islam in her thirties , speaks from experience of bigotry and intolerance among her former co-religionists : she was genitally mutilated as a child in Somalia , briefly radicalized by a preacher of jihad in Kenya , nearly forced into a marriage , threatened with death in the Netherlands by the Muslim assassin of her collaborator , the filmmaker Theo van Gogh , and is still hounded by murderous fanatics in her new home , America .
In her latest book , “ Nomad : From Islam to America ” ( Free Press ; $ 27 ) , she reminds her readers of the West ’s tradition of intellectual revolt against clerical tyranny and warns of the insidious , intransigent enemies in their midst .
“ The Muslim mind today seems to be in the grip of jihad , ” she writes .
Ayaan Hirsi Ali says that Muslims must choose between Islam and the secular West ; Tariq Ramadan speaks of integration .
Illustration by Mark Ulriksen
She is not hopeful that Americans will heed her warning .
Her initial job interviews in the United States were discouraging : the Brookings Institution , she writes , worried that she might offend Arab Muslims .
( The conservative American Enterprise Institute , however , immediately appointed her as a fellow . )
On college campuses , Muslim students accuse her of wanting to “ trash ” Islam , while Western feminists , convinced that white men are “ the ultimate and only oppressors , ” lack the “ courage or clarity of vision ” to help her knock down the mental “ hovels ” of the East .
Pointing to Major Nidal Malik Hasan ’s murderous rampage in Texas , last November , she deplores the “ conspiracy to ignore the religious motivation for these killings ” in America .
Muslims today , Hirsi Ali believes , must be forced to choose between the darkness of Islam and the light of the modern secular West .
In her new book , which bears the additional subtitle “ A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations , ” she takes an uncompromising line with her own relatives , who remain faithful to their benighted religion .
The book opens with an account of her visit to her father ’s deathbed , in Whitechapel , in London ’s East End , in 2008 .
Her father , a highly respected political opponent of Somalia ’s Soviet - backed military dictator , became more religious during exile and old age .
Father and daughter had n’t spoken since 2004 , when Hirsi Ali and van Gogh made the film “ Submission , ” about the oppression of Muslim women , and she learned that he was fatally ill only a few weeks before his death .
She did n’t want to visit him at his home , since it was in “ a mostly immigrant area and overwhelmingly Muslim , ” and had to be escorted by policemen to his hospital .
In a brief but moving scene , she describes her father longing , but physically unable , to communicate with her .
The emotions of the moment dissipate soon after she leaves the hospital , when , driving down Whitechapel Road with her bodyguards , Hirsi Ali glimpses covered Muslim women on the pavement and long - bearded men outside a large mosque .
Overcome by “ an instant sense of panic and suffocation , ” she feels as though she were “ the only true nomad . ”
The Muslims in Whitechapel “ had brought their web of values with them , ” values of a culture that she has left behind .
She deplores her “ conflicted ” half sister Sahra , who is interested in studying psychology in London while remaining a devout Muslim , and who has an annoying habit of saying “ Inshallah ” after every phrase .
“ How long will Western societies . . . continue to tolerate the spread of Sahra ’s way of life ? ” Hirsi Ali asks .
Considering her vain and financially needy brother , she laments , “ This is the tragedy of the tribal Muslim man . ”
She writes a letter to a deceased grandmother in Africa , educating her about the enviable ways of the Western “ infidel ” : “ He may take care of his parents but has no use for a memory filled with an endless chain of ancestors .
All the seeds of his toil are spent on his own offspring , not those of his brothers or uncles . ”
“ The only difference between my relatives and me is that I opened my mind , ” Hirsi Ali writes .
The book ends with a letter to an imagined unborn daughter , which is also a tribute to her fellow anti-Islam agitator Oriana Fallaci , who memorably claimed that Muslims “ breed like rats ” in Europe .
Hirsi
Ali worries that her daughter will confront “ the bleakness of having no challenges in life , ” in “ an America of many posts : post - civil rights , postfeminism , post - cold war . ”
She wonders , “ What will you fight for ?
What will you fight against ? ”
Yet there are plenty of dangers that remain , and she warns her child about being brainwashed by “ Allah and his agents , ” and by the “ many isms ” that she will be exposed to in America : “ socialism and communism and all sorts of cults and collectivisms . ”
“ Nomad ” is unlikely to earn Hirsi Ali many Muslim admirers .
Neither will her recent support for the proposed French ban on face veils and the Swiss referendum outlawing minarets .
In denouncing Islam unreservedly , she has claimed a precedent in Voltaire — though the eighteenth - century scourge of the Catholic Church might have been perplexed by her proposal that Muslims embrace the “ Christianity of love and tolerance . ”
In another respect , however , the invocation of Voltaire is more apt than Hirsi Ali seems to realize .
Voltaire despised the faith and identity of Europe ’s religious minority : the Jews , who , he declared , “ are , all of them , born with raging fanaticism in their hearts , ” who had “ surpassed all nations in impertinent fables , in bad conduct and in barbarism , ” and who “ deserve to be punished . ”
Voltaire ’s denunciations remind us that the Enlightenment was a much more complex and multifaceted phenomenon than the dawn of reason and freedom that Hirsi Ali evokes .
Many followed Voltaire in viewing the Jews as backward , an Oriental abscess in the heart of Europe .
Hirsi Ali , recording her horror of ghettoized Muslim life in Whitechapel , seems unaware of the similarly contemptuous accounts of Jewish refugees who made the East End of London their home after fleeing the pogroms .
Whitechapel has much in its past — oppression , bigotry , poverty , radicalism — that would have helped Hirsi Ali understand not only the neighborhood ’s newest inhabitants but also her own family .
But “ Nomad ” reveals that her life experiences have yet to ripen into a sense of history .
The sad truth is that the problems she blames on Islam — fear of sexuality , oppression of women , militant millenarianism — are to be found wherever traditionalist peoples confront the transition to an individualistic urban culture of modernity .
Many more young women are killed in India for failing to bring sufficient dowry than perish in “ honor killings ” across the Muslim world .
Such social pathologies no more reveal the barbaric core of Hinduism or Islam than domestic violence in Europe and America defines the moral essence of Christianity or the Enlightenment .
Islamic fundamentalist groups have long terrorized many Muslim countries , especially those , such as Pakistan and Afghanistan , that were ravaged by blowback from the Cold War and the war on terror .
These extremists , who now assault the West as well , have always lacked popular support within their own countries .
The anarchic vivacity of contemporary Muslim societies — featuring such figures as Ali Saleem , Pakistan ’s cross-dressing television host , and Cairo ’s hijab - wearing sex therapist Heba Kotb , whose talk show is beamed across the Arab world — does not quite match Hirsi Ali ’s description of an incurably medieval people busy devising ever - harsher laws for themselves while plotting mayhem for the infidels .
In recent years , Islamist movements , led or assisted by women activists , have helped democratize Indonesia and Turkey ; innumerable Muslims , such as Asma Jahangir , in Pakistan , and Shirin Ebadi , in Iran , fight to defend the rights of women against both Islamic fundamentalists and secular autocrats .
Nor do Hirsi Ali ’s simple oppositions — traditional societies versus democracy , Islam versus Western secularism — sum up the experiences of Muslims in Europe , who are the Continent ’s most globalized minority , with multilayered identities that are usually influenced less by the Koran or Sharia than by the politics , culture , and economy of various nations and transnational networks .
Her praise for the United States , her new home , shows a growing familiarity with right - wing touchstones ( self - reliance , distrust of government , family values , gun ownership , Christianity ) .
But when she writes that a Muslim can be “ an American patriot ” only if he does n’t “ care very much about being a Muslim , ” she seems suspicious of the country ’s un-European traditions of cultural and religious pluralism .
Eager to reëducate her “ fellow nomads ” in “ the ways of the infidel , ” Hirsi Ali is convinced that “ lingering between the two value systems , ” as her half sister does , “ stunts the process of becoming one ’s own person . ”
But those privileged enough to find refuge in the West rarely find it easy or desirable to abandon their ancestral culture and convert to the Randian individualism that she appears to uphold as the noblest form of human existence .
The fate of the truly modern nomad is , rather , a ceaseless inner conflict between ways of life and value systems ; this very quality has made the nomad an emblematic figure of the contemporary age .
If Hirsi Ali ’s rhetoric has earned her critics among Western liberals , she has a fierce defender in Paul Berman , whose new polemic , “ The Flight of the Intellectuals ” ( Melville House ; $ 26 ) , hails her as a “ classic example of a persecuted dissident intellectual . ”
He upbraids such writers as the Anglo - Dutch journalist Ian Buruma and the British academic Timothy Garton Ash , who , he says , “ sneered at Ayaan Hirsi Ali for having taken up the ideas of Western liberalism . ”
Berman also condemns Buruma and Garton Ash for “ grovelling ” to Tariq Ramadan , a Swiss - born Muslim professor at Oxford University , whose work seeks to integrate observant Muslims into secular Western societies , and whom Berman sees as an apologist for extremism .
For Berman , the spectacle of writers attacking Hirsi Ali while embracing Ramadan points to a dangerous “ reactionary turn in the intellectual world ” of Europe and America .
Berman , who started his intellectual career in the early nineteen - seventies , as an anthologist of anarchist quotations , has emerged as a prominent critic of liberal - left pieties .
In “ A Tale of Two Utopias ” ( 1996 ) , he reprimanded the American student radicals of the sixties for failing to recognize the evil of Communism .
In “ Terror and Liberalism ” ( 2003 ) , he scolded liberals too timid to join what he saw as America ’s crusade for liberal democracy in Iraq .
His recent writings call for unambiguous ideological commitment in what he describes as a worldwide clash between liberalism and totalitarianism ( or “ fascism , ” which Berman prefers , since to hear the “ pungent ” word “ is to flare your nostrils ” ) .
There is no doubt that 9/11 announced a new enemy of liberal civilization — an enemy far more obscure than , say , Prussian militarism , Nazism , or Communist totalitarianism , all of which were embodied by territorial states and standing armies .
What was one to make of men who hid in caves and spoke in apocalyptic tones , mixing modern anti-imperialist rhetoric with invocations of a glorious Islamic past ?
Were they rootless and marginalized revolutionaries trying to realize an Islamic myth of community , or did they express a deeper pathology of backward tradition - bound societies ?
Had the Muslim world produced a modern totalitarian ideology called “ Islamism ” ?
“ Terror and Liberalism ” offered answers that could seem consolingly simple .
“ Do n’t look now , but those onion bagels are following us again . ”

During the Vietnam War , Hannah Arendt noted that members of the Democratic Administration had frequent recourse to phrases like “ monolithic communism , ” and “ second Munich , ” and deduced from this an inability “ to confront reality on its own terms because they had always some parallels in mind that ‘ helped ’ them to understand those terms . ”
Similarly , Berman , who was n’t known previously for his expertise on modern political movements east of Europe , identified Islamism as a derivative version of the totalitarian enemies — Fascism and Communism — that liberalism had already fought throughout the twentieth century .
After “ trolling the Islamic bookstores of Brooklyn , ” he offered a genealogy of “ Islamism ” that rested almost entirely on his reading of Sayyid Qutb , an ideologue of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood .
According to Berman , liberal intellectuals were obliged to do battle with the new nihilistic Fascism , which included secular dictatorships like Iraq ’s as well as pan-Islamist movements .
“ I ’m happy to be a laptop general , ” he wrote , and his work quickly united a variety of public figures , from Richard Holbrooke to Martin Amis , in the cause .
The book had its liberal critics .
Writing in The New York Review of Books , Ian Buruma rejected Berman ’s “ radical vision of an American state , filled with revolutionary élan and military steel , battling heroically and alone with outside enemies , ” and wrote , “ There is something in the tone of Berman ’s polemic that reminds me of the quiet American in Graham Greene ’s novel , the man of principle who causes mayhem , without quite realizing why . ”
In 2007 , when Buruma published a profile of Tariq Ramadan in the Times Magazine , Berman responded with a twenty - eight - thousand - word article in The New Republic that presented his own appalled discovery of the academic ’s ideas and inspirations .
He focussed on Ramadan ’s “ family relations that shape everything he writes and does , ” particularly Ramadan ’s grandfather Hasan al - Banna , the Egyptian founder of the Muslim Brotherhood .
In “ The Flight of the Intellectuals , ” Berman expands his original indictment , arguing that Ramadan makes the right noises but is actually quite vague about women ’s rights , and his reinterpretations of Islamic texts do not sound very liberal or moderate .
In Berman ’s account , the modern Islamic thinkers whom Ramadan is related to or admires turn out to be promoters of jihadi violence against Israel and the West .
Ramadan ’s grandfather , for instance , was an early supporter of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Haj Muhammad Amin al - Husseini , who tried to create an Arab - Nazi alliance .
Berman concedes that Ramadan himself does n’t advocate terrorism or anti-Semitism , but says he is soft on those who do , which makes it more inexplicable that liberal intellectuals should depict Ayaan Hirsi Ali , the “ admirer of the West , ” as a loose cannon while hailing Ramadan as “ a long - awaited Islamic hero — the religious thinker who was going , at last , to adapt Islam to the modern world . ”
According to Berman , intellectuals like Buruma and Garton Ash have helped Ramadan “ become a representative man of our age . ”
Ramadan , a prolific author who has preached a “ European ” Islam in the heart of secular France , has certainly attracted the attention of journalists and academics , along with those uncompromising secularists who use him as a foil .
But Berman , assessing Ramadan from within this echo chamber , is prone to overestimate his resonance in the wider world .
“ In the eyes of a vast number of European Muslims a more glorious ancestry than Tariq Ramadan ’s does not exist , ” he writes .
It is more likely that the majority of European Muslims worry more about unemployment , discrimination , and inequality than about setting up an Islamic caliphate , and have never heard of Hasan al - Banna .
Ramadan himself is virtually unknown among many of Europe ’s Muslim communities , not least the South Asian Muslims in Britain , who , in the age of the Internet and satellite television , have their own transnational reformist thinkers , Urdu-speaking pop preachers , and charismatic evangelists .
Ramadan ’s over - all reputation in Europe and the Middle East ca n’t begin to compare with that of a reformist “ satellite sheikh ” like Egypt ’s Amr Khaled , or , for that matter , a figure like Yusuf al - Qaradawi , a Qatar - based theologian who justifies suicide attacks on Israel and whose program on Al Jazeera reaches tens of millions of people .
It seems irrational to fear , as Berman does , that a lukewarm profile in the Times Magazine , a favorable mention or two in The New York Review of Books , and a teaching job at Oxford would help Ramadan “ break into . . . the American conversation , ” not to mention force a “ reactionary turn ” in the country ’s intellectual life .
Sooner or later , just about every writer of non-Western background finds himself taken to be a representative of , or spokesperson for , his community , nation , race , or religion .
Ramadan , who has solemnly , even pompously , embraced this role , seems no more than one of the many academics struggling to fulfill the West ’s post - 9/11 demand for “ moderate ” Islam .
Berman clearly wants him to prove his credentials by unconditionally repudiating various Islamist grandees .
Ramadan is evidently fearful of losing credibility in the very community of conservative Muslims that he wishes to reconcile with the West .
But Berman reads volumes into Ramadan ’s silences and pursues him with inquisitorial zeal .
He suggests that Ramadan supports the Taliban , even while admitting that Ramadan never mentions the Taliban .
He says that Ramadan not just “ admires ” but “ worships ” Qaradawi , although the citations of Ramadan that he produces to illustrate this claim reveal nothing more fervent than the standard lexicon of scholarly attribution : “ Yusuf al - Qaradawi aptly notes that . . . ” ; “ For details , see Yusuf al - Qaradawi . . . . ” Berman ’s fulminations against Ramadan —
“ He is imprisoned in a cage .
. . .
He can not think for himself .
He does not believe in thinking for himself ” — cause his usually sprightly prose , finally , to crack .
What is he trying to accomplish ?
It ’s possible that , by building Ramadan up as a treacherous enemy of liberal civilization , Berman hopes to vindicate his own earlier role as a laptop general .
After nearly a decade , the Bush Administration ’s global war on terror , which Berman saw as a crusade for liberal democracy , seems a fiasco .
In addition to destroying innumerable lives , it has helped an initially small band of fanatics multiply and mutate ( Al Qaeda in Iraq , the Pakistani Taliban ) in new locations ( Waziristan , Connecticut ) .
Of course , the proliferation of extremists could be taken as further evidence of a worldwide Fascist conspiracy , and this , it seems , may be Berman ’s larger project .
In rummaging through the “ hidden corners ” of Ramadan ’s thought , he seems less interested in describing a “ new twist . . . in the history of the Western intellectuals ” ( a melodramatic and unconvincing move ) than in finding as many examples of Muslim extremism as possible — the “ murk , ” as he described it in “ Terror and Liberalism , ” of people “ drunk on the idea of slaughter . ”
This sets him off on a long exploration of the virulent hatred of Jews manifested by Ramadan ’s grandfather and his Islamist allies .
Certainly , this malignity does still fester in the proclamations of Hamas and Hezbollah ; and Berman deftly summarizes a revisionist history that emphasizes “ centuries of Muslim cruelty toward the Jews , ” challenging the conventional view that European - style anti-Semitism was unknown under the Ottoman Empire .
But he misses an opportunity to enrich his genealogy of hate by setting it within the modern history of the Middle East and Asia .
For instance , he makes a passing reference to Rashid Rida , a prominent Islamist thinker at the turn of the twentieth century and al - Banna ’s revered teacher , expressing curiosity about his praise for early Zionist settlers , but does n’t explore the matter further .
Although , ultimately , Rida turned against Zionism as Jewish immigration to Palestine surged in the wake of the Balfour Declaration , he had been an outspoken critic of European anti-Semitism during the Dreyfus trial and made early attempts , including an exchange with Chaim Weizmann , regarding an agreement between “ the Arabs and their Hebrew cousins . ”
Berman rightly points out that the mufti of Jerusalem showed an obscene eagerness to help extend the Final Solution to the Middle East , and hatred of British colonialists and Zionist settlers certainly provoked Naziphilia among many Arabs of the nineteen - thirties and forties .
But it is worth noting that , by 1941 , when the mufti sidled up to Hitler and , soon afterward , began to air his anti-Semitic rants on the radio , reactionary pan-Islamists like him had to contend with overlapping groups of liberal Westernizers , Marxists , and secular Arab nationalists ; far from being representative of the larger Arab world , the mufti was a fast - diminishing figure even in his own small sphere of influence — forced out of Palestine by the British in 1937 and blamed for a series of political debacles there .
Berman himself relates that Arabs comprehensively failed to respond to the mufti’s exhortations to kill the Jews .
What you would n’t guess from Berman ’s account is how common it was for anti-colonialist leaders to stumble into such unlikely alliances .
In the nineteen - twenties , Mahatma Gandhi , a devout Hindu and pacifist , vigorously campaigned for the restoration of the caliphate .
And in 1941 an old colleague of his , Subhas Chandra Bose , travelled to Berlin and enlisted Indian P.O.W.s who later fought in the Waffen S.S.
The expedient notion that my enemy ’s enemy is my friend even motivated the Jewish militant leader Avraham Stern to try , in 1940 , to enlist Nazi support against the British rulers of Palestine .
It ’s easy to look at the protesters and the politicians in Greece — and at the other European countries with huge debts — and wonder why they do n’t get it .
They have been enjoying more generous government benefits than they can afford .
No mass rally and no bailout fund will change that .
Only benefit cuts or tax increases can .
Yet in the back of your mind comes a nagging question : how different , really , is the United States ?
The numbers on our federal debt are becoming frighteningly familiar .
The debt is projected to equal 140 percent of gross domestic product within two decades .
Add in the budget troubles of state governments , and the true shortfall grows even larger .
Greece ’s debt , by comparison , equals about 115 percent of its G.D.P. today .
The United States will probably not face the same kind of crisis as Greece , for all sorts of reasons .
But the basic problem is the same .
Both countries have a bigger government than they ’re paying for .
And politicians , spendthrift as some may be , are not the main source of the problem .
We , the people , are .
We have not figured out the kind of government we want .
We ’re in favor of Medicare , Social Security , good schools , wide highways , a strong military — and low taxes .
Dealing with this disconnect will be the central economic issue of the next decade , in Europe , Japan and this country .
Scientific Article on Bats ' Oral Pleasures Triggers Sexual Harassment Scandal
An Irish scientist who showed an article to his female coworker is charged with sexual harassment .
Scientific Article on Bats ' Oral Pleasures Triggers Sexual Harassment Scandal
Dr. Dylan Evans , a psychologist and behaviorist who teaches in the University College Cork , came to the office of Dr Rossana Salerno Kennedy who is lecturing in the same college .
They had a discussion where Dylan tried to prove that humans are not unique in their behavior .
To prove his point , he showed her a scientific article about peculiarities of oral sex among bats , published in a specialized journal PLoS One .
“ She asked me for a copy .
She was not embarrassed in the least .
And I had no intentions to embarrass her .
I had no idea it could turn like this , ” the scientist explains .
Two weeks later Dr. Evans received an official notification from the administration that Dr. Kennedy accused him of sexual harassment in the form of demonstrating to her a dirty article and complimenting her on her looks .
“ I was shocked , insulted and humiliated .
I was very ashamed .
I asked for a copy of the article to finish our discussion , ” the woman explained the reasons for her complaint .
A special committee satisfied her claim , acknowledging that the article might have been offensive .
Now Dr. Evans will be on probation for two years and will be fired if something similar happens .
Now many scientists are outraged with the dubious decision .
They support their colleague and demand that the sentence is vacated .
The Irish Federation of University Teachers has filed a petition where it called the scandal ridiculous and violating the intellectual freedom and freedom of speech .
Scientists willingly sign the petition .
Dr. Evans is supported by 2,500 colleagues all over the world .
Many media outlets wrote about the article that embarrassed Dr. Kennedy , including the Komsomolskaya Pravda .
According to New Scientist magazine , the research that preceded the article called " Fellatio in fruit bats prolongs copulation time " became the most popular one in 2009 , and generated the greatest readers ’ interest .
Why was the Irish doctor horrified ?
Why was she not able to calmly discuss unusual animal behavioral model ?
It would have been different if the article was demonstrated to a physicist by a mathematician , in this case there could probably be a dirty insinuation .
The research on bats was conducted by Chinese scientist Min Tan and his colleagues from Guangdong Entomological Institute in Guangzhou , China .
The research materials include video presenting no more than graphs .
It is surprising that Dr. Kennedy chose to file a claim against the famous scientist .

The Chicago Bulls have reached out to Phil Jackson through back channels to gauge his interest in returning to the franchise he won six NBA titles with , two sources with knowledge of the situation told ESPN The Magazine 's Chris Broussard .
There has been no direct contact between Bulls officials and Jackson , Broussard reports , but sources close to both parties have spoken and come away with the belief that Jackson would be open to a potential reunion in Chicago next season .
Bulls general manager Gar Forman refused to comment on the club 's coaching search when reached Monday night by telephone .
And Chicago is not the only team that has registered interest in a coaching reunion with Jackson in conjunction with a planned free - agent pursuit of LeBron James .
NBA coaching sources told ESPN.com 's Marc Stein on Tuesday that the New Jersey Nets have made similar back - channel inquiries about their chances of luring Jackson away from the Los Angeles Lakers .
After 11 seasons and two championships as a player with the New York Knicks , Jackson 's first coaching experience came with the Nets during the final two seasons of his active career in 1978 - 79 and 1979 - 80 , when he served as a player - assistant under Kevin Loughery .
Nets president Rod Thorn denied any form of contact with Jackson in an interview Tuesday afternoon with AOL Fanhouse , while Lakers spokesman John Black told the Los Angeles Times that the team is not aware of Jackson being contacted for any coaching vacancy .
" Not to my understanding , " Black told the newspaper .
" Obviously , if they were to contact him , it would be tampering . "
Said Thorn to Fanhouse : " It 's not true .
We 've never approached him .
We have n't made any backdoor dealings or whatever it was called . ''
Asked if the Nets would pursue Jackson should he leave Los Angeles at season 's end to become a coaching free agent , Thorn said : " I anticipate he 's going to stay with the Lakers .
He 's got a great situation there . "
Earlier Tuesday , ESPN.com reported that the Nets privately acknowledge the long - shot nature of tempting Jackson away from L.A. , given the 64 - year - old 's recent insistence that he 's " 90 percent " certain he 'll coach the Lakers if he coaches anywhere next season .
Yet sources with knowledge of New Jersey 's thinking have maintained for weeks that new owner Mikhail Prokhorov is determined to make the splashiest hire he can to enhance the Nets as part of the quest to sign marquee free agents such as James .
It took almost the entire press conference at the White House on Thursday for President Obama to find his voice in responding to the oil disaster in the gulf  and it is probably no accident that it seemed like the only unrehearsed moment .
The president was trying to convey why he takes this problem so seriously , when he noted :
“ When I woke this morning and I ’m shaving and Malia knocks on my bathroom door and she peeks in her head and she says , ‘ Did you plug the hole yet , Daddy ? ’
Because I think everybody understands that when we are fouling the Earth like this , it has concrete implications  not just for this generation , but for future generations .
I grew up in Hawaii where the ocean is sacred .
And when you see birds flying around with oil all over their feathers and turtles dying , that does n’t just speak to the immediate economic consequences of this ; this speaks to how are we caring for this incredible bounty that we have .
And so sometimes when I hear folks down in Louisiana expressing frustrations , I may not always think that their comments are fair .
On the other hand , I probably think to myself , ‘ These are folks who grew up fishing in these wetlands and seeing this as an integral part of who they are . ’
And to see that messed up in this fashion would be infuriating . ”
And a child shall lead them .
...
This oil leak is not President Obama ’s fault .
Stopping the spill is BP ’s responsibility ; it both caused it and it has the best access to the best technology to plug it .
Of course , as the nation ’s C.E.O. , Mr. Obama has to oversee the cleanup , and he has been on top of that .
His most important job , though , is one he has yet to take on : shaping the long - term public reaction to the spill so that we can use it to generate the political will to break our addiction to oil .
In that job , the most important thing Mr. Obama can do is react to this spill as a child would  because it is precisely that simple gut reaction , repeated over and over , speech after speech , that could change our national conversation on energy .
You see , right now our energy conversation is dominated by three voices .
There are the “ petro - determinists , ” who never tire of telling us that we ’ll be dependent on oil for a “ long , long time . ”
That is true .
The problem is , these same people have been telling us that ever since the first oil crisis in 1973 , and their real objective in doing so is not to help us understand that breaking our oil addiction is difficult , but to make us think that it is impossible  so do n’t bother .

Then there are the “ eco-pessimists , ” who argue that it is probably already too late .
We are toast .
Unless we rewire human beings to want less growth  not only ourselves but the millions in China and India who aspire to live like us  the end is nigh .
The eco-pessimists may be right , and they are certainly sincere , but they have little respect for the power of innovation , the power of six billion minds all trying to solve one problem .
Since I have seven loads of laundry in the wash and all my dresser drawers on the porch air - drying because my roommate thought it would be hilarious to saturate my dresser with his urine , I 'm not really in an April Fools '

It 's business as usual at the Department of Interior 's Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) .
Nothing has changed at the MMS since the spill began .
President Obama 's moratorium on drilling has not affected the MMS in any way .
" Is there a moratorium on off shore drilling or not ? " asked Peter Galvin , conservation director with the Center for Biological Diversity , the environmental group that discovered the administration ’s continued approval of the exemptions .
" Possibly the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history has occurred and nothing appears to have changed . "
MMS officials said the exemptions are continuing to be issued because they do not represent final drilling approval .
The MMS has changed no policies despite the exceptional difficulty of responding to a blow out in water over 1000 feet deep .
At the MMS it 's like the BP spill never happened .
Heads must roll at the MMS .
They still act like they are working for Dick Cheney .
East and southeast winds are blowing the oil into the most environmentally sensitive areas in the Gulf west of the Mississippi river .
Watermen are out of work .
Some of the Gulf 's most sensitive and productive environments are in trouble .
NOAA 's latest forecast trajectory map indicates light oil stretching just off Louisiana 's coastline to Atchafalaya Bay by Tuesday , with heavier concentrations just west the river 's mouth .
The forecast shows the potential for oil along Southwest Pass on the lower Mississippi River and on the beaches of Port Fourchon and the Timbalier Islands , though it still shows no oil on Grand Isle .
......
Oil has been found in Little Pass , which is between East Timbalier and Timbalier islands , just west of Port Fourchon in Terrebonne Parish , said Garret Graves , coastal adviser to Gov. Bobby Jindal .
" If you look at that area , from Cocodrie east , you see an intricate area of fragmented coastal marshes , " Graves said .
" That 's probably the worst area of the state where this stuff could get , in terms of our ability to protect the wetlands or get oil out . "
But the MMS has n't learned a thing from the disaster .
It ’s official !

ATLANTA - A new study shows that saving rainforests and protecting land in national parks and reserves reduced poverty in two developing countries , according to research by a Georgia State University professor .
Paul J. Ferraro , associate professor of economics in GSU 's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies , with four co-authors , looked at the long term impacts of the poor living near parks and reserves established in 1985 or earlier in Costa Rica and Thailand .
The logic goes against the conventional wisdom that says taking away resources , such as farm land and forests , exacerbates poverty .
" The results are surprising , " Ferraro said .
" Most people might expect that if you restrict resources , people on average will be worse off . "
The research , entitled " Protected areas reduced poverty in Costa Rica and Thailand , " was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America journal .
The authors speculate that the conservation of biodiverse areas may have helped the poor because of tourism and infrastructure , such as new roadways , which may have provided new economic opportunities .
While Costa Rica and Thailand are not representative of all developing nations , Ferraro said the results are promising .
He said the study can be replicated elsewhere in the world to look at the impacts of efforts to protect the environment and reduce poverty , two of the United Nations Millennium Development goals .
###
Ferraro's co-authors are Kwaw Andam of the International Food Policy Research Institute , Katharine R.E. Sims of Amherst College , Margaret B. Holland of the University of Wisconsin , and Andrew Healy of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles .

There 's no guarantee that the flash unit is still good or that the battery still has a charge ( chances are good though ) .
There should be a button on the front to activate the flash charging circuit .
Go ahead and press that .
You should hear the whine of the capacitor charging and after a bit you should see the indicator LED light up on the back .
You should NOT have to hold the front button down .
If the capacitor wo n't charge without the button being held down , toss the camera and find another .
With the back off , you should see a small sprocket just under the view hole and above the rectangular cavity .
The film advance wheel should spin easily since there is no film inside .
When there is film in the camera and you advance the film with the wheel , the teeth on the edge of the film spin the small sprocket .
This action resets the release button .
Since there ’s no film in the camera now , go ahead and spin the small sprocket towards the right .
You should feel the tension build and then the sprocket should lock once the release button is set .
Now press the release button .
You should see a flash .
If you did n’t hear the whine , it ’s most likely a bad battery .
Replace the battery with a fresh one and repeat .
If the flash does n’t fire , toss the camera and get another one .
The village of Ganvie , in Benin , is the only human settlement in the world , built on stilts , in the middle of a lake , several kilometers from the nearest shore .
But people do n’t just go ahead and build themselves a home , in the middle of a lake , they must have a serious reason .
And the reason for the existence of Ganvie can be traced back to the 18th century , when a peaceful African tribe , the Tofinu , tired of running from the slaver tribe of Dom Homey , decided to build themselves a home , on Lake Nokoue .
The Dom Homey believed a terrible demon lived in the lake , and their ruthless warriors dared not set foot in its waters .
The Tofinu had finally found their peace .
But fast forward to present day , and the people of Ganvie are still reluctant to go on solid ground , although the threat of slavery is only a distant memory .
They ’ve ground accustomed to living on the water , and would n’t abandon their unique lifestyle , for anything .

Ganvie currently has a population of 30,000 , all living in bamboo houses , built on stilts .
Moving around the village is only possible in pirogues ( boats carved from tree trunks ) , and even if someone wants to visit their next door neighbor , they have to row there .
The Venice of Africa , as Ganvie is commonly referred to , has one and a half pieces of dry land .
the complete patch of land is the site of the village school , while the half will be the cemetery , when the villagers import enough dry ground , from the shores .
Photo Credits
This unique African village is completely sustainable , and the only time villagers go ashore , is when they want to sell their fish .
Unfortunately , the pollution of Lake Nokoue , and the scams of so called tourist guides , plunged Ganvie back in to the obscurity it had managed to crawl out of , a few years back .
Tourists stopped traveling here , and the beauty of this place remains a secret to many of us .

According to Pippenger [ 1996 ] , when comparing a Lisp system that is purely functional ( and has strict evaluation semantics , not lazy ) to one that can mutate data , an algorithm written for the impure Lisp that runs in O ( n ) can be translated to an algorithm in the pure Lisp that runs in O( n log n ) time ( based on work by Ben - Amram and Galil [ 1992 ] about simulating random access memory using only pointers ) .
Pippenger also establishes that there are algorithms for which that is the best you can do ; there are problems which are O ( n ) in the impure system which are Ω ( n log n ) in the pure system .
There are a few caveats to be made about this paper .
The most significant is that it does not address lazy functional languages , such as Haskell .
Bird , Jones and De Moor [ 1997 ] demonstrate that the problem constructed by Pippenger can be solved in a lazy functional language in O ( n ) time , but they do not establish ( and as far as I know , no one has ) whether or not a lazy functional language can solve all problems in the same asymptotic running time as a language with mutation .
The problem constructed by Pippenger requires Ω ( n log n ) is specifically constructed to achieve this result , and is not necessarily representative of practical , real - world problems .
There are a few restrictions on the problem that are a bit unexpected , but necessary for the proof to work ; in particular , the problem requires that results are computed on - line , without being able to access future input , and that the input consists of a sequence of atoms from an unbounded set of possible atoms , rather than a fixed size set .
And the paper only establishes ( lower bound ) results for an impure algorithm of linear running time ; for problems that require a greater running time , it is possible that the extra O ( log n ) factor seen in the linear problem may be able to be " absorbed " in the process of extra operations necessary for algorithms with greater running times .
These clarifications and open questions are explored briefly by Ben- Amram [ 1996 ] .
In practice , many algorithms can be implemented in a pure functional language at the same efficiency as in a language with mutable data structures .
For a good reference on techniques to use for implementing purely functional data structures efficiently , see Chris Okasaki's " Purely Functional Data Structures " [ Okasaki 1998 ] ( which is an expanded version of his thesis [ Okasaki 1996 ] ) .
Anyone who needs to implement algorithms on purely - functional data structures should read Okasaki .
You can always get at worst an O ( log n ) slowdown per operation by simulating mutable memory with a balanced binary tree , but in many cases you can do considerably better than that , and Okasaki describes many useful techniques , from amortized techniques to real - time ones that do the amortized work incrementally .
Purely functional data structures can be a bit difficult to work with and analyze , but they provide many benefits like referential transparency that are helpful in compiler optimization , in parallel and distributed computing , and in implementation of features like versioning , undo , and rollback .
Note also that all of this discusses only asymptotic running times .
Many techniques for implementing purely functional data structures give you a certain amount of constant factor slowdown , due to extra bookkeeping necessary for them to work , and implementation details of the language in question .
The benefits of purely functional data structures may outweigh these constant factor slowdowns , so you will generally need to make trade - offs based on the problem in question .

It ’s easy to get obsessed with gear .
It ’s easy to think that the real key to making great recordings is using a $ 5000 microphone plugged into a $ 4000 preamp .
And sure , it probably does make it a bit easier .
But I really think that the equation on what it takes to make a great recording is something like 90 % technique and 10 % gear ( not accounting for the quality of the music itself which is of course far more important than either in the grand scheme of things . )
I believe that as long as you have gear that can “ get the job done ” you need to stop making excuses and stop dreaming about pro gear and start learning how to use what you got !
I ’m sure there are plenty of GearSlutz out there who would point and laugh at my setup because I use a $ 300 preamp and a $ 800 microphone ( on the other hand , I ’m sure there ’s people reading this who would love to have an $ 800 microphone ! )
But I really do not blame my gear at all when my mixes do n’t sound the way I want them to .
I know that the real problem in such a case is not the gear , but me .
It was me not knowing how to set the compressor or position the mic .
Knowing how to use the compressor is more important than the quality of the compressor and knowing how to position the mic is more important than the quality of the mic !
This is why I think it ’s a huge mistake to spend all of your time shopping for your next upgrade in gear instead of learning how to work with what you ’ve got .
One of the worst ( and most common ) examples of this is when people spend many hours testing out lots of different plugins instead of working with the ones they ’ve got .
I ’ve been to sites where you can download hundreds of different free plugins to try out .
This is an evil site that I plan on never visiting again .
We ’re taught that more choice is always better but at some point it becomes paralyzing .
My advice is : Stop looking for perfection in your gear and stop looking for the latest plugin and start working on improving your recording and mixing technique .
And that ’s not to say that there ’s anything wrong with upgrading your gear or looking for a piece of gear that you really need .
All I ’m saying is that you need to get yourself to the point where you are focusing on recording and mixing ( and not on acquiring gear ) as quickly as possible .
It ’s easy to drag out the “ looking for gear ” phase way too long .
Conan O'Brien is n't making a single cent off his upcoming 30 city comedy tour -- sources tell TMZ that Coco is doing the whole thing so he can employ his former " Tonight Show " staff .

The move is no sweat off Conan 's back -- dude scored a $ 32.5 million severance deal from NBC before they kicked him to the curb .

9000 computers in Swiss schools have been dual - booting Windows and and Ubuntu for some time now in anticipation of guidelines from the Switzerland 's Department of Public Instruction , whose motto is " Long Live Free Software . "
The Tribune de Geneve featured a story on Friday about the elimination of dual boot capabilities in all of these machines and a migration exclusively to Linux ( the original story is available here in French or here in English courtesy of Google 's language tools ) .
Beginning this September , all 9000 computers will run only Ubuntu and free and open source software .
While officials are happy to be saving money on licensing , the Department of Public instruction largely made the move out of what they considered best practices for student education ( please note that the translation below is directly from Google Translation ; non-French speakers should get the idea , though ) .
Why go to FOSS ?
Free , effective teaching , " they have only advantages , " says Manuel Grandjean , director of the Media Service Schools of DPI and as such contractor for the migration department to the Open source .
On the one hand , they offer enough to satisfy the saving plan of the State Council , which advocates measuring 28 " to promote open - source software " in the administration .
But there was no question of a solution on the cheap .
" We chose open - source software for their qualities , " says Manuel Grandjean .
There are , analysis there , " a real convergence " between the foundations of education practiced in DIP and free software .
Through their community development , " they encourage the sharing and democratization of knowledge , as well as autonomy with the acquisition of skills . "
This move also levels the playing field for students who may not be able to afford computers with the latest Microsoft software :

About the Specialty Crops Program
The North Carolina Specialty Crops Program ( SCP ) was a statewide , multi-agency program dedicated to new crop development .
The main headquarters was located at the R.P. Cunningham Research Station , just north of Kinston , North Carolina .
The satellite headquarters was located at the Mountain Horticultural Crops Research and Extension Center near Asheville , North Carolina .
The SCP had the ability to study various crops on any one of the many research stations located throughout the state .

Current Projects
NC Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services has worked with DEA and other agencies to develop a method for growers to acquire industrial hemp seed so that growers can participate in the industrial hemp pilot program .
Spurred on by the demands of a burgeoning craft brewing industry and a strong public interest in locally grown ingredients , farmers are experimenting with hops ( Humulus lupulus ) as an alternative income source .
Over the past seven years , an increasing community of growers across North Carolina have established hop yards and sold their product to local craft breweries and home brewers .
This is a fairly new industry where North Carolina farmers are showing interest in establishing a bamboo plantation with plans to sell young bamboo shoots within a year or two and bamboo timber in five years or so .
This project is a three - year study to help truffle growers monitor their orchards .

Completed Projects
Determine if the new heirloom - type hybrids have consumer acceptance as having the flavor of heirloom tomatoes and can be successfully grown in organic and conventional production systems .
Dr. Jeanine Davis received a four - year grant from the USDA National Research Initiative on small farms and rural communities to study farmland preservation techniques and new crop / new agricultural enterprises as a way to enhance small - farm prosperity .
This was a cooperative project with Land of Sky Regional Council , the Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Project , Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy , American Farmland Trust , Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy , and Warren Wilson College .
The project created many useful tools , publications , videos , and an eBook for non -timber forest products producers , buyers , and consumers .
This project was funded by federal stimulus funds in the form of a grant .
Luffa sponge products are readily available in the cosmetic and bath section of department stores , discount stores , pharmacies , and specialty shops .
The popularity of luffa for personal hygiene products is due to the gentle exfoliating effect the fibers have on the skin .
Many environmentally conscious consumers appreciate that luffa products are biodegradable , natural , and a renewable resource .
In many other countries luffa is also used to make household cleaning products for scrubbing pots , pans , barbecue grills , tires , and many other surfaces that are not harmed by the abrasive fibers .
Pyrethrum ( Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium ) is a perennial temperate plant with small , white , daisy - like flowers from which natural insecticides , the pyrethrins , are derived .
Traditionally , pyrethrum was produced in many African countries where hand - labor was used to plant , harvest , and dry the crop .
Political upheaval , drought , and lack of an organized development and marketing structure resulted in unreliable pyrethrum supplies for US manufacturers .
From 2002 - 2004 , the NC Specialty Crops Program received funding from the GoldenLeaf Foundation to support a large number of research projects and educational programs throughout North Carolina .
Reports on many of these projects can be accessed from this interactive table .

After the mostly positive feedback on the recent wiki discussion , we have now gone ahead , formed a preliminary team consisting of both users and developers , and put up a project page .
All constructive feedback on this new project is welcome .
We'd also like to invite any users and developers , who are willing to help to make this a success , to join us .
At this point we areespecially looking for people who can help with : _________________"

Thanks for listing me on the project page .
I would be interested in working on the initial installation of MediaWiki , internal organisation , and moderation .
This should be a really nice resource for everyone , but we could REALLY use the help of users .
So join in !_________________“ Truth , like infinity , is to be forever approached but never reached . ” -- Jean Ayres ( 1972 )

Require user registration before people can edit pages ; no one wants to waste resources by making it easy for spammers to lure maintainers into a game of whack a mole .
Put it in a RCS ; I doubt anyone wants this to suffer from the same issues the forums suffer for not having had a RCS at the start .
Here are a few suggestions :

I think the homepage is great , even after all these years ; functional and attractive .
No need to change what ain't broke .
Maybe I'm in the minority , though .

1 ) This wo n't work .
The unofficial wiki gets virtually no spam from unregistered edits .
It 's all via registered accounts , many verified .
( Throwaway addresses are cheap and creating an auto - responder for email verification is simple )
2 ) Except for mods , everything on mediawiki is in the database , so putting the code in rcs will do nothing .
All you need to resurrect a wiki is a database dump and a list of modifications used .

For mediawiki there are extensions for auth , I think authentication is not a bad thing after all , and not much trouble either , and if official documentation is ever to appear on this wiki , even as a read only pages somehow parsed from xml ( and maybe some way for users to leave a note for some updates / bugs ) .
For mediawiki there are extensions for auth , http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Authentication , I see there is an ldap plugin which gives the option of using the local database as well as LDAP servers at the same time , I believe gentoo devs all have an ldap account so it can be reused , and database part could authenticate against this forum users database .
Now , how many edits will come from users that do n't have a forum account , there will be a percent but I think small .

Having to enter a CAPCHTA each and every time you want to edit a page is likely more of a problem than registering .

It uses the Gentoo name and the Gentoo logo .

So yngwin , what do you think about these 2 urls ?
Whole lotta shakin ' coming from the Redmond , Wash . , vicinity , and I 'm not talking about an earthquake .
Yesterday Steve Ballmer beheaded his president of entertainment and devices , 22 - year veteran Microsoftie Robbie Bach .
Bach 's top design guy , J Allard , went with him , though Allard is apparently being kept on in some vague advisory capacity ( probably to keep him out of the hands of Google ) .
According to Allard , " no chairs were thrown . "
[ Cringely also weighs in on the head of Apple , in " Steve Jobs : Savior or tyrant ? " | Stay up to date on all Robert X. Cringely 's observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
Note that Bach is claming this is a " retirement " and was entirely his decision .
I 'm not buying it .
If that were true , they'd have someone new in the wings to replace him , and Microsoft would be rolling out a big sheet cake with Bach 's name on it .
That did n't happen .
This is a sudden , major reorg of a key part of Microsoft 's business .
Bach got the boot because Microsoft is taking it in the assets in the mobile space , and the Redmond Behemoth has ( belatedly ) realized that 's where its future lies .
Yes , the Windows Mobile OS sucks harder than an asthmatic at an oxygen bar , but I 'm not entirely convinced that 's Bach 's fault .
An interface that 's barely tolerable from 18 inches away with a full keyboard and mouse is completely useless on a 2 - or 3 - inch screen and a teensy keypad .
And yet for years Microsoft has insisted on bringing the Windows to Windows Mobile .
Whose vision was that ?
It was n't Bach's .
Windows on every device ?
Windows to control your phones and your TVs and the lights in your house ?
Windows in your car ?
That belongs to our favorite semi-retired billionaire , the churros- munching , hurricane - battlin ' Billy Gates .
So with Bach gone , Steve Ballmer is taking over Microsoft 's mobile operations .
That 's a little like saying , " Son , you crashed the car , so I 'm going to hand the car keys to this gorilla and let him drive for a while . "
For a change of pace here in Cringeville , let 's look at what Microsoft has done right over the last decade .
Yes , I know , I might sprain something .
But bear with me .
First , the Xbox : What an amazing piece of technology .
Too expensive ?
Yes , especially if you need replacement parts , extra cables , or controllers .
That whole Red Ring of Death thing ?
That was a billion - dollar mistake .
But for pure graphical execution and gameplay , it blows everything else away .
This is the future of home entertainment .
It 's still hard to look at one and remember it 's a Microsoft product .
The Zune : I gave Microsoft a lot of well - deserved grief for the name ( apparently " Zune " sounds a lot like the " F " word in Hebrew , and I do n't mean " frankfurter " ) .
But the Zune HD is another impressive piece of technology -- a beautiful , whizzy yet intuitive interface that looks nothing at all like Windows .
Yet the Zune has barely gotten into the single digits in terms of market share .
Do n't blame the technology , blame Apple 's stranglehold on the digital content market , Microsoft 's inept marketing , and stupid decisions about DRM and the Zune Marketplace .
The new Windows Phone 7
Series seems to be finally abandoning the Windows metaphor and adapting to the form factor of the phone itself .
And it 's only five years too late .
Project Natal :
The no-wands - required , gesture - based interface looks to be a major breakthrough in home gaming .
If when it appears later this year it 's as good as it initially looks , it will blow the Wii away .
The Courier Tablet , such as it was , got everyone in a tizzy -- even when it existed solely as an animation on Gizmodo .
Yet Microsoft just killed it .
Its primary designer ?
J Allard , though he denies the death of the Courier inspired him to leave .
Where did all of these products come from ?
You guessed it -- Microsoft 's Entertainment and Devices division .
Boy , what a bunch of screw - ups .
Pop quiz :
What 's the biggest Microsoft disaster of all time ?
Sorry , time 's up .
The correct answer is Windows Vista .
Seven years in the making , and a complete and utter cluster - zune .
Yet Windows and Office are still the cash cows for Redmond , generating billions in profits each quarter .
They will for some time to come , just like mainframes still generate billions for IBM .
They 're not the future , though .
The future lives in mobile devices and the cloud .
That 's now in the hands of Ballmer .
InfoWorld 's Ted Samson says this is Microsoft 's way of telling the world it 's serious about mobile .
I think this is their way of telling shareholders it 's time to sell .
Microsoft has succeeded because a ) Bill Gates realized early on that if you controlled the operating system , you could control the entire PC market ; and 2 ) he and Ballmer used this control to bully hardware makers and enterprises into following " the Microsoft way . "
As Microsoft has since discovered , you can't bully your way into the consumer electronics market .
Unless you possess a huge institutional advantage ( like , say , owning the operating system ) , you have to actually persuade people your products are better .
If you 've spent the last 20 years lying to them about how well your products work , they are n't inclined to believe you .
So Microsoft axing one of its captains may look like it 's taking its troubles seriously , but it is n't going to solve the problem .
Microsoft 's biggest problem is the big , bald sweaty guy at the top .
You want to see real change in Redmond , that 's where it has to happen .
But do n't count on seeing that any time soon .
How would you solve Microsoft 's problems ?

I was really into fractals in college ( I know … ) when I was making rave flyers ( I know ! ) for a friend ’s parties in Iowa ( I know !
I know !
Shut up already ! ) .
Anyway , the thing that I really used to love doing with this fractal application that I had on my computer was zooming in to different parts of the familiar Mandelbrot set as far as I could .
I never got very far …between 5 or 6 zooms in , my Packard Bell 486/66 ( running Windows 3.11 ) would buckle under the computational pressure and hang .
Therefore , I absolutely love this extremely deep HD zoom into the Mandelbrot set :
Just how deep is this computational rabbit hole ?
The final magnification is e.214 .
Want some perspective ?
a magnification of e.12 would increase the size of a particle to the same as the earths orbit !
e.21 would make a particle look the same size as the milky way and e.42 would be equal to the universe .
This zoom smashes all of them all away .
If you were “ actually ” traveling into the fractal your speed would be faster than the speed of light .
After awhile , the self - similarity of the thing is almost too much to bear ; I think I went into a coma around 5:00 but snapped to in time for the exciting ( but not unexpected ) conclusion .
Full - screen in a dark room is recommended .
Update :
This 46 - minute video seems to be the deepest fractal zoom out there right now , with a zoom level of 10^10000 .
The magnification factor is so much less in the video above but that one ’s more fun / artistic .
And 10^10000 is such an absurdly large number1 that there ’s no way to think about it in physical terms … the zoom factor from the size of the universe to the smallest measurable distance ( the Planck length ) is only about 10^60 .
If cats , as the cliche has it , are mysterious creatures , then it 's partly due to circumstance :
Their nocturnal natures , slinking walk and an ability to vanish at will can make them tricky for humans to read .
Dogs , on the other hand , may have their secrets but seem transparent in their needs and desires :
Pet me , throw the ball , call in sick from work today and take me to the beach .
That 's why I 've always considered " the mysterious cat " more a matter of image than reality .
We give them a home and love , we pet and feed them , and they purr , sit on our laps and occasionally shred the sofa .
Where 's the mystery in that ?
But there is one feline mystery I 've never solved , and it was about one of my own pets .
Jezebel was the kitten of a pregnant stray I found in the street back in the early ' 80s , and she was a rough - and - tumble little hoyden of a cat .
And like a lot of cats , she tended to be a " kneader " when she was happy , working her claws in and out of my leg or arm when I 'd pet her .
But while most cats grow out of , or at least , learn to moderate this behavior over time , Jezebel instead became more methodical in how she used her claws .
She began inserting a single claw into one spot on my body , sitting and staring intently at the spot while she did it .
She would " puncture " odd locations , not just the arms and the legs .
And she 'd always sit and squint and purr while she was doing it .
I really had no idea what to make of this weird behavior until I developed a severe sinus infection .
It hit me while I was on vacation , and I went to three doctors before finally coming home , only to find my own doctor could n't seem to get anywhere with it , either .
My friend Kelly was an acupuncturist and he offered to treat me ; since we were friends , he made a house call .
As soon as Kelly walked in with his bag full of needles and herbs , Jezebel came flying from the back of the house .
Her eyes were huge , and she escorted him into the living room and then nosed around his case when he put it on the floor .
He laughed , and moved her aside so he could get out his needles .
She came back up to the case , and touched every needle packet with her nose as he pulled it out .
After he lay them all out on the table , she jumped into my lap and sat there , purring .
Every time Kelly inserted a needle in my face , she nudged the needle with her cheek , her purring getting louder .
After he was done , she sat on my lap , her eyes squinted , while purring more loudly than I 'd ever heard her , touching her nose or cheek to every single needle .
Kelly said he'd never seen anything even remotely like it .
A few minutes after he'd inserted the needles , I felt my sinuses shift and open , and my nose started to run copiously .
I laughed and tried to shift Jezebel off my lap , but she refused to go , burying her face in my armpit and cranking the volume on her purr even louder .
Kelly handed me some tissue and I sat there , face bristling with needles and nose running , my little furry purr machine making my whole body vibrate .
Because acupuncture was the only thing that seemed to help my sinuses , I decided to have Kelly come back a few more times .
Every time was the same : no matter where Jezebel was when he got there , she 'd come running , tail high , eyes bright , eager to help him get those needles in .
This was before I began keeping my cats indoors , and she 'd even come in when she was outside and could n't possibly have heard him at the door .
Kelly , who was of a considerably more mystical bent than I , firmly believed Jezebel had been an acupuncturist 's cat in a past life .
We used to tell each other stories about " the acupuncture cat " while he treated my sinuses that spring , Jezebel purring and squinting and overseeing the process .
One day I got a phone call that Kelly had died .
He 'd been struggling with AIDS for weeks , back in the time when there were no treatments and survival time was sometimes counted in days .
After the call , I was standing at the closed bedroom window , crying , when I saw Jezebel appear on a fence five backyards away ; her eyes were fixed on where I stood .
She flew across the fences , went through the little cat door to the laundry room , and a few seconds later came running into my bedroom .
I scooped her up and held her next to my wet face .
She pushed her little nose behind my ear , and purred as hard as she could .
I do n't know what was behind Jezebel 's mysterious relationship to acupuncture .
Maybe it was something as mundane as the smell of the herbs in my friend 's little black case , or the heat given off at the acupuncture points .
Maybe she was just glad my sinuses were draining ; I certainly was .
After Kelly 's death I kept getting acupuncture , but I had to go to an office for my treatments .
Jezebel kept up her own practice of cat - claw - puncture her whole life , but she never did manage to tell me what it all meant .
Maybe cats really are as mysterious as cliche has it , after all .
The venerable print magazine Old Trout was recently relaunched with a splashy issue on “ The Thirteen Scariest Americans . ”
I was asked to write up the scariest American from an environmental point of view .
The choice was not difficult .
The scariest polluter in the U.S. is Don Blankenship , CEO of Massey Energy .
The guy is evil , and I do n’t use that word lightly .
The issue is out now .
( Look for it on a newsstand near you ! )
The folks at Old Trout have given me permission to publish an expanded version of the piece after a suitable period of exclusivity .
So watch for that at the beginning of December .
[ UPDATE : Here ’s the full piece , “ Don Blankenship is an evil bastard . ” ]
In the meantime , check out three things .
First , there ’s this longish New York Times piece on Blankenship from Sunday .
In the usual style of mainstream reportage , it is studiously neutral in tone , woefully downplaying the environmental destruction Massey does and the thuggish tactics Blankenship has imposed .
But you can get a pretty accurate general picture of the guy .
Second , watch this short clip from Bill Moyers ‘ PBS special Is God Green ?
At the end there ’s an archival clip of Blankenship from 1984 .
To me it ’s absolutely mesmerizing .
I ’ve probably watched it 50 times .
The sunken , lifeless eyes , the flat affect , the utter lack of empathy … like I said , it bespeaks psychopathy .
I ’ve shown it to a bunch of other people and they do n’t find it quite as chilling as I do , so your mileage may vary :
And finally , please visit I Love Mountains and do whatever you can — even if it ’s only sending a letter to the editor or signing an online petition — to end the horrifically destructive practice of mountaintop - removal mining .
Metrics Tree Maps 03 May 2010
Posted in Visualisation
As a consultant I often find myself in a position where I have to get to know a large existing code base quickly ; I need to understand how the code is structured , how well it is written , whether there are any major issues , and if so , whether they are localised or whether they are spread throughout the code base .
To get a feeling for the general quality of the code I have found Toxicity charts useful .
To understand the structure , Dependency Structure Matrices come in handy .
Conceptually somewhere between those two lie metrics tree maps , which I want to write about today .
A metrics tree map visualises the structure of the code by rendering the hierarchical package ( namespace ) structure as nested rectangles , with parent packages encompassing child packages .
The actual display is taken up by the leaves in this structure , the classes .
Have a look at the following tree map which shows the JRuby code base , without worrying too much about the " metrics " part yet .
At the top right I have highlighted the org .
jruby .
compiler package .
The tree map shows that this package contains a few classes , such as ASTCompiler and ASTInspector , as well as three subpackages , namely impl , ir , and util , with util for example containing a class called HandleFactory , visible on the far right .
( Visible in the full - size version . )
In the following I explain how the tree maps visualise metrics , and I will explain how to create such maps from Java source code .
As usual , adapting this other programming languages is relatively easy .
Showing metrics in the tree map
From the JRuby example above it is clear that tree maps can visualise two metrics by using the size and the colour of the rectangles .
In the example the size of the rectangle represents the number of lines in the corresponding file ( the actual length of the file , not the sum of the lines of code in all the methods ) while the colour shows the sum of the cyclomatic complexity of all the methods in the class ; the redder the class , the higher the complexity .
This map allows easy identification of large and complex classes , and usually file size and complexity are correlated , meaning that larger rectangles appear in a darker shade of red .
The left third of the JRuby tree map follows this pattern almost perfectly .
However , the tree map also highlights an exception to this pattern : the IANA class in the org.jruby.ext .socket package .
This class is large but has a very low complexity for a class if its size , something that is worth an investigation .
It should be obvious that other size metrics , such as method count or length , could be mapped to the rectangle size , while metrics such as class fan - out or data abstraction coupling could be mapped to the colour .
Going further , while it is intuitive to show a size - based metric as the size , it can be worthwhile to map other metrics to the size .
For example , a tree map showing complexity via the size and fan - out as colour makes it obvious which complex classes have high fan - out and which ones have not .
This can be useful to identify which ( overly ) complex classes can be refactored more easily .
In a class that has lower fan - out the complexity is more " self - contained " , likely allowing for one or more easy Extract Class refactorings .
Going beyond these examples , it is also possible to map non-metric information onto the colour , for example the name of the dominant committer of a file .
In such a case each committer would be mapped to an individual colour , and rectangles could be shaded grey if no single committer accounted for more than a certain percentage of commits .
Such a view would show whether a development team has bought into collective code ownership , or whether developers have carved off individual packages for themselves .
More ideas , and other visualisations here .
Using Checkstyle to get metrics
Checkstyle is meant to report on violations of guidelines , usually if a numeric threshold is exceeded .
( I 've shown how this data can be visualised in a previous article . )
If all thresholds are set to zero Checkstyle considers everything a violation and reports all metrics .
The following file shows the configuration used for this article .
< module name = " Checker " > < property name = " severity " value= " warning " /> < module name = " TreeWalker " > < module name= " FileContentsHolder " /> < module name= " FileLength " > < property name = " max " value= " 0 " /> </ module > < module name= " MethodLength " > < property name = " max " value= " 0 " /> </ module > < module name= " ClassDataAbstractionCoupling " > < property name = " max " value= " 0 " /> </ module > < module name= " ClassFanOutComplexity " > < property name = " max " value= " 0 " /> </ module > < module name = " CyclomaticComplexity " > < property name = " max " value= " 0 " / > </ module > </ module > </ module >
With this file saved as " metrics.xml "
Checkstyle can be invoked as follows to create an XML file containing all metrics we are interested in .
java - jar checkstyle - all- 4.1.jar - c metrics.xml -f xml - o checkstyle_out.xml -r < source_dir > < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < checkstyle version = " 4.1 " > < file name= " jruby - 1.4.1/src/org/jruby/anno/AnnotationBinder.java " > < error line = " 1 " severity =" warning " message =
" File length is 487 lines ( max allowed is 0 ) . " source= " com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.sizes.FileLengthCheck " /> < error line = " 31 " column= " 1 " severity =" warning " message = " Class Data Abstraction Coupling is 1 ( max allowed is 0 ) classes [ AnnotationBindingProcessor ] . "
source=" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.metrics.ClassDataAbstractionCouplingCheck "/> < error line = " 31 " column= " 1 " severity =" warning " message = " Class Fan-Out Complexity is 5 ( max allowed is 0 ) . " source= " com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.metrics.ClassFanOutComplexityCheck "/> < error line = " 36 " column= " 5 " severity =" warning " message = " Cyclomatic Complexity is 1 ( max allowed is 0 ) . " source= " com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.metrics.CyclomaticComplexityCheck "/> < error line = " 36 " column= " 5 " severity =" warning " message = " Method length is 3 lines ( max allowed is 0 ) . " source=" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.sizes.MethodLengthCheck " /> ...
For languages other than Java other tools can be used to create a similar output file .
The format does not need to be exactly the same ( more later ) .
Drawing tree maps with InfoVis
I 've been using the InfoVis Toolkit for years and while development on it has stagnated it just works ; at least as long as a Java 5 runtime is available , which , unfortunately , is not the case on Mac OS X Snow Leopard .
I 'm open to suggestions of better / newer tools ...
InfoVis is an interactive Java application that has a decent user interface to map various fields of the input file onto different aspects of the tree map , size and colour being two obvious ones .
At this point it is probably worth mentioning that I generally also " sort " the tree map by whatever metric I have mapped to the size .
The screenshot on the right shows the settings I used for the JRuby tree map above , and in case you wonder about the abbreviations for the metrics , FLENGTH is obviously file length , and WMCcc stands for Weighted Method Count ( cyclomatic complexity ) .
Data conversion
The remaining piece of the puzzle is the transformation of the Checkstyle output into a format that InfoVis can interpret .
Luckily , the input file format for InfoVis , named TM3 , is very simple .
The following excerpt shows data for the first few classes of the JRuby code base .
FLENGTH CDAC CFOC MCOUNT WMCloc WMCcc INTEGER INTEGER INTEGER INTEGER INTEGER INTEGER 487 6 16 15 422 87 org jruby anno AnnotationBinder 21 0 1 0 0 0 org jruby anno Coercion 14 0 0 0 0 0 org jruby anno CoercionType 5 0 0 0 0 0 org jruby anno FrameField 69 6 9 1 54 11 org jruby anno InvokerGenerator 136 1 3 4 93 26 org jruby anno JavaMethodDescriptor 20 0 0 0 0 0 org jruby anno JRubyClass
The first line contains the names of the metrics , the second line their data types .
Both are tab separated .
The remaining lines contain the metrics for each of the classes followed by the tree structure , with all package nodes flattened out and separated by tabs as well .
Sometimes non-XML formats are so refreshingly easy to work with .
A small Ruby script , which I have attached further down can be used to convert Checkstyle 's XML output into the TM3 format , using a command like this : ruby checkstyle2tm3.rb checkstyle_out.xml < source_dir > > treemap.tm3
Currently , the script has the path separator hard - coded .
If you intend to run this script on a Windows machine you have to change the path separator constant in line 6 manually .
This Zip archive contains the Ruby script used to convert Checkstyle XML output format to the InfoVis TM3 file format .
Remember that you might have to change the path separator .

Idaho 's plan to downgrade the dollar
Andrew Leonard
A bill to allow citizens to pay their taxes with silver medallions gains support .
Goldbugs are watching closely .
With only one state representative dissenting , the Idaho House State Affairs committee voted on Monday to endorse HB 633 , a bill that would allow Idaho citizens to pay their state taxes with an official state silver medallion .
The news comes just a month after a South Carolina legislator introduced a bill seeking to ban Federal currency altogether , and replace the upstart greenback with gold or silver coins .
A half - dozen other states have considered similar legislation , reports the Tenth Amendment Center .
But there 's a key difference between the Idaho plan and the bills proposed in other states , most of which fall somewhere on a spectrum ranging from Tea Party rage to Ron Paul goldbug - ism .
( The South Carolina bill , for example , claims that " the State is experiencing an economic crisis of severe magnitude caused in large part by the unconstitutional substitution of Federal Reserve Notes for silver and gold coin as legal tender in this State . " )
In contrast , the sponsor of the Idaho bill , Republican Phil Hart , seems to be marshalling wide support by crafting legislation that is straight out industrial policy aimed at boosting Idaho 's silver industry .
The text of the bill is quite clear .
The intent of this act is to use the abundant silver resources of the state of Idaho to create a means whereby the people of Idaho can pay their taxes to the state using silver mined from the ground of Idaho , processed in Idaho and finally minted into a medallion in Idaho .
It is the intent of the Legislature to create mining jobs in Idaho while giving the people of Idaho a means to store their wealth in a precious metal that is immune from the effects of inflation while complying with the mandates of our federal Constitution .
The Idaho bill therefore incorporates tax incentives for silver processors located in Idaho .
From The Idaho Reporter : That , Hart believes , could bring hundreds , if not thousands of jobs to the state .
In conjunction with the creation of the medallion , Hart 's bill would also try to lure silver processing companies to Idaho , and in particular , north Idaho , which , according to Hart , was once called " the silver capital of the world . "
The bill would give companies that come to Idaho to process silver for the medallion a 10 - year exemption from income taxes , as well as property taxes .
The exemption would be open for 20 years and would sunset after that period of time .
Hart believes one of the advantages of silver is that it would resist inflationary pressure better than paper money .
But since states are n't allowed to mint their own money , the value of the silver medallion will have to fluctuate according to market forces .
In just the last ten years , the value of an ounce of silver has zig - zagged between four and twenty dollars .

MORE than 30 child experts are calling for a ban on the sale of pornographic magazines such as Playboy and Penthouse and other soft porn material from newsagents , milkbars , convenience stores , supermarkets and petrol stations .
The group has asked censorship ministers to review the rules on which the so - called lads ' mags such as People , The Picture , Zoo and Ralph are reviewed , saying they are increasingly explicit and contributing to the sexualisation of children .
Calls for ban ... Playboy .
A letter to the standing committee of attorneys - general / censorship ministers signed by a former chief justice of the Family Court , Alastair Nicholson , the chief executive of World Vision , Tim Costello , the actor Noni Hazlehurst and 34 academics , child professionals and advocates says such material should be restricted to adults - only premises .
They are particularly disturbed by the prevalence of '' teen sex ' ' magazines featuring women apparently aged more than 18 but looking younger and styled with braces and pigtails but in highly sexualised poses and sometimes performing sex acts .
Under Australian censorship laws it is illegal to use under - age models or models who appear to be under 18 .

NARAL Pro-Choice America Pays Tribute to Dorothy Height 's Legacy of Leadership
Lithuania 's first gay pride parade can go ahead as planned on Saturday , an appeals court has ruled .
Earlier this week , a lower court outlawed the parade after the chief prosecutor argued that anti-gay groups could cause violence .
But the appeals court ruled that the state must ensure the right to peaceful assembly .
Correspondents say that homosexuality is seen as taboo by many in Lithuania , a majority Roman Catholic country .
The original ban was criticised by President Dalia Grybauskaite , some European governments , and the international rights watchdog Amnesty International .
Organisers of Saturday 's Baltic Pride 2010 march have welcomed the ruling , which is final .
The parade in the Lithuanian capital , Vilnius , is expected to draw 350 participants and an even larger crowd of opponents , according to the Associated Press news agency .
Some 800 police officers will be on hand to maintain order , and have been instructed to confiscate harmful objects as well as tomatoes and eggs , the Baltic Pride organisers said on their website .
The ruling issued by the top Vilnius appeals court said : " The state has a duty to ensure the right to peaceful assembly , even of people whose opinions are not popular or represent minorities . "
Lithuania , an EU member since 2004 , has repeatedly been criticised by rights groups for widespread intolerance toward sexual minorities .
One of the things we love about tequila is that it is equally enjoyably sipped neat as it is in cocktails .
Tequila ’s versatility has helped make it the key ingredient in the most frequently ordered cocktail in the United States , the Margarita .
Although the Margarita is so common and fundamentally simple , it ’s a drink which is often mutilated , adulterated , and generally fouled up .
The key to making a great Margarita , or any tequila drink for that matter , is the use of fresh citrus .
There is no mix in the world that will come close to even the most clumsily prepared Margarita made with fresh lime juice .
While many classic Margarita recipes call for Cointreau , we feel that it ’s an unnecessary inclusion in a drink that is best made with only 3 ingredients ( we feel the same way about salt as well ) .
Our favorite margarita recipe comes from Tommy ’s Margarita Bar in San Francisco and tequila icon Julio Bermejo :
Tommy ’s Margarita
2 oz Blanco Tequila
1 oz lime juice ( must be fresh squeezed )
1 oz agave syrup ( diluted 1:1 nectar / water )
Shake and strain over cracked ice ( no need to salt the rim ) .
That ’s it .
Three ingredients and the result ( even if you do n’t have the best shake in the world ) is nothing short of amazing .
We recommend that you use a 100 % agave tequila , because with so few ingredients , the tequila you use here REALLY matters , so do n’t use a bottom shelf mixto .
For our Margaritas we prefer using Tequila Avion Silver , Don Julio Blanco , Tequila Pueblo Viejo or Tequila Cabebeza all which do extremely well in the drink .
For more on the Margarita , be sure to listen to our How to Make A Margarita Podcast .
Not all great tequila drinks are citrus based , and this next one is a great variation on a classic from bar star Ricky Gomez .
It ’s one of the best tequila and mezcal drinks we ’ve ever had :
Oaxaca Old Fashioned
2 oz Reposado Tequila ( El Tesoro recommended )
1/2 oz Mezcal ( if you ’ve got it we recommend Del Maguy Chichicapa )
1/4 oz agave nectar
2 dashes of Angostura and one dash of Regan ’s orange bitters Build in a rocks glass .
Add ice and stir .
Grapefruit zest .
Del Maguey Chichicapa is n’t cheap , but when lime prices skyrocket ( as they ’ve been known to do ) , it seems downright affordable .
You can also substitute Del Maguey Vida or Piedra Almas ’ La Puritita Verda for a cocktail that wo n’t break the bank .
While it is n’t as easy to prepare ( due to the chili tincture ) as Tommy ’s Margarita or Ricky Gomez ’s Oaxaca Old Fashioned , Erik Adkins ’ Carter Beats The Devil ( created for Flora in Oakland , California ) could very well be the ultimate tequila drink .
It easily ranks among the top 10 tequila cocktails we ’ve ever had .
Carter Beats The Devil
2 oz Reposado Tequila
1 oz . fresh lime juice
1/2 oz . organic agave nectar
1/4 oz .
Maguey Minero Mezcal
20 drops ( eye dropper ) of chili tincture *
* To make chili tincture , cover Thai chili with overproof rum for two weeks , strain .
Put all ingredients in a cocktail shaker , add ice , shake well and pour , straining out the ice .
Carter Beats
The Devil is a tequila lovers dream – it pulls everything we love about tequila together with wonderful spice from the Thai chili and smoky goodness from mezcal .
It ’s one of the world ’s great tequila cocktails .

Despite the politicians ' claims to be " protecting life , " a new wave of anti-choice laws will have devastating consequences for women , writes Nicole Colson .
A SERIES of anti-abortion laws passed in Oklahoma and Nebraska is making control over women 's reproductive lives the business of everyone but women themselves .
In April , the Oklahoma legislature voted to overturn Gov. Brad Henry 's veto of two new anti-choice laws .
One requires a woman seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound and listen to a description of the fetus before aborting .
According to the New York Times , the law mandates that " a doctor or technician set up the monitor so the woman can see it and describe the heart , limbs and organs of the fetus .
No exceptions are made for rape and incest victims . "
And if that were n't cruel enough , the second law is more chilling -- it prevents women who give birth to a disabled child from suing a doctor who knowingly withheld information about birth defects .
In essence , the law gives a green light to anti-choice physicians to lie to patients -- a clear violation of medical ethics and a shocking breach of the doctor - patient relationship .
After all , if doctors can lie about birth defects , what else will they be allowed to lie about to women , if they deem the truth too " inconvenient " to their personal beliefs ?
Marching in support of abortion rights in San Francisco ( Josh On | SW )
That 's not all that Oklahoma lawmakers have in store for women .
As the Times points out , " Two other anti-abortion bills are still working their way through the legislature and are expected to pass .
One would force women to fill out a lengthy questionnaire about their reasons for seeking an abortion ; statistics based on the answers would then be posted online .
The other restricts insurance coverage for the procedures . "
Among other things , the questionnaire would require women to reveal the town they live in , the status of their relationships , their education level , number of previous abortions , how many children they have and their race -- making them easily identifiable , particularly if they live in small communities , and opening them up to possible harassment , if not violence , from disapproving partners , family members or random anti-choice strangers .
In an era where Kansas abortion provider George Tiller was gunned down in his church by an anti-choice activist , this threat should not be taken lightly .
But try telling that to Oklahoma state Sen. Todd Lamb .
" The goal of this legislation is just to make a statement for the sanctity of human life , " said Lamb , the majority floor leader , who is sponsoring the bill requiring women to fill out a questionnaire .
" Maybe someday these babies will grow up to be police officers and arrest bad people , or will find a cure for cancer . "
So what about the women who consider their lives ruined by being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term ?
Do they matter ?
How about the children who suffer the fate of being born unwanted ?
Like any number of sanctimonious right - wingers , Lamb refuses to spare a second thought for the women whose lives are affected by his laws -- and his concern for " babies " evaporates as soon as they 're actually born .
Lamb is on record opposing universal health care , and according to James Nimmo in the Oklahoma Observer , he " voted against the ' All Kids Act ' in 2007 , a bill giving health insurance to 42,000 poor Oklahoma kids with money from a tobacco tax passed in 2004 " and " refused to allow three bills to be heard about contraceptives assigned to his Health and Human Resources Committee in 2007 . "
One of those three bills , the " Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergency , " would have required facilities that provide medical care to rape victims to offer emergency contraception .
Lamb 's concern about the " sanctity of human life " does n't extend to actual living , breathing women -- just the fetuses they carry .
IN NEBRASKA , meanwhile , the " Abortion Pain Prevention Act " was also signed into law by the governor in late April .
It bans abortions for women more than 20 weeks pregnant , under the pretext that fetuses can feel pain after that point -- a claim not established by medical fact .
Law professor and National Abortion Federation board member Caitlin Borgmann described in the Los Angeles Times the expert " evidence " that members of the Nebraska legislature heard on this question :
Two witnesses testified on the topic of fetal pain .
One was an expert in pain management and anesthesiology , who admitted he had no personal experience treating or studying fetuses .
The second was a pain expert who had administered fetal anesthesia in a neonatal intensive care unit , but only starting at 23 weeks .
He also asserted that " life begins at conception " according to his " religious viewpoint " and his " maker . "
( This same doctor , venturing far beyond his apparent medical expertise , spontaneously volunteered that electroshock therapy to induce a grand mal seizure should be the preferred treatment over abortion for a suicidal woman 20 or more weeks pregnant . )
Another Nebraska bill given final approval by lawmakers at the same time requires women who seek abortions to be screened for possible mental and physical problems before they can have the procedure .
According to the Associated Press , the screenings :
would assess whether women have risk factors that could lead to mental or physical problems after an abortion .
Doctors would have to tell patients whether they had any of the risk factors , but could perform abortions even if they existed .
If a screening was not done , a woman could file a civil suit ...
The doctors would likely have to screen for far - ranging risk factors that could change over time .
Any risk factors cited in peer - reviewed journals indexed by two major medical and scientific listing services during the year before a planned abortion would have to be checked .
Again , there 's no scientific consensus that abortion causes " mental or physical problems . "
But that has n't stopped anti-choice groups from claiming proof of pseudo - scientific fabrications like " post- abortion syndrome " or the thoroughly discredited " link " between abortion and breast cancer .
The law is expected to go into effect this summer .
THESE LAWS , despite what their backers claim , have nothing to do with " protecting babies and women " and everything to do with intimidating doctors from providing abortion services and undermining women 's right to control their own bodies .
Such measures -- coming on top of decades of parental consent laws , mandatory waiting periods and restrictions on abortion funding -- are a conscious strategy of the anti-abortion movement to chip away at a woman 's right to abortion until it disappears completely .
In contrast to the right wing 's claims , for many women , being able to choose abortion is n't something to be ashamed of , but something to be celebrated .
As DaShaya , a member of the Chicago Abortion Fund , which provides abortion funding to low - income women , explained on the group 's Web site :
What a great feeling it is to have choice over your body .
I have children and I 've had abortions , but I can't imagine not having an option .
I have made many choices in life , and some were not good .
However , they were made based on my personal situation at that time .
I rarely regret anything I do , and having the privilege to control me is an exceptional feeling .
That 's precisely the attitude that anti-choice politicians like Todd Lamb find so offensive -- and it 's no wonder why women seem to be the very last people that anti-choicers are concerned about .
Witness the disdain that right - wingers have for women who refuse to be ashamed of their decision to abort .
" Feminists rejoice at the idea of abortion for convenience : They are also anti-woman , " ran the headline of a recent article by conservative blogger Lori Ziganto .
Ziganto was objecting to the actions of a woman who , appalled at anti-choice ads in the New York City subway for the Web site AbortionChangesYou.com posted sheets on top of the ads so that they read " Abortion changes you : Now I can go to college and fulfill my dreams . "
Ziganto has a funny notion of " convenience . "
Being able to finish school instead of being forced to drop out hardly seems like a flip decision .
Neither does having an abortion because of an inability to financially care for a child -- or because a woman is n't ready for the responsibility of a child -- two of the main reasons consistently cited by women aborting a pregnancy , according to the Guttmacher Institute .
And as anyone who has tried to obtain an abortion knows , there 's nothing " convenient " about the experience , particularly for poor and working - class women .
Trying to scrape together hundreds of dollars for a medical procedure often not covered by insurance , finding an abortion provider in your state ( or perhaps having to cross state lines to find one ) , navigating waiting periods and parental consent / notification -- all of this represents a huge burden on women that new laws like those in Oklahoma and Nebraska will only magnify .
More importantly , it should be none of Ziganto 's business -- or Todd Lamb's or Sarah Palin 's or anyone else -- what any woman chooses to do with her own body , since they are not the ones who have to live with the impact of that choice .
But for Ziganto , Lamb and others like them , the idea of a woman having an abortion , being unapologetic about it , and talking about how it made her life , yes , better is threatening .
That 's the dirty secret of anti-choice groups , behind their supposed concern for " babies " -- their fundamental lack of concern for the realities facing women saddled with unwanted pregnancies .
The decision should n't be theirs .
Whether or not a woman chooses to have an abortion should be her decision alone -- not the state 's and not the anti-choicers who claim they 're trying to " save " us from some made - up " harm " or from ourselves .
Without the fundamental right to control their own bodies -- and decide when , how and under what circumstances to choose to have a child -- women will be relegated to second - class status .

An 8 - ship aid flotilla will likely set sail from Turkish ports on Wednesday in an attempt to reach the Occupied Gaza Strip
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu called on the Israelis to lift their siege of Gazan civilians and warned them not to block the aid flotilla .
Turkey had for decades been close to Israel , its secular generals preferring Tel Aviv to the Arab powers .
But the ruling AK Partisi is imbued with more respect for Islam and for popular opinion than was common with most Turkish governments .
Since two of the 8 ships in the flotilla are Turkish - sponsored , any naval confrontationof Turkey ’s vessels by an Israeli warship could turn ugly in the diplomatic realm .
Ireland has likewise urged Israeli restraint .
The 1.6 million people of the Gaza Strip , half of them children , have become trapped by history between a hostile Israel on one side , cutting them off from their traditional hinterland of Arab markets , and the Mediterranean on the other .
Since 2007 , the Israelis have imposed on Gaza a thoroughgoing blockade , in hopes of unseating the Hamas party - militia that gained control in the January , 2006 parliamentary elections .
The blockade has deeply harmed the health and economic well - being of the Gazans , but it has had zero impact on Hamas hegemony .
Although Israeli officials propagandistically claim that they allow large amounts of aid through every week , what they do n’t say is that they are n’t allowing enough aid in .
Saying that you give someone you keep tied up in your basement a whole 400 calories a day is just a way of saying you are starving him , since he needs roughly 2000 calories a day .
Focusing on what is let through as opposed to what is kept out is just misdirection , as when a stage magician gets you to glance somewhere else other than at the elephant he brought in .
After the brutal war it launched on Gaza in December - January 2008 - 2009 , Israel banned the import of building materials that would have allowed most buildings and residences to be repaired .
Here are some revealing statistics from a recent report by the World Health Organization on the situation in Gaza :
“ In Gaza , Israel ’s blockade is debilitating the healthcare system , limiting medical supplies and the training of medical personnel and preventing serious medical cases from travelling outside the Strip for specialized treatment . ”
“ Israel ’s 2008 - 2009 military operation damaged 15 of the Strip ’s 27 hospitals and damaged or destroyed 43 of its 110 primary health care facilities , none of which have been repaired or rebuilt because of the construction materials ban . ”
“ Some 15 - 20 percent of essential medicines are commonly out of stock and there are shortages of essential spare parts for many items of medical equipment . . . ”
In Late 2008 , nearly 1 in 5 Palestinians lived in “ extreme poverty . ”
Over half lived below the poverty line .
“ In the second half of 2008 , one third of West Bank households and 71 percent of Gaza households received food assistance , with food accounting for roughly half total household expenditures – making families highly vulnerable to food price fluctuations . ”
“ In May 2008 , 56 percent of Gazans and 25 percent of West Bank residents were deemed food insecure by the UN . ”
“ Chronic malnutrition has risen in Gaza over the past few years to reach 10.2 percent . ”
[ This is especially true among children in Gaza ) .
Before I even dip a toe into this subject , a little background :
If you had asked me two years ago what the hardest part of making our film ” THE WATERHOLE ” was I would have answered something like “ working with limited resources ” or “ time constraints . ”
If you were to ask me today I would answer simply and without hesitation : “ getting into film festivals . ”
The film business is a freight train ’s length of consecutive rejection .
You get used to it .
You have to .
I really wanted to take the film to as many places we could , show it to audiences and get their reactions all while partying with other filmmakers and film fans .
That did n’t happen .
Getting rejected to as many film festivals as we did hurt but it ’s a reflection of reality .
There is a lot of competition and you take your chances just like anyone else .
For the most part , I still believe that film festivals are still great events and a vital part of the world of independent film .
Film festivals have thousands of submissions to assess , and a lot of good films get passed over .
The point of this post is not a criticism of film festivals , but rather to one aspect of them , the submission process .
The fact of the matter is that submitting to film festivals can be a tremendous waste of money .
For our film we submitted to well over thirty film festivals with submission fees ranging anywhere from $ 25 - $ 80 .
At the end of the day this adds up to a lot of money spent , especially to an independent filmmaker with a dwindling budget .
This money could have been used to host our own screenings , hire marketing or self - distribution consultants or even used to make another film .
( Literally , what we spent was almost the budget of Gary King ’s wonderful little film “ What ’s up Lovely . ” )
Adding to the problem is Withoutbox , a wonderful tool to submit to festivals and manage those submissions , but with the side effect of making it too hard to be discriminating with too many options .
( Hell yeah I would like to go to Dublin or Hawaii or Bermuda ! )
Simply put , the festival submission process is the filmmaking equivalent to the lottery .
Worse actually , because at least all lottery ticket buyers are playing on the same level .
Do you think every film that submits to a festival gets equal consideration ?
You do n’t ?
Good , I would hate to be the one to throw that bucket of cold water on you .
Here ’s a fact : we did not submit to the first festival we screened at .
Did n’t pay either .
We got in via a friend of a friend and we were extremely grateful , but it was in no way something we planned for .
I wo n’t pretend to know all the inner workings of the selection process but many films that get in get in do so through back channels , who - knows - who and sometimes even through bribery – friendly and playful bribery , but bribery none - the - less .
Many films get selected after screening at a major festival or because the star of the film has connections .
There is no way to compete with that .
None .
My very favorite story was reading an interview with the festival director of the 2009 South - by - Southwest Film Festival joking that she was thrilled a film she acted in was selected .
She would have to be one hell of a great actress to make me believe she was really surprised .
If you simply send in the film the chances of someone watching it that actually has power to program it is slight .
I highly recommend that every filmmaker watch the documentary “ Official Rejection ” for a wonderfully frightening tour through the festival submission process .
I mention it here for another reason .
The filmmakers behind the movie endorsed “ The Hill County Film Festival ” that was founded by a duo they featured in the doc .
We submitted , figuring that given their history with festivals they would make an attempt to at least be conscientious enough to give fair treatment to those submitting .
We were rejected .
Fine .
I read the rejection letter for the salt in the wounds and see that they confessed that they were not able to watch every film .
I love honesty , but can I have my submission fee back ?
So not to be the jackass that just complains , what would I recommend ?
Festivals rely on these fees to help cover the costs occurred by running these large events , so we ca n’t expect them to do away with the fees altogether .
( Although bless those festivals that have no submission fees , what few of them there are . )
First , filmmakers deserve feedback .
Maybe each filmmaker gets sent a chain of custody form , explaining who watched the film , a rating and a few comments .
It would n’t take much time and would at least provide a sense of where the film stood in the selection process .
Or how about a pre-screening process ?
Have filmmakers send a trailer and / or a synopsis to weed out the ones that are not the right fit for the festival right off the top .
This would generate less submission revenue , but is seemingly a much fairer approach .
Any transparency is better for my money than just a rejection letter .
Will I ever spend money on a festival submission again ?
I hope not .
In reality I could not look a filmmaker in the eye and tell him not to submit to Sundance , Toronto or any of the half a dozen or so major fests .
You just need to try to do everything your power to get it seen by a person who makes the decisions .
Are there other smaller festivals that are worth the fee ?
Yes .
Ask other filmmakers .
Do the research and choose carefully .
There are thousands of festivals and you ca n’t submit to all of them and should n’t submit to most of them .
Buy Chris Gore ’s “ Ultimate Film Festival Survival Guide ” and read it cover to cover .
( We did not get this book until six months after we began submitting and what a difference it would have made . )
Making THE WATERHOLE was a learning process .
In many cases we learned only after making mistakes .
Spending the type of money we did on festival submissions is one mistake I do not want to repeat .

Elsewhere , the manifesto offers that typically Lib Dem combination of the idealistic and the opportunistic .
The party wants a smaller House of Commons and the right to remove corrupt MPs , both of which measures we support .
But their demand for " fair votes " , as they insist on calling proportional representation , is specifically designed to give them , the least popular of the three main parties , a whip hand in the formation of governments .
Where is the fairness in that ?
Some ideas are simply risible .
While the manifesto sensibly calls for a greater emphasis on energy conservation , it also says that all Britain 's energy should come from renewable sources within 40 years .
This fantastical aim would be achieved by closing down nuclear reactors and dirty coal - fired stations .
If we want to return to a peasant economy , then this is the route to follow .
Washington ( CNN ) --
As the oil slick from the recent offshore oil rig disaster makes its way to Gulf Coast shores -- expected to devastate the precious ecosystem and hurt struggling businesses -- the seeds of political fallout for the Obama administration are beginning to sprout .
Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said on his program that the oil slick disaster is " Obama 's Katrina . "
Not so , says Media Matters for America :
" Media conservatives have rushed to absurdly compare the Obama administration 's response to a catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to the Bush Administration 's botched response after Hurricane Katrina , a hurricane that left more than 1,500 dead , " the liberal - leaning group said on its website .
" This claim is undermined by a number of facts . "
Another Obama critic , Joe Weisenthal of BusinessInsider.com , wrote Thursday , " Today the story got elevated to national emergency level , but the explosion on the rig happened eight days ago ! "
White House Senior Adviser David Axelrod told ABC news Friday : " This is always the case in Washington -- that whenever something like this happens , the political speculation sets in . "
" The truth of the matter is we had the Coast Guard on the scene almost immediately after this accident .
The deputy secretary of the interior was on the ground the next day , and we 've been coordinating closely with the local authorities and [ BP officials ] from the very beginning . "
Axelrod said that no additional offshore oil drilling has been authorized and " none will until we find out what happened here and whether there was something unique and preventable here . "
On April 20 , the Deepwater Horizon rig was ripped by an explosion that burned for two days until the rig sank .
Eleven missing men are presumed dead .
State and local officials are now scrambling to avert further natural disaster , which is threatening to surpass the Exxon Valdez disaster 20 years ago in Alaska .
In addition , several governmental agencies -- along with the U.S. military -- are aiding the effort .
Several top administration figures were also sent to the region Friday .
Speaking at the White House Friday , Obama emphasized that BP -- the company that owns the rig -- is legally responsible for paying the costs of the response to and cleanup of the spill .
Still , he said , " We are fully prepared to meet our responsibilities to any and all affected communities . "
In early April , Obama announced plans to pursue the expansion of oil drilling off the nation 's coasts , a plan that received praise by Republicans and other administration critics .
Noting that it was not an easy decision to make , Obama said that in order to sustain economic growth , produce jobs and keep businesses competitive , " we 're going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable , homegrown energy . "
Some Democrats and environmentalists ripped into Obama 's decision at the time .
Now , with the oil leaking at a high rate , Obama 's critics are once again calling on him to kill offshore drilling .
Sen . Bill Nelson , D - Florida , asked Obama in a letter Thursday to halt exploratory oil operations in coastal waters .
Nelson said in the letter that the potential environmental and economic damage from the current spill required immediate preventive actions until the cause is discovered -- adding that " until we learn what happened , I 'm asking that you also call for an immediate halt of test wells and all other exploratory operations in coastal waters . "
Nelson also said he would file legislation " that would , for the time being , prohibit the Interior Department from acting on your administration 's plans to expand offshore drilling , including seismic testing and other exploratory operations . "
On Friday , Obama told reporters in the White House Rose Garden that domestic oil production continues to be " an important part of our overall strategy " but said " it must be done responsibly for the safety of our workers and our environment . "
Obama also ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to " report back to me in 30 days " on any " precautions in technologies " needed to prevent such accidents in the future .
" We 're going to make sure that any leases going forward have those safeguards , " Obama said .
" We 've also dispatched teams to the Gulf Coast to inspect all deep - water rigs and platforms to address safety concerns . "
The oil slick disaster could also stall a climate change bill from moving forward .
The House passed its version last year .
The Senate 's version was supposed to be introduced this week -- but was derailed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , a key sponsor of the bill , pulling his support .
The proposed Senate bill included provisions for offshore drilling -- something sponsors hoped would bring enough Republicans on board to support the bill .
Political observers say Democrats will likely have a hard time supporting a bill with offshore drilling components in it .
Those who represent states with coastlines will undoubtedly face pressure coming from constituents as the midterm election nears .

Guess what the cow has done this time ?
America ’s dairy farmers could soon find themselves in the computer business , with the manure from their cows possibly powering the vast data centers of companies like Google and Microsoft .
While not immediately intuitive , the idea plays on two trends : the building of computing centers in more rural locales , and dairy farmers ’ efforts to deal with cattle waste by turning it into fuel .
With the right skills , a dairy farmer could rent out land and power to technology companies and recoup an investment in the waste - to - fuel systems within two years , Hewlett - Packard engineers say in a research paper to be made public on Wednesday .
“ Information technology and manure have a symbiotic relationship , ” said Chandrakant D. Patel , the director of H.P. ’s sustainable information technology laboratory , which wrote the report .
“ And having these data centers locally will give farmers a new opportunity . ”
Companies have historically tended to build their large computing centers — often called server farms — in or near large cities and industries .
As this practice has continued over the years , it has become difficult for companies building the largest data centers to find enough cheap electricity and real estate to meet their needs .
We ’ve all been there before , having to do a demo to show the dangers of not patching , or insecure operating systems , and then spending ages configuring a vulnerable host for the demo .
Or even just wanting to set up a host so that you can better familiarize yourself with Metasploit , it takes a while to build a vulnerable machine , in my experience it actually always seems to take me longer to build an insecure machine than a secure one .
The crew over at Metasploit recently released Metasploitable , which is an Ubuntu 8.04 server install as a VMWare image , it includes a number of vulnerable packages , such as tomcat , mysql , tikiwiki , and others .
This is definetely a move in the right direction if you ask me , as this is just the type of thing that I ’ve been looking for , as this is going to save me hours of time , and will be perfect for a lot of my presentation needs , and will also help me to train others up on the many facets of Metasploit .

Annapolis , Maryland ( CNN ) --
For 11 women soon to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy , the school 's bucolic grounds and these warm , sun-washed spring days are about to give way to another world : preparing for life undersea , as the first women to serve on U.S. Navy submarines .
It is difficult to think of a career more arduous than that of a submariner in the U.S. Navy : weeks spent in a high - stress environment , cramped quarters in a craft submerged hundreds of feet below the surface , very few places to go to decompress .
Add to that the fact that , as their ships slip under water on their first cruises , this elite group will be making history as the first officers of their gender assigned to what has long been the all - male community of the submarine fleet .
But they say breaking a gender barrier is far from their minds .
Trained to be leaders and endure the sacrifices that come with that , they say they are focused on the bigger picture .
" I am not doing this to be a trailblazer , " says Marquette Ried of Fort Collins , Colorado .
The words come out as easily as the wide smile she gives when she talks about life after graduation from the Naval Academy this month .
" I see us being just like our male counterparts , and I think we 'll be accepted the same way , " Ried says .
The Navy 's submarine fleet has always been manned by elite crews with top scientific and tactical minds who are able to thrive in a pressure - cooker environment for long periods of time .
It is a tight community , and those who cannot meet the standards are booted out ; those who make it often rise through the ranks and enjoy successful and prosperous careers .
For the history of the modern U.S. Navy , the " silent service , " as submarine duty is nicknamed , has been off limits to women for numerous reasons .
Publicly , the argument has been based on space .
There is very little room on the vessel to accommodate separate facilities for men and women .
In private , many will tell you women do n't belong in such an atmosphere , they can't cut it , and they would be a distraction to male sailors .
The change is the most significant for women in the Navy since 1994 , when the service first let them serve on ships .
The arguments were similar then .
On Thursday the Naval Academy showed off the service 's future , the first class of female submariners .
Do n't bother telling these graduating seniors the arguments .
They know all about what people have been saying , and that has not changed their minds .
Eleven of the nearly 200 women in the academy 's class of 2010 volunteered for submarine training .
All 11 were evaluated and interviewed , as were their male counterparts , and all 11 were told last week they were accepted into the program .
" I think it 's important that we go into this knowing that we will be imposing a little bit of change on the sailors , " says Abigail Gesecki .
" The professionalism is going to show in that they are willing to work with us and for us if they are willing to work for [ male officers ] , " says Laura Martindale .
" Small spaces and other issues might cause some snags , but the professionalism of the force is going to rise to the challenges of this new integration , " she says .
These women are among the best of the best the class of 2010 has to offer .
The 11 women are among the 138 seniors from the academy chosen to enter the submarine training program .
To be selected for this career path , a midshipman must demonstrate an ability to absorb and understand technical sciences as well as be at the top of her game academically .
About 20 female seniors in all will be chosen for the submarine program from 2010 graduating classes at schools across the country .
They will come from the Naval Academy , the collegiate Reserves Officer Training Corps programs , and officer candidate schools , according to Navy officials .
Last fall , Elizabeth Hudson of Plymouth , Massachusetts , began her senior year at the academy with her mind set on joining the Marine Corps upon graduation .
Her poise and bearing are those of an experienced military officer , and it does not take long to pick up on the spirit she carries that would serve her well as a future Marine .
But that is not to be .
Hudson , a systems engineering major , heard about the Navy 's policy change last October , began thinking about what the Navy was looking for , and knew she was qualified .
" I thought of it as my responsibility to volunteer .
I did n't know if it was going to come to fruition ... and it was more of , ' Here is an opportunity , ' and I thought I had some of the requisite skills , " Hudson says .
But when asked why she switched from the Marine Corps to the sub service , she says there is not much of a difference between the two .
" Both are small services , have a sense of camaraderie , extensive and highly specialized training and the sense that you are the best , or most elite in your mission , " she says .
" Obviously one is more physically demanding and one is more intellectually demanding , but here at the Naval Academy our motto is ' morally , mentally and physically , ' so thankfully being here I was able to develop all three of those aspects , " she says .
From a Navy family , Hudson says her father did not regale her with sea stories .
Instead , he instilled in her a need to serve her country , and from an early age she knew she wanted to be in the Navy .
A submariner and an academy grad himself , her father did not fully embrace his daughter 's decision to come to the academy , but he eventually came around -- including supporting her initial decision to join the Marine Corps , she says .
" He thought he was shocked when I got in here [ the academy ] , " she says , laughing .
" He 's up for a new round of that now .
He 's very excited . "
But there are those who are not excited , and she is ready for that .
" There were people that did not want to see us at the Naval Academy , " Hudson says , referring to opposition to women attending the service academies .
" I like to think I am a professional and hope those who have criticisms are also professionals and they wo n't let their concerns hinder their competency and their mission , " Hudson says .
For Ried , the chance to become a member of this first class of female submariners means giving up a future career in another highly competitive field , naval aviation .
As an aerospace engineer and top student at the academy , Ried was one of the select in her graduating class to get a coveted aviator position and have the opportunity to head off to flight school after graduation .
" I was doing my initial flight training and was not enjoying it as much as I thought , " she says .
" The submarine opportunity came along and everything I was looking for was in that community . "
Her eye set on leadership , she came to the academy for the opportunity to lead and become a pilot and make a difference in people 's lives , she explains .
A career in submarines was not originally in the plan .
" It was never anything I looked at until my senior year ; [ then ] this opportunity came up , " she says .
" I wanted that more technical leadership right out of the academy , " adds Ried .
She shows very little concern publicly for what is coming , and says she has had nothing but positive conversations with people .
" There is going to be anxiety around this whole change , but I have had very positive experiences with my classmates and officers , " she says .
" Everybody is really excited about us coming aboard and I have not met a lot of resistance personally , " Ried says .
As graduation at the end of May approaches , Hudson and Ried and their nine classmates in the group are looking forward to what is ahead , but they say there is still a lot of administrative work to be done before they can start sub school .
When it does start , the women will go through an intensive 15 - month submarine officer training program , which includes nuclear power school , submarine training and the Submarine Officer Basic Course .
When the orders come in from the Navy that will start these women 's careers as well as make history , they doubt there will be any regrets about changing the direction they thought they were going .
" I look at it as an opportunity that opened up and I 'll do the best I can and do my job the best I can , " Ried says .
Quite frankly I do n’t know what to say about this .
Watching an oil spill whose size makes the Exxon Valdez accident look like somebody dropped a stick of butter as it gets closer and closer to the shores that still have n’t recovered from the devastation of Katrina is a little like watching a train wreck .
A train needs a certain amount of time to brake to a stop–and that means several miles in the case of a heavy freight train or a fast passenger train .
Any attempt to stop quicker is just simply not going to work because it ’s against the laws of physics .
So you step on the brake in the hope of minimizing the damage and wait for the inevitable crash , watching in horrified fascination as the train gets closer and closer .
In the meantime , the blame game has started .
The Obama administration has blamed it on BP .
BP has blamed it on the contractors in charge of the drilling and on faulty equipment .
Blame the tools !
The media and the right wing have begun blaming Obama for not doing enough to stop the crisis , despite the fact that the federal government had offered help , been turned down and told that the situation was being managed .
They should have stepped right in and taken over , say the people who normally howl over any sort of government interference .
And Sarah Palin has spun on the proverbial dime and has become sooooooo concerned about the environmental issues that you ’d think she ’d never even heard the phrase , “ Drill , Baby , Drill , ” that she led her supporters in chanting throughout the 2008 presidential campaign .
Clearly there is more than enough blame to go around , and I ’ll not exempt the Obama administration for not acting quickly enough .
Sometimes , you need to step up to the plate .
Sometimes , acting quickly is more important than making sure all the p’s are p’s and q ’s are q’s .
But even if it HAD acted faster –is there anything that really could have been done ?
Or was this truly like the train wreck that no matter what you do , no matter how hard you try , no matter how fast you act , that collision is just going to occur and there ai n’t nothing you can do about it .
Obama says that BP is going to pay for it .
No .
The one certain thing in every disaster that has occurred as long as I can remember is that BP will wriggle out of it and pay off at best a token amount that seems big only if you do not take into account the amount of damage this accident will cause .
But it will be paid for … and the people who will pay for it will be ?
US .

Activists on board a six - ship flotilla carrying aid to the Gaza Strip tried to lynch the Israel Navy commandos who boarded their Turkish - flagged boat early Monday , Israel Defense Forces sources told Haaretz on Monday afternoon .
At least nine people were killed and several more were wounded in the fighting that erupted aboard one of the ships .
The IDF confirmed that at least seven Navy commandos had been wounded , two of them seriously , in a fight which apparently broke out after activists tried to seize their weapons .
The commandos , who intercepted the Turkish ferry Mavi Marmara after it ignored orders to turn back from its course to Gaza , said they had encountered violent resistance from activists armed with sticks and knives .
According to the commandos , the activists threw one of the soldiers from the upper deck to the lower after they boarded .
The organizers of the flotilla said the troops opened fire first .
An Israeli military spokesman said some of the commandos were equipped with paintball guns but the non-lethal weapons were not enough against activists who charged in with batons .
" They had pistols with live ammunition as back - up , to defend themselves , " he said .
The IDF said it had confiscated two pistols from the boat .

One of the commandos told reporters he descended by rope from a helicopter onto one of the six ships in the convoy and was immediately attacked by a group of people waiting for them .
" They beat us with metal sticks and knives , " he said .
" There was live fire at some point against us . "
A Reuters cameraman on the Israel Navy ship Kidon , sailing close to the convoy , said IDF commanders monitoring the operation were surprised by the strong resistance put up by the pro-Palestinian activists .
One of the commandos said some of the soldiers were stripped of their helmets and equipment and a several were tossed from the top deck to a lower deck , forcing them to jump into the sea to escape .
" They jumped me , hit me with clubs and bottles and stole my rifle , " one of the commandos said .
" I pulled out my pistol and had no choice but to shoot . "

The soldiers said they were forced to open fire after the activists struck one of their comrades in the head and trampled on him .
A senior IDF field commander ordered the soldiers then to respond with fire , a decision which the commandos said received full backing the military echelon .
The IDF said its rules of engagement allowed troops to open fire in what it called a " life - threatening situation " .
" Navy fighters took control of six ships that tried to violate the naval blockade [ of the Gaza Strip ] , " said a statement from the IDF .
" During the takeover , the soldiers encountered serious physical violence by the protesters , who attacked them with live fire . "
Elite troops from Shayetet 13 , a naval commando unit , boarded the protest boats at around 4:00 A.M.
Al Jazeera reported Monday morning that the Gaza aid flotilla had changed course to avoid a confrontation with Israeli warships .
Some 700 pro-Palestinian activists were on the boats , including 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire of Northern Ireland , European legislators .
The boats were carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid and supplies to Gaza .
The Israel Navy had been operating under the assumption that the activists manning the boats would not heed their calls to turn around , and Israeli troops had been prepared to board the ships to steer them away from the Gaza shores toward the Israeli port city of Ashdod .
Huwaida Arraf , one of the flotilla organizers , said the conv9oy began the journey from international waters off the coast of Cyprus on Sunday afternoon , after two days of delays .
According to organizers , the flotilla had been expected to reach Gaza , about 400 kilometers away , on Monday afternoon , and two more ships had been expected to follow in a second wave .

The fossils were preserved in brightly coloured minerals
Researchers have revealed remarkably well preserved fossils of soft - bodied marine creatures that are between 470 and 480 million years old .
Prior to this find , scientists were unsure whether such creatures died out in an extinction event during an earlier period known as the Cambrian .
The fossils were preserved in rocks formed by layers of ancient marine mud in south - eastern Morocco .
They are described in the latest issue of the journal Nature .
The research team that studied the fossils described them as marine animals that lived during the early part of a period that followed the Cambrian , known as the Ordovician .
Professor Derek Briggs from Yale University in New Haven , US , who was an author of the study , told BBC News that the discovery provided " a much more complete record of early marine life than we 've ever had before " .
The creatures , he explained , closely matched those found in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia , a locality in Yoho National Park , which is famous for yielding rare fossils of soft - bodied marine creatures from the Middle Cambrian period .
" There was an anomaly in the fossil record , " said Dr Peter Van Roy , the lead researcher on the study , who is also based at Yale University .
" Most of these animals just seemed to disappear at the end of the Middle Cambrian . "
The transition between the Cambrian and the Ordovician periods is crucial in evolutionary history .
The " Cambrian explosion " saw the sudden appearance of all the major animal groups .
It was followed by the " great Ordovician biodiversification event " when the number of marine animal groups increased exponentially over a period of 25 million years .
Professor Briggs explained : " [ These specimens have ] shown that some of the organisms that we thought were exclusive to Cambrian actually persisted until the Ordovician . "
Dr Jean - Bernard Caron , a palaeontologist from the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada who was not involved in this study , told BBC News that the discovery was " very exciting " .
He said that the fossil record had never before demonstrated that certain lineages of Cambrian animals survived until this later period .
Preserving life 's record Dr Van Roy created illustrations of the ancient marine creatures
The specimens show that poor fossil preservation , rather than mass extinction , was probably responsible for this gap in the fossil record .
Because hard shells fossilise , and are therefore more readily preserved than soft tissue , scientists had an incomplete and biased view of the marine life that existed during the Ordovician .
But the conditions at this Moroccan site , Professor Briggs explained , were special .
" Very thick " marine muds , he said , were laid down in the deep ocean , trapping the creatures ' bodies below the influence of storms .
These mud layers also excluded oxygen , creating conditions conducive to forming some of the minerals in which fossils are preserved .
Dr Van Roy , who has been working at this site in for around a decade , discovered this particular group of fossils just one year ago .
But he expects to find even more and he and his team have planned further expeditions to Morocco .
" We 're only scratching the surface , " he said .
" I 'm certain there will be more spectacular fossils coming out of this site in the near future . "

Will Americans laugh at a sitcom about outsourcing their jobs to India ?
With our country reeling from the deepest recession and the largest job losses in decades ?
NBC certainly thinks so .
The network just bet big on the premise by picking up the provocatively titled Outsourced as its first new primetime comedy series order for next season .
By tackling such a touchy subject , NBC is guaranteed free publicity because of the inevitable controversy over its new comedy series .
And that may distinguish it in next fall ’s cluttered landscape where more than 90 % of new shows fail .
According to NBC ’s official description , the set - in - India workplace series “ centers on the all - American company Mid America Novelties whose call center has suddenly been outsourced to India and a manager , played by Ben Rappaport , is being transferred to India to run the operation . ”
Supposedly , the socio-economic aspects of exporting American jobs to India are not expected to be front and center story - wise .
Instead , the series is billed as “ the Midwest meets the exotic East in a hilarious culture clash ” .
The sitcom is based on the 2006 romantic comedy by the same name which won the best film award at the 2007 Seattle International Film Festival .
In the movie , a Seattle retail manager Todd Anderson , is told to travel to Gharapuri to train his replacement .
Once there , he encounters a bunker - like call center filled with willing novices who are supposed to learn how to sound American .
( They mispronounce his name “ Toad ” . )
“ Todd just lost his job .
Now he has to find his life …
Call centre chaos …
What really happens at the other end of the line ! ” were some of the movie tag lines .
Todd finds that he must learn about the Indian culture before he can even think of Americanizing his subordinates with help from the new assistant manager who becomes his love interest .
Though the timing of the TV series seems intentional , NBC first developed Outsourced more then 2 years earlier .
That series pilot was initially scripted by Seattleites John Jeffcoat ( director / co- writer of the film ) and George Wing ( co- writer ) .
It was brought back almost by accident by TV / film director Ken Kwapis ( The Office , He ’s Just Not That Into You , License To Wed ) , who developed that project in its first incarnation .
This development season , NBC approached him to helm another pilot , but he urged the execs to revisit Outsourced instead .
This season ’s pilot was given a rewrite by LA - based scribe Robert Borden , and Jeffcoat and Wing told the Seattle Times a few days ago that a credit arbitration is currently ongoing .
Though NBC ’s announcement said only Borden and Kwapis are getting EP credit and the movie ’s writers have no producing credit , the pair told the local media they ’ll be consulting producers for the new series and are negotiating writing and / or directing involvement on the first season .
“ George and I always felt that the show should n’t be a carbon copy of the movie , ” Jeffcoat told the Seattle Times .
“ There are a lot of changes .
The comedy is definitely broader than in the movie , so that ’s going to be interesting to see how people respond to it . ”
Recession - themed comedies were popular last pilot season and one , ABC ’s Hank starring Kelsey Grammer as a Wall Street executive losing his job , made it onto the air — but then lasted only a handful episodes .
In that case , it ’s safe to say the demise came because the show was n’t good , but the recession overtones might have been a contributing factor .
This year , NBC has another hot comedy pilot that touches upon the economic downturn , This Little Piggy , about adult siblings moving in with their older brother after falling on hard times .
But both Hank and Piggy reflect the recession ’s impact on American families , while Outsourced goes to the heart of a sensitive economic and social issue .
Normally , social issues resonate deeper with people in the more conservative middle and southern regions of the country .
But NBC ’s upscale workplace comedies which Outsourced will join , like 30 Rock and The Office , tend to draw most from the more liberal coasts .
But outsourcing is actually a subject that touches a nerve even in largely liberal and open - minded Hollywood .
Sony Pictures
Entertainment recently became the latest studio to ship most of its IT operations to India , resulting in mass layoffs .
And the making of subtitles for American DVDs has now been largely outsourced to India as well .
On the other hand , each broadcast network still has to depend on American audiences to tune into its TV shows for successful ratings .
Because , at least for now , those viewers ca n’t be outsourced .
HOUSTON -- Houston Rockets star Yao Ming is now a father .
The 7 - foot - 6 Yao and his wife , Ye Li , had a baby girl on Friday at a Houston hospital , team spokesman Nelson Luis said .
The couple , who married in August 2007 , did not announce the baby 's name .
She weighed 7 pounds , 9 ounces .
" I am very excited about the arrival of our daughter , " Yao said in a statement .
" This is a very special moment in our lives and we thank everyone for their kindness and support . "
Chinese basketball fans were eager to learn if Yao would have the baby in America or China .
Yao said in March that the birth was a " private " matter .
The baby will be an American citizen since she was born in the U.S .
There was no immediate comment from the Chinese Basketball Association , where Yao started his career .
Yao 's baby could claim Chinese citizenship as the child of Chinese nationals .
However , Chinese law does not recognize dual citizenship .
A number of Chinese celebrities have been criticized for becoming naturalized citizens of other countries .
Chinese are subject to stringent visa requirements , and some of the celebrities argued it was easier to travel internationally with passports from countries such as Singapore or the U.S .
Baby
Yao has captured the imagination of fans in China , and most say they do n't care which country claims the baby .
They wonder about her potential basketball skills with a 7 - 6 father and 6 - 2 mother , who was a center for China .
Yao , who had extensive foot and ankle surgery last summer , is back to running on a treadmill and expects to resume full basketball activity by the end of the month .

How much is Ozzy Osbourne worth ?
Net Worth : $ 240 Million Profession : Professional Rock Star Date of Birth : December 3 , 1948 Country : England Height :
1.78 m
About Ozzy Osbourne
John Michael Osbourne , also know by his nickname Ozzy is a native of Great Britain .
He was born in 1948 and is one of the most important figures in the history of heavy metal music .
Later in life , he also starred in a few reality shows centered around the life of him and his family .
He has received numerous lifetime achievement awards and was inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame .
Ozzy rose from a hard - working , humble background .
Both of his parents were factory workers .
It was this sort of upbringing , class continuous way of thinking that would inspire many of the lyrics of his first few albums .
He was abused as a child by school bullies .
In his teen years , he was diagnosed with dyslexia .
Even with such a disability , he was drawn to the stage at an early age .
Even in his school days , he performed in various plays .
He cites the first time he heard the Beatles on the radio as a Eureka moment in his life .
From that moment on he knew music is what he wanted to do with his life .
As of 2020 , Ozzy Osbourne has an estimated net worth of $ 240 million dollars .
What makes him so successful ?
The success of a potentially self - destructive person as Ozzy Osbourne can be described in three ways , a talent for music , being an interesting personality on which a few reality TV shows can be built , and marrying the right woman .
From his earliest days , everyone knew that Ozzy had plentiful musical talent .
He honed and worked on those aspects of his life .
He had a unique and powerful voice and found a band that could capitalize on his gifts .
Not that his musical career was without hiccups .
There were plenty of disagreements and creative differences with plenty of his band mates but he still managed to forge a highly successful career .
Due to his life being so eventful , and him being very eccentric , he was able to capitalize on that as well and be a star of numerous reality TV shows .
One could even argue that his first reality show , based on the life of his family , created a template for future family - based shows .
But all of that would be for nothing if he did n’t have Sharon , his voice of reason , his rock , his sanctuary .
How did Ozzy Osbourne get so rich ?
Black Sabbath rock band was a major success , to the amazement and surprise of everyone involved .
They got fame , recognition by both fans and critics as early as their first album .
But as Ozzy stated , their only problem was that the band was n’t very popular with women .
But , during those days , Ozzy would meet his future wife Sharon .
She is the rock upon which a large part of his success , especially later in life is built upon .
Without her support , he would probably burn out and succumb to the demons of drugs and alcohol … as many of that era did .
Their next two albums would be divisive .
The critics would hate them , and the public would adore them .
Both the second and third albums peaked at the Top Ten in the UK and US .
And both albums reach Gold status in just a couple of weeks .
As they stayed longer together and created more music , Black Sabbath got even the critics on their side .
Their 3rd , 4th and 5th albums were a success both critically and commercially .
But there were problems brewing all around .
Ozzy and fellow band member Tommy Iommi were always fighting .
Ozzy ’s behavior was really eccentric and borderline criminal at times .
His use of alcohol and drugs was peaking and he was becoming less and less reliable .
After a fight where Iommi knocked out Ozzy , he split with the band .
As he stated many times , after the split with the bend he spent the time doing coke and drinking as much alcohol as he could .
Eventually , he recovered and got this life sort of in order and formed his own band .
One of the highlights of his solo career is without a doubt the song Crazy Train .
Apart from
Ozzy ’s singing , the song is characterized by one of the greatest guitar solo ’s ever performed .
All in all , when you combine the sales of both his solo albums and the sales of Black Sabbath , he has sold over 100 million copies .
Later in life , and especially during the 2000s , he became more famous as a reality star .
The first reality TV show that he was on was , The Osbournes , which followed the eccentric lives of him , his wife Sharon , and their two kids Kelly and Jack .
The show aired on MTV for a couple of seasons .
In the 2010s he and his son created a reality TV show called Ozzy and Jack World DeTour .
We calculate that between his record sales and reality TV appearances , Ozzy Osbourne is worth about $ 240 million dollars in 2020 .
Why is he so famous ?
Ozzy worked odd jobs while trying to work on his musical career .
Geezer , Butler wanted his as a vocalist for his new band , Rare Breed .
Ozzy accepted , but that band only lasted for two shows and broke up .
But after a while , they got back together and formed the band that would eventually make them famous , Black Sabbath .
This band would define their lives and careers , as well as the history of rock music .
It went from a heavy blues band to the first , and some claim archetypal heavy metal bands of the 70s and 80s .
They drew their inspiration from anything occultist , or the dark aspects of the human psyche .
Nobody , not even their record label thought that they would be much of a success .
But they were all wrong .
From their first album onward , Black Sabbath , with Ozzy Osbourne at their helm , was a force that would change the music world forever .
Summing - Up
For someone born in a small factory town in England , Ozzy Osbourne had lived a remarkable life .
He was part of a band that changed the history of music forever .
In addition to that , he helped perfect a reality TV genre that was still in its infancy .
One of the greatest rock vocalists will truly be remembered for ages , both for his contribution to the music community , as well as his unique persona .
A diverse group of businesses have joined in a class - action suit brought against Yelp for aggressive ad sales that the plaintiffs say amount to extortion .
Yelp has made some changes to its features in an attempt to " clarify " how advertising affects a business listed on the site , though lawyers for the plaintiffs say that it does n't directly address the practices that led to the lawsuit .
In February , a veterinary hospital in Long Beach , California accused Yelp of attempting to extort expensive advertising contracts from the company in exchange for removing false reviews left for the company on Yelp .
Lawyers for the hospital filed a federal class - action lawsuit in California after discovering that numerous other businesses had recounted similar problems in articles published last year in the Chicago Tribune , the Wall Street Journal , and in particular the East Bay Express .
Yelp 's terms of service forbid leaving reviews with false information , but businesses have had little success in getting such reviews removed .
Instead ,
Yelp relies on a secret filter ostensibly meant to identify both positive and negative reviews that are left in bad faith , e.g. , reviews left by employees of the business to raise ratings , or negative reviews left by people that have n't even visited the business .
In March , lawyers in the case filed an amended complaint after nine other businesses joined as plaintiffs , all citing specific instances of Yelp ad sales representatives making repeated attempts to sell ad contracts .
Ad representatives promised positive reviews from " Yelp Elites " — heavy users of the site with favored status — in exchange for advertising , or threatened negative reviews from Yelp Elites if they did not .
Many businesses experienced negative reviews that often contained false information or personal attacks on business owners after declining to advertise .
Such reviews violate Yelp 's terms of service , as previously mentioned , but were not removed .
Today , Yelp told The New York Times that it was making some changes to its website to address the numerous complaints from small businesses .
It will no longer let businesses that advertise on Yelp choose a review to " highlight " by always making it appear first .
It will also allow users to click a link and read reviews that have been " filtered " by Yelp 's secret algorithm , though those reviews wo n't affect a business ' overall rating .
" I hope that these changes will debunk some of the myths and conspiracy theories out there about Yelp and its advertising and whether those are linked , " Jeremy Stoppelman , cofounder and CEO of Yelp , told NYT .
Stoppelman has long maintained that the problem is n't Yelp , but merely confusion on the part of business owners that rely on positive Yelp feedback to keep customers coming through the door .
" It will underscore the point that it really is and has always been a level playing field for businesses , and will showcase the unique challenge we face , in certain situations where it 's obvious businesses are trying to change ratings , " he said .
These changes are a good first step , but do n't go far enough according to the lawyers that represent the plaintiffs .
" Small businesses have been expressing their outrage at Yelp ’s dirty business practices for a long time , and it is unfortunate that it took the filing of a class action to get Yelp to make even these amends , " attorney Jared Beck said in a statement .
" It does n't really address the concerns brought up in the lawsuit — that Yelp effectively extorts money from businesses by threatening negative reviews if they do n't pay for advertising on the site , " attorney Greg Westin told Ars .
We attempted to contact some of the businesses cited in the lawsuit for comment , but none wanted to go on the record , citing threats and harassment for participating in the suit .
Other business owners
Ars spoke to confirmed being on the receiving end of the actions described in the lawsuit .
Yelp is a helpful site when trying to find a good restaurant or store to try , especially if you are just visiting or are new to an area .
But its usefulness depends on whether or not you can trust the reviews and ratings left by its users .
If the reviews are being manipulated to encourage business owners to buy advertising , the trust relationship is broken .
Users , businesses , and Yelp alike could all benefit from more transparency in how Yelp 's filtering works and how ratings are displayed on a business ' page .
Latino hip - hop legends Cypress Hill have canceled a concert scheduled for next week at the Rialto Theatre in Tucson to protest Arizona 's controversial immigration law .
A post that went up Monday on their Web site reads :
" In a show of resistance to the criminalization of immigrant communities and in opposition to SB1070 , recently signed into Arizona legislation , Cypress Hill has elected to cancel a performance scheduled in Tucson for May 21 , 2010 .
This decision was made in an effort to show support and solidarity with those , undocumented and otherwise , being directly affected by this unconstitutional ' law . '
Cypress
Hill recognizes those living in the struggle for their basic civil rights .
Rise Up ! "
It should be noted that " Rise Up " is also the name of Cypress Hill 's first album in six years , which hit the charts last month at No. 19 .
The theater 's general manager , Curtis McCrary , told the Tucson Sentinel he understood Cypress Hill 's stance but tried to talk them into voicing their concerns onstage .
" It 's a completely unjust law , " he said .
" And one of the worst things about this law is that it 's bad for business . "
Tucson Weekly has posted a copy of the plea McCrary sent to Cypress Hill , urging them to reconsider .

Pharmaceutical companies are ingenious in all the different ways they pump drugs into the system .
The best known techniques include buying medical experts to put their names on articles written by the drug companies which can then be placed in medical journals ; or hosting small casual dinners of docs to tell them about supposedly new and proven but still off - label uses for drugs .
Docs get asked to come along for wonderful vacations with the dealers .
They get great money making speeches .
Adriane Fugh - Berman , a Georgetown University doctor and colleague of mine on Pharmedout.org , drives the pushers nuts with her research and writing exposing their underworld .
She has published a new article in the Boston Review setting out a basically unknown and genius way that Big Pharma makes a killing .
In addition to buying docs , the drugsters invent or exaggerate diseases .
They then pump knowledge about the creepy new condition into the medical world through a process known as Continuing Medical Education , or CME .
This is how docs and health care professionals are supposed to keep abreast of new developments in their field .
It works like this :
CME is the pharmaceutical industry ’s most important marketing tool .
Through a largely unnoticed process that plays out over a course of years , the pharmaceutical industry uses CME — which , unlike other forms of drug promotion , is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) — to prepare the market for new drugs , expand existing markets , position products against competitors , and promote unproven uses of treatments .
Here ’s how it works .
Pharmaceutical - company employees , or specialized vendor services , identify opinion leaders — influential ( or up - and - coming ) health - care professionals at academic medical centers .
Physicians are the primary target , but as nurse - practitioners and physician assistants become increasingly important in primary care , these hidden prescribers are also being targeted .
Industry ’s influence on NPs and PAs has not received enough attention ; for example , the recently passed Physician Payments Sunshine
Act requires that pharmaceutical companies disclose payments made to physicians , but not those made to other prescribers .
Selected opinion leaders are wooed , perhaps over an expensive one - on - one meal with a company researcher or executive — not someone identified with marketing .
In the course of discussing the opinion leader ’s work , the industry representative will elicit his or her opinions on a variety of topics , including the “ disease state ” of interest .
Opinion leaders whose perspectives align with a company ’s marketing goals are then courted .
A company may nurture relationships with targeted health - care professionals over many years and will pay them to educate their peers at CME events and other settings .
Industry - paid speakers frequently deny espousing marketing messages .
I ’ve heard many physicians justify their pharma - funded speaking gigs by saying , “ I never emphasize their product ” or , triumphantly , “ I do n’t even mention their drug ! ”
But these comments only highlight their sales skills .
Pharma does n’t hire doctors to sell drugs ; that ’s a drug rep ’s job .
Pharma hires physicians to sell diseases .

It provides recent developments in the drug business , a lengthy bibliography of blogs and sources of information as well as a few videos of drug reps spilling the beans and telling how the business works inside out .

Norma Gamble was cooking dinner in her Mid-City home Sunday evening when she heard a gunshot from upstairs .
She ran to the second floor , where a teenage boy who had been living with the family and two teenage girls were hanging out .
She found one of the girls on the floor , bleeding profusely from a bullet wound to her lower back .
“ My stomach hurts , ” said the 15 - year - old .
“ Help me . ”
Paramedics took the girl from the home in the 1800 block of Wellington Road to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , where she was pronounced dead .
Los Angeles Police Department detectives Monday were still trying to piece together what happened .
But detectives said the 16 - year - old boy had been discussing Russian roulette and was loading and unloading a revolver as the girls watched .
Detectives said one of the girls became uneasy as the boy kept playing with the gun .
The girl , identified by the L.A. County coroner ’s office as Alexis Wallace , stood to leave the room .
As she was walking out , the boy pointed the gun at her and pulled the trigger , not realizing that there was a bullet in the chamber , police said .
When Gamble came across the bloody scene , she said , the boy was distraught , running around the room in a “ chaotic state . ”
“ The gun just went off , ” he said in disbelief , throwing the weapon onto his bed .
“ What do you mean ?
We do n’t own any guns , ” Gamble replied .
The boy had recently arrived at the two - story home on a tree - lined street in the historic Lafayette Square section of Mid-City .
Gamble said her brother , who lives with her in the home , was a close family friend of the boy and his mother , who lives in Compton .
He decided to take the boy in , hoping the move would keep him out of trouble .
The teenager ’s father had been absent for years , the Gamble family said .
The family was hoping to give the boy a strong set of role models , and a safer neighborhood to live in .
They described him as polite and peaceful .
“ My brother had taken him in to give him a second chance , try and turn his life around .
Teach him there ’s more to life than what he ’d seen : gangs , drugs , violence .
You come here , you work hard , this is what you can achieve , ” said Byron Gamble , 53 , another of Norma Gamble ’s brothers .
The boy , whose name was not released because of his age , was booked and taken to Central Juvenile Hall , where he is being held without bail .
When Norma Gamble saw the scene in the bedroom Sunday night , she immediately called police and applied pressure to the girl ’s wound .
The other teenage girl ran down the stairs .
Gamble ’s niece later found her sitting in the middle of the street .
The suspected shooter was on his way out of the house when police arrived .
They stopped him and handcuffed him , Gamble family members said .
About a dozen relatives of the dead girl arrived at the home .
Gamble said the girl ’s mother was frantic .
“ Do you know my daughter is only 15 ? ” Gamble recalled the mother saying .
“ And now she ’s dead . ”
On Monday morning a large bloodstain remained on the bare mattress in the boy ’s room .
Gamble had thrown away the linens because they were soaked .

Major Labels Begin Major Astroturfing Campaign To Get 3 Strikes In The US
from the begin - astroturfing - now ... dept
I 've received hundreds of e-mails enthusiastically reacting to my " call to action " at the National Association of Recording Merchandisers convention last month .
The music business is facing huge challenges from piracy and theft .
Never before in American history has an entire industry been so decimated by illegal behavior .
Yet the government has not responded in a meaningful way to help us address this crisis .
My call to action is for all of us to become more aggressive in lobbying our government , more outspoken in drawing attention to the problems caused by piracy and more actively engaged .
We cannot win this fight alone .
Governments outside the U.S. are legislating , regulating and playing a prominent role in discussions with ISPs ( Internet Service Providers ) .
Sales have dramatically improved in these countries .
How is it that the U.S. - with the most successful music community in the world - is not keeping up with places like South Korea , France , the UK and New Zealand ?
As I said in my speech , I hope that the industry can negotiate a voluntary deal with the ISPs .
We need our government representatives to encourage this .
But whether or not we reach a deal with the ISPs , our government needs to know that we 've got a piracy problem and we need real solutions .
To accomplish this , our government needs to hear from all of us , so they know that their constituents are out here .
Join me in calling on our elected officials to fight piracy .
Please help by forwarding this email to your colleagues , friends - everyone who loves music .
And consider enlisting your entire company to help in this fight .
Then by clicking on the link below a message will be sent to your representatives in Washington .
Help us launch a viral campaign to cut off access to the online sites that are used to steal our music , our property and our jobs .
In only takes a second but it can make a tremendous impact .
" Music rights now " is a community of individuals who believe music has value and is worthy of protection from online theft .
We are songwriters , artists , musicians , recording studio engineers , managers , retailers , record company employees , publishers , performing rights organization employees , music producers , truck drivers , lawyers , stylists , music video directors , laborers , photographers , graphic designers , DJs , radio employees , music fans -- and countless others ' who have joined together to fight for the survival of artistry and the music industry .
The unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted music is JUST AS ILLEGAL AS SHOPLIFTING A CD .
Sharing music on peer - to - peer networks like Ares , BitTorrent , Gnutella , Limewire , and Morpheus is against the law .
The rules are very simple .
Unless you own the copyright , it 's not yours to distribute .

A friend just forwarded me an email " from " the CEO of Universal Music ( really from an email marketing campaign system if you look at the headers ) that encourages him to push for new laws in the US to kick people offline for file sharing .
To date , the RIAA and others in the recording industry have known better than to seriously push for a three strikes - type legislation in the US , knowing that it is a battle that they very well might lose .
They had hoped , quite strongly , that various ISPs would come to simply agree to implement a three strikes plan to kick people offline after three accusations ( not convictions ) of copyright infringement .
But it 's been nearly a year and a half since the RIAA believed those deals were close , and there 's still nothing to show for it .
Nothing .
So , it looks like the industry is going to plan B : which is going back to trying to ram through legislation that will require ISPs to take the draconian step of protecting one industry 's broken business model .
And to get this going , it looks like the industry has set up a neat little set of astroturfing groups and " consumer " campaigns that try to hide the specifics , but clearly are designed to get similar three strikes legislation ( similar to the Digital Economy Act in the UK ) put in place in the US .
The letter starts out by making it sound like a populist sort of deal :
Note the choice of language .
" Hundreds of emails " is his way of suggesting that there 's a groundswell of public support .
But , for what kind of " call to action " ?
Ah , the one where we ask the government to protect Universal Music 's business model .
Amusingly enough , atNARM , I gave a presentation on all sorts of ways that the industry could thrive through adopting new business models .
I was told that two RIAA members specifically asked the conference not to let me speak , and while I do not believe anyone from Universal Music attended my speech , they did have incredibly scantily clad models standing outside the door inviting people to go to a party .
Perhaps instead of partying and lobbying the government , you could have looked at what 's actually working , instead of complaining that nothing will work .
And here we go .
Note that the four countries named all put in place forms of " three strikes " legislation recently to kick file sharers off the internet based on accusations , not convictions .
By naming those four countries , the letter is implicitly calling for support for three strikes legislation requiring ISPs to try to prop up Universal 's failing business model .
And here we go .
The call to make this into a " viral " campaign .
Well , let 's look at the details .
While Universal uses some nasty " spy on your clickthrough " HTML attempts to hide the actual sites it 's sending you to , it 's not difficult to figure out more details on this campaign .
The first place they want you to go is to a website for MusicRightsNow.org , which automatically forwards you to a Facebook page .
Facebook page ?
Why that looks all grassrootsy and made by " the people " right ?
Not a recording industry front at all !
It even includes a neat little inclusive manifesto claiming to represent everyone : Except , of course , infringement is not " theft " and a grassroots group of folks getting together to " fight for the survival of artistry and the music industry " do n't get the CEO of Universal Music to announce their coming out party .
As for the " survival of artistry and the music industry , " as we were just pointing out , both are doing fantastic .
More music is being created and consumed than ever before .
More money is being spent and made on the music industry than ever before .
In fact , it really seems like the only people who are suffering happen to work at a few companies that have refused to adapt with the times ... like the major record labels .
So , can we cancel this campaign ?
It looks like the actualis doing great .
But , let 's explore further .
So who 's actually behind " Music Rights Now " ?
Well , the Facebook breadcrumbs lead to Music United -- a long term recording industry front group that was mocked mercilessly nearly a decade ago , for its incredibly lame attempts to " speak the language of kids today " to teach them that file sharing is bad .
It does n't look like things have improved much .
The front page points to a widely debunked study ( which it refers to as " credible " ) claiming that file sharing has cost $ 12.5 dollars to the US economy and has killed 70,000 jobs .
Then there 's this fun bit of misleading propaganda :
A bit out of date there on the list of file sharing networks , of course .
Also , " just as illegal " is a bit misleading .
Both are , in fact , illegal , but under very , very different laws .
But the key point is that they 're wrong .
Making a blanket statement that " sharing music on peer - to - peer networks ... is against the law , " is flat out wrong .
It would be news to all of the musicians we know who encourage their work be shared online .
The web page also claims that " Digital theft is killing the music business . "
Again , the evidence we just pointed to yesterday shows that music is doing better than ever .
Of course , in the fine print , we get the list of who 's behind this .
It includes all the usual suspects : the RIAA , the NMPA , ASCAP , SESAC , SoundExchange , the SGA , A2IM , BMI , AFTRA and a variety of other smaller organizations that represent labels and publishers .
Consumer groups ?
Nope .
Of course not .
This is not , after all , a consumer driven effort .
It 's just designed to look like one .
Either way , it seems clear that the industry is realizing that ISPs are n't going to agree to kick people offline based on accusations , so it 's kicking off a well - coordinated campaign to get the government to help , and pressure it to put in place the same sort of overly draconian protectionist measures that do n't actually help musicians or the music industry -- but clearly try to prop up the failed and dying business model of a few middlemen .
Not surprisingly , this seems well - timed to go with the expected release this week of the report from the White House 's IP Enforcement Coordinator ( IP Czar ) , Victoria Espinel ....
How much do people want to bet her report also fits in with propping up those businesses ?

( CNN ) -- Scientists do n't know why , but one of Jupiter 's two main cloud belts has disappeared -- again .
Like a wayward pet , the belt has gone missing before and has always returned .
" This is a big event , " said planetary scientist Glenn Orton of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab .
" We 're monitoring the situation closely and do not yet fully understand what 's going on . "
The brown cloudy band , known as the South Equatorial Belt , or SEB , started fading late last year , NASA said in a story on its website .
" But I certainly did n't expect to see it completely disappear , " said amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley of Australia .
" Jupiter continues to surprise . "
Orton says the belt may not be gone , just hidden under higher clouds .
" It 's possible , " he said on the NASA website , " that some ' ammonia cirrus ' has formed on top of the SEB , hiding the SEB from view . "
On Earth , NASA says , white wispy cirrus clouds are made of ice crystals .
On Jupiter , the same sort of clouds can form , but the crystals are made of ammonia instead of water .
The belt 's disappearances can be erratic .
" The SEB fades at irregular intervals , most recently in 1973 - 75 , 1989 - 90 , 1993 , 2007 , 2010 , " said John Rogers , director of the British Astronomical Association 's Jupiter Section .
" The 2007 fading was terminated rather early , but in the other years , the SEB was almost absent , as at present . "
The return of the SEB can be dramatic , NASA said .
" We can look forward to a spectacular outburst of storms and vortices when the ' SEB revival ' begins , " Rogers told NASA .
" It always begins at a single point , and a disturbance spreads out rapidly around the planet from there , often becoming spectacular even for amateurs eyeballing the planet through medium - sized telescopes .
" However , " he said , " we ca n't predict when or where it will start .
On historical precedent , it could be any time in the next two years . "
" I 'll be watching every chance I get , " Wesley said .
" The revival will likely be sudden and dramatic , with planet - circling groups of storms appearing over the space of just a week or so . "
Jupiter , the largest planet in the solar system , is visible in the eastern sky before dawn , NASA said .
Can we take a step back , please ?
And consider some of the claims that are being made right now by politicians and pundits alike ?
1 ) The Tories are claiming that they " won " .
This is nonsense .
In a hung parliament , by definition , no party can claim " victory " .
In the British system , you win only when you have a majority in the Commons .
Cameron failed to get one .
2 ) A Lab - Lib coalition government would not be unrepresentative of public opinion .
On the contrary , the two parties combined would have the support of 53 per cent of voters .
This is the " anti-Conservative " majority that Labour ministers and officials keep refering to .
Remember : no government since the Second World War has ever been elected with more than 50 per cent of the vote .
3 ) Gordon Brown is " defying " the public and " clinging on " to office .
Not true .
Brown is following consitutional precedent , which ensures continuity of government and gives the prime minister the right to stay on and try to form a coalition that has the confidence of parliament .
Brown is behaving as ( the Tory ) Edward Heath behaved in February 1974 .
4 ) The country wants strong government , which is single - party government .
Really ?
Why then did the voters not give any one of the three major parties a majority in parliament ?
The reality is that coalitions can be stronger and more effective than single - party administrations -- even in the eyes of the markets .
Ten of the 16 governments that enjoy triple - A credit ratings are coalitions .
Seven of the largest fiscal consolidations carried out in OECD countries since 1970 occurred under coalition governments .
5 ) Labour is interested in party advantage ; the Tories are concerned about the national interest .
Rubbish !
As the Telegraph reported this week , the Tories are willing to bribe the Unionist parties in Ulster with up to £ 200 m of taxpayers ' cash in the form of postponed public spending cuts in the province .
Is this putting the nation first , or is it partisan and self - interested deal - making of the grubbiest kind ?

I suspect that they are doing a pre-launch worst - case - scenario drill to see what would happen if they came under some sort of a DDOS cyber - attack !
They get one in - house team to attack and another to then defend and try to keep the connection up .
As of now , the latter team is losing .
You see ... they can get valuable information from this and may become more prepared for this type of scenario should a corporate gaming competitor ( i.e. Microsoft ) try to embarrass them when the game gets out of beta .
Or , perhaps a member of some triad cyber - gang is about to lose a wager on a match and so he has his friends try and pull the plug on the whole network ?!
If you are Blizzard , you have to be prepared for these kinds of things !
And , at the same time , they can see how many people will keep trying to play despite the futility .
They can see what this event does to their ratings system perhaps .
But , mostly , they can generally try to figure out how to deal with similar problems when they pop up later .
This is all very serious business people -- mucho dollaro$ .

Yeah , right .
Since everyone seems to be having trouble finding a game or staying in one ( related in some way to " S2MASTER_SERVER_ERROR_INVALID_DATA " ) , I started wondering ...
If this was related to the latest patch , would n't it have presented these problems earlier ?
And could n't they just shut down battle .
net for a while and roll back a few of the latest changes ?
Maybe , maybe not .
But they are keeping battle .
net up while obsessed players continuously try to join games which they will be booted from even if they do .
So , even if the Blizzard technicians do n't know what the problem is , you 'd think they might shut things down and reboot more or less .
Curiously , that 's not what the Blizzard staff is choosing to do .
Therefore ...
I think it 's fairly obvious that we are being used as guinea pigs !

Terran are the plague !
Mother June Shannon is selling her Georgia home and moving into an RV with her beau , Geno Doak .
It was accounted for before that the previous unscripted television mother destroyed her about 3,300 square foot house and sold every last bit of her assets .
Court records got by WOACB obviously showed m that Mama June and her beau may escape warrants from Alabama for an as of now dynamic criminal case .
Prior to the month , June Shannon facilitated an online carport deal on Facebook .
The unscripted television star had all the earmarks of being selling almost every last bit of her assets .
She posted things going from laps , old fashioned furnishings and child apparatus to dolls , gadgets , holders , and skateboards .
During her online carport deal , a news source acquired a video from inside the home .
The house showed up wrecked .
A few rooms looked void while different zones were destroyed .
Geno and June talked inconsistently about a thing available to be purchased as a supporter got them on record .
A couple of days , Mama June and Geno Doak stopped a huge dumpster close to the front yard of the home .
Individuals started to hypothesize that the couple was looking to sell the house .
Mom June purportedly told neighbors and companions that she and Geno were selling the home .
Furthermore , she conceded the two proposed to buy an RV and travel around the United States .
The majority of this comes at an odd time for the unscripted television mother .
June Shannon is as of now dealing with indictments for medication ownership in Alabama .
Geno Doak has numerous charges identified with medications and abusive behavior at home from capture in spring 2019 .
Court records gotten by WOACB notice that June has not shown up in court since March .
In May , her lawyer documented a movement to be pulled back from the case .
In the archive , lawyer George B. Bulls II expressed that endeavors to arrive in June had fizzled .
Also , the lawyer said that June was not able to consent to the understanding she marked with him .
Therefore , the judge expelled her lawyer from the case .
Despite the fact that this is a functioning case , there are no dates recorded for her preliminary .
Records from August show that the court sent June a notice that her lawyer has been expelled from the case .
Be that as it may , the records do n’t list the following date for her hearing , however , she is put under the “ reprobate ” status .
Moreover , a warrant was sent for her capture .
With Geno and June both neglecting to show up in court in Alabama , the two could well intend to escape indictment .
Realizing the couple is in a profound dependence on rocks , getting away with tomfoolery with the cops could be an ideal catastrophe waiting to happen .
Here ’s a good side - by - side comparison showing the viewable difference between the new MacBook Pro hi-res screen option and the standard display .
The new 2010 MacBook Pro 15 ″ model with optional high - resolution screen running at 1680 ×1050 sits on the left , alongside an older MacBook Pro with the standard 15 ″ display running at 1440×900 on the right .
Note the additional visible images and information on the high resolution screens display .
Thank you Andrew for pointing us to the pictures over at MacRumors forums , check out the thread if you want to see the full resolution shots .
The original poster has this to say about the screens :
1 ) The difference in resolution is very noticeable ; especially websites with a lot of text or images ; if the site has a lot of white space and they are not coded to stay together , then there is even more white space .
2 ) The color is alright , but the brightness seems a bit dimmer than the older anti glare ; I have both set to the same brightness and both have been calibrated with a Huey Pro. 3 ) The vertical viewing angles still sucks ; it ’s a TN panel , so I ’m not surprised ; look like the older one .
I tried taking a picture of this , but my P&S is also a POS .
4 ) Horizontal angles are also like the older one .
I took a picture , but I do n’t if you can tell , but the high - resolution one looks a bit yellow from the right
It ’s worth mentioning that both of the MacBook Pro ’s featured in the pictures are also the antiglare screen model , which is why the black bezel and glass is n’t seen .
In fact , you ca n’t get a new MacBook Pro 15 ″ with an antiglare screen unless you also get the hi-res screen upgrade .
The classic glass & black bezel screen is available at both standard resolution and HD models though .
If you ’re shopping for a new MacBook Pro , Amazon offers the new models at 3 % to 5 % discounts depending on the model , with free shipping included .
Update : also from MacRumors , here ’s a picture of the new MacBook Pro 15 ″ high - res anti-glare matte screen version vs the new MacBook Pro standard res glossy version .
Never mind the Champions League Trophy .
The main prize at stake on Saturday night in the Bernabeu Stadium when Inter Milan face Bayern Munich in the Champions League Final is guaranteed membership of the very exclusive club started by Jock Stein in 1967 .
Membership of this club is restricted to coaches whose team win the big one , the European Cup or Champions League , as well as their own domestic double of League and Cup .
Stefan Kovacs the Romanian coach was the next to join in 1972 when he coached the magnificent Ajax team of Cruyff , Neeskens and Rep to this triple feat , coincidentally also beating Inter Milan in the Final ..
It would be another 16 years before a further member was admitted when Guus Hiddink ’s PSV Eindhoven achieved the feat in 1988 .
In 1999 Alex Ferguson became the second Scot to join when Manchester United achieved their treble .
And not until last year , 2009 , was a fifth member admitted when Pep Guardiola achieved it in his first season as a top class manager .
While Jock Stein ’s Celtic also won the League Cup and the Glasgow Cup that incredible season of 1966 - 67 , the normal European pattern of having only the League and Cup to compete for , will ensure that only the domestic double is needed to apply for full membership of this elite club .
With only 5 members in over 54 years of the European Cup / Champions League it is clearly a very exclusive club and ensures the Big Man will always be in exalted company .
It can never be taken away from Stein and the Lisbon Lions that they were the first coach and the first team ever to achieve this remarkable treble .
Both Jose Mourinho and Luis Van Gaal have already completed the first two legs of this treble , with wins in both domestic league and cup with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich respectively .
So whoever of them is triumphant on Saturday night will be guaranteed instant entry to this elite club founded by Jock Stein .
Van Gaal and Mourinho are already the sole members of one exclusive club and on Saturday night one of them will join another small group which currently also only has two members .
GGW pointed out last month , before the Quarter Finals , that Van Gaal and Mourinho are the only two managers ever to have won the Champions League with clubs outside the ‘ Might is Right ’ top 20 group of richest clubs ( With respectively Ajax in 1995 and Porto in 2004 ) and therefore it would be no surprise if either of them were to repeat the feat with their current much better resourced clubs .
Winning the Champions League with a second club will entitle Saturday ’s winning coach to join Ernst Happel and Ottmar Hitzfeld as the only coaches to have ever lifted the European Cup / Champions League with more than one club .
Happel was the manager who denied Stein a second victory in 1970 when he coached Feyenoord to victory over the Big Man ’s meek Milan Mice , and then in 1983 he took Kevin Keegan ’s Hamburg team to victory over Juventus .
Hitzfeld triumphed with two different German clubs , a Borussia Dortmund team including Paul Lambert in 1997 and Bayern Munich in 2001 .
So which of the two would be the better candidate to join Stein ’s collection of managerial giants .
Van Gaal would probably be the new member closer in style and spirit to the Big Man who would probably have disapproved of much of Mourinho ’s shenanigans .
Van Gaal has an impressive record as a coach winning league titles in three countries as well as his Champions League and UEFA Cup success with Ajax .
He found the task of managing Barcelona a difficult one despite inheriting and keeping an interpreter , young Mourinho , ho turned out to be something of a coach in waiting .
In two spells with Barcelona Van Gaal won 2 leagues and a Cup not a bad record but he could not do what he was hired to do , and emulate fellow Dutchman Johan Cruyff who in 1992 finally managed to take Barcelona to the European Cup success they so craved ever since deadly domestic rivals Real Madrid won the first one in 1956 .
Last season Van Gaal gave clear proof that he was still a coach of considerable merit when he guided small town club AZ Alkmaar to a first ever Dutch League title .
That impressive feat earned him another opportunity at the very top level when the club ranked 4th in the Might is Right League , Bayern Munich appointed him as the man to lead their challenge for the 2010 Champions League .
Like 1st and 2nd ranked Might is Right clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona , Bayern exercised that financial might in summer 2009 spending around 90 million euros in bringing in no less than 8 top players .
It took Van Gaal some time to settle in at Bayern and turn them into his team , playing in his style to his commands .
He immediately jettisoned Brazil captain Lucio who was snapped up by Saturday ’s opponents Inter for whom he has been an outstanding defender all season .
He also fell out with Luca Toni , probably the best traditional centre forward in the world in his prime and still a fine forward .
Toni was shipped out to Roma in the winter transfer window and helped them come very close to denying Inter their domestic successes , pushing them hard in both the league and the cup .
He relegated both other star forwards Klose and Mario Gomez to the bench in favour of a young eager runner Thomas Muller and workhouse Croat forward Ivica Olic .
These words “ eager runner ” and “ workhorse ” say a great deal about Van Gaal ’s Bayern but he also found room for both Ribery and Robben , on the few occasions when both were fit and available .
Together they became “ Robbery ” a combination of exciting attacking wide forwards who stole the hearts of Bayern supporters .
Apart from their undoubted flair and class , Van Gaal ’s Bayern are efficient rather than inspiring , a hard team to beat but a hard team to love .
Every GGW reader will be well familiar with Jose Mourinho and his successes with Porto , Chelsea and Inter Milan .
Which Celtic supporter can ever forget that it was Mourinho ’s Porto team that denied Celtic the UEFA Cup in 2003 before making Celtic supporters feel slightly better by going on to win the Champions League the following year .
He transformed Chelsea into one of the top clubs in the world before heading for Milan and winning the Italian League two years in succession .
His tactical triumphs against Chelsea and Barcelona in this year ’s Champions League knock - out stages have confirmed his reputation as the top tactical manager on the world stage and should ensure he gets the chance next season at Real Madrid to win trophies in Spain and restore Real Madrid as kings of Europe .
Mourinho gets an undeserved reputation as a coach of defensive teams .
But his Inter Milan had the nerve to use three forwards against both Chelsea and Barcelona when the likes of Manchester United struggled with one .
It is fairer to say that his teams tend to be superbly organised defensively .
But defence is an important part of football and confidence in defence allows his teams to play forward with assurance .
The conflict between the two men will be as interesting as the clash between their teams .
Mourinho has always acknowledged the debt he owes to Van Gaal who allowed him to make the transition under him at Barcelona from interpreter to assistant coach .
He ha snot shown the disrespect for him he reserves for other coachers notably poor Ranieri , who has been the butt of many Mourinho jibes this season .
Van Gaal too has generally been respectful about Mourinho although in the last few days , perhaps needled by some of the publicity focused on Mourinho , he has claimed that Mourinho ’s teams are geared up to win but his own teams are geared up to win playing well , which is a more difficult thing to do .
The bookies tend to have Mourinho ’s team as the favourites , but GGW reckons that Bayern should be seen as the more likely to persevere .
In 9 of the last 10 Champions League finals the club ranked highest in the Might is Right League table has tended to triumph .
By this rule Bayern ’s 4th place should make them favourites to beat Inter .
Van Gaal is no mug .
Like Mourinho he believes in meticulous planning before a game and in meticulous preparation of his team related to the opposition they will be facing .
Do n’t expect another 10 goal thriller on the 50th Anniversary of the greatest game ever played , Real Madrid ’s 7 - 3 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park .
Each coach may well have studied the other team so well that all their strengths will be nullified and neither team is allowed to play well .
The best bet may be 0 - 0 at 90 minutes ( currenly available at about 7 - 1 ) and then settled on penalties after a further 30 minutes stalemate .
However there are enough players out there , Arjen Robben , Schneider , Etoo , Milito who have the individual class and brilliance to overcome even the most meticulous of annulment strategies .
Let us hope so .
But expect Van Gaal ’s team to triumph if it goes to penalties .
At 9:23 p.m. , when he got pinch - hitter Ronny Paulino to hit a grounder to third for the 27th out , only then could Halladay bask in his moment -- breaking into a big smile and wrapping his arms around catcher Carlos Ruiz before disappearing in a joyous , jumping gray - and - red mob of teammates .
" It 's never something that you think is possible , " Halladay said .
" Really , once I got the two outs , I felt like I had a chance .
You 're always aware of it .
It 's not something that you expect . "
It was the second perfect game in the majors this month alone , unheralded Dallas Braden doing it for Oakland against Tampa Bay on May 9 .
It 's the first time in the modern era that there were a pair of perfectos in the same season -- Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez threw a no-hitter , too , in April .
Halladay struck out 11 , and was cheered by a crowd of 25,086 throughout much of the night .
Another fan called later -- Vice President Joe Biden dialed up the Phillies ' clubhouse to offer his congratulations when it was over .
" Early in my bullpen I was hitting spots more than I have been .
I felt like I just carried that out there , " Halladay said .
While there were a couple of good plays behind him -- shortstop Wilson Valdez went deep into the hole for a grounder , backup third baseman Juan Castro went to his knees for another , second baseman Chase Utley ranged well to his left for another fine play -- Halladay did n't need any great defensive work in this gem .
" I think everybody knows you have to have those kind of plays to do something like that , " Halladay said .
Yes , but on this night , the 33 - year - old righty known as Doc was a veritable one - man show .
" You 've got to take your hat off to Doc , " Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said .
" That 's why he is who he is .
That 's what they got him for . "
Steely - eyed , standing tall and always working swiftly , Halladay ( 7 - 3 ) broke into a big smile as his teammates rushed in to congratulate him .
" That 's a big emotion for him , " Phillies left - hander Jamie Moyer said , laughing in the clubhouse .
" It 's fun to watch . "
The Marlins said they would give Halladay the pitching rubber as a souvenir , leading to a slightly surreal scene .
The lights at Sun Life Stadium went out and fireworks began exploding two minutes after the game ended , with the field crew preparing for a postgame concert behind second base .
Working in the dark , four men went to work on the mound , digging up the slab where Halladay made history .
" Look who 's pitching , " Marlins outfielder Cody Ross said .
" It 's Roy Halladay , the best pitcher in baseball .
It 's not embarrassing . "
The concert lasted more than an hour .
On this night , Halladay was the lone maestro .
The former AL Cy Young winner was the centerpiece of a multiteam trade that brought him from Toronto to the two - time NL champions in the offseason , and the Phils gave him a $ 60 million , three - year contract extension .
He was within one out of a no-hitter on Sept. 27 , 1998 , in just his second major league start , pitching for the Blue Jays against Detroit .
Pinch - hitter Bobby Higginson ended that on the first pitch he saw , hitting a solo home run .
" It 's hard to explain , " Halladay said .
" There 's days where things just kind of click and things happen .
It 's something you obviously , you do n't ever go out and try to do .
It 's a great feeling .
It 's a lot better than the eight and two - thirds . "
Halladay faced three Marlins pinch - hitters in the ninth .
Mike Lamb led off with a long fly ball , but Shane Victorino had plenty of time to backtrack in the super - spacious outfield at Sun Life Stadium and squeeze it for the first out .
Another pinch - hitter , Wes Helms , struck out , and the crowd filled with Phillies fans simply began to roar .
From there , it was all up to Paulino , who fouled the first pitch into the seats along the first - base side , took ball one , swung and missed for strike two , and then stabbed at Halladay 's 115th and final offering .
Castro ranged to his left to get it and threw across to first baseman Ryan Howard , who caught the ball and jumped in the air .
In a week that saw the hard - hitting Phillies get shut out on three straight days by the New York Mets , Halladay delivered the most masterful pitching performance of all .
" He did what he had to do , " Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said .
" We gave him one run .
He made it stand up .
That was good .
Super for him . "
On the short list of baseball 's perfect games , there are the first two : John Richmond and John Ward pitched them five days apart in 1880 , two decades before what is considered the modern era .
This was the Phillies ' second perfect game , with Jim Bunning having thrown one in 1964 .
Philadelphia has thrown 10 no-hitters , the last by Kevin Millwood in 2003 .
It was the second time the Marlins had been no -hit in their history , the lone other coming by the Dodgers ' Ramon Martinez on July 14 , 1995 .
Halladay credited catcher Carlos Ruiz for a smooth ride .
" We felt like we got in a groove early and about the fifth or the sixth I was just following Chooch , " he said .
" I can't say enough about the job he did today .
Mixed pitches .
For me it was really a no - brainer . "
The NL East leaders ' lone run off Josh Johnson ( 5 - 2 ) came in the third , and fittingly in this battle of aces , it was unearned .
Valdez singled , then scored when Chase Utley 's fly to center skipped off Cameron Maybin 's glove for a three - base error .
" It 's one of those things where everything has to go right and it did , " Maybin said .
" J.J. did a great job of competing .
Unfortunately , one play ... that was the ballgame . "
Valdez scored easily .
And Halladay had all the support he needed .
A Philadelphia story , for certain .
Sorry , Flyers -- your return to the Stanley Cup finals on Saturday night just got upstaged , in a big way .
In fact , NBC broke into its coverage of the Game 1 of the Flyers - Chicago matchup to show a replay of the final out .
There have now been three perfect games in the last 10 months , with Mark Buehrle doing it last July 23 for the Chicago White Sox against Tampa Bay .
Halladay had a complete - game one - hitter last September against the New York Yankees , though with far less drama , thanks to Ramiro Pena getting a double to right field in the sixth inning .
Unshakable on the mound , not even three - ball counts fazed Halladay .
He went to either 3 - 1 or 3 - 2 counts seven times , twice in the game 's first three batters alone , and always worked out of the trouble .
Chris Coghlan tossed his bat aside on the Marlins ' first plate appearance of the night , thinking he 'd drawn a walk , only to hear plate umpire Mike DiMuro call strike three .
Coghlan was n't pleased , and that was a theme for the Marlins throughout .
" I thought they were balls , that 's why I took them .
But obviously they 're too close to take , " Coghlan said .
" I do n't want to talk about the strike zone because that 's discrediting what he did . "
Hanley Ramirez had the same issue two batters later , stepping toward first after thinking a 3 - 1 pitch missed the zone .
It had n't , DiMuro said , and Ramirez wound up grounding out .
That was just the start .
Jorge Cantu went to a 3 - 1 count in the second before striking out on a foul tip .
Dan Uggla had a three - ball count before a flyout in the fifth , and Maybin added drama in the sixth .
Maybin showed bunt twice , drawing a small chorus of boos , and eventually worked his way ahead 3 - 1 .
He ended up hitting a hard shot to deep short , where Valdez fielded it on a hop and threw to Howard in time to beat Maybin by a half - step -- umpire Tim Welke taking a big swing to indicate the out .
Halladay got another nice play in the eighth when Castro went to his knees to snare a sharp grounder off Cantu 's bat , recovering and throwing to first in plenty of time .
When Cody Ross popped to short to end the eighth , Halladay showed no emotion , simply walking to the dugout with his head bowed a bit , tugging once on the left shoulder of his gray jersey .
" I was thinking , if somebody hit a ball close to me , I was going to do whatever it takes , " Castro said .
For the Marlins , Johnson threw a career - high 121 pitches in seven innings , giving up seven hits , one unearned run , one intentional walk and striking out six .
His night was stellar -- and did n't even come close to comparing to his counterpart .
" He 's the best right - hander in the game , " Johnson said , " and he kind of proved it . "
Game notes
Phillies 3B Placido Polanco ( bruised left elbow ) was sidelined again , Castro getting the call to start for the second straight night .
Polanco is expected to undergo an MRI exam on Sunday to see if the problem is more serious than originally thought .

Problems are mounting for American Apparel Inc. , the popular Los Angeles apparel maker and retailer that has been plagued by debt constraints and weak sales since last year .
On Wednesday , the company reported disappointing first - quarter preliminary results and said it expected problems with its debt , sending its shares plummeting 41 % to its lowest price in more than a year .
It also declined to provide a financial outlook for the year because of continued uncertainty about its business .
Even as its fortunes have reversed , founder and Chief Executive Dov Charney has remained upbeat .
Recently , he scoffed at reports that the company was in trouble , telling The Times , “ It ’s so silly — we ’re a flourishing , growing company . ”
On Wednesday , he was equally optimistic .

“ Our company in the past has been through these types of issues before , and it ’s never presented us with any particular difficulties in running our business , ” he said in a call with analysts .
But retail experts are becoming increasingly worried about the company , which is known for its racy advertising and colorful clothing .
In a note to investors , Todd Slater , an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets , said the first - quarter results were “ not the turn we were looking for . ”
He also lowered his estimates for the year and said he believed the company would remain under pressure .
For the quarter , American Apparel reported that sales at stores open at least a year — an important indicator of a retailer ’s performance because it excludes the effect of store openings and closings — had tumbled 10 % .

The results are especially troubling because competitors have posted healthy sales and stock growth in recent months as economic conditions have improved and because of easy year - over - year comparisons .
American Apparel also warned that it anticipated being unable to comply with the terms of its credit agreement by June 30 , which could have an effect on the company ’s ability to carry out its operating plan for the year .
It said it planned to continue to work with its second - lien lender to amend the agreement before the projected default .
The company ’s growing problems are leading some to speculate that the company could be a target for a takeover or bankruptcy filing , which the company had flirted with in late 2008 .
“ They might get somebody to come in and do a bottom - fishing bid , ” said Tom Burnett , a mergers and acquisitions expert and director of research at Wall Street Access .
“ There ’s always somebody willing to take a chance . ”

Shares of American Apparel plummeted $ 1.11 to $ 1.63 .
American Apparel also posted an operating loss of $ 17.6 million .
That compared with an operating loss of $ 3.9 million in the first quarter of last year .
The company has struggled with reduced manufacturing efficiency at its production facilities after laying off 1,500 workers in September .
Those job cuts stemmed from a government inspection last year that found that hundreds of American Apparel workers did n’t appear to be authorized to work in the U.S .
At the time , company executives said they did n’t anticipate any significant loss in productivity .

Final first - quarter results , including net income and earnings per share , are expected to be filed no later than the end of June , the company said .
Still , American Apparel continues to be considered a promising firm by some standards .
The company , which has been outspoken about immigrant rights , was praised in a report released Wednesday by the Harvard Business Review for treating its lower - wage workers well .
The report said the company ’s implementation of a team structure and worker - friendly perks boosted productivity .
In a call with analysts Wednesday , Chief Financial Officer Adrian Kowalewski said American Apparel would “ work to regain our footing coming out of the global recession . ”

“ As we deal with the specific shocks our business has weathered in the last nine months , ” he said , “ we are confident we have the talent , or are hiring the talent , to overcome any drags on our business and plan to reemerge a stronger company . ”

It was hailed as a breakthrough in the fight to cut carbon emissions .
In 2007 , researchers found that heavy electricity users cut their consumption after being told that they used more energy than their neighbours .
Almost a million US households have since received similar feedback and have cut electricity use by an average of 2.5 per cent .
But a new study has identified a wrinkle in the plan : the feedback only seems to work with liberals .
Conservatives tend to ignore it .
Some even respond by using more energy .
The findings come from a study of over 80,000 Californian households , just under half of which received feedback on energy use .
Overall , the technique worked : households who got the feedback cut electricity by around 2 per cent , say Dora Costa and Matthew Kahn at the University of California , Los Angeles .
But important difference emerged when Costa and Kahn looked at the political leanings of those in the survey .
Homeowners who identified themselves as Republicans cut energy use by just 0.4 per cent on average .
And those Republicans who showed no practical interest in environmental causes – people who did not donate to environmental groups and did not choose to pay extra for renewable energy – even increased electricity use by 0.75 per cent .

Act of defiance
Wesley Schultz at California State University in San Marcos , one of the researchers behind the 2007 finding , is not surprised by the result .
He says that some Republicans have a negative view of the environmental movement and so might want to distance themselves from a green - themed campaign .
Using more electricity could be an act of defiance , whether conscious or subconscious .
The result does not negate the usefulness of such psychological “ nudges ” , adds Schultz .
But it does suggest that feedback needs to be tailored to specific groups .
“ No one is immune to social pressure , ” says Schultz .
“ Even among those that increased electricity use there is a nudge that would work . ”
It is not clear what that nudge would be , however .
It could be a focus on the financial savings that come with reduced electricity use , suggests Costa .
Or it could be a pitch that equated less energy use with increased self - sufficiency , says Robert Gifford at the University of Victoria in British Columbia , Canada .
But such nudges simply may not work in conservative parts of the US , Costa concludes .
She says that other energy - saving schemes will need to implemented as well , such as tougher building codes .
Unlike nudges , which do not place a financial burden on homeowners and buyers , these other approaches can drive up the price of homes and so are not always popular .
“ It may be that we have to do other politically difficult things , ” she warns .
Costa and Kahn ’s paper was published last month on the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research .
A bill sponsored by Ron Paul and Alan Grayson to thoroughly audit the Fed , passed the House .
However in a brazen move that ought to offend the sensibilities of every citizen , the Fed is lobbying Senate members to water down the bill so that it is meaningless .
The Huffington Post tells the story in Fed Privately Lobbying Against Audit .
The Federal Reserve is privately lobbying against a bipartisan Senate amendment that would open the central bank to an audit by the Government Accountability Office , according to documents distributed to Senate offices by a Fed official .
In order to obtain the documents , HuffPost agreed not to reveal the name of the Federal Reserve official who did the specific lobbying in question .
" As I mentioned , we believe that the bipartisan Corker - Merkley provision in the Dodd Bill is quite strong and addresses issues of transparency and disclosure without impinging on the independence of monetary policy , " the official goes on .
Merkley teamed with Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) on an audit provision , but Merkley himself says he 'd prefer to go further .
" I appreciate Representative [ Alan ] Grayson 's concerns over accountability at the Federal Reserve .
I have been a strong proponent of Fed reform and voted against the re-confirmation of Ben Bernanke because the Fed has been so lax in using its regulatory powers , " Merkley said in a statement to HuffPost , responding to an analysis from Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) showing that the Senate bill did not meaningfully expand transparency .
The Fed argument is a replay of a tactic that the bank tried in the House .
Instead of outright opposition , the Fed backed an amendment in the lower chamber from Rep. Mel Watt ( D - N.C. ) , which the bank said would expand transparency but not interfere with monetary policy .
It became clear , however , that the amendment would not expand transparency and was an attempt to defeat the audit in general .
The Watt amendment was soundly defeated .
The Corker - Merkley amendment is the Senate version of the Watt amendment and the Fed is once again arguing that the broader amendment will impinge on the independence of monetary policy .
" The Sanders amendment , however , would directly interfere with monetary policy , " argues the Fed official .
" The amendment removes the current statutory protection for core monetary policy activities from GAO audit and would permit the GAO to audit monetary policy decisions and the decisionmaking process itself . "
Last year , the Fed brought on Enron 's former top lobbyist , Linda Robertson , to help fend off the audit .
" Robertson would help the Fed manage relations with lawmakers seeking greater oversight of a central bank that has used emergency powers to prevent Wall Street 's demise , " Bloomberg reported
Dodd Bill Would Allow Fed To Hide Its Spending
The Wall Street reform bill headed for a test vote on the Senate floor Monday night will allow the Federal Reserve to continue to pump trillions of dollars into major banks largely in secrecy , the co-author of House language that would open the central bank to an audit charged in a memo to the Senate .
" The Senate has a provision in its reform bill that purports to audit the Fed .
But , it really does n't do anything of the sort .
I 'm going to run down the details for you , and reprint the legislative language so you can read it yourself , " writes Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) .
It would not allow the GAO to look into the Fed 's massive purchase of toxic assets , its hundreds of billions in foreign currency swaps with other central banks or its open market operations , among other restrictions .
Grayson and co-author Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) passed legislation through the House that would allow the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to audit the Federal Reserve and , after a delay , release the information to Congress .
It was a remarkable victory , with a populist coalition beating back the combined lobbying efforts of the Treasury Department , the Fed and Wall Street banks .

What You Can Do
Send A Message
( CNN ) -- " I think we have a problem . "
Lt. Col . Anthony Terreri , reading the CT scans of an injured soldier who'd just arrived at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , realized the shrapnel he saw lodged inside the soldier 's skull was n't really shrapnel at all .
It was unexploded ordnance -- a live round of ammunition that could detonate at any time .
The young Afghani soldier had arrived less than an hour before , after an IED had flung shards of metal into his head .
" The internal part of the fragment was not solid metal , but it had a metal exterior , " recalled Terreri .
" There 's an air gap at the end , a formed end at one side and the fragment was elongated . "
He looked at a second scan , a side X - ray of the soldier 's skull , to confirm his suspicions .
" The projectile was part of the bomb that went off , " explained Maj .
John Bini , who oversees all trauma care at Bagram .
" People will pack just about anything in to these things : rocks , nails , screws , explosives . "
Bini and his team immediately summoned an explosive ordnance disposal team to assess how risky it would be to conduct the surgery .
The doctors needed to minimize the risk of setting off the ordnance .
They were told not to drop the explosive , prick it with a scalpel or let it be exposed to any electricity .
" We knew that any electrical current possibly could cause detonation . "
Bini has been able to find roughly 50 similar cases in the history of modern warfare , but his team at Bagram was prepared .
Nonessential personnel were immediately evacuated from the area and all electronic machinery was disconnected from the patient .
Everyone else who remained donned flak jackets , including Maj.
Jeffrey Rengel , who was manually administering anesthesia .
" We had to turn off all volatile anesthetics because they could increase the magnitude of an explosion , " said Rengel , referring to a class of anesthetics that would have been used to calm the patient .
Because they are vaporous , the danger would be magnified if there was an explosion and those gases were in the air .
" I resorted to counting the drips in my IV tubing to determine what was being delivered to the patient . "
Using a blood pressure cuff , a battery - operated heart rate monitor and some good old - fashioned arithmetic , Rengel monitored the soldier 's vital signs while Bini prepared himself to operate .
" The surgeon needed to be someone actually trained on how to do this , what procedures needed to be done .
I was the one who knew how , " said Bini .
" The Air Force has an emergency surgery course ...[ and ] I 'm the course director . "
Despite his training and his confidence , he was apprehensive .
" As I was putting my body armor on and getting ready to walk in to operating room , I was going to tell somebody that if anything happens , tell my wife and children that I love them , " said Bini .
" But then I stopped myself .
I did n't want to jinx myself , " he said .
" Surgeons are superstitious people . "
The round had n't penetrated the patient 's brain but had caused a significant fracture ; portions of his skull were compressed against the outside of his brain .
" I made a wide incision in the scalp down to the skull where I could lift off skin flap could actually see the projectile wedged underneath a flap of bone , " Bini said .
Out of fear that using metal tools would detonate the explosive , Bini was forced to abandon his clamps and scalpels .
" I grabbed it with my hands , sort of worked it out , and really pulled it out with my hand . "
He handed the shell over to the explosives handlers , who safely removed it from the hospital .
The doctors ' skillful handling of the situation has drawn a lot of media attention .
But they shrug it off as just another day at the office .
" We trained to go to war and do surgery at war , " said Bini .
" I never thought I 'd see one of these things in my lifetime , but you just prepare for it . "
" You fall back on those skills that all physicians have , going back to the basics of your practice , " said Rengel .
They argue the real heroes are the men and women on the front lines , not them .
" Those guys risking being blown up every day , those guys are the ones taking the big risk , " said Terreri .
" We 're safe compared to guys walking around down the roads . "
Review : Kick - Ass The Game
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Friday , 7th of May 2010 - 07:15 PM ]
There most certainly is .
Why would n't there be , as merchandising is a great way to make more money off a great franchise .
It is the capitalist way after all .
Unfortunately , they are generally just pieces of shit that end up sitting on the shelf once you have made it through once .
Is this the case for Kick - Ass ? Read below .
Graphics :
Ok , I know that this was one of the biggest gripes people had when I posted the trailer and screens for the game .
People whined and made fun of it because it looked dated .
Which to be honest , when compared to modern games it is .
What the retardababy patrol seems to have missed is that this is a PSN and iPhone game , and not a full blown , current gen title .
When you look at it from that angle , the graphics for the game are actually pretty decent .
In fact I would place them higher than ' decent ' given the limited resources .
I mean , the iPhone / iPad are not know for their spectacular 3D graphics .
As for the PSN , yes it does have the power of the PS3 behind it so they could have been much better , but developer , WHA Entertainment , was also developing for the other platform as well , so they could n't push too hard .
At least there were some good clips from the film and comic pages spliced in as well .
Audio :
Alright , now if ever you were to have a beef with something here , it would be the audio .
This is most evident in the voice acting .
I mean the music and effects are great , in fact much of it came from the film .
I especially loved the music they used for the fights , but they could have at least grabbed the actors or at least decent sound - a - likes for the voice over work .
The exception to this is Hit Girl .
I started playing as Hit Girl and thought that everything was great as Voice Overs go .
It really sounded like Chloe Moretz did the VO work .
( I ca n't verify if she did or not )
But right when you get to meet Red Mist for the first time expecting to hear McLovin ' Christopher Mintz - Plasse , I get surprised by hearing the 25 - year - long smoker version of his voice .
It was the same for Mr. McDunnough Mr. Cage and the Young Eisenheim Mr. Johnson .
Not even close to the voices we were presented with in the film this is spawned from .
I know getting actors can be fickle , Iron Man 2 went through the same thing , but at least they tried to get sound - a- likes .
This was just hard on the ears for me .
Controls :
For this review I was only able to get some good hands on with the PSN copy of Kick - Ass , so I can't really talk about the " waggle " and thumb pressing of the iPhone version .
But what I can say is that if you have played Marvel Ultimate Alliance or any game like it , then the PSN controls will be extremely familiar .
They are almost mapped the same way as well , including special attacks that require you to hold the R2 button and press which ever special attack you want from the other buttons .
Not much more to say about them really .
I mean outside of the touchy controls in the menu , there were no real issues one way or another .
They took a non -broke system and went to town .
Gameplay :
Minus the last level ( no spoilers ) the entire game is played in a simple beat - em - up , button mashing RPGish kind of way .
Just like the controls , it is close in hand with games like Marvel Ultimate Alliance .
You are given a mission .
You follow a " path " to get to the mission spamming light and heavy attacks wasting enemies until you get to the " boss " of the area .
That is when you would generally change things up to a slightly different strategy , but generally it is doing the same thing .
The only " break " from this form of gameplay , sans the last level , is the upgrading section you get to play with as you gain style and experience points .
Both of those are really the same thing , except that you gain more experience by beating enemies with style and high combos .
Like beating a guy a few times , then shooting him , then kicking him on the prong of a fork lift .
That will get you WAY more XP than just beating on him until he is down .
From there , you get to level and then upgrade the three aspects of the characters , Defense , Attack and Abilities .
To me , it seemed kind of useless once I got higher in levels .
As you can always take away from one section and pump it into another .
Like for me , I balanced everyone in all three categories until I came across someone that was a bit difficult to take down .
So I shifted all of my ability points into attack and defense .
I could n't do any cool tricks , but I did n't have the time to drop sweet moves since I walked right through them ; they could n't effectively damage me and I was hitting them like a steamroller .
Overview :
Now in the end , this is a Movie adaptation video game .
It should be looked at as an adaptation video game as well and not like what has happened to other comic books that have films and video games .
* COUGH * Batman * COUGH *
It is not ground breaking to say the least , but it does add a bit of extra fun onto the whole Kick - Ass franchise .
Do n't expect it to have anything new as far as content or canon goes .
The story , much like the comic was to the film , is exactly the same generally speaking .
So , heads up , you will get to see the story for the third time here .
I will say that unlike other film adaptation games , this one can be extremely fun .
I am not to sure if there is a reason to playthrough the game multiple times - unless you are a trophy whore - because you can get the full experience in one playthrough .
Two if you want to go solo and then add a friend later on .
That said , when you look at the price point here against the content , it could be a bit steep .
So if you do n't have the cash to burn or the huge fandom of the franchise , you may want to wait until it is about 9.99 on the PSN .
You should n't feel jipped at that price .
Kick - Ass was designed and published by WHA Entertainment , Inc. and was released on April 29 , 2010 for the PSN and iTunes .
It retails for $ 14.99 on the PSN and $ 2.99 on iTunes .
A code for the PSN version of the game was provided by the publisher for reviewing purposes .
I played the game to completion on Normal mode in single player and co-op play .
Just like in the film and comic , Hit Girl is my favorite .
Lane Bryant is up in arms that two US television networks - Fox and ABC - have resisted airing a sexy lingerie ad featuring busty , plus - sized models in time periods where the networks have broadcast other racy fare .
In a post on LB 's Inside Curve blog , the clothing company complains that " ABC and Fox have made the decision to define beauty for you by denying our new , groundbreaking Cacique commercial from airing freely on their networks . "
The ad , which was initially available at lanebryant.com , has since been removed .
The post also claims that ABC " restricted our airtime " and refused to air the spot during Dancing With the Stars , while Fox " demanded excessive re-edits and rebuffed it three times before relenting to air it during the final 10 minutes of American Idol , but only after we threatened to pull the ad buy . "
The post continues : " Yes , these are the same networks that have scantily - clad housewives so desperate they seduce every man on the block - and do n't forget Bart Simpson , who has shown us the moon more often than NASA - all in what they call ' family hour . ' "
The ad depicts several attractive models in the latest line of Lane Bryant lingerie .
Ample cleavage - which Bryant says was a problem for the networks - is on display in the ad .
" The networks exclaimed , ' She has ... cleavage !'
Gasp ! " the blog post states .
" While it 's no secret that Victoria 's Secret ' The Nakeds ' ads are prancing around on major networks leaving little to the imagination , steaming up TV screens and baring nearly everything but their souls , our sultry siren who shows sophisticated sass is somehow deemed inappropriate ...
Does this smack of a double standard ?
Yep .

Not surprisingly , comments from readers on the blog support the ad and chide the networks .
" I have been advocating for curvy girls for about 20 years now ... and STILL there is bigotry against women of size .
We 're deemed inappropriate , unintelligent , and we 're shunned .

PALO ALTO , CA — All 1,472 employees of Facebook , Inc. reportedly burst out in uncontrollable laughter Wednesday following Albuquerque resident Jason Herrick 's attempts to protect his personal information from exploitation on the social - networking site .
" Look , he 's clicking ' Friends Only ' for his e-mail address .
Like that 's going to make a difference ! " howled infrastructure manager Evan Hollingsworth , tears streaming down his face , to several of his doubled - over coworkers .
" Oh , sure , by all means , Jason , ' delete ' that photo .
Man , this is so rich . "
According to internal sources , the entire staff of Facebook was left gasping for air minutes later when the " hilarious " Herrick believed he had actually blocked third - party ads .

The lack of fervor about climate change is also true of the United States , where action on climate and emissions reduction is still very much a work in progress , and concern about global warming was never as strong as in Europe .
A March Gallup poll found that 48 percent of Americans believed that the seriousness of global warming was “ generally exaggerated , ” up from 41 percent a year ago .
Here in Britain , the change has been driven by the news media ’s intensive coverage of a series of climate science controversies unearthed and highlighted by skeptics since November .
These include the unauthorized release of e-mail messages from prominent British climate scientists at the University of East Anglia that skeptics cited as evidence that researchers were overstating the evidence for global warming and the discovery of errors in a United Nations climate report .
Two independent reviews later found no evidence that the East Anglia researchers had actively distorted climate data , but heavy press coverage had already left an impression that the scientists had schemed to repress data .
Then there was the unusually cold winter in Northern Europe and the United States , which may have reinforced a perception that the Earth was not warming .
( Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , a United States agency , show that globally , this winter was the fifth warmest in history . )
Asked about his views on global warming on a recent evening , Brian George , a 30 - year - old builder from southeast London , mused , “ It was extremely cold in January , was n’t it ? ”
In a telephone interview , Nicholas Stern , a former chief economist at the World Bank and a climate change expert , said that the shift in opinion “ had n’t helped ” efforts to come up with strong policy in a number of countries .
But he predicted that it would be overcome , not least because the science was so clear on the warming trend .
“ I do n’t think it will be problematic in the long run , ” he said , adding that in Britain , at least , politicians “ are ahead of the public anyway . ”
Indeed , once Mr. Cameron became prime minister , he vowed to run “ the greenest government in our history ” and proposed projects like a more efficient national electricity grid .
Scientists have meanwhile awakened to the public ’s misgivings and are increasingly fighting back .
An editorial in the prestigious journal Nature said climate deniers were using “ every means at their disposal to undermine science and scientists ” and urged scientists to counterattack .
Scientists in France , the Netherlands and the United States have signed open letters affirming their trust in climate change evidence , including one published on May 7 in the journal Science .
BP has " fallen short " in providing data about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the US government has said , in its latest critical letter to the firm .
The Obama administration said the British energy giant should act in a " transparent manner " and " promptly " make all information public .
Earlier , BP said more oil than the 5,000 barrels a day it first estimated were gushing from the burst well .
The spill has reached Louisiana and is threatening Florida and Cuba .
The crude has been flowing since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , leased by BP , exploded off the coast of Louisiana on 20 April and sank two days later .
' A little more '
The Obama administration asked BP to make public all measurements of the growing leak , air and water quality samples , trajectories of underwater plumes and locations of dispersants .
It is imperative BP promptly provide all information regarding the oil spill Obama administration letter
The request came in a letter to BP CEO Tony Hayward from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) Administrator Lisa Jackson .
It said : " In responding to this oil spill , it is critical that all actions be conducted in a transparent manner , with all data and information related to the spill readily available to the United States government and the American people . "
The officials said that despite claims by BP it was making efforts to keep the public and the government informed , " those efforts , to date , have fallen short in both their scope and effectiveness " .
They said it was " imperative that BP promptly " make public all data on the spill .
Obama administration officials last week wrote a letter to BP demanding clarification over its commitment to pay for damages from the spill ; the firm said it had already done so .
Another letter at the weekend cast doubt over the effectiveness of BP 's latest attempt to siphon oil from the gushing well head .
' Top kill '
BP had stuck by its first estimate that some 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , a day of oil was leaking from the well - despite claims from several experts the real figure was at least 10 times higher .
GULF OIL SPILL Live pictures ( External site )
But BP spokesman Mark Proegler told news agency AFP on Thursday : " Now that we are collecting 5,000 barrels a day , it might be a little more than that . "
A live video feed showing the oil gushing from the well has been made available by BP after pressure from a US congressman .
It shows a large , flowing plume of oil and gas next to the tube that is carrying some of it to the surface .
Meanwhile , the EPA has told BP to use a new dispersant to contain the spill , as fears grow about potential damage from the use of such chemicals .
BP has used a number of dispersants , all approved by the EPA , to try to break up the crude .
The oil firm 's temporary solution has been to funnel the oil up to a ship , but on Sunday it is preparing its latest attempt to seal the rupture , which is a mile below on the seabed .

An ocean current is threatening to carry the oil into the Atlantic
Engineers are planning a so - called " top kill " operation , in which heavy mud would be injected to stem the oil flow , then cement used to block the well permanently .
It emerged on Wednesday a small portion of the slick had entered the so - called Loop Current , which could take it to Florida and up the eastern US coast .
Florida forecasters said it would be at least a week before the oil reached waters near the state .
Farther south , US officials have been talking to Cuba about how to respond should the spill reach the island 's northern coast .
Poll Finds Rise in Gay Marriage Approval
A nine - percentage - point difference now exists between supporters and opponents
of marriage equality , a new Gallup poll discovered .
Gallup 's latest findings indicate 53 % of Americans do not believe same - sex marriage should be recognized as valid by law , while 44 % believe it should .
In 2009 , 57 % of Americans stated gay marriage should not be legal , while 40 % said the opposite .
Opposition to gay marriage is now tied for the lowest level ever recorded by Gallup — in 2007 , 53 % of Americans also said gay marriage should not be legalized .
As far as support , 2007 also was a good year for marriage equality , with 46 % voicing approval .
Since then , support for marriage equality dipped before picking up this year .
Gallup 's " bottom line " for its poll was thus : " Over time , Americans have become more accepting of legal same - sex marriage , and a growing number of subgroups now show majority support for it .
However , religious and conservative segments of the U.S. population remain largely opposed — even though their support for gay marriage has also increased in recent years .
Because religious and conservative groups are larger than nonreligious and left - leaning groups in the United States , overall , more Americans remain opposed to , rather than in favor of , same - sex marriage . "
When Gallup first asked about the legality of gay marriage in 1996 , 68 % of Americans were opposed and 27 % in favor .
The Orange County Register reports that since mid-March , California election officials have received at least 99 written complaints from people who say they were registered to vote as Republicans without their consent .
The Register found another 74 voters who said that they were duped or coerced into registering to vote as Republicans .
The complaints were filed after paid petitioners canvassed discount store parking lots and community college campuses in March asking passers - by to sign petitions for causes like legalizing marijuana , fighting cancer or cleaning up beaches .
The Register called 348 registered Republicans in Orange County and reached 90 of them .
Of those , only 16 said they wanted to be Republicans .
The rest said they were coerced into signing by fast - talking petitioners , some of whom offered people free sunglasses if they signed .
The California Republican party has a controversial policy of paying signature gatherers up to $ 8.00 apiece for sending in new GOP voter registration cards in that district .
The signers in the current case all lived in the 34th State Senate District in Central Orange County , where Republicans are hoping to oust a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 election .
In 2006 , the Register uncovered a similar pattern of fraud in the county that was attributed in part to the bounty the GOP pays to signature gatherers .
In that incident , 167 voters complained that they were switched to Republican affiliation without their permission , and the Register found another 112 voters who claimed they were tricked .
Eleven signature - gatherers in that case were eventually convicted of falsifying voter registrations and other charges .
Of the eleven , eight went to jail .
I had access to the Mount & Blade : Warband beta .
And I have to admit , I was less than impressed .
Graphically , Mount & Blade : Warband is a nightmare even with the visual improvements the developers reportedly implemented over the original Mount & Blade .
Comparatively , it ’s graphical equivalent is the original Half - Life or something else from the late 90’s / early 00 ’s during the “ butt- ugly ” pubescent phase of 3D gaming .
The menus are basic to say the least .
There is no voice acting .
There is only text and blocky graphics .
I kept asking myself , “ What the hell is the mass appeal of this game ?
Why are there so many rabid cultists following this title ?
I ’m a gamer of almost 30 years .
How am I not part of this ‘ in ’ crowd ? ” I found myself only able to sit with the game for 20 – 25 minutes at a time .
After a while , I just stopped thinking about the game .
Afterall , I had a kill ratio to keep up in Battlefield Bad Company 2 and I still had about 1,000,000 more colonels to assassinate in Just Cause 2 .
Then I got my hands on the full version of the Mount & Blade : Warband .
I decided to give it an honest - to - god second try .
I ’m glad I did .
And now … I get it .
I feel like I ’m part of the “ in ” crowd now .
Mount and Blade : Warband is a great game .
It ’s fantastic .
It ’s addictive .
I want to take a day off of work to do nothing but play it .
For the past few nights , I forcefully had to to stop myself from playing and go to bed sometime before 3:00 AM .
( Do n’t tell my wife .
She ’d kill me if she knew what time I was coming to bed .
I ’ve been using the excuse “ Oh , I ’m just coming back from the bathroom ” when she catches me . )
I foresee many more near - sleepless nights to come because of this game , too .
But that does n’t mean that every PC gamer that ’s vaguely interested in this title should drop what they ’re doing and run out and buy it .
At first appearance , many gamers might confuse Mount & Blade : Warband with a poor man ’s Oblivion or Morrowind .
Some gamers have asked me if it was like the Total War series .
To those iquiries , I can only reply , “ yea , it ’s kinda like that … but not really . ”
While the leveling experience is similar to Oblivion – the more you use a skill , the faster it increases–and tactically , it can be very similar to Total War games , the closest game I can think of to describe Mount and Blade : Warband is Sid Meier ’s Pirates !.
You start the game as a single soldier looking to prove himself in the world .
It ’s just you , your sword , your crossbow , and your horse .
The rest of your digital life is in your hands .
One man alone cannot fell the gigantic armies of your enemies .
It ’s up to you to amass a force to be reckoned with .
You can ride your horse from town to town and ask for strong armed men to join your cause .
Some towns will be able to offer a few men to help out .
Once a soldier is in your party , you ’re in charge of their weekly monetary allowances , their training , their health , and their food supply .
From there , your army will follow you into hell itself if you ’re a strong enough leader .
Maintaining an army is n’t easy … or cheap .
To keep your army fat and happy , you need cash .
Raising money is difficult at first , therefore raising an army is equally difficult .
But good things come to those who wait .
Income can come about several ways .
You can always find a king or a lord or a duke who is in need of a favor or two .
Doing missions for kings and lords grants you increased fame in those parts of the world .
While gopher missions can get a little boring , sometimes you ’re asked to retrieve someone ’s head , or many people ’s heads .
Or if you want to live the live of a brigand , you can always pillage a village or two .
Then… it ’s time for war .
Unless you are attacking a specific city or town , armies clash on gigantic , randomly - generated fields of battle .
The battles take place in real time as your soldiers fight for their own survival .
At first , most battles start as a sheer numbers game .
Your five crazy villagers with pitchforks will stand no chance against a well trained army of 75 .
But in time , your army will grow and you ’ll need to develop a more tactical approach to the fights when the armies are equal in training and in number .
The outcome of any battle can go one of three ways .
1. Victory : Congratulations !
You and your army have slaughtered your enemy and you revel in the spoils of war .
You now own all the weapons and armor of your former enemy and you can sell them at the local smith or trade the items for food for your army .
Victorious armies also gain levels .
Surviving soldiers can train from crazy pitchfork wielding citizen - warriors to a highly disciplined infantrymen , archers , spear men , and more .
2. Defeat :
Way to go , dummy !
Your entire party has been wiped out and you have been knocked unconscious .
You are taken prisoner and are dragged across the country with your captors until you find an opportunity to escape .
You then need to start rebuilding your army .
3. Retreat : Either you or your enemy has successfully retreated and bloodshed has been avoided … for now .
The combat is brutal in Mount & Blade : Warband .
You ca n’t charge into battle expecting to take 20 arrows to the chest and then have your health regenerate if you just hide behind a rock for seven seconds .
A few solid blows will raze even the strongest of men .
If you find yourself too far ahead of your army , you ’ll quickly be surrounded by the enemy and subsequently , your men will have to drag you from the field .
Discretion , tactics , and pace are the name of the game .
You need to know when to hold ’em , know when to fold ’em , know when to walk away and know when to run .
Also having your archers thin their numbers before your infantry reaches their front lines helps , too .
It is absolutely exhilarating when you win a battle against a team that outnumbers you .
And the feeling you get the first time you attempt to siege a castle is something I have n’t felt with gaming since I was much younger .
Nothing happens instantly in Mount & Blade : Warband .
It is an experience that is also an investment .
The amount of enjoyment that you get out of it is proportional to the time you put into it .
So , the more you play it , the more you enjoy it .
The more you enjoy it , the more you play it .
The campaign alone is as engrossing as any playthrough of Sid Meier ’s Pirates !.
You can marry .
You can become a ruler .
You can have other lords swear fealty to you .
You can do all this before even touching the 64 - player multiplayer experiences .
If the Mount & Blade series got the fresh coat of current generation makeover it deserves ( complete with voice acting ) , we ’d be looking at major major contender for PC game of the year no matter what year it was presented in .
It ’s easily one of my favorite games of this year .
I ’m not a “ graphics whore , ” but I can say without a doubt that the visuals in Mount & Blade : Warband are the biggest setback in the game experience .
Mount & Blade : Warband is going to keep a lot of gamers very happy for a very long time .
Sadly , most will never see past the incredibly dated graphics .
I love this game dearly , but I know it ’s not for everyone .
If you can truly say to yourself , “ visuals do n’t matter at all to me , ” or if you ’re a fan of the original Mount & Blade , then there is no reason to put off purchasing Warband .
It is truly a game meant for adults .
Be happy you ’re part of the “ in ” crowd .
But , as adults , we ’ve seen the evolution of gaming grow past this level of detail .
Most of us are probably spoiled with age , and there ’s nothing wrong with that .
If you do n’t fall into one of the two crowds listed above , then give the demo a try before you buy .
Some will be impressed into month - long gaming addictions .
The rest will brush it off and move on .
A bit more from the article :
Lehman Brothers had just filed for bankruptcy four days earlier and the Federal Reserve had authorized the New York Fed to lend up to $ 85 billion to insurance giant AIG .
That afternoon , she ( Pelosi ) called Paulson to ask for a full briefing the next morning .
" They said , ' That will be too late .
That will be too late .
Tomorrow morning , 9 o'clock will be too late , ' " Pelosi recalled .
In a meeting that evening with Congressional leaders and staff , Paulson , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , and others offered a dire assessment , and made an appeal for intervention that ultimately resulted in TARP .
Bernanke and Paulson beseeched the legislators to act quickly , warning that , the entire U.S. economy might collapse in days without rapid intervention .
But Pelosi had a question .
" I asked them , and said , ' Why am I calling you - why did n't you call me ? , " Pelosi said .
( snip )
" Here 's what they said .
They said , ' We were not allowed to tell Congress , but since you called , we 're going to answer your questions . ' "
Pelosi offered no hints as to why the Bush administration would prohibit its top lieutenants from speaking up about the need for federal intervention .
This is a MASSIVE indictment of the Bush Administration .
Not like we were n't already suspicious of the timing of the news back then - remember the awkward choreography of announcements coming from Paulson , Bush and eventually McCain 's failtastic Campaign suspension .
But to have our worst fears verified by none other than Nancy Pelosi is staggering news .
Kudos to her for finding a way to share it with the world .
I wonder what will happen now that we know .
UPDATE 1 : Also from Talking Points Memo - responses from Bushco people :
Michele Davis , spokeswoman for former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , now emails to say there was no pressure from the White House to keep crucial information about the looming financial crisis from Congress .
" [ N ] o one at Treasury ever felt in any way constrained by the White House from communicating with the Congress , " she writes .
and
Tony Fratto , who served as Deputy Press Secretary to President George W. Bush , says Pelosi 's claim is inaccurate .
" No one was barred from briefing Congress , " he emails .
" Congressional leaders were briefed , at President Bush 's direction , right after he was briefed .
Weak sauce , IMO .

Advertisement Conservationists say mink are re-establishing themselves in North Uist , despite years of work to eradicate the animals , at a total cost of more than £ 4 m .
Mink are ferocious predators and have devastated local wildlife in the Western Isles .
They arrived there in the 60s and 70s , after being imported by fur farmers .
Animals which escaped or were released into the wild illegally quickly increased in numbers .
Since 2001 , almost 2,000 mink have been culled .
The first phase of the Hebridean Mink Project focussed on North and South Uist and South Harris .
Phase two is focussing on the remainder of Harris and Lewis .
Iain Macleod , the project manager , says : " Unfortunately , we 've found that a small satellite population has re-established in the Uists .
" We 're not sure whether that 's because we missed them first time round or whether between the two phases of the project , some mink managed to slip past us down into Uist again .
" It was probably a combination of both those things .
But we have to manage that .
We 're dealing with an incredibly mobile animal that can survive in almost any habitat . "
The news that mink are re-establishing themselves in North Uist is being seen as a significant setback .
There were lots of dead birds , lots of chicks being decapitated
Martin Scott
RSPB Scotland
But conservationists say the Hebridean Mink Project has proved to be a success , and has already led to a significant increase in the number of ground nesting birds breeding in the Hebrides .
Martin Scott , of RSPB Scotland , says : " A lot of the birds , such as the terns which come every year , have shown that they 've responded well to the mink being removed .
We used to see devastation in the colonies .
" There were lots of dead birds , lots of chicks being decapitated , and we 're not seeing that any more .
The birds are now expanding out , and moving into new areas . "
The Hebridean Mink Project is now entering its final year .
The team of trappers are urging local people and visitors to report any sightings to help them ensure the islands can eventually be declared mink free .

The AP reports :
" Gay Zimbabweans face widespread harassment and some have even been raped by those intending to convert their sexuality , the U.S. State Department said in a discussion of its annual human rights report in Zimbabwe .
Gay men were forced into heterosexual acts and lesbian women were raped , sometimes by male relatives , to teach them to change their ways , said Amanda Porter , political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Harare and compiler of the report .
' Some families reportedly subjected men and women to corrective rape and forced marriages to encourage heterosexual conduct , ' she said Tuesday . "
Last week Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe responded to calls to make gay rights a part of the country 's revised constitution by saying , " Three days ago , I heard that some people want us to discuss the issue of gays in the new constitution .
How do we even begin to talk about it ?
Those who engage in homosexual behaviour are just crazy .
It ’s just madness .
Insanity .
We ca n’t do it or the dead will turn in their graves .
If you are doing that ( engaging in homosexuality ) , you are destroying nationhood . "
PAWTUCKET , RI — Nerf , the popular toy manufacturer , announced Tuesday that it was introducing a new line of foam - based biological weapons capable of causing " massive outbreaks of fun . "
The product promises " hours of unexpected panic - inducing fun . "

According to company officials , the Nerf biological weapons represent the next logical step in foam warfare , offering kids all the enjoyment of deploying a disease - causing agent , while still being safe for indoor play .
" Kids of all ages will have a blast striking their favorite domestic target with these new highly contagious , neon - colored pathogens , " Nerf CEO James Anderson told reporters .
" Whether contaminating their city 's water supply , or releasing an invisible cloud of airborne foam agents , our Nerf biological weapons will result in hours of enjoyment . "

Developed over the past 15 years by top toy designers in exile from Russia , the microscopic Nerf neurotoxins are sold in two sizes : Bacterial Blast and Pandemic Pump .
When released upon unsuspecting populations ages 6 and up , the cushy spores harmlessly infect a host by entering the nose , lungs , and eyes , before gently ricocheting off the internal organs .
Nerf has also introduced the new Rapid - Fire Mega - Poxx - 86 Inoculator , a distribution device capable of delivering 35 vials of brightly colored toy biohazards with pump-action precision .

" Get ready to feel your chest slowly fill with excitement ! " said Nerf spokesperson Patricia Mora , holding up a small plastic test tube filled with 10 milligrams of her company 's newest toy .
" Just grab a friend , unleash a few neon microorganisms , and prepare for a squishy attack on your entire central nervous system . "
According to the Nerf website , the incubation period for its latest line of playthings is 72 hours , but the excitement does n't stop there , primarily because Nerf - infected children unknowingly transmit the highly communicable toy microbes to everyone they encounter .
One vial of Nerf biotoxin , priced at $ 14.99 , can entertain up to 20 children or one densely populated metropolitan area for up to six unforgettable days .

The Nerf bioweapons reportedly offer a variety of " completely safe " physical symptoms ranging from coughing , to temporary respiratory paralysis , to breaking out in colored polka - dot hives , to harmlessly rolling on the ground doing what company officials have termed the " crazy seizure dance . "
" It was so cool , " 11 - year - old test user Alex Richanbach said .
" First I started shaking a little , and then I got really , really hot .
After that , everything went dark and dizzy , and when I woke up in the backyard , I puked up a bunch of foam balls . "
Advertisement
Added Richanbach , " Nerf biological weapons rule ! "
In time , Nerf plans to release accessories to complement the new line of bioterrorism toys , including Funmat suits , squishy canisters containing vaccines or " antifoamotics , " and a large plastic tarp with Velcro straps that can turn any bedroom into a Nerf triage unit .
The company will also sell the spongy pathogens in refill packs that can be used to create a never - ending biological weapons stockpile .

" Pending the success of the Nerf biological agents , we may begin work on our long - standing Nerfcular weapons program , " Anderson said .
" Within five years , we could be sitting on a Nerftron Bomb . "
Added Anderson , " The only part of your face that will get melted off is your frown ! "

At press time , company scientists were scrambling to locate more than 500 gallons of missing Nerf gas .

Good evening .
Tonight I ’d like to discuss a battle of modern politics with which every American is intimately familiar , and that is the so - called “ War on Drugs ” .
The discourse surrounding the war is among the most philosophically insightful of all the hot - button issues , and nothing says more about a politician ’s true principles than how he defends his position on drug use in America .
Through careful examination of political rhetoric we can see that , despite the recent trends towards decriminalizing marijuana , the philosophy of freedom is actually losing the fight for the minds of the American people , especially among the established politicians .
Even as drug laws grow more relaxed and penalties less severe , the government is actually tightening its control over the daily lives of innocent civilians .
To the enlightened individualist who recognizes non-violence and the freedom to choose as the hallmarks of great civilization , it is immediately clear that any production , retail , and consumption of drugs or any other products which do not cause harm to others is absolutely none of the government ’s business .
It is further clear to any literate person that the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the federal government from passing any legislation restricting the trade and use of drugs regardless of whether such actions harm others or not .
This of course has nothing whatsoever to do with any particular “ right to use drugs ” or lack thereof ; it is simply the moral and Constitutional mandate that one person cannot use coercion against another to control personal choices .
To advocate for the repeal of drug legislation is not an endorsement of drug use , but rather a rejection of assault and imprisonment as a response to non-violent actions .
Unfortunately , the battle cry of the mainstream anti-“ War on Drugs ” movement has become , “ Decriminalize , regulate , and tax ” , or “ DRT ” for short .
Presumably , the unusual word “ decriminalize ” is used here specifically to distinguish from legalization , as , for example , minor traffic violations are typically not criminal offenses , but are still illegal .
Regulation , of course , means only allowing government - approved vendors to sell government - approved drugs in government - approved quantities .
Furthermore , the concept of taxing drugs is invoked with the intent that they would be taxed above the rate of ordinary sales tax , just as cigarettes and alcohol already are .
This stance is philosophically void ; it signifies no fundamental change in how people interact with one another .
If the movement to end the War on Drugs takes the DRT form , it deserves to lose in Congress .
The DRT argument is not a moderate form of the Libertarian stance .
It is in fact a moderate form of the statist stance .
Advocates of personal freedom must not regard DRT as any improvement whatsoever over current laws for the simple reason that the DRT argument treats the question of government control of drugs as one of degree rather than of morality .
Both current laws and the proposed changes accept it as a foregone conclusion that certain people have the authority and the responsibility to use force to help others make personal decisions .
Neither side of the debate rejects philosophically the idea that aggression is a moral good , and so neither side is any better than the other .
Some freedom fighters have mistakenly fallen into the trap of thinking that the regulation of DRT only implies that harmful drugs will be kept out of the hands of small children .
This is of course not what the legislators intend by the term at all .
Keeping drugs away from children is regulating child care , not regulating drugs .
What the legislators mean is that they want to control who sells drugs and in what quantities , just as there are already huge barriers to entry in the bars and distillery industries .
When they say they will tax drugs , they mean to apply steep taxes to disincentivize the consumption of drugs , as if that is the government ’s prerogative or responsibility .
The establishment politicians , even the seemingly drug - friendly ones , have no intention of rejecting coercion and nanny - state values in favor of a philosophically individualist attitude towards drug use .
Their purportedly new ideas are just a rehashing of the well - worn and thoroughly despised statist programs .
Those who will oppose the live - free - or - die stance of the Tenthers and the Libertarians fall back on tired and intellectually lazy distractions masquerading as arguments .
Politicians will try to confuse the issue by citing collateral damage done by drug users operating vehicles on public roads .
This has nothing to do with the issue at hand , because drug legislation has nothing to do with roads , and no one has ever seriously suggested that druggies should be allowed to harm others without accountability .
The only point put forward by the Libertarians is that drug users who do not harm others should not be forbidden from pursuing their recreation on their own property .
Taxing drugs to disincentivize their use has no bearing on whether people drive while high or not , and so the latter should never be brought up in a debate about the former .
By far the most widespread counter - freedom argument on the issue of drugs is the fabled plea for moderation .
Almost all politicians and most citizens would not hesitate to agree with the statement that the government should not tell people how to live their lives if they are n’t hurting others .
However , when that philosophy is taken to its logical conclusion of repealing all drug laws , the average Congressman will retaliate with a criticism of “ absolutism ” , arguing that society should not take moral principles to “ extremes ” .
It is impossible to exaggerate how intellectually void and utterly meaningless this is as a defense .
To criticize an otherwise valid principle simply for being a principle is to abandon all hope for consistency and morality in the world .
To cry out against absolutism for no particular reason save that it is absolutism is the last , desperate act of a failing philosophy in the face of incontrovertible truth .
Essentially , a plea for moderation is nothing more than a spiteful admission of defeat .
The “ Decriminalize , regulate , and tax ” camp is as much of a moral failure as the War on Drugs itself , and the only legitimate stance to accept is that of complete legalization and individual choice .
The importance of this philosophical distinction cannot be overstated .
Ayn Rand once noted that sociologists and historians go to extraordinary lengths researching trends in history to try to explain events , but that she was able , with relatively little intellectual effort , to predict events by understanding the philosophical motivations of the various schools of thought in modern politics .
Even John Maynard Keynes declared
“ The ideas of economists and political philosophers are more powerful than is commonly understood .
Indeed , the world is ruled by little else .
Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence are usually the slaves of some defunct economist . ”
I am here to tell you that I am a philosopher .
I know why people do things , based not only on their moral values but on the even more fundamental structures of epistemology and ontology that guide their whole lives .
Because of this , I can predict the future of politics more accurately than any sociologist who tries to study only statistics and feelings as if they are dissociated from logic and the mind .
I have analyzed the theory of the War on Drugs and its associated debate , and I have educated myself as to how others perceive the situation .
If you wish to know what will happen with the War on Drugs , I will tell you .
The War on Drugs will never be won .
It is far too late for the central planners to put the genie back in the bottle and convince society that drugs are a paralyzing threat to the nation .
However , the anti-War movement will not succeed , either .
As the federal debt continues to climb and the prison crisis grows ever more severe , decriminalization and the increased nullification of federal marijuana legislation will be inevitable , but full legalization of all drugs will not be realized .
The efforts of Congressmen Ron Paul and Barney Frank to promote individual freedom will continue to make repealing drug laws a cool way for establishment politicians to appeal to younger voters , but the establishment will never renounce government control as a fundamental value .
The consequences of this intellectual laziness will be far more severe than is presently believed .
In fact , the government will reassert itself in another decade or two with a new crusade for our protection .
This post - War on Drugs phenomenon will actually be more restrictive and affect more Americans than the current battle , because it will be excused as being more relevant to the functionality of society .
The demon will be bad nutrition and health habits .
The so - called fight against childhood obesity will merge with the campaigns to outlaw trans fats and excess salt consumption .
Nanny state do - gooders from the Left - wing establishment will incite rage and riot among naive Right - wingers by complaining that unhealthy , lazy , fat people are bankrupting the nation ’s health - care systems .
They will rally the false fiscal conservatives into an elitist fit and decry the unhealthy scum that pollutes our nation the same way illegal immigrants and the unemployed are resented by the dumber Republicans today .
The same underlying principle of the government protecting individuals from the substances they choose to consume under the guise of promoting general health will lead to a far more disruptive and personally invasive institution than the War on Drugs ever has .
Granted , it is unlikely that half a million people will go to jail for eating too much salt , but they may be chastised regularly by public school officials .
Restaurants will be forced to submit to periodic menu evaluations , and folks with a sweet tooth will be forced to pay high taxes to offset their own choices .
In the long term , mainstream American society will pay dearly for its decision to marginalize drug users today .
All tyranny and oppression begins with small groups who are easy to criticize and treat as plagues upon the larger national population .
Once the philosophy of individual liberty has been supplanted by state - enforced “ wellness ” and collective decision - making , the regulations become ever - more invasive and destructive to everyday people .
The transition from minor regulation of drug use to absolute Orwellian totalitarianism is merely one of degree , and the inherent nature of government is to gradually exploit whatever power is given to it more and more as time goes by .
Thank you all for listening .
I ’ve got some procedural and promotional business to attend to tonight .
I ’ve decided that , in order to diversify my content and communicate better with my listeners , every fifth audio track I publish will discuss topics and questions suggested by the fans .
The Worst - Case Scenario has a Facebook page , and you can find the link here or on the Connections and Networking page of the blog .
Add the page on Facebook and submit any questions , comments , or ideas you may have to the Discussions section .
I want to do these in Discussions rather than on the Wall because that encourages multiple people to post their thoughts on a particular topic .
As I said I ’ll do these user - submitted episodes every fifth time , so I ’ve got one more of my own after this and then I will take submissions .
Please post your thoughts and questions for me on the Facebook page and share it with your friends .
Thank you .
Young girl becomes first tenant of Capsule Apartment
From Legal Evening News :
The end of last month , a 78 year old retired engineer Huang Rixin ( 黄日新 ) built 8 units of “ Capsule Apartment ” in Liulangzhuang , Haidian district in Beijing .
Each unit is less than 2 square meters and can only fit a single bed .
The monthly rent for each unit is between 200 – 250 yuan .
After the apartments were built , no one has ever come by .
So Huang Rixin opened up the apartment units for “ test - living ” .
After test - living , last night “ Capsule Apartment ” finally welcomed its first tenant !
10 pm at night , Zhang Qi is reading in bed in the “ Capsule Apartment ”
At 8 pm last night , a 25 year old girl , Zhang Qi ( 张琪 ) of Shanxi carried all her belongings – a small suit case and moved into her new place .
Short haired and wearing a short shirt , her face was full of sunshine .
Zhang Qi was in Beijing for the past 5 years , currently works at an advertising company in Guangqumen .
Her monthly salary is 3000 – 4000 yuan .
Couple days ago she found out that the Capsule Apartment allows “ test - living ” , so she came .
5 days later , most of the people “ test - lived ” there one by one all moved away , she was the only person brought all her belongings and decided to stay for long term .
She became the first tenant of the capsule apartment .
“ I was not very adjusted on the first day ” Zhang Qi said , the insulation was not so good , and all her neighbors were migrant workers so it was very noisy at night .
And she did not bring a thick enough blanket , so she was very cold and could n’t sleep on the first night .
“ But I am getting use to it ! ” Zhang Qi smiled and said while she was unpacking .
Last night she brought over cotton fabrics , wallpapers and scissors etc. happily started detracting her new home .
She first used cotton fabrics as her “ ceiling ” then put up the wallpapers .
“ There is a fairy tale world in every girl ’s heart ” Zhang Qi said , in here she can achieve her Beijing dream .
The only inconvenience Zhang Qi felt is the toilet and shower , she must walk outside from her third floor apartment at night to go to the bathroom , and must go to the bath house for shower .
But Zhang
Qi felt that she can overcome if others can .
Before this she shared an apartment with others and paid 800 yuan per month , but now she has her independent space .
Zhang
Qi planned to stay here at least for one year , “ if possible I would live her until I get married . ”
The neighbor migrant workers all do not understand , “ we all dislike living here , why would this little girl like to live here ? ”
Today , the designer of the apartment huang Rixin was pleased and said , “ someone is renting , that means my design was acknowledged . ”
A reporter wanting to experience this kind of life became Zhang Qi ’s next door neighbor .
Zhang Qi putting up paintings to decorate her apartment
Hallway of the Capsule Apartment has Transparent glass floor that sees through downstairs .
Dialogue with Zhang Qi :
( 法制晚报 : Legal Evening News hereafter referred as FW ) :
What are the main reasons for you to live here ?
Zhang :
My father died in 2008 , my mother does not work and my sister just graduated .
The money I save can help my family .
FW : Do your family and friends know that you are living here ?
Zhang : I just broke up with my boyfriend .
All my good friends knew , wait till I finish decorating and I will invite them over .
They even all think I am very “ hip ” .
I felt that running around in life , there is no need to tell my family .
FW : Do you think living here is depressing ?
Zhang :
This is my own space ; you can put up your own photos , feels kind of successful .
People are born equal ; living here does not mean the future will not be good , maybe a lot of artists will appear here !
FW : Do you think it is safe here ?
Zhang :
Safe or not I did not think about , I feel most people are good .
FW : Do you have plans to buy a house ?
Zhang : Actually in 2008 , I used my own money and helps from my mother bought a small home in Shunjing , 20 square meters , no property rights , only 130,000 yuan , now it is worth 220,000 yuan .
I am renting it out for 1,200 a month .
JOHANNESBURG —
They ’re calling him the World Cup ’s “ loose vuvuzela . ”
They ’re swooning as he spreads the love , jumping into his players ’ arms like some cuddly bear with diamond earrings and no neck .
They ca n’t get enough of his deadpan quotes , as when he responds to a question about his kiss - and - hug management style by saying he still prefers women , specifically his girlfriend “ Veronica who is blonde and 31 . ”
At 49 , Diego Armando Maradona is neither blonde nor 31 .
But he is Mr. Unscripted in the age of spin , the Hugo Chávez of global soccer .
As coach of an outrageously talented Argentine team , one thrown together in the image of his own extravagant skills , Maradona is having a good World Cup .
To genius much is permitted .
And so it should be .
The contrast with some of Maradona ’s more pinched rivals , including the French coach Raymond Domenech and the England manager Fabio Capello , could not be more extreme .
Domenech wears the expression of a man who ’d rather be reading Foucault as “ Les Bleus ” implode and then take to the barricades in open mutiny .
Clive Head ( b. 1965 ) is the leading British realist painter of his generation , known for his striking paintings of urban landscapes .
He has achieved a worldwide reputation and his work is held in private and public collections internationally .
Although there is a clear link between Head 's work and the traditions of American Photorealism , the paintings extend that tradition by drawing on a European history of art , with the result that Head 's work is as much a descendant of Canaletto , Constable and Ginner as Estes , Bectel and Goings .
In his working method , Head seeks to embody a strong sense of place , not simply as a record of the look of a place , but as the expression of a place by a particular person .
This is the first full - length monograph on his work and sets out to introduce it to a wider audience .
It incorporates a short history of Clive Head 's work to date , examining a number of his paintings in detail in order to illuminate his working processes .
Michael Paraskos argues that Head 's paintings , in their depiction of multiple viewpoints , have parallels with Cubism , although unlike the Cubists Head seeks to unify multiple viewpoints into a coherent scene , so that the shattering effect disappears .
This places Head at the forefront of contemporary aesthetic theory and practice as he seeks to reinvent realist painting for the twenty - first century .
The book is illustrated with 100 large - format images , which will help to establish Clive Head as a leading figure in contemporary painting .
Apple today wowed investors this afternoon with an impressive earnings report that toppled Wall St. estimates yet again .
For the 2Q of 2010 , Apple reported EPS of $ 3.33 a share on revenue of $ 13.5 billion .
Net profits for the quarter came in at $ 3.07 billion , which is nearly 90 % higher than Apple ’s profits from the same quarter a year - ago .
During the 2Q of 2009 , Apple reported EPS of $ 1.79 a share on revenue of $ 8.2 billion .
Put simply , business is booming .
In terms of inventory , Apple sold 2.94 million Macs during the quarter , representing a 33 % increase from the same quarter a year - ago .
i Phone sales measured across the same period increased 131 % , coming in at 8.75 million units during the quarter .
iPod sales , meanwhile , checked in at 10.89 million units sold , representing a 1 % decline from the same quarter a year - ago .
“ We ’re thrilled to report our best non-holiday quarter ever , with revenues up 49 percent and profits up 90 percent , ” Steve Jobs said in an Apple Press Release .
“ We ’ve launched our revolutionary new iPad and users are loving it , and we have several more extraordinary products in the pipeline for this year . ”
Think about that .
Apple ’s revenues were up by about 50 % , but their profit levels almost doubled .
That ’s unbelievable .
Prior to Apple ’s earnings announcement , the consensus on Wall Street was that Apple would report earnings of $ 2.45 a share on revenue of $ 12.04 billion .
In fact , the highest estimate from over 25 polled analysts was from Turley Muller of Financial Alchemist who anticipated EPS of $ 2.81 on revenue of $ 12.87 billion .
o yeah , Apple smashed through even the most bullish of analyst predictions , with ease .
The curse of Bush
By Kate Sheppard
The Obama administration has faced harsh criticism for its oversight of offshore oil and gas development in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
The most absurd commentary , of course , comes from Republicans who have consistently pushed back against any attempts to regulate industry for years .
The administration has been fighting back , but no one wants to actually call the problem by its name : the Bush administration .
At a House hearing Wednesday , Doug Lamborn ( R - Colo . ) accused Salazar of " harping on what MMS did or did n't do in the previous administration .
" Why are n't we talking about the here and now ? " asked Lamborn .
Salazar shot back about the efforts they 've taken to reform the beleaguered agency .
" Unlike the prior administration , this is not the candy store for the oil and gas kingdom that you and others were a part of , " he deadpanned .
At another point in the hearing , he pointed out , again without naming names , that an official at the department was sent to federal prison for obstruction of justice under the previous administration .
( That would be Steven Griles , a deputy secretary at the department from 2001 to 2004 ) .
On Thursday , when MMS head Elizabeth Birnbaum was pushed out of her post as head of the Minerals Management Service , her statement pointed back to the Bush administration , again without naming it directly , for leaving the MMS a deeply dysfunctional institution when she took over last July .
She said that she hopes the reforms that Salazar has proposed for the agency " will resolve the flaws in the current system that I inherited . "
It happened again Thursday when Obama made reference the past decade of cozy relations between industry and regulators .
Eight of those years , of course , were under Bush .
That was also when the porn , meth , and oil parties were happening in Lake Charles , La. , office and the sex , coke , and oil parties were happening in the Lakewood , Colo. , office .
In fact , if you look at all the failures at MMS that may have contributed to this disaster , the vast majority happened under Bush .
It 's not that the Obama administration MMS has been blameless .
There was , of course , the lack of environmental analysis on the gulf well and the pitiful review of BP 's oil spill response " plan . "
There was also a less - than - flattering piece on Birnbaum in the New York Times this week .
It did n't paint her as an active problem at the agency , however , but rather gave the impression that she was n't up to the task of reforming such a screwed up division .
From what folks who know her have told me , she was well intentioned , if significantly unprepared for the job .
So Republican badgering of the administration over the issue is fairly absurd .
Fixing the troubled agency was one of the very first things Salazar sought to address after taking office , announcing a restructuring of MMS 's royalty - in - kind program , calling for a Justice Department investigation , and instating a new conduct code for the agency in the first days after taking office .
The Obama Department of Interior could have done more , of course , to improve the beleaguered agency .
But the root of this is still the one name they wo n't say : George W. Bush .

British Library to digitise 40 m of its newspaper pages
More than 40 m pages could be scanned and digitised in the first two years
The British Library has announced a 10 - year project to make 40 m pages from its newspaper archive available online .
The record of more than 300 years of journalism , including coverage of the Crimean and Boer Wars , will be put on the web by the publisher BrightSolid .
The move will spare historians having to search the current hard copy and microfilm collection .
The digital material will be made free to users at the main library site at St Pancras , north London .
A charge will be levied for searches conducted from outside the library .
The British Library 's archive contains about 750 m newspaper pages , including 52,000 local , regional , national and international titles .
' Rich detail '
Over 10 years the project will give internet users their first chance to search stories and articles on international events such as the Crimean and Boer wars and the Suffragette movement .
Pages written during the census years between 1841 and 1911 will also be made available online .
BrightSolid said it aims to complete the digitisation of more than 4 m pages within the first two years .
It will offer a unique insight into major events and key periods of historical interest
Chris van der Kuyl
BrightSolid chief executive Lynne Brindley , chief executive of the British Library , said : " Historic newspapers are an invaluable resource for historians , researchers , genealogists , students and many others , bringing past events and people to life with great immediacy and in rich detail .
" By making these pages fully searchable we will transform a research process which previously relied on scrolling through page after page of microfilm or print .
" It will help the newspaper collection to remain relevant for a new generation of researchers , more used to accessing research information via their laptop than travelling to a physical location . "
BrightSolid chief execuitve Chris van der Kuyl said : " Digitisation will mean that those people who have n't previously been able to access the physical resource will now be able to access it from anywhere at anytime .
" It will also offer a unique insight into major events and key periods of historical interest . "
The hard copies of the pages will be moved to Boston Spa , West Yorkshire .
A digital copy of the scanned material will also be archived in the library 's national collection .

LIMA , Peru —
An offshore natural gas exploration rig leased to Venezuela ’s national oil company sank off the coast of northeastern Venezuela and forced the authorities to evacuate all 95 of its workers , President Hugo Chávez announced early Thursday .
It was unclear if the sinking posed an environmental risk .
In an attempt to calm nerves after the explosion of an offshore drilling rig last month in the Gulf of Mexico , Venezuelan energy officials said that there would be no harm since security mechanisms were quickly put in place to stop any leaking .
The cause of the sinking was unclear .
Mr. Chávez , who made the initial announcement about the sunken rig via his account on Twitter , also said that two Venezuelan Navy patrols were sent to the waters near the rig , which is owned by a subsidiary of Aban Offshore , India ’s largest oil rig company .
“ You know this platform is semi- submergible , ” Mr. Chávez told his followers on Twitter .
“ At midnight it listed , took on water , ceased operations and they evacuated , ” he said .
Mr. Chávez has recently begun using Twitter in an attempt to reach out to people in Venezuela and beyond .

What exactly makes the new video for M.I.A. so objectionable that the YouTube Web site took it out of circulation ?
asks Alexander Billet .
PLENTY OF graphic content can be found on YouTube .
From executions by firing squad to clips of Vietnamese children covered in napalm , the blood and gore seem in no short supply .
What might be harder to find , however , is the new video from M.I.A .
The British / Sri Lankan artist ( whose real name is Mathangi Arulpragasam ) is no stranger to controversy .
She 's also no stranger to choosing sides .
It 's this that might have the suits up in arms over her video , but it 's also what makes her one of the most important artists of our era .
When " Born Free " premiered on April 26 , the Google - owned video site swiftly buried it , claiming that the official clip was in violation of rules that " prohibit content like pornography or gratuitous violence . "
A firestorm of protest swept the Internet in the days that followed .
M.I.A. herself lashed out , and countless supporters backed her up .
Though YouTube was quick to point out that " Born Free " was not actually banned , they have also " age - gated " the video , meaning that only 18 - and - over viewers can find it .
This , combined with a vigorous amount of " flagging " from uptight viewers , has made the vid a challenging find .
A scene from M.I.A.'s video for " Born Free "
Anyone even vaguely familiar with YouTube will attest to what a crock this is .
Viewers can already find everything from soft - core porn to outright hate speech on the site , none of which seems to offend Google 's " standards . "
So what is it that makes " Born Free " so objectionable ?
The song itself , to be included on her upcoming , as - yet untitled album , is a full - on sonic assault .
Listeners only familiar with " Paper Planes " may wonder where the Clash - era hooks went , and why they 've been replaced by a thumping , buzzing , chopped - and - screwed techno beat .
And while her familiar swagger remains intact , there is no doubt that this is an angrier , more frustrated M.I.A. :
I throw this in your face when I see ya
I got something to say
I throw this shit in your face when I see ya
Cause I got something to say
It 's a taunt directed ( in this case with appropriate irony ) at the forces that have resented her success .
She 's defiant as ever , but with a more palpable dose of rage .
One might wonder whether the experience of seeing her native Sri Lanka torn apart in the recent civil war -- and the corresponding genocide against the country 's Tamil population -- has had any influence on this .

The video answers with an unmistakable yes .
More short film than music video , it 's nine minutes long - - double the time of the song itself .
Like any good film , the music takes a backseat to the action onscreen .
Directed by Romain Gavras ( son of legendary French left - wing filmmaker Costa Gavras ) , it follows a SWAT - like platoon of storm troopers as they raid an apartment complex in an unnamed city .
The men , who all display American flags on their upper - right sleeves , are brutal as they prowl from dwelling to dwelling , beating innocent bystanders without mercy , shouting insults and epithets .
Finally , they find who they 're looking for , and it's only after this nameless young man is shoved onto the bus that we realize their quarry are all fair - skinned , red - headed men .
As the bus drives away , a trio of young redheads with keffiyehs wrapping their faces emerge from behind a corner , throwing rocks and raising their fists .
The shocking parallels continue .
The bus reaches its destination , a compound that looks like a mixture of Abu Ghraib and the U.S. - Mexico border .
One prisoner , a boy not one day over 12 years old , is shot in the head point - blank before the rest are forced to run across a minefield .
The video 's climax is a full - frontal shot of one of the redheads literally being blown to bits .
WHAT STARTS as a straightforward satire ends as a graphic statement -- and one that 's unfortunately applicable worldwide .
That repression of any ethnic group -- be it Arabs in Gaza or Latinos in Arizona -- makes about as much sense as rounding up gingers .
And therein may lie the reason some of the honchos at Google took particular offense .
As the Chicago Tribune 's Kyra Kyles quipped , " Maybe the mistake M.I.A. made was using violence and brief nudity to make a political statement . "
As for M.I.A. , a refugee who was forced to flee to the UK because of her father 's role in the Tamil liberation struggle , she comes honest by her outspoken views : " I do have a political background .
I 'm only in England , learning this language and building a life in this society , because of political reasons .
Why would I deny that ? "
At a time when music is becoming increasingly segregated , her work is truly unclassifiable , pulling on punk , electroclash , grime , hip - hop , dancehall and just about anything else she can use as a vehicle to speak out on sexism , the " war on terror " and poverty in the developing world .
All these elements have combined to make her face one of the most recognized and respected in music .
It 's also made her an easy scapegoat .
The " Born Free " fiasco is only the latest to be visited on M.I.A. by various authorities since the start of her musical career .
A brief list would include the following :
2004 : MTV bans her video for " Sunshowers , " the second single off her debut Arular , after she refuses to remove references to the Palestine Liberation Organization .
2006 : M.I.A. is denied entry to the United States , where she was scheduled to work on her second album with producer Timbaland .
No reason is given for the denied visa , but rumors swirl that it is connected to her father 's political ties .
2009 : In the heat of the civil war , M.I.A. accuses the Sri Lankan government of " genocide " against the Tamil minority .
Government spokesperson Palitha Kohona shoots back that she is " misinformed , " and that she should " stay with what she 's good at , which is music , not politics . "
The New York Times labels her " an apologist for the Tamil Tiger rebels , " despite her denunciation of the Tigers ' tactics .
2010 : More apparent visa troubles .
M.I.A. reports that she is " Banned from leaving the U.S. , family banned from coming to U.S. to see me , baby ... "
IT SEEMS safe to say that few artists of her profile have had to deal with this many headaches .
Just as telling as this kind of censorship , however , is the massive popularity she 's achieved , despite all the obstacles .
Kala , the album she was almost prevented from making after the visa problems , is recognized as one of the best releases of 2007 , and has sold over a million copies worldwide .
In 2009 , even as the Times and Sri Lankan government were branding her one shade off a terrorist , Time magazine named M.I.A. one of the " World 's Most Influential People . "
In six years , she 's gone from a virtual unknown to darling of the indie scene to a musical flashpoint of rebellion in an increasingly globalized culture .
If there 's one thing to pull from the minor online shitstorm around " Born Free , " it 's further proof of the growing contradiction in that same culture .
On the one hand , it 's clear that those in power will do almost anything to keep these kinds of ideas , this kind of art , from gaining a hearing .
On the other , when people hear music that they relate to in a visceral way , there 's ultimately little that can be done to stop it .
Anyone who thinks M.I.A.'s implacable momentum can be stopped by burying her video is in for a rude awakening when the album is released this June .

You could say the rare flat - headed cat of Southeast Asia belongs in a category all its own :
The feline has webbed feet , a strangely streamlined head , and it prefers swimming in swampy peat forests .
But the flat - headed cat 's unusually aquatic lifestyle may also doom it :
More than half of its lowland habitat is quickly becoming vast biofuel plantations , a new study says .
One of the least - studied felines , the 3.3 - pound ( 1.5 - kilogram ) cat likely eats fish and crabs .
Its streamlined head may provide speed in the water , although that 's pure speculation , said study co-author Andreas Wilting of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin , Germany .
To get a loose estimate of the elusive cat 's population , Wilting and colleagues pieced together scattered records of flat - headed cat sightings since 1984 .
Their findings jibe with a previous estimate by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , which found fewer than 2,500 breeding individuals of the nocturnal animal roaming rain forest pockets in Thailand , Malaysia , Brunei , and Indonesia ( see regional map ) .
The team then combined the population estimate with climate records from the same time period to make a computer model that predicted where the cat once lived and where it likely lives now .
The results revealed the biggest threats to the endangered species .
The new study suggests that the cat 's numbers can only decrease as more of the region 's swamps are drained to plant palms , which are grown for oil used in biofuel production .
Flat - Headed Cat Is " Sexy " Conservation Symbol
The new model helped the team identify 19 hot spots that need to be protected for the flat - headed cat to survive , said Wilting , whose study appeared March 17 in the journal PLoS ONE .
Most of the region 's established protected areas sit at higher elevations , offering no haven for the lowland - dwelling species .
The scientists were surprised to discover that the cat has never been sighted in upland rain forests , which suggests the species is entirely dependent on swamps and rivers for its food .
In coming months , the team will share their model and recommendations with government officials in Southeast Asia , Wilting added .
" It makes no sense to publish [ in ] scientific journals if we do n't bring the details to the people who can implement things on the ground , " Wilting said .
The researchers also hope their work will help get the flat - headed cat appointed as a symbol of the threatened Southeast Asian ecosystem the species calls home .

Rocket Mass Heater Plans - now free for a while
Last month 's release of the KDE 4.4 desktop environment restored the faith of many after what has been something of a roller coaster two years .
Even the most loyal KDEians found that loyalty stretched by the debut of version 4.0 in 2008 .
Reassessing , and with hindsight , I think it 's fair to characterize the whole saga as both a cautionary tale and an admirable example .
Admirable , because the KDE team has displayed a quality that is so often lacking in open source software development : leadership .
By 2008 , thanks to its stability , performance and feature - set , KDE3 had become one of the best desktops on the computer scene .
However , it was becoming clear that a successor , KDE4 , would represent a significant break with the past - the best was about to get even better .
More than a mere upgrade , it was to be a complete rewrite and absolutely packed with mouth - watering technology .
To the credit of the development team , they released largely on time , but it was a release that pushed the community first to bafflement and then resentment .
It was unusable - and when I say unusable , I mean it literally could n't be used for any serious work - due to stability and performance problems .
To most people , a 4.0 release means a new version of a finished product , yet the general consensus was that KDE4 ran like an alpha .
To top it off , it lagged behind KDE3 in terms of features .
The other jarring aspect of KDE4 was that the changes that had been made were so bold .
For example , music player Amarok had been an application that had evoked the sacred phrase , " killer app " , magic words that desktop Linux desperately needs to have associated with it .
It was , however , like so many of the old favorites , nominated for a rewrite and redesign .
It 's much improved since the initial , disappointing release , but it still does n't quite have feature parity with the final KDE3 version .
Konqueror , the file manager / web browser combination was another beloved , if slightly eccentric , KDE fixture that found itself depreciated in favor of something new .
Just what were team KDE thinking in terms of pushing me out of my comfort zone ?
The answer : they were doing what had to be done .
KDE had reached the end of the line and needed to be restarted to keep up , and begin to lead , in the world of desktop environments .
Some of the decisions were criticized , but there 's a saying that good leadership is always in dispute .
The problems that did crop up were due to poor communication and a determination to release on schedule , no matter what .
Two years on , things are back on track .
It 's perhaps time to begin a campaign of telling people who left KDE , " it 's safe to come back ! " .
As it stands , not only is KDE 4.4 a superb desktop , thanks to the new frameworks that are now in place the potential for new developments is almost overwhelming .
Personally , I would n't hesitate to recommend KDE4 .
However , it 's been a rocky couple of years getting here .
It ’s been quite a while since we last heard any new material from Dido , but she recently had a new track entitled Everything To Lose included on the OST for the new Sex and The City movie .
In what may come as a surprise to some , this track is has a strong electronic feel to it , which is quite a step away from her previous work .
Everything To Lose is precursor to the style and direction that she will take on her upcoming fourth studio album .
The long intro may freak a few of you out , but stick with it because it ’s worth it if you do .
Her brother Rolo ( who is also part of UK dance act Faithless ) has previously worked on material included on Dido ’s Life For Rent and No Angel albums , but he will be stepping into his element with her new album .
I ca n’t bloody wait for it ’s release as I think it will be a massive step in Dido ’s career which will hopefully see her return to her rightful place at the top of the charts .

Tax dodging in Greece is so rampant that the Bank of Greece estimates the country could be losing as much as five billion euros a year .
While that 's a far cry from the € 54 billion needed for 2010 , it could result in much harsher cuts as the country tries to get out from under its crushing debts .
That lost tax money would have nullified the need for Greece 's planned 10 - year bond issue , which is expected to raise up to € 5 billion , or a set of new austerity measures to cut € 2.5 billion , which the government will discuss this week with European Union and International Monetary Fund officials .
Despite decent annual economic growth , Greece was receiving less in tax revenue than its EU peers .
As Bloomberg reported last week :
Greece 's revenue from income tax was 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007 , compared with an EU average of 8 percent , EU statistics show .
Tax revenue fell by 2.5 percentage points of GDP between 2000 and 2007 to a euro region - low of 32 percent even as economic growth averaged 4.1 percent a year .
Greece 's tax collectors seem unperturbed by their underperformance :
They went on strike last week to protest the government 's austerity measures .
Anecdotes suggest that the evasion may be even worse .
An anonymous Greek banker wrote in a blogged - about note :
On the official statistics alone , we are comfortably in the world 's top 40 for per capita GDP .
But that 's peanuts .
Lest we forget , that 's our declared income .
Do n't quote me on this apocryphal statistic , but I 'm reliably informed that exactly six Greeks declared more than a million EUR in income last time anybody counted .
And exactly 85 declared more than half a million .
So we 're probably a bit better than top 40 .
Either that , or this trading floor alone has more rich people than Greece .
Hell , our new recruits for this season alone could probably do it .
If you have any doubts about Greek wealth , check out on Bloomberg the balance sheet of the National Bank of Greece , Eurobank , Alphabank and Piraeus bank , the top four .
The four of them alone command EUR 164 billion in deposits !
Slightly misleading , since they all have operations in the Balkans , but that 's almost one GDP , lying in deposits !!!
More to the point , how many Greeks do you know who keep their money in Greece ?
That 's merely our spending money , it 's a small fraction of our savings and assets .
The anonymous banker also notes that since much of Greece 's debt is in foreign hands , a default could be more painful for the world at large -- especially EU counterparts like Italy who are also facing massive deficits -- than for Greeks who have untaxed funds stashed away in foreign denominations .
A while ago , I was determined not to write a play for a well - known theatre .
Just before going to see the artistic director , I ran into the designer Bob Crowley in the bar .
" I 'm going upstairs , " I said firmly , " to tell him I 'm not going to do it .
I do n't have the time and anyway , I do n't want to . "
Next day , Bob rang me .
" You know that play you 're not going to write ? " he asked .
" Well , I 'm designing it . "
To this day , I 'm not sure what happened when I went into the room .
I took one look and before a word had been spoken , I knew I was lost .
Later , I recalled James Carville , Bill Clinton 's Southern lieutenant : " Once you 're asked , you 're fucked . "
So much attention has recently been concentrated on the fortunes of battle that nobody has been ready to address the likelihood that , when the smoke clears , we will probably wake up with a new prime minister .
Yes , the election campaign will have failed to address Afghanistan , Iraq , collusion in torture , climate change , the future of Europe and the collapse of the capitalist system .
But tomorrow that much will be history .
Instead we 're going to be asking : what sort of prime minister will David Cameron be ?
If he can't even seal the deal , how on earth is he going to implement it ?
All leadership depends on the defining ability to persuade people to do things they do n't want to do .
My first sighting of Cameron was in his shirtsleeves , doing one of his quick - fire question - and - answer sessions with 250 students in Brighton .
Afterwards I did a straw poll outside on the lawn .
The ones who went in liking him came out liking him ; the ones who were n't sure still were n't sure ; and the ones who had n't liked him still did n't .
After 45 minutes , he had n't changed a single mind .
In his punishingly boring 410 - page book of interviews with the editor of GQ , Cameron goes on record as saying that his favourite karaoke song is A Hard Day 's Night " because I find it 's better to sing something old , something familiar and something fairly easy to sing " .
But if , as he promises , he plans to inflict the most savage public service cuts in history , he will soon be singing a very difficult song indeed .
An entire population will be asked to act against their own immediate interests .
Nobody has yet observed that convincing them is a task for which Cameron does not seem cut out .
As one Tory MP confided to me : " He 's not the kind of person who , if you 've suffered a misfortune , is going to put his arm round you and say : ' Bad luck , old chap . ' "
After Hillary Clinton had been insulted by Obama in a candidates ' debates , she had no desire to serve under him .
But as soon as she was called to the White House , she knew she had to be his secretary of state .
And a remarkable success she 's making of it .
She has even begun to move US Middle East policy away from the madness of Jerusalem and closer to the wisdom of Tel Aviv and of Ramallah .
Clinton took the job against her own instincts because , finally , when you say " I have to do it for Barack , " it sounds convincing .
It makes sense .
So does " I have to do it for Maggie . "
And so , for a while , did " I have to do it for Tony . "
But nobody in their right mind will say " I have to do it for Dave . "
Why not ?
Because you do n't believe he would ever do anything for you .
Man downloading and watching porn at home fined 3,000 yuan
From Netease :
A young man named Yang Huajun ( not his real name ) likes to go online , one time by chance he joined a QQ group , and the members of the group often posted some pornographic videos and pictures .
Out of curiosity , Yang Huajun often watched these pornographic materials , not for long , he started to download them in order to view them at any time .
Until he was arrested by the local police , he was not aware of that his action had violated the law .
Yesterday , Nanxi County Yibing City Public Security Bureau ’s network monitoring unit responsible person said :
This unit has just cracked a case of allegedly using the Internet to spread and copy pornographic contents .
The suspect Yang Huajun was arrested .
On February 26 , 10 am , Yang Huajun had just turned off his computer and was preparing to go out from his home , then he heard a knock on his door .
He thought it was his relatives so he hurried to open the door .
When the door was open , there were numbers of unfamiliar faces ; these strangers were the police officers of the Yibing Public Security Bureau network monitoring unit and the Nanxi County Public Security Bureau network monitoring unit .
The police examined Yang Huajun ’s laptop computer and a desktop computer hard drives and identified a large number of pornographic materials allegedly downloaded from the Internet , including 39 video files ( about 7 gigabytes ) , 526 pornographic pictures ( about 80 megabytes ) .
After the arrest , Yang Huajun confessed that he always loved the Internet .
About six month ago , by chance , he joined a QQ group , dozens of the group members from time to time uploaded a few obscene pornographic videos and pictures , including some erotic videos and photos of celebrities in the entertainment circles , such as photos of naked actresses in the “ sexy photo gate ” ( Edison Chen photo scandal ) .
“ I was very curious , so often go to the group to browse ” Yang said , and later it became a habit .
For the ease of viewing , he directly downloaded some of the obscene pornographic videos and pictures onto his computers at home and built a dedicated folder so he could view them at any time .
Before the Spring Festival this year , the police began casting a huge net for catching the suspects using the Internet to spread pornography .
Nanxi County Public Security Bureau Network monitoring unit was directed by the Yibin City police , to take over these big cases of distributing porn on the Internet .
After receiving the order Nanxi county leaders , county Public Security Bureau chief Peng Yunli immediately asked the County network monitoring unit to investigate in the shortest time possible , to gather evidence and lock down the suspects .
Yibin City and Nanxi County , two network monitoring surveillance departments investigated from nearly 30 leads .
And after half of month , one QQ number repeatedly jumped into their sights .
After verifying that QQ number account often downloaded obscene videos and pictures from the Internet , its owner Yang Huajun was quickly locked up by the police .
According the captain of the network monitoring team Liu Yngna , the suspect when captured did not know his action of downloading pornography violated the law .
He thought watching porn at home did not provoke anyone else .
He reminds the public to pay attention to the connection between the virtual community and the real world .
Online and offline are connected , when people ’s actions in the virtual world are “ dishonorable ” can still be a crime .
Liu Yingnan pointed out that the suspect only was watching porn at home , he did not distribute them or try to make a profit .
According to the 1997 “ Computer Information Network and the Internet Security Protection and Management Law ” promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security :
Any organization or individual may not make use of the International network for copying , viewing and distributing obscene , pornographic contents .
Yang Huajun was punished with a warning and a 3,000 yuan fine .
The state of Texas has decided to rearrange history to indoctrinate students with GOP propaganda .
Today , the right - wing Texas State Board of Education ( SBOE ) will give final approval of content for state social studies curriculum .
The standards will “ dictate what is taught in all Texas schools and provide the basis for textbooks and student achievement tests over the next decade . ”
Yesterday , this unqualified board — which includes a woman who thinks public education is a “ tool of perversion ” and a chairman whose real profession is a dentist — continued to inject their right - wing ideology into the state ’s standards , pushing for inclusion of more conservatives , more Confederate glorification , and more distortion of progressive viewpoints .
Whether To Require Students To Learn Obama ’s Middle Name : Republican David Bradley is one of the leaders of the SBOE ’s far - right faction .
Yesterday , he suggested that if students were going to learn about Barack Obama as the first African - American president , they should also learn his middle name — Hussein .
However , fellow Republican Bob Craig objected , saying , “ The intent of what you ’re doing is pretty obvious , but I do n’t think it is necessarily correct , ” pointing out that other presidents like Kennedy and Reagan do n’t have their middle names in the standards .
Bradley eventually withdrew his amendment , and the board decided to list Obama as he is on the White House website : Barack H. Obama .
Elevating Confederate Leader Jefferson Davis To The Level Of Abraham Lincoln :
There was “ prolonged debate ” yesterday over whether to “ include Confederate President Jefferson Davis ’ inaugural address with a lesson on Abraham Lincoln ’s philosophical views . ”
Far - right Republican Cynthia Dunbar said that excluding Jefferson would be an attempt to “ whitewash ” history .
( TFN Insider adds , “ But that ’s what Davis ’s address does !
The address does n’t even mention the reason southern states seceded : slavery . ” )
Eventually , the SBOE votes to keep in Davis and require students to “ contrast ” his speech to Lincoln ’s speeches .
Requiring That Historical Figures — Except Conservative Ones — Must Be Dead For Students To Study
Them : Yesterday , SBOE voted to strip United Farm Workers of America co-founder Dolores Huerta from a third - grade list of “ historical and contemporary figures who have exemplified good citizenship . ”
Several officials argued that she is a socialist and therefore should be excluded .
But perhaps the most blatantly biased objection came from Bradley , who said :
I am very reluctant to include persons who are still alive .
By definition of “ history , ” you must be dead , because you never know when you might embarrass us later .
…
Of course , the board has had no problem including Wallace Jefferson , the Republican chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court , or right - wing figure Phyllis Schlafly … [ emphasis original ]
AR Rifle Hacking & Building
The ArmaLite Stoner pattern rifle , specifically the AR - 15 , is arguably America 's most popular long arm .
Villainized in the press , issued by the military , equipped in numerous video games , and kept legally in countless US homes ... the famous " black rifle " is one of the most extensible and configurable firearms , yet so many users do little beyond attaching a new optic or other accessory on their picattiny rail .
This talk is an exploration of how many features and modifications are possible on AR rifles .
I showcase my custom AR - 15 which can function as upwards of five very distinct firearms .
One single gun ( the lower receiver is the only serialized and controlled element , regulated by the ATF ) can shoot a variety of calibers of ammunition , launch exotic projectiles , and serve in a great many roles : from defense to plinking to weekend craziness and more .
May 17 , 2010  -- President Obama announced today that he will create a presidential commision to investigate the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , an administration official said .
The commission , said to be similar to those that probed into the space shuttle Challenger disaster and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident , will examine the oil industry 's practices , such as rig safety .
It will also examine the government 's response and study the " structure and function " of government agencies like the embattled U.S. Mineral Management Service .
Current government officials or elected officials would not be eligible to serve on the commission .
On Capitol Hill , Congress is also promising more scrutiny of the government 's response to the BP spill .
The Senate Homeland Security committee today began questioning government officials , including Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar about their agences ' actions .
Sen. Barbara Boxer and other Senate Democrats called today for the Department of Justice to open a criminal and civil investigation into the spill .
There are already signs that the increased scrutiny is having an effect .
An administration official confirmed to ABC News today that an Interior Department official will step down in the wake of the spill .
Chris Oynes , who oversaw offshore oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for the Minerals Management Service is said to be " retiring " from his position as associate director at the end of the month .
BP Claims Some Success in Capturing Oil
While news of the investigation broke in Washington , BP said today that , for the first time , one of its schemes to capture oil from the leak is actually working .
Remote submersibles hooked up a mile - long tube to the broken well pipe over the weekend .
BP says it is siphoning some of the leaking oil to a tanker on the surface , which will eventually be processed and sold like other crude .
It can be called a partial success at best .
The tube does n't stop the gushing oil , but slows it , according to the company .
BP says that over time , they may be able to stop up to 80 percent of the oil .
" We 've got flow going , it is great progress over the last 24 hours .
What we are doing is slowing , doing something called opening up the choke at the top of well to slowly increase the flow rates , " Bob Dudley , BP 's managing director who is overseeing the response efforts , said on " GMA . "
This morning , BP said the tube was suctioning about 1,000 barrels of oil a day , or about 20 percent of what BP estimates is leaking from the well , according to The Associated Press .
Others call the plan wildly optimistic .
" I do n't think it 's realistic that they 're going to get a significant fraction of the leak into the containment vessel , " said Steve Wereley , professor of fluid mechanics at Purdue University .
" Plugging the 4 - inch pipe into the 20 - inch pipe , that area is going to leak .
To address that concern , BP has surrounded the straw with a series of rubber stoppers to create a seal .
BP is also pursuing two other methods of stopping the oil .
Today , the company started drilling a second relief well , and at the end of the week , BP may turn to the " top kill " strategy , where concrete and mud would be shot into the leak to plug it .
" We 've got an engineering operation where we will enter the blowout preventer at the well head and be able to inject some heavy fluids to be able to try to permanently stop the flow from the well , " Dudley said .
" In addition to that we are still drilling the relief well . "
BP Will Reimburse ' All Legitimate Claims '
Over the weekend Napolitano and Salazar sent a letter to BP that stated : " We understand that BP will not in any way seek to rely on the potential $ 75 million statutory cap to refuse to provide compensation to any individuals or others harmed by the oil spill even if more than $ 75 million is required and BP will not seek reimbursement from the American taxpayers . "
BP Will Reimburse ' All Legitimate Claims '
This morning Dudley said the $ 75 million cap was irrelevant and BP " will pay all legitimate claims . "
" We 've said from day one we will take responsibility for the spill , we will not hide behind the $ 75 million cap .
We are taking responsibility for the spill not just in words , we 've set up claims centers across the Gulf Coast , " Dudley said .
" We are issuing checks to those who have been affected in the fishing area so they do n't miss a boat payment or a house payment [ and can ] put food on the table .
I think we are seeing not only our agreement with that as well as our actions . "
Plumes of Oil Discovered Underwater
Scientists discovered disturbing findings under the sea -- huge plumes of oil , some of which are 10 miles long and three miles wide .
These plumes may explain why the oil slick has n't grown on the surface .
" This oil as you can see has depth , it 's not only the size of Manhattan in area , but it's also several hundred meters depth , " University of Southern Mississippi professor of geological oceanography Vernon Asper said .
Rep. Edward Markey Lashes Out at BP
On Sunday , Rep. Edward Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts , lashed out at BP and accused the company of " burying its head in the sand on these underwater threats " and compared the underwater plumes to " hidden mushroom clouds . "
In response to Markey 's statement , Dudley said the joint incident command will investigate the plumes , but " as of today , it is hard to even comment on them . "
But some scientists say these plumes are not huge " mushroom clouds " under the sea .
In fact , they are not visible to the human eye .
What they detected were dips in the oxygen level of the water between 2,000 - 6,000 feet .
Microbes are feasting on the oil , and that frenzied meal is causing them to consume oxygen as well , but the scientists say that so far not at dangerous levels .
The biologists says they are pleased with the way the bacteria are devouring the oil in the deep , and are beginning to question the wisdom of using dispersants at the source of the leak , because that might interrupt that bacterial smorgasbord .
BP and the Coast Guard , however , have been saying that dispersants are the reason more oil has not been seen rising to the surface .
When asked if the chemical dispersants were making the situation in the Gulf worse by depleting the oxygen , Dudley said the dispersants are like " soap suds . "
" It is like soap that breaks up the oil into small , very small droplets and then it degrades , biodegrades .
And that 's part of the natural process of it , " Dudley said .
" And so what will happen then is a little of the oxygen will be reduced , that means the bacteria is working .
We think we see the natural processes at work here through the use of dispersants . "

RFC 5841 TCP Option to Denote Packet Mood 1 April 2010 1 . Introduction DSM - IV ] .
Packets cannot feel .
They are created for the purpose of moving data from one system to another .
However , it is clear that in specific situations some measure of emotion can be inferred or added .
For instance , a packet that is retransmitted to resend data for a packet for which no ACK was received could be described as an ' angry ' packet , or a ' frustrated ' packet ( if it is not the first retransmission for instance ) .
So how can these kinds of feelings be conveyed in the packets themselves .
This can be addressed by adding TCP Options [ RFC793 ] to the TCP header , using ASCII characters that encode commonly used " emoticons " to convey packet mood .
1.1 . Terminology RFC2119 ] .
2 . Syntax RFC793 ] .
It is proposed that option 25 ( released 2000 - 12 - 18 ) be used to define packet mood .
This option would have a length value of 4 or 5 bytes .
All the simple emotions described as expressible via this mechanism can be displayed with two or three 7 - bit , ASCII - encoded characters .
Multiple mood options may appear in a TCP header , so as to express more complex moods than those defined here ( for instance if a packet were happy and surprised ) .

Apple the company , and not an individual employee , initiated the investigation into a missing iPhone prototype that found its way onto the Internet , according to the search warrant unsealed in this case earlier this morning .
The details confirm a story we reported in April soon after that search warrant was served .
Talk about high drama in the world of high tech .
The execution of the search warrant touched off a firestorm of media controversy , along with a PR nightmare for Apple .
Law enforcement broke down the door at the home of Gizmodo blogger Jason Chen , confiscating his computers in connection with the missing Apple iPhone prototype that found its way onto the Internet .
The judge in this case , Clifford Cretan , was the original judge who approved the search warrant .
He ruled this morning that there was no need to protect the investigation or the identities of the people involved since the public already knew who the Apple employee was who lost the phone , and who the person was who found it and ultimately sold it to Gizmodo .
The Gawker Media Web site then posted images of the phone on its Gizmodo Web site .
In an interview with CNBC , deputy district attorney Chris Feasel said he was disappointed by the ruling but that his office would abide by it , with plans to release the search warrant by Friday afternoon .
He also confirmed that it was Apple that called police to report the phone was stolen , which set the investigation in motion .
Feasel also says that instead of investigating this case as a stolen property crime , it was referred to the county 's REACT high tech crimes unit , or Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team , as a trade secrets case .
The attorney representing the media , including Wired.com , C/ Net , Los Angeles Times , California Publishers Association , says the main issue is what information was given to the judge in the first place to get him to issue the warrant .
Was this a trade secrets case ?
Stolen property ?
What information was given to the police ?
All of those details will come out when the warrant is released publicly .
Another key issue : Was Chen identified to the judge as a " journalist , " or merely an individual ?
It 's a key question because of California 's Shield Law which supposedly protects reporters from searches like this .
More broadly , this case could try to answer whether bloggers are afforded the same rights and protections as more traditional journalists afforded under the First Amendment .
Another issue the courts might have to decide in connection with this case is whether a blogger 's home is an extension of his office , and therefore considered a " newsroom , " which would also be protected against law enforcement searches , unless some criminal activity had been determined ahead of time .
The search warrant should disclose all these details .
Feasel also confirmed that investigators had not yet looked at Chen 's computers , and will wait to do so until the sticky issues of how a journalist 's rights extend to bloggers are worked out .
Meantime , while no charges have yet been filed in this case , Feasel tells CNBC he 's confident charges will be filed sooner than later , but did n't offer specifics as to which charges would be filed , or even against whom they might be filed .
Apple did not return phone calls seeking comment .
UPDATE : In the search warrant , investigators are clearly identifying the single suspect in this case as Brian Hogan , the individual who found , and later sold , the prototype iPhone to Gizmodo .
Interestingly , blogger Jason Chen and the Web site Gizmodo are not characterized as suspects , that investigators believed they could find evidence in Chen 's computers confirming Hogan 's involvement in the case .
Also interesting , for the first time , it is confirmed that Steve Jobs himself contacted the folks at Gizmodo to ask that the phone be returned .
Finally , another fact in this case : Investigators say Hogan claimed he was paid $ 8,500 for the prototype phone , and that Gizmodo would pay him a bonus once the new iPhone was officially unveiled by Apple .
Gizmodo has reported that sum it paid for the phone totaled $ 5,000 .
Angela Merkel 's CDU suffered because of the Greek rescue package German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's party and its coalition allies have been defeated in regional elections in North Rhine - Westphalia .
The sharp fall in support for Mrs Merkel 's party means her national coalition will lose its slim majority in the upper house of parliament .
The campaign has been overshadowed by the government 's decision to contribute to a huge rescue package for Greece .
Meanwhile many cities in NRW are on the brink of bankruptcy .
Final results showed Mrs Merkel 's Christian Democrats ( CDU ) with 34.6 % and their Free Democrat ( FDP ) allies on 6.7 % .
The Social Democrats ( SPD ) , Germany 's main opposition party , polled 34.5 % of the vote , while the Greens won 12.1 % and the Left Party 5.6 % .
Analysis : Merkel faces fallout North Rhine - Westphalia ( NRW ) , Germany 's most populous state and home to 18 million people , is in the country 's industrial heartland and regarded as a weathervane for national politics .
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle , who is also vice - chancellor and leader of the Free Democrats , called the loss a " warning shot for the governing parties " .
" We must make an effort to win back lost trust , " he said .
The coalition in NRW between the CDU and the pro-business FDP had mirrored the one at the federal level .
It was not immediately clear what type of alliance or coalition would emerge in NRW .
Sunday 's vote gave the CDU 67 seats in the state legislature and their FDP allies 13 seats .
The SPD also hold 67 , the Greens 23 and the Left Party 11 .
ANALYSIS By Steve Rosenberg , BBC News , Berlin
It 's only one regional election , but it matters because defeat in North Rhine Westphalia deprives Chancellor Angela Merkel of a majority in the upper house of the German parliament .
And without that , she 'll find it much harder to push through the national legislation she wants .
The multi-billion euro bailout of Greece may be one reason that voters have turned against her .
The rescue package is extremely unpopular with the German public .
But it 's not just Greece .
Ever since they took power nationally , Chancellor Merkel 's coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats have n't stopped squabbling - over everything from body scanners at airports to budget deficits .
And the more they 've bickered , the more unpopular they 've become .
The leader who 's been nicknamed " Iron Angie " is suddenly looking weaker .
But on a national level , the result means Mrs Merkel will lose her automatic majority in the upper house of parliament , the Bundesrat , and will rely on opposition support to push through policy .
This is expected to jeopardise long - promised tax cuts and health system reforms .
Mrs Merkel had campaigned in the state until the last minute in an effort to prevent the result that was forecast in the polls .
With the economic crisis dominating the campaign , opponents accused Mrs Merkel of attempting to delay a decision on the hugely unpopular rescue package for Greece until after the poll .
In NRW , local councils are sinking into debt , leading to rising kindergarten fees and the threatened closure of libraries , swimming - pools and theatres .

We 've seen robots play Soccer Tennis , and Battle Ball , and now Dr. Masaaki Kumagai , director of Tohoku Gakuin University 's Robot Development Engineering Laboratory , brings us BallP ( or Ball Inverted Pendulum ) : a 20 - inch , 16.5 - pound robot that derives its name from the bowling ball that it balances on .
Using three omni-directional wheels , the robot can stand still , move in any direction , and pivot along its vertical axis .
A combination of motors , micro-step controllers , gyroscopes , and accelerometers allows the thing to carry equipment -- either on its own , or with the help of a human operator ( sort of like a high - tech wheel barrow ) .
If anything , it 's a lot less intrusive than CMU 's Ballbot -- our previous favorite robot butler ( yes , in the end it all comes down to who can get us a cold one the fastest ) .

We all know that Facebook has been making privacy changes over the past few years which supposedly reflects society ’s trends toward becoming more open .
A new infographic produced by Matt McKeon effectively illustrates how Facebook has steadily decreased the default privacy settings of users ’ profiles to be more open .
The latest settings are surprisingly open and looking at the image below should make you wonder why Facebook is making profiles increasingly open .
We ’ve remixed Matt McKeon ’s original animation ( which can be found here ) to produce the following image :
Sometimes pretty cool things happen and yet almost nobody knows about them .
One of the coolest things I came to learn recently is the development of extension support in rekonq .
The development is done by Nikhil Marathe .
He ’s implementing Chrome ’s extension API which is luckily based on HTML , JavaScript and other web standards which makes it easier to adopt than Mozilla ’s current XUL - based model ( which is being deprecated my Mozilla in favor of Jetpack in Firefox 4.0 anyway ) .
Kudos to Nikhil for his awesome work !
In related news , from what I ’ve read rekonq 0.5 is shaping up nicely .
According to the roadmap all targeted features are done which hopefully means that the release target in June is hit .
Rekonq will ( at least if nothing unexpected happens ) also become the default browser of Kubuntu 10.10 .
It ’s already default in nice Arch - based distro Chakra .
Now only Fedora 14 KDE and openSUSE 12.0 need to follow . 😀

Here is the least you need to know from the semifinals Game 3 morning skate at Bell Centre : Jordan Staal skated for the first time since having surgery on his foot , he will not play tonight - Bill Guerin missed practice with a maintanence day and is a game - time decision - With Guerin missing practice , Mark Letestu centered the third line and could make his NHL postseason debut - Andrei Markov did not skate for Montreal , his status has not changed - Jaroslav Spacek did skate and was listed as day - to - day by coach Martin__________________________________________________________________________Penguins forward Jordan Staal skated for the first time today since undergoing a procedure to repair a lacerated tendon in his foot .
Below are pictures of Staal .
For more details please see the 11:51 AM entry.__________________________________________________________________________Here are sound bites from the Penguins locker room earlier this afternoon : I think that is good for hockey if that is the case .
I remember the Forum for sure .
I remember when they made the switch here to the Bell Centre .
This is a lot of history with the building .
They have continued the trend here .
If you look at the crowd and see how they play here , it is a special place .
There are the types of games here that hockey players should be able to get up for .
No , I was n’t .
This is the only one I ’ve been in .
It does n’t change anything for me .
I just remember coming out onto the ice and my first goal .
I remember it was a two - on - one on ( Jose ) Theodore .
It was pretty special .
I was just happy to be here .
Obviously I wanted to score .
To get my first goal was a dream come true .
When you are on the road you are in an environment that is pretty hostile as far as being a road team .
It ’s loud and it ’s a challenge .
I think you focus according to that .
Again , much like the last game here , if I get the opportunity then it is something I am going to be pretty proud of .
Hopefully I ’ll bring something to the lineup .
The fact that it is in Montreal – that is a pretty crazy building – hopefully I will keep the emotions in check .
I will mostly keep it simple .
I want to be solid in all the areas they expect me to be solid in – faceoffs and in the D - zone .
I do n’t want to hurt the team tonight .
If I get that opportunity hopefully I put my best foot forward .
I want to be good in the right faceoff circle and try to win more than 50 percent of my draws .
I might even get a chance on the power play at some point so I hope to bring some fresh blood to that and keep it going like we had it in Game 1 .
We had no idea the extent or what to expect so just to see him skate on it is exciting for us .
Jordan Leopold wears them .
There is a guy in Montreal who cuts them and molds them into your skates .
There are some other companies that seem to do some generic ones but they do n’t seem to fit as well .
Obviously on the penalty kill it protects your foot from a shot like ( Philadelphia ’s Simon ) Gagne and ( Jeff ) Carter went through .
It ’s something that I would look into for sure .
I think it is how you use it .
Energy is energy – it is just how you harness it .
I think when you are getting energy at home from the crowd sometimes your emotions get the best of you and you ca n’t harness it in the right ways .
It is something we will definitely have to try to deal with and take advantage of .
I think that we know what to expect .
I think that we understand what it can do and what its effects are and how to combat it .
I think that is based off of experience .
__________________________________________________________________________Sounds from head coach Dan Bylsma 's media conference after the team 's morning skate : Jordan Staal , there were a few chuckles when I said he was day - to - day .
But he is day - to - day .
He is progressing .
He was on the ice for a short time without his gear on testing out his foot and his skate .
He ’ll remain day - to - day and doing well .
Being the playoffs , Bill Guerin is just a maintenance ( day ) and will be game - time ( decision ) .
Mark Letestu was on one of the four lines today .
He ’s a guy we would insert into the center position if need be .
We would not be risking anything in terms of his health .
You ’d have to talk to a doctor about the procedure .
There is no risk right now .
He has to heal from the surgical wound and get back in his boot and be comfortable playing .
It ’s not a risk in terms of weighing if he should play .
We spent a lot of time in the offensive zone and did a good job of that .
There are areas where I think we can do better .
Hopefully we ’ve made that adjustment and hopefully we ’ll see that tonight when we play in the offensive zone .
Our plan is not going to change .
We want to play there .
We want to get action in and around the net .
We want to do a few different things to get more space there and more chances around the net .
We are there a lot .
__________________________________________________________________________The
Canadiens appear to be a very confident group returning home to the Bell Centre .
Below are some of their comments in the locker room today following the morning skate : I think you have to give credit to ( Montreal general manager ) Bob Gainey and his staff .
They signed Hal last summer .
It was apparent to me after training camp that Hal Gill was one of our leaders in addition to being a great defenseman .
He has excelled in a shutdown role and has been great on the penalty kill .
But more than that , his enthusiasm in the dressing room , his voice has been very important .
He is one individual who has brought a lot of leadership in addition to ( Brian ) Gionta , ( Scott ) Gomez , ( Travis ) Moen and the people who have won like ( Mike ) Cammalleri .
Those are players who have made a big impact .
I thought that in the Washington series after Game 4 I think that their leadership was a big factor in us winning that series .
I really believe that Andrei is going to be a player that is going to help us .
He is no different than any other player , whether it was in the first round or at some point during the regular season , who at times struggled .
I ’ll give you an example .
Maxim Lapierre was a player who was very frustrated , especially after the season he had last year .
Now , he is playing great hockey for us .
It might not show on the stats that he is having good games , but the way he is contributing with his energy and by finishing checks has been a big factor .
Andrei has had some ups and downs but I am confident that he is going to bounce back and help us .
I think to come back to our great fans is a plus .
The energy , enthusiasm and passion that they show is something that is a big factor .
It is interesting when you look at the playoffs this year , out of the eight teams that remain , four our Original Six teams .
That is great for hockey and the NHL .
We look at one game at a time .
We know that tonight is going to be a tough game because our opponent has played tough on the road .
They are the Stanley Cup champions and they have great personnel .
It is a big challenge that we have to be prepared for .
We have to be as good as we were on Sunday on special teams and five - on - five we have to be better .
We know what the challenge is but the fact that we are at home and that we have the fans behind us is a big plus for us .
I think it is not about me but about our team .
I think our team responded well in the first round .
I think we have a team that was difficult to assess during the year because of key injuries .
Number - two it was almost a complete overhaul of the team because of all the free agents we brought in .
To assemble a group like that takes time .
I really believe that we have developed really good chemistry .
We have shown that we have great character the way we responded .
I think our team has grown and understood how to win in the playoffs .
They have shown the sacrifice that is required .
I would take it any day of the week .
Our energy in this building is the best that I have ever seen .
It seems a bit like the Italian National Soccer Team back in the day .
They defend , defend and defend and when they get their one chance then they score the goal .
I think we would like to have some more offense and develop some more scoring chances .
We are working on it and we will get there .
I do n’t think we feel the pressure that if we get that one chance , it has to go in .
We just try to make the best play we can and hopefully it goes in .
We learned not to stay in the hotel when we are at home .
That was n’t a good omen for us .
It was disappointing to come back home and lose those two games .
You ’re right sitting here now , we have that one series under our belt where we had that feeling .
We would really like to take advantage of these two games .
We are happy to be at home and we understand the importance of not falling behind 3 - 1 again that is for sure .
I bet he is pretty excited .
I know he was a boyhood Habs fan .
To come here and play in this building I would expect he is going to be at the top of his game .
I would n’t expect anything but the best out of Sid tonight .
The fans in Calgary were great as well .
I got to experience that playing in my home market last year .
This year ( in Montreal ) has just been an elevation of that I guess .
The crowd here just brings so much energy and enthusiasm .
It can help .
At the same time we talked last series about how we have to be careful in our room not to get too excited .
You try to get your excitement level and keep it all game long .
Sometimes you get too excited to start .
We had some good 10 - minute starts and then kind of tailed off from there .
I think it is important for us to enjoy the crowd and realize that we need to play a full hockey game .
The crowd will be even happier if we win at the end of the night .
I think what we learned not only from Game 6 , but also from the two games that we lost , is that we ca n’t change our game .
We ca n’t start being fancy .
We have to play the way that has been successful and works for us .
The biggest thing is that we have been up in our gap .
The forwards have done a great job of coming back and helping out .
You ca n’t keep a gap and you ca n’t be up in their face if you do n’t have back pressure .
Not only that , when the forwards are coming back they are pushing ( the Penguins ) into us .
They do n’t have any room to do their curl - backs .
When they force them into us we can use our sticks to make a play .
It ’s not just me and Hal but the forwards doing a great job of coming back .
That is one game .
We slowed him down for one game .
You know he is going to bounce back .
That is why he is as good as he is .
He is not going to give up and stop working so we have to make sure we have that same mentality .
We ca n’t let up for a second .
We have to be just as good if not better tonight because we know he is going to come ready to play .
Those are stats that you can throw out the window when the playoffs start .
Every game is different and every game something strange could happen .
It is really not strange to see him score .
The same things apply .
We ca n’t let off the gas pedal .

A new study , to be published in the International Journal of Obesity , has found that negative attitudes towards " obese " people are based on an emotional response of disgust .
Advertisement
Previous research into negative attitudes towards fat people had centered on perceived controlability of body weight .
That is , fat people were blamed for being lazy and lacking self - control which led to negative attitudes in the wider community .
However , even when a person 's beliefs about the cause of obesity were shifted , their attitudes towards fat individuals were not impacted .
This suggested that the weight bias was not based in logic , but in emotion .
As Dr Lenny Vartanian - who led the new study – states , " Although the scientific community acknowledges biological , behavioral and social contributors to body weight , a common belief in society at large is that one 's body weight is almost infinitely malleable .
The problem with this idea of willpower is that we chalk it up to a moral weakness . "
What 's so interesting about Dr Vartanian 's study is that it indicates the association between weight and morality is borne from the emotion of disgust and may help explain why negative attitudes towards fat people are so difficult to change .

The research involved three studies .
In the first , 300 American university students completed questionnaires asking how favorably they rated various social groups and how much they believed being part of that group was under an individual 's personal control .
Participants rated obese people , along with 15 other groups , including African Americans , smokers , lottery winners , welfare recipients , drug addicts , homosexuals , the mentally ill , and people who were elderly , homeless , rich or religious .
Finally , they were asked to rate the feelings of disgust they held towards each group .
In general , the social groups rated most negatively and with the highest levels of disgust were those perceived to have an element of personal control over being a member of that group .
Obese people were among the most negatively viewed groups , on par with homeless people ( which is incredibly problematic , but that 's a rant for another day ) and politicians .
The only groups rated as more negatively and as more disgusting were drug addicts and smokers .

A second study with 125 different participants from the same university used the same questionnaire , except that the term " fat people " was used instead of " obese people " .
The results were identical .
Finally , in the third study , 99 students from an Australian university completed slightly different questionnaires but again with an identical result to the first two studies .
So how can this be changed ?
If no matter how much we hit people over the head with HAES , we will still be seen as disgusting , what direction should our activism go in ?

My preferred solution : bust the beauty ideal .
Dr Vartanian states in his article that " disgust [ is ] related to a process of moralization in which preferences are converted to moral values . "
Smoking was all the rage 60 odd years ago and the results of this research indicate smokers are now one of the most disgusting population groups in our society .
Similarly , as the size of the female beauty ideal has wittled down over the past few decades , negative attitudes towards women that lie outside this ideal have increased .
We fat bloggers are regularly accused of normalizing obesity .
As it turns out , normalization may be exactly what we need .

While we all wait to see how EA ’s Online Pass will work out starting in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 , THQ is ready to battle used game sales .
UFC Undisputed 2010 launches on May 25th and will have a one time use code to be used for the online functions of the game .
If you have purchase a used copy or rent the game from Gamefly it will cost you an additional $ 5 to be able to take the game online .
From THQ :
THQ is delivering a truly unmatched online gaming experience for fans of UFC and across all fighting games in general .
The main enhancement of UFC Undisputed 2010 ’s premium online content is the new “ Fight Camp Mode ” in which players can assemble ranks of up to 40 people and train together .
This is a significant value - add to the game as players can continually improve their skills by training with their friends and bringing teams of MMA specialists together .
This multiplayer content for UFC Undisputed 2010 will be available via a one - time code included with the game at purchase .
Codes for accessing the content will be available for second - time buyers for an additional $ 5 .
Details for acquiring the codes and how this will work will be available via the UFC community site .
It seems as if companies are all joining together to choke off or at least slow down used game sales .
By making this move the game companies are likely assisting to the demise of stores like GameStop and rental services like Gamefly .
Personally , I understand the need to do this business wise but as a gamer I am not happy with the impending direction of gaming here .

Fernando Alonso has warned Lewis Hamilton to cut out the rough stuff or face the consequences .
The Spaniard said that if the 25 - year - old British star repeats his antics in Malaysia and China he could be kicked down the grid or even booted out of the race .
Hamilton charged down the pit lane side by side with Sebastian Vettel in Shanghai and weaved in front of Vitaly Petrov in Sepang .
And Alonso , Hamilton 's former McLaren team - mate who is now at Ferrari , said : " I do n't think Hamilton is in any kind of privileged position .
" The decisions have been inconsistent , because at other times Hamilton would have been punished .
" Lewis has had some warnings and if he does something in the next race , however little , there will be penalties because of the last two races . "
But GP legend Sir Jackie Stewart believes that Hamilton 's stirring performances have ruffled feathers .
" He has woken up a lot of drivers with his skills , " said Stewart .
" I do n't think he is dangerous .
He has got a lot of enthusiasm but he has to realise that can induce judgments you otherwise might not make .
That is part of the maturing process . "
Photo caption : Antonella Giangiacomo , one of dozens of volunteers at the House of Social Rights in Rome , reviews a grammar lesson with two migrants .
( Fulvio Paolocci/ GlobalPost )
ROME , Italy —
Inside a grimy , two - story building nearby Rome ’s main train station , Italian teacher Ersilia Secchi addresses her class :
“ Who washes the dishes in your house ?
Do you wash the dishes ? ” she asks a young man from China .
“ I do n’t , my mother does , ” he says .
She then turns to an African man .
Do you wash the dishes ? ” “ I eat at the shelter , ” he replies .
“ Besides , we do n’t even have dishes in Africa . ”
Moments like these remind Secchi that teaching her language to migrants is hardly ever just about grammar .
Helping them navigate Italy is the goal and the key to her students ’ survival , which in many cases already required a life - threatening journey by boat or hanging onto the undercarriage of a truck crossing the Italian border .
“ If they do n’t know how to say , ‘ Help , I ’m sick , ' or ' Help , I ’m hungry , ’ how are they ever going to make it ? ” asked Secchi .
She is one of dozens of volunteers who teach Italian at Casa dei Diritti Sociali , the House of Social Rights .
For the past 25 years , this local non-profit organization has taken on the job of introducing migrants to Italian society .
The language school counts on a steady stream of college students who volunteer to earn their teaching credits , as well as retired professionals from all backgrounds who have found meaning in teaching migrants .
Even with a run-down building , crowded classrooms and broken chairs , the classes thrive under a motto that holds the entire project together : “ Without language , you ca n’t exercise your rights . ”
Written in bold letters above the chalkboard , students can see it everyday .
“ Italian is a very complicated language , ” said Secchi , who has been volunteering since she retired two years ago .
“ But they come here with their modest attitude and learn it — it ’s fascinating . ”
She insists on teaching her students basic forms of courtesy .
That way , she says , they can lessen the prejudice and mistrust Italians have toward those who look different or ca n’t express themselves correctly .
Among its 60 language classes per week , the House of Social Rights offers an alphabetization class — for those immigrants who are illiterate or unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet — and two other more advanced - level groups .
Unlike most Italian courses around the city , this school does n’t follow a curriculum and classes run on an ongoing basis .
This way , migrants can come and go depending on the seasonal harvests or other job opportunities .
“ Those who have jobs as street vendors often ask me to teach them words like ‘ zipper ’ or ‘ bag strap , ’ ” said Valeria Frazzini , another volunteer who came to fulfill her teaching credential and never left .
“ Through my classes , I get a glimpse into their lives and their journey here . ”
Recently , Frazzini wrote the Italian word for “ sea ” on the chalkboard .
She expected students to associate it with words like summer , sun and beach .
“ A middle - aged woman replied , ‘ sea , boat , fear , ’ ” Frazzini said .
She says the main obstacle that keeps her students from learning Italian is connected to their previous traumas and daily worries .
Last year an immigration law called “ Security Package ” added on a language test as part of the application for migrants seeking long - term residency in Italy .
That made the House of Social Rights job even more crucial .
“ How is knowing Italian connected to national security ? ” asked Augusto Venanzetti , the language school ’s coordinator .
“ Italy is becoming more and more multi-ethnic , but immigration law is very bad . ”
Recently , the House of Social Rights built the first network of language schools for migrants in Rome to interact with the Italian government as one unified front .
The school gave life to a network of 26 volunteer - run language schools for migrants , which include global Catholic charities such as Caritas and Sant ’ Egidio , as well as evangelical churches and leftist associations .
“ We made a small miracle happen , ” said Venanzetti , “ and now we are talking about how to create a synergy within our different identities . ”
The House of Social Rights runs on annual local government funds and European Union help for special projects .
But even with its army of volunteer teachers , the organization is forced to turn migrants away because of limited classroom space .
“ If we could expand , we would double the number of students , ” said Venanzetti .
“ They need our help to pass the language test . ”
Occasionally , there are exchanges in the letters - to - the - editor section of our local newspaper concerning Palestine .
The usual sequence of events begins with the publication of a letter either critical of Israel or supportive of the Palestinian people .
Then one or more of our local hard - core Zionists weighs in with the usual talking points in defense of the indefensible crimes being committed by Israel .
They launch ad hominem attacks on the writer , deny or ignore any factual assertions , then move on to accusations of anti-Semitism .
Usually , they find it important to remind us that Palestinians , or “ Arabs , ” as Zionists often prefer to reference the indigenous population of Palestine , are all terrorists who hate Jews and want to destroy Israel .
We ’re lucky to have a letters editor here in Santa
Fe who does n’t shy away from the subject of Zionism ; our local paper is otherwise very conservative in its news coverage .
I have never had a letter refused despite the fact that I speak plainly when expressing my views .
There is a 150 - word limit on letters to the editor and a thirty - day waiting period between letters from any individual , so I do n’t waste time on subtleties .
It can be a tricky business though .
Having to put the first foot forward leaves one open to vicious personal attacks and libel in response .
The thirty - day waiting period makes it impossible to refute such attacks in a timely manner .
Sometimes the outcome is encouraging , other times , not so much .
Ya’ writes your letter and ya’ takes your chances , so to speak .
In March I wrote a letter pointing out the gross hypocrisy of the Los Angeles - based Simon Wiesenthal Center building its $ 150 million Museum of Tolerance on top of an ancient Muslim cemetery , the Mamilla cemetery in Jerusalem .
Several days later , there was not one , but four vitriolic responses published , each attacking me by name .
I wo n’t go into detail about the Hasbara techniques employed in these letters , but it often seems there is a group of Zionists in Santa
Fe who are getting their talking points from the same source or else are consulting with each other before writing responses .
In this case , though I ca n’t know for certain , I suspect that two of the four letter writers may have been coached by a third , more informed and skilled writer who is one of our well - known local Zionist fanatics .
All four letters contained common talking points , but three of the four used strikingly similar language to claim the Museum of Tolerance is not being built over the ancient grave site but rather “ adjacent to it . ”
This is patently false .
The fact that the museum is being built on top of portions of the cemetery is not in dispute .
But I presume the writers knew they had strength in numbers , so they decided to go for the Big Lie .
The effect was compelling .
With three letters referring to me by name and appearing to refute the central fact in my commentary , uninformed readers were most likely convinced I was wrong in my assertion .
Several acquaintances of mine contacted me to question the validity of my claim .
I have to admit , after reading the letters , even I was momentarily taken aback and found myself asking , “ Did I get this wrong ? ”
The fourth letter writer in the group , though she did n’t use the “ adjacent to ” lie , did compare me to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
She also insisted I hate Jews , substantiating this claim by informing the reader that , “ Everyone knows when non-Jews use the word Zionism it is secret code for anti-semitism . ”
No kidding .
Secret code .
She must use a magic - decoder ring to decipher the newspaper .
There are some supporters of Israel with whom one can at least engage in reasonable dialog .
We should do so with as much respect and understanding as possible .
Educating the misinformed is the most important work we do .
But many pro-Zionist zealots have abandoned rational thought when it comes to Israel .
They embrace a type of fanaticism which in essence is a new religion called Israelism .
Any lie or any denial of the truth is justified , as long as it is in support of Israel .
Defense of the Jewish state takes precedence over even the most basic concepts of human rights and social justice .
Israel is a benign , infallible entity and the evil Arabs are to blame for any transgressions which may occur when Israel reluctantly exercises its “ right to defend itself . ”
In my view , these individuals deserve nothing from us but disdain .
They should be rebuked and excluded from the conversation .
Their sole objective is to derail the discussion whenever possible .
We ca n’t counter their illogical assertions with any rational argument because they are extremists who have moved beyond reason .
Hence , my use of terms such as “ nut - balls ” and “ crazies ” to refer to them .
Okay , perhaps it ’s a bit mean spirited , but really now , secret code words ?
The next letter exchange which occurred involved the same alleged organizer of the previous campaign against me .
I wrote a piece decrying the illegal siege of Gaza .
It turns out I was wrong about a point of fact in my letter .
Dang .
One hates to be caught in an error by these loonies .
But I have to fess up .
I was relying on three different news sources when I stated that the recent shipment of clothing allowed into Gaza by Israel was the first such commercial shipment of clothing in three years .
Wrong !
My Zionist foil discovered a Palestinian source , Paltrade , which did indeed substantiate that during the months of August , September and October of 2008 , Israel allowed some commercial shipments of clothing to enter Gaza .
Prompted by this revelation , I did additional research and discovered another source which suggested that a shipment was also allowed in during July of that same year .
I stand corrected .
How could I have been so ignorant of Israel ’s largesse ?
The irony is , by emphasizing the error in my letter , my nemesis actually reinforced the pertinent truth of the assertion : Israel prohibits commercial importation of clothing and shoes into Gaza on a regular basis .
In his zeal to discredit me , he proved my point .
Also , he did not address the information in my letter concerning other types of commodities which have been denied importation into Gaza in recent years including crayons , toys , books , fabric , threads , needles , light bulbs , candles , matches , musical instruments , sheets , blankets , mattresses , toilet paper , diapers and feminine hygiene products .
Yes , toilet paper and tampons .
But to his credit , on this one point he is right and I was wrong .
The recent garment shipments allowed into Gaza were not the first commercial shipments in three years .
They were the first in a year and a half .
Oh , those generous Israelis .
The more disturbing aspect of the writer ’s pyrrhic victory is that his source , Paltrade , provides indisputable proof of the punishing scale of Israel ’s illegal siege of Gaza .
Reports at the Paltrade site include a litany of statistics which document the devastating impact the siege is having on the people of Gaza and their economy .
Yet , faced with these appalling facts , the writer spent his time combing through reports of individual month ’s imports , or lack thereof , to find references to the few commercial shipments of clothing which Israel has permitted .
It ’s as if he went digging through piles of corpses to find a few people left alive so he could shout , “ Aha !
See , we did n’t kill everyone . ”
I regret not being more mindful of the facts in my letter , and I apologize for trusting sources which turned out to be flawed .
We have to be careful not to create an echo chamber for misinformation in our efforts to awaken people to the nature of Zionism .
Plus , we can ill afford to give these nut - balls any reason to discredit us .
The letter writer in question is a wizard of obfuscation and misdirection and will always attempt to find a chink in the armor of reason and exploit it .
But this obsession with finding any error , no matter how substantively irrelevant , in order to obscure the actual issues is as deeply disturbing as it is commonplace in pro-Zionists ’ arguments .
So , without a doubt , I was wrong .
Israel is far more generous than my letter suggested .
Four months ’ worth of clothing shipments in three years — where did the people of Gaza find room for such a luxurious surplus ?
We should be grateful for the ever - vigilant Zionists in our midst who keep us honest .
Without their principled obstructionism , we might actually be able to engage in constructive dialog about the crimes being committed by the rogue regime in Israel , not to mention the funding and political cover being provided for these crimes by the United States and much of the international community .
Such discussions might lead us to conclude that respect for human dignity and the rule of law should be a benchmark for the behavior of all nations .
What a terrible threat that would be to Israel ’s existence .
One month after news of a giant Gulf Coast oil spill began making headlines across the country , aid organizations worry that the region may see an influx of workers seeking cleanup jobs that simply do n’t exist .
“ People are being told they can drive here and apply for jobs and BP will pay for travel and hotels .
This is just not true , ” executive director of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Darlene Kattan said Thursday night at a public meeting in Metairie .
Kattan ’s phone has been ringing off the hook with calls from agencies nationwide struggling to find jobs for laid - off workers – and interested in placing workers in cleanup jobs they ’ve heard about .
Unfortunately , these jobs do n’t exist in the numbers imagined , or in the number needed to employ the thousands already here and needing work .
In short , the never - ending great recession has met the never - ending oil spill .
Already 3,200 people have attended trainings and received certification to do the estimated in the cleanup .
Far less have gotten jobs .
Just last week , more than 2,000 people vied for consideration for 500 jobs that may or may not materialize cleaning up oil along Alabama ’s shoreline .
A BP officials said the company was n’t accepting any more applications , and would contact those who had already applied if and when the need to fill the jobs arose .
Meanwhile , businesses have begun to sell trainings being provided free of charge in areas affected by the spill through a disaster response command center .
The site recently added a page that suggests their training courses will be needed all the way up the East Coast as the oil moves into the loop current .
In the New Orleans region , Kattan has heard about people coming into Hispanic neighborhoods offering to fill out BP job application forms for a $ 100 fee . “
I do n’t want to see another Katrina scenario , ” the advocate said , referencing similar scams that exploited Spanish - speaking laborers seeking rebuilding work following the 2005 storm .
While BP has held worker trainings for Spanish as well as Vietnamese - speaking communities , Metairie lawyer Monica Sanchez said Thursday that all those affected by the spill should push BP for more translation services .
“ They have an obligation , ” she said .
But even as Sanchez encouraged those being hurt by the spill to file claims , many in the Hispanic community expressed fears about domino - like economic injury that would not be recognized by the oil giant because it was not directly caused by the spill but instead , caused by rising seafood prices or other disruptions in business that happened as a result of it .
Martin Gutierrez , director of the Catholic archdiocese ’s Hispanic apostolate , said that Catholic Charities also holds these concerns and accordingly , is using an emergency grant from BP to buy pre-paid gift cards from local grocery stores , rather than national chains .
BP representative Hugh Depland said that while the company was n’t sure exactly when more workers would be hired , the $ 239 billion company was spending “ a lot of money , time and effort to bring this event to a close . ”
And to those worried restaurateurs facing rising prices for shrimp and oysters ?
In the words of fellow BP rep Randy Prescott : “ Louisiana is n’t the only place that has shrimp . ”
Google is cleaning up its mess after the company says it mistakenly collected browsing data from unencrypted Wi -Fi networks as part of its Street View project .
The search giant said on Monday that it had deleted all Wi-Fi data collected in Ireland at the request of the Irish Data Protection Authority .
The destruction of incorrectly obtained data in Ireland was confirmed by iSec Patners Inc. , an independent security consulting firm .
Google says it has also reached out to " regulators in the other relevant countries about how to quickly dispose " of the Wi-Fi data it mistakenly collected .
Google has not named the " other relevant countries " it has reached out to , but the company 's Wi -Fi data packet snooping could affect many locations included in Street View .
In a blog post on Friday , Google said its Street View cars , which take 360 - degree photographs for use in Google Maps , have been collecting data from unprotected Wi -Fi networks since 2007 .
If you 're just hearing about Google 's Wi-Fi data collection faux pas for the first time , here 's a quick FAQ to get you up to speed :
Why was Google collecting Wi -Fi data in the first place ?
Google says it was collecting basic Wi -Fi data from network routers including Service Set Identifier ( SSID ) information and Media Access Control ( MAC ) addresses .
The search giant says collecting this information from data access points across the world helps the company improve the accuracy of its location - based products like Google Maps for mobile , My Location , and Buzz .
What else were the Street View cars collecting ?
Google says the programming code meant to collect SSIDs and Mac addresses was also collecting data packet information ( Web browsing and communication data ) from non-password - protected Wi -Fi networks .
If a Street View car collected data in my neighborhood , does Google have my browsing data now ?
Illustration : Stuart Bradford For Google to have collected any information from your computer you would have had to be browsing the Internet on a Wi -Fi network that was n't password protected when the Street View car was in range of your wireless signal .
It 's also important to note that Google says it collected only data fragments and not entire pieces of browsing or communication data .
Google says that this happened because its Street View cars were constantly moving when collecting data and were changing channels ( your Wi - Fi signal is broadcast on an over - the - air channel ) about five times per second .
When did Google start collecting Wi -Fi data ?
Google says the code that inadvertently collected Wi -Fi data was created in 2006 and used in the Street View project a year later .
Google Street View first launched on Google Maps in late May 2007 .
It 's not clear whether Google 's Wi-Fi snooping began when Google first sent its Google Street View cars into the streets or whether this code was added to the project soon after .
If Google has been collecting this data since 2007 , why are we only finding out about it now ?
Google says it did not realize what was going on with its data collection practices until German authorities told the search giant they wanted to audit Google 's Street View Wi -Fi data collection practices .
Google says the request from German authorities sparked an internal review which uncovered the problem .
Google grounded its Street View cars once it discovered the Wi-Fi data collection issue , and says it will no longer have its Street View fleet collect Wi -Fi data .
What is Google doing with the Wi-Fi data it does have ?
Graphic : Diego Aguirre
Google says it has stored all the snooped data on separate hard drives that are not connected to the rest of Google 's network , essentially locking the data down .
The company says it has asked a third - party to investigate its Wi-Fi privacy lapse , determine how it happened , and confirm that Wi -Fi packet data has been permanently deleted .
What about Google 's warning about protecting your Wi -Fi network ?
Google should never have been collecting the data packets transmitted across open Wi -Fi networks , and it is a smart enough company that it should have caught this mistake much earlier .
However , the search giant definitely has a point about protecting your Wi -Fi router .
Not only is an open Wi -Fi signal an invitation to your neighbors to snag some free Internet access , but it exposes your computer to any number of security intrusions , including identity theft .
So make sure you password - protect your Wi-Fi router to keep unwanted guests , hackers , and drive - by googlers off your network .

Carnage continues to mount as Obama 's lethal ' look forward , not backward ' strategy continues to fail ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/14/2010 , 4:02 pm PT
An argument could be made that the greatest beneficiary of the BP oil disaster in the Gulf has been Massey Energy 's CEO Don Blankenship .
Until the Gulf Gusher took over the front pages , the serious heat , in both media and Congress , had been on Blankenship and the coal mine explosion which took the lives of 29 miners at Massey 's Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia .
Remember that ?
Well , the investigation has very quietly --- and largely behind closed doors , to the chagrin of family members of the victims --- proceeded into that fossil fuel - related disaster , even as Blankenship must be thanking the Oily Gods for taking him momentarily out of the spotlight .
So let 's put him back in it , shall we ?
Given that the mafia - like strongman tactics seen in remarkable video tape revealing Blankenship roughing up an ABC News reporter in 2008 --- which we 've only just now seen ( it 's posted in full below ) --- could as well be a scene straight out of Goodfellas or The Sopranos , the news today from the Charleston Gazette seems par for the course .
Ken Ward Jr. is reporting at the paper 's " Coal Tattoo " blog today that the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) has reportedly told victim 's family members that a page is mysteriously missing from the " fireboss book " at Massey 's Upper Big Branch Mine ...
Federal investigators have determined that a page was removed from the “ fireboss book ” at Massey Energy ’s Upper Big Branch Mine , where 29 workers were killed a month ago in the worst U.S. coal - mining disaster in 40 years .
That ’s according to a new court filing by lawyers for the families of two of the miners who died in that horrific April 5 explosion in Raleigh County .
U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration officials revealed this potentially important piece of information to the families of the Upper Big Branch miners during a closed - door meeting last week at Liberty High School in Beckley , according to the court documents .
Rachel Moreland and Mark Moreland , lawyers for the families of William I. Griffith and Ronald Maynor made this revelation public in a legal memorandum filed in the lawsuit in which they and the United Mine Workers seek to force MSHA to conduct its investigation of the disaster through a public hearing .
The legal memo , filed today in U.S. District Court in Charleston , says this is what happened at that meeting last week :
After much prodding by miners ’ families , MSHA admitted that the investigative team determined that one page of a fire boss book has been removed .
The legal memo does not indicate what date the page covered , or provide any additional details ( though I ’m told it was from sometime in October 2009 ) .
Given what we 've already learned about Massey 's extraordinary tactics deployed to evade any real accountability for thousands of safety violations at their mines over the years , the out - and - out destruction of evidence in a case in which the company or its owners and board members could ( or at least should ) be held culpable for man-slaughter , at the very least , would n't come as much of a surprise .
That point is especially true in the context of the following video from ABC News , taped in April of 2008 for 20 / 20 , showing Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship in all his thuggish glory .
As you 'll see , not only does Blankenship attempt to intimidate the reporter with the threat of being killed ---
" If you 're going to start taking pictures of me , you 're liable to get shot , " Blankenship tells the journalist at first sight --- but he then proceeds to rough him up , pushing him across the parking lot .
Take note of how far Blankenship actually shoves the guy --- looks as if it could be 50 to 100 feet --- during the tussle , by comparing where the footage begins right next to the trailer , and then ends far , far away after the Massey CEO finally stops jostling the camera ...
As WV environmental activist and radio host Bob Kincaid explained to The BRAD BLOG via email this week : " The culture of violence that exists in Massey flows from the top down .
In the last year , Massey supporters have been convicted twice in WV Magistrate courts for attacking / assaulting peaceful individuals .
No jail time in either case . "
Kincaid notes that , following , the ABC incident , " Blankenship , of course , was never charged .
Should 've been , but I assume ABC News did n't think it worth their time .
How wrong they were ! "
He says the incident " shines a light on the wholly dysfunctional , utterly corrupt judicial system in this state .
Add that into the same hopper with two misdemeanor cases ( one assault , one battery ) in which Massey supporters got off with fines only and no jail time , while peaceful protesters have received two month jail sentences , and been subjected to ridiculous bonds . "
That Massey 's board kept Blankenship in charge even after that footage was released two years ago speaks volumes .
That the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has kept Blankenship on as a member of their Board of Directors also speaks volumes about the thugs at the Chamber as well .
Velvet Revolution 's StopTheChamber.com campaign has long been calling for accountability for the Chamber 's CEO Tom Donohue , having issued a $ 200 k reward offer for information leading to his arrest and conviction .
Earlier this month , the VR campaign announced another reward offer of $ 50 k " for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any Massey Energy executive official for paying a bribe to any federal official for any purpose , including to cover up or ignore safety violations , pass legislation , or install or appoint pro-Massey people in key oversight positions . "

How 's that Whole ' Look Forward , Not Backward ' Thing Workin ' for Ya ?
And finally , where the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) is essentially the equivalent of the U.S. Mineral Management Service ( MMS ) , at least when it comes to responsibility for overseeing safety issues for the federal government --- the former responsible for overseeing coal mining , the latter responsible for overseeing oil drilling and rigs such as the Deepwater Horizon which blew up last month killing 11 workers and spewing millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico --- accountability is needed for those federal agencies and their failures to have shut down both of the deadly operations long ago .
Under the Bush Administration , both MSHA in the Dept. of Labor and MMS in the Dept. of Interior , became little more than extensions of the fossil fuel industry itself , having both long ago abdicated their statutory roles as federal regulators .
But where we are happy to hold the Bush Administration to account for their utter bastardization of the idea of " federal regulation " in these industries , we 're also happy to hold the Obama Administration accountable for having utterly failed to seek accountability for the eight years of criminal failure by the previous administration on virtually every account .
The buck now stops with them .
And they have simply refused to hold their criminal predecessors accountable .
The Administration 's political strategy to ' look forward , not backward ' is precisely what has allowed overly powerful scofflaw corporations like BP and Massey ( and thugs like Donohue and Blankenship ) to get away with the crimes they have for so long , raping and pillaging the country 's resources to the nearly - sole benefit of their officers and shareholders , even as the carnage --- including very real human bodies --- continues to pile up .
Will the Obama Administration ever get serious about accountability and bring these thugs --- all of them ... all the way to the top --- to account for what they 've done to this nation ?
Or will this administration end up equally liable for having helped to assure the bar of executive branch and corporate criminality stays forever lowered ?
Think the Bush administration was bad ?
Just wait for what the next Republican administration will believe they are allowed to do if nobody in the Bush Regime is ever held accountable for their historic crimes against this nation , and all that it once stood for .

A battle between Norman Finkelstein and Benny Morris on Russian television , I wish we could see it here .
" Dr. Morris , you ’re wearing many different hats , " Finkelstein says and Morris comes off as a propagandist more than a scholar , damaging himself at the end by stating that Israel did not attack " any hospital " in Gaza .
And as for the chicken farm that Israel destroyed with tanks , we do n’t know if there were " Hamas gunmen " inside the chicken coop , Morris says in a mocking tone .
As if it ’s funny .
The Goldstone Report demonstrates that Israel attacked two hospitals , al - Quds and al - Wafa Hospitals .
And as for the Sawafeary chicken farm , Israel wantonly destroyed 31,000 chickens and many coops when its army controlled the farm , and doing so served no military purpose .
Finkelstein takes the appropriate tone about the Gaza horrors , describing white phosphorus that burns at 1500 degrees .
And he stands up for the right of return at minute 15:00 or so , says that all the world is for it except for the US , Australia , Israel and some banana republics .
Bloodshed Off Gaza European Countries Condemn Storming of Aid Flotilla
Israeli commandos killed at least 10 and as many as 19 people when they stormed an activist flotilla carrying aid to the Gaza Strip on Monday .
The European Union has called for an inquiry into the incident , while German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle says he is " deeply concerned . "
Hey , these must be those “ interesting times ” the Chinese were banging on about !
Life sure is hella interesting at the moment , is n’t it ?
Hung parliaments and that ?
The freefall feeling is quite bracing in a way .
Who knows what ’s coming next ?
Anything ’s possible !
Wheeeeee !
The thing is , while most of us are waiting for the other shoe to drop , for the full force of these interesting times to come down and do a bit of major league squishing upside all our heads , a young man named Paul Chambers has already had his passport well and truly stamped by them .
Paul is the man who , excited about traveling to Belfast to a girl he had met through Twitter , posted the following Tweet :
“ Crap ! Robin Hood Airport is closed .
You ’ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I ’m blowing the airport sky high ! ! ”
Yesterday , he was found guilty of sending an “ indecent , obscene or menacing ” message and received a £ 1000 fine and a criminal record .
On top of all this , he lost his job and Crazy Colours ( the girl he was originally flying over to meet ) said yesterday “ Paul was half way through qualifying as an accountant .
This conviction means he can’t qualify now .
His career is ruined . ”
Ever read ‘ The Joke ’ by Milan Kundera ?
It ’s good !
Not my favourite novel by the man , but holy shit , guess what it ’s about !
( Forgive me for copying and pasting the Wikipedia synopsis ) .
Written and set in 1965 Prague , the novel opens with Ludvik Jahn looking back on the joke that changed his life in the early 1950s .
In a playful mood , he writes a postcard to a girl in his class during their summer break …
“ Optimism is the opium of the people !
A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity !
Long live Trotsky ! ”
His colleagues and fellow young - party leaders do not quite see the humor in the sentiment expressed in the postcard .
Ludvik finds himself expelled from the party and college and drafted to a part of the Czech military where alleged subversives form work brigades and spend the next few years working in mines .
Jack of Kent is the man to read on why both prosecution and law are bunk in this case , so I won ’ t try to add to that .
I just wanted to address just the two or three people who I saw yesterday trotting the old “ He was stupid to post the joke and deserves what he got ” argument around the paddock .
And that includes the Judge on the case , Jonathan Bennett , who said he was ‘ satisfied ’ the message was of a ‘ menacing nature in the context of the time we live in ’ .
What all these people are essentially saying is this : because this country was made less safe by the hasty , reckless , duplicitous way in which Tony Blair took us into war ( a war which only yesterday claimed 114 more lives ) , and because he will never be brought to justice for that , we must live in a state of paranoid readiness , a state of nervous anxiety , a humorless state that cannot tell the difference between a joke and a threat , for the foreseeable future .
Because that one , massive crime will go unpunished , we shall all be punished in thousands of interesting ways .
As Robert Harris said , while we stand at airport security with our shoes in our hands , Tony Blair floats unimpeded through another part of the terminal .
As we sit by a ruined Tube station , picking rubble out of our hair , Tony Blair is on his way to a thousand quid a plate dinner in a bulletproof limo .
To those people who put forward the view that Paul is the one at fault here , I ’d like to say , it ’s not supposed to be like this .
We ’re not supposed to be scared of our shadows .
We ’re not supposed to be torturing people .
We ’re not supposed to be letting people get away with murder .
We ’re not supposed to be prosecuting people for offhand jokes .
If you want to follow the case , the #twitterjoketrial is the hashtag du jour .
If you want to contribute to Paul ’s fine / legal defence , details are here and here .
If you want to complain about the case to the CPS , go here .
I urge you to get involved in whatever way you can .
We need to show these people that we refuse to live by their arbitrary , paranoid laws .
We need to remind them that we are living in England , 2010 , not Prague 1965 .
While we ca n’t avoid some of the interesting times up ahead , we can at least carry ourselves with some dignity through them .
[ Michel Bauwens has kindly invited me to serialize excerpts from my forthcoming book The Homebrew Industrial Revolution : A Low - Overhead Manifesto .
Over the next several weeks , I will post two excerpts from each chapter ( one excerpt a week ) . ]
Chapter One . A Wrong Turn ( first excerpt )
The natural course of things , according to [ Ralph ] Borsodi , was that the “ process of shifting production from the home and neighborhood to the distantly located factory ” would have peaked with “ the perfection of the reciprocating steam - engine , ” and then leveled off until the invention of the electric motor reversed the process and enabled families and local producers to utilize the powered machinery previously restricted to the factory .
[ Borsodi , Prosperity and Security ]
But it did n’t happen that way .
Instead , electricity was incorporated into manufacturing in an utterly perverse way .
Michael Piore and Charles Sabel described a fork in the road , based on which of two possible alternative ways were chosen for incorporating electrical power into manufacturing .
The first , more in keeping with the unique potential of the new technology , was to integrate electrically powered machinery into small - scale craft production : “ a combination of craft skill and flexible equipment , ” or “ mechanized craft production . ”
Its foundation was the idea that machines and processes could augment the craftsman ’s skill , allowing the worker to embody his or her knowledge in ever more varied products : the more flexible the machine , the more widely applicable the process , the more it expanded the craftsman ’s capacity for productive expression .
The other was to adapt electrical machinery to the preexisting framework of paleotechnic industrial organization — in other words , what was to become twentieth century mass - production industry .
This latter alternative entailed breaking the production process down into its separate steps , and then substituting extremely expensive and specialized machinery for human skill .
“ The more specialized the machine — the faster it worked and the less specialized its operator needed to be —the greater its contribution to cutting production costs .
[ Sabel and Piore , The Second Industrial Divide ]
The first path , unfortunately , was for the most part the one not taken … .
The second , mass - production model became the dominant form of industrial organization .
Neotechnic advances like electrically powered machinery , which offered the potential for decentralized production and were ideally suited to a fundamentally different kind of society , have so far been integrated into the framework of mass production industry .
Mumford argued ( in Technics and Civilization ) that the neotechnic advances , rather than being used to their full potential as the basis for a new kind of economy , were instead incorporated into a paleotechnic framework .
Neotechnic had not “ displaced the older regime ” with “ speed and decisiveness , ” and had not yet “ developed its own form and organization . ”
Emerging from the paleotechnic order , the neotechnic institutions have nevertheless in many cases compromised with it , given way before it , lost their identity by reason of the weight of vested interests that continued to support the obsolete instruments and the anti-social aims of the middle industrial era .
Paleotechnic ideals still largely dominate the industry and the politics of the Western World … .
* * *
The new machines followed , not their own pattern , but the pattern laid down by previous economic and technical structures ….
* * *
The fact is that in the great industrial areas of Western Europe and America… , the paleotechnic phase is still intact and all its essential characteristics are uppermost , even though many of the machines it uses are neotechnic ones or have been made over — as in the electrification of railroad systems — by neotechnic methods .
In this persistence of paleotechnics … we continue to worship the twin deities , Mammon and Moloch … .
* * *
We have merely used our new machines and energies to further processes which were begun under the auspices of capitalist and military enterprise : we have not yet utilized them to conquer these forms of enterprise and subdue them to more vital and humane purposes ….
* * * Not alone have the older forms of technics served to constrain the development of the neotechnic economy : but the new inventions and devices have been frequently used to maintain , renew , stabilize the structure of the old social order ….
* * *
The present pseudomorph is , socially and technically , third - rate .
It has only a fraction of the efficiency that the neotechnic civilization as a whole may possess , provided it finally produces its own institutional forms and controls and directions and patterns .
At present , instead of finding these forms , we have applied our skill and invention in such a manner as to give a fresh lease of life to many of the obsolete capitalist and militarist institutions of the older period .
Paleotechnic purposes with neotechnic means : that is the most obvious characteristic of the present order .
Mumford used Spengler ’s idea of the “ cultural pseudomorph ” to illustrate the process : “ … in geology … a rock may retain its structure after certain elements have been leached out of it and been replaced by an entirely different kind of material .
Since the apparent structure of the old rock remains , the new product is called a pseudomorph . ”
A similar metamorphosis is possible in culture : new forces , activities , institutions , instead of crystallizing independently into their own appropriate forms , may creep into the structure of an existing civilization … .
As a civilization , we have not yet entered the neotechnic phase … .
How were existing institutional interests able to thwart the revolutionary potential of electrical power , and divert neotechnic technologies into paleotechnic channels ?
The answer is that the state tipped the balance .
The state played a central role in the triumph of mass - production industry in the United States .
The state ’s subsidies to long - distance transportation were first and most important .
There never would have been large manufacturing firms producing for a national market , had not the federal government first created a national market with the national railroad network .
A high - volume national transportation system was an indispensable prerequisite for big business .
We quoted Mumford ’s observation above , that the neotechnic revolution offered to substitute industrialization by local economic development for reliance on long - distance transport .
State policies , however , tipped the balance in the other direction : they artificially shifted the competitive advantage toward industrial concentration and long - distance distribution .
Alfred Chandler , the chief apostle of the large mass - production corporation , himself admitted as much : all the advantages he claimed for mass production presupposed a high - volume , high - speed , high - turnover distribution system on a national scale , without regard to whether the costs of the latter exceeded the alleged benefits of the former … .
The railroad and telegraph , “ so essential to high - volume production and distribution , ” were in Chandler ’s view what made possible this steady flow of goods through the distribution pipeline .
The primacy of such state - subsidized infrastructure is indicated by the very structure of Chandler ’s book .
He begins with the railroads and telegraph system , themselves the first modern , multi-unit enterprises .
And in subsequent chapters , he recounts the successive evolution of a national wholesale network piggybacking on the centralized transportation system , followed by a national retail system , and only then by large - scale manufacturing for the national market .
A national long - distance transportation system led to mass distribution , which in turn led to mass production … .
In other words , the so - called “ internal economies of scale ” in manufacturing could come about only when the offsetting external diseconomies of long - distance distribution were artificially nullified by corporate welfare .
Such “ economies ” can only occur given an artificial set of circumstances which permit the reduced unit costs of expensive , product - specific machinery to be considered in isolation , because the indirect costs entailed are all externalized on society .
And if the real costs of long - distance shipping , high - pressure marketing , etc. , do in fact exceed the savings from faster and more specialized machinery , then the “ efficiency ” is a false one … .
The national railroad system simply never would have come into existence on such a scale , with a centralized network of trunk lines of such capacity , had not the state rammed the project through .
Piore and Sabel describe the enormous capital outlays , and the enormous transaction costs to be overcome , in creating a national railroad system .
Not only the startup costs of actual physical capital , but those of securing rights of way , were “ huge ” :
It is unlikely that railroads would have been built as quickly and extensively as they were but for the availability of massive government subsidies .
Other transaction costs overcome by government , in creating the railroad system , included the revision of tort and contract law ( e.g. , to exempt common carriers from liability for many kinds of physical damage caused by their operation ) .
According to Matthew Josephson ( The Robber Barons ) , for ten years or more before 1861 , “ the railroads , especially in the West , were ‘ land companies ’ which acquired their principal raw material through pure grants in return for their promise to build , and whose directors … did a rushing land business in farm lands and town sites at rising prices . ” …
The federal railroad land grants … included fifteen mile tracts of land on either side of the actual right of way .
As the railroads were completed , this land skyrocketed in value .
And as new towns were built along the railroad routes , every house and business was built on land sold by the railroads .
The tracts included valuable timber land , as well ….
Absent the land grants and government purchases of railroad bonds , the railroads would likely have developed instead along the initial lines described by Mumford : many local rail networks linking communities into local industrial economies .
The regional and national interlinkages of local networks , when they did occur , would have been far fewer and far smaller in capacity .
The comparative costs of local and national distribution , accordingly , would have been quite different .
In a nation of hundreds of local industrial economies , with long - distance rail transport much more costly than at present , the natural pattern of industrialization would have been to integrate small - scale power machinery into flexible manufacturing for local markets .
Instead , the state artificially aggregated the demand for manufactured goods into a single national market , and artificially lowered the costs of distribution for those serving that market .
In effect , it created an artificial ecosystem to which large - scale , mass - production industry was best “ adapted ” … .
Besides almost single - handedly creating the artificially unified and cheap national market without which national manufacturers could not have existed , the railroad companies also actively promoted the concentration of industry through their rate policies .
Piore and Sabel argue that “ the railroads ’ policy of favoring their largest customers , through rebates , ” was a central factor in the rise of the large corporation . ” …
“ Indeed , seen in this light , the rise of the American corporation can be interpreted more as the result of complex alliances among Gilded Age robber barons than as a first solution to the problem of market stabilization faced by a mass - production economy . ”
Second , the American legal framework was transformed in the mid-nineteenth century in ways that made a more hospitable environment for large corporations operating on a national scale .
Among the changes were the rise of a general federal commercial law , general incorporation laws , and the status of the corporation as a person under the Fourteenth Amendment .
The functional significance of these changes on a national scale was analogous to the later effect , on a global scale , of the Bretton Woods agencies and the GATT process : a centralized legal order was created , prerequisite for their stable functioning , coextensive with the market areas of large corporations ….
Third , not only did the government indirectly promote the concentration and cartelization of industry through the railroads it had created , but it did so directly through patent law .
… [ M ] ass - production requires large business organizations capable of exercising sufficient power over their external environment to guarantee the consumption of their output .
Patents promoted the stable control of markets by oligopoly firms through the control , exchange and pooling of patents .
According to David Noble ( America by Design ) , two essentially new science - based industries ( those that “ grew out of the soil of scientific rather than traditional craft knowledge ” ) emerged in the late 19th century : the electrical and chemical industries .
In the electrical industry , General Electric had its origins first in a merger between Edison Electric ( which controlled all of Edison ’s electrical patents ) and the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company , and then in an 1892 merger between Edison General Electric and Thomas - Houston — both of them motivated primarily by patent considerations … .
From the 1890s on , the electrical industry was dominated by two large firms : GE and Westinghouse , both of which owed their market shares largely to patent control .
In addition to the patents which they originally owned , they acquired control over patents ( and hence over much of the electrical manufacturing market ) through “ acquisition of the patent rights of individual inventors , acquisition of competing firms , mergers with competitors , and the systematic and strategic development of their own patentable inventions .
As GE and Westinghouse together secured a deadlock on the electrical industry through patent acquisition , competition between them became increasingly intense and disruptive .
By 1896 the litigation cost from some three hundred pending patent suits was enormous , and the two companies agreed to form a joint Board of Patent Control … .
The structure of the telephone industry had similar origins , with the Bell Patent Association forming “ the nucleus of the first Bell industrial organization ” ( and eventually of AT&T ) The National Bell Telephone Company , from the 1880s on , fought vigorously to “ occupy the field ” ( in the words of general manager Theodore N. Vail ) through patent control .
As Vail described the process , the company surrounded itself
with everything that would protect the business , that is the knowledge of the business , all the auxiliary apparatus ; a thousand and one little patents and inventions with which to do the business which was necessary , that is what we wanted to control and get possession of … .
This approach strengthened the company ’s position of control over the market not only during the seventeen year period of the main patents , but ( as Frederick Fish put it in an address to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers ) during the subsequent seventeen years of
each and every one of the patents taken out on subsidiary methods and devices invented during the progress of commercial development .
[ Therefore ] one of the first steps taken was to organize a corps of inventive engineers to perfect and improve the telephone system in all directions … that by securing accessory inventions , possession of the field might be retained as far as possible and for as long a time as possible ….
Even with the intensified competition resulting from the expiration of the original Bell patents in 1894 , and before government favoritism in the grants of rights - of - way and regulated monopoly status , the legacy effect of AT&T ’s control of the secondary patents was sufficient to secure it half the telephone market thirteen years later , in 1907 … .
By the time the FCC was formed in 1935 , the Bell System had acquired patents to “ some of the most important inventions in telephony and radio , ” and “ through various radio - patent pool agreements in the 1920s … had effectively consolidated its position relative to the other giants in the industry . ”
In so doing , according to an FCC investigation , AT&T had gained control of “ the exploitation of potentially competitive and emerging forms of communication ” and “ pre-empt[ed ] for itself new frontiers of technology for exploitation in the future … . ”
The radio- patent pools included AT&T , GE and Westinghouse , RCA ( itself formed as a subsidiary of GE after the latter acquired American Marconi ) , and American Marconi .
Alfred Chandler ’s history of the origins of the consumer electronics industry ( Inventing the Electronic Century ) is little more than an extended account of which patents were held , and subsequently acquired , by which companies ….
The American chemical industry , in its modern form , was made possible by the Justice Department ’s seizure of German chemical patents in WWI …
More generally , patents are an effective tool for cartelizing markets in industry at large .
They were used in the automobile and steel industries among others , according to Noble .
In a 1906 article , mechanical engineer and patent lawyer Edwin Prindle described patents as “ the best and most effective means of controlling competition . ” …
And unlike purely private cartels , which tend toward defection and instability , patent control cartels — being based on a state - granted privilege — carry a credible and effective punishment for defection .
Through their “ Napoleonic concept of industrial warfare , with inventions and patents as the soldiers of fortune , ” and through “ the research arm of the ‘ patent offensive , ’ ” manufacturing corporations were able to secure stable control of markets in their respective industries .
These were the conditions present at the outset of the mass production revolution , in which the development of the corporate industrial economy began .
In the absence of these necessary preconditions , there simply would not have been a single national market or large industrial corporations serving it .
Rather than being adopted into the framework of the paleotechnic factory system , the introduction of electrical machinery would likely have followed its natural course and lived up to its unique potential : powered machinery would have been incorporated into small - scale production for local markets , and the national economy would have developed as “ a hundred Emilia - Romagnas . ”
Add free public transit to the granite counters and stainless - steel appliances on the list of amenities attracting buyers to Toronto ’s hot condo market .
Under a new city policy , condo developers will have to include a year ’s supply of Metropasses in each new unit they sell .
“ This is the carrot that will get people onto public transit , ” said Councillor Howard Moscoe ( Eglinton - Lawrence ) , a former TTC chair , who introduced the policy approved by council in November .
But just like spa tubs and lakeside views , the cost of the passes will be reflected in the price of the condo , according to developers .
The rule will apply to development applications made after April 28 on buildings with at least 20 units in the downtown and central waterfront areas , city centres in Scarborough , North York and Etobicoke , and avenues defined by the official plan , including the arteries slated for the Transit City light rail plan .
“ These units are in strategic locations ; these are not condos in the middle of nowhere , ” said Rod McPhail , Toronto ’s director of transportation planning , urban development services .
The designated areas already have good transit access and many of the avenues are ripe for transit - oriented development .
The new rule is one of the trade - offs for developments in areas where the requirements for residential parking in condos have been lowered , he said .
It will be about 18 months before the developments to which the rule applies are built .
McPhail believes other Canadian cities , notably Vancouver , will be watching to see whether the rule helps generate transit ridership .
But developers have made no secret of the fact they oppose the new charge and that costs will be buried in the price of units , said Stephen Dupuis , president and CEO of the Building Industry and Land Development Association ( BILD ) .
“ It ’s wasteful because people are going to get those Metropasses whether they want them or need them ( or not ) , and I figure a third of people do n’t want them or need them , ” he said .
The reduction in parking requirements is meaningless unless the threshold is placed low enough that a developer can eliminate an entire floor of parking , said Dupuis .
But Moscoe says all developers are not opposed .
In fact , he claims , the original idea came from a developer .
He ’s convinced builders will end up marketing the Metropasses the same way they tout their locations and amenities , because people want to live near transit .
For developers it ’s a good deal , he said .
They can buy the passes in bulk at about a 12 per cent savings and then get 15 per cent back in a federal tax deduction — and they do n’t have to pay for the passes until the unit is sold .

There is a press release from Purdue University by Elizabeth K. Gardner and Greg Kline regarding a study by Matthew Huber of Purdue and Steve Sherwood of the University of New South Wales .
The press release is titled
Researchers find future temperatures could exceed livable limits
The news media have already uncritically picked up this story ( e.g. see Climate change could make half the world uninhabitable ) .
The paper version of this study is
Steven C. Sherwood and Matthew Huber , 2010 : An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress
http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0913352107
with the abstract
“ Despite the uncertainty in future climate - change impacts , it is often assumed that humans would be able to adapt to any possible warming .
Here we argue that heat stress imposes a robust upper limit to such adaptation .
Peak heat stress , quantified by the wetbulb temperature TW , is surprisingly similar across diverse climates today .
TW never exceeds 31 °C .
Any exceedence of 35 °C for extended periods should induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals , as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible .
While this never happens now , it would begin to occur with global - mean warming of about 7 °C , calling the habitability of some regions into question .
With 11 – 12 °C warming , such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed .
Eventual warmings of 12 °C are possible from fossil fuel burning .
One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed .
Heat stress also may help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record . ”
The article is edited by Kerry A. Emanuel , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ,
The study has a major fault in that it has not properly assessed the actual behavoir of the atmosphere if such warming occurred in the lower troposphere .
Moreover , this is another example of the publication of a paper with predictions that can not be tested .
I discuss these issues in more depth below .
Excerpts from the news article read
WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind . – Reasonable worst - case scenarios for global warming could lead to deadly temperatures for humans in coming centuries , according to research findings from Purdue University and the University of New South Wales , Australia .
Researchers for the first time have calculated the highest tolerable “ wet - bulb ” temperature and found that this temperature could be exceeded for the first time in human history in future climate scenarios if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated .
The researchers calculated that humans and most mammals , which have internal body temperatures near 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit , will experience a potentially lethal level of heat stress at wet - bulb temperature above 95 degrees sustained for six hours or more , said Matthew Huber , the Purdue professor of earth and atmospheric sciences who co-authored the paper that is currently available online and will be published in an upcoming issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Wet - bulb temperature is equivalent to what is felt when wet skin is exposed to moving air .
It includes temperature and atmospheric humidity and is measured by covering a standard thermometer bulb with a wetted cloth and fully ventilating it .
and
While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change central estimates of business - as - usual warming by 2100 are seven degrees Fahrenheit , eventual warming of 25 degrees is feasible , he said .
This study was supported by the NSF ; i.e .
The National Science Foundation - funded research investigated the long - term implications of sustained greenhouse gas emissions on climate extremes .
The team used climate models to compare the peak wet - bulb temperatures to the global temperatures for various climate simulations and found that the peak wet - bulb temperature rises approximately 1 degree Centigrade for every degree Centigrade increase in tropical mean temperature .
This is an example of the paradigm , as written by Dick Lindzen ( see ) where
“ In brief , we have the new paradigm where simulation and programs have replaced theory and observation , where government largely determines the nature of scientific activity … … ”
The Sherwood and Huber 2010 paper , while it fits Dick ’s new paradigm , it also fails the scientifically plausibility test .
Can the wet bulb temperature actually reach 95 F ( 35C ) over wide areas as they claim ?
To explore this issue , we start with a thermodynamic diagram which relates temperature , wet bulb temperature , and pressure together .
One form of this diagram is the skew T / log p which is presented below .
http://ccrc.unh.edu/~stm/AS/Common/Skew_T.JPG
[ click figure below for a larger , clearer image ]
This diagram provides a tool to assess the consequences for the Earth ’s atmosphere above the surface , if a 95 F ( 35C ) wet bulb temperature were actually achieved .
Values of the wet bulb temperature correspond to wet adiabats in the above figure .
For example , if you trace along a wet adiabat to 500 hPa , the temperature that results when this high humidity air ascends to that height can be obtained , as discussed in
Pielke Sr. , R.A. 2002 : Synoptic Weather Lab Notes .
Colorado State University , Department of Atmospheric Science Class Report # 1 , Final Version , August 20 , 2002 .
With a value of 35C for the wet bulb temperature , this corresponds to a temperature at 500 hPa of ~ 14C ( ~57 F ) .
In the current climate , the values of the temperatures at 500 hPa are almost always between - 5C and - 45C .
Only very locally , such as in the eye wall region of a hurricane , are the 500 hPa temperatures warmer than - 5C .
The reason is that deep cumulus convection mixes the atmosphere up to this level and higher such that the moist adiabat is a close approximation of the resulting atmospheric temperature lapse rate .
We discuss this role of deep cumulus convection for the higher latitudes in our papers
Chase , T.N. , B. Herman , R.A. Pielke Sr. , X. Zeng , and M. Leuthold , 2002 : A proposed mechanism for the regulation of minimum midtropospheric temperatures in the Arctic .

J. Geophys .
Res. - Atmos. , 113 , D24101 , doi:10.1029/2008JD009799 .
In the first paper , in the abstract we wrote
We further provide evidence that minimum Arctic midtropospheric temperatures are regulated by moist convective processes and that minimum 500 mbar temperatures are controlled to a large extent by high - latitude sea surface temperatures .
The temperature - 45C is the expected 500 mbar temperature in an atmosphere regulated by moist adiabatic ascent from a surface temperature of 1 – 2 below 0 C , the approximate freezing point of seawater .
The same mechanism to regulate 500 hPa temperatures occurs in the tropics with respect to how warm temperatures can become at that level .
The sea surface tempertures in the tropics determine how warm the 500 hPa temperature can become , as well as being the source for the water vapor that is needed to elevate the wet bulb temperature .
The IPCC multi-decadal climate model predictions , of the type such as the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model used in the Sherwood and Huber PNAS study , however , are not accurately representing this relationship between the surface and mid-troposphere , as illustrated , for example , by the paper
De-Zheng Sun , Yongqiang Yu , and Tao Zhang , 2009 : Tropical Water Vapor and Cloud Feedbacks in Climate Models : A Further Assessment Using Coupled Simulations Journal of Climate , Volume 22 , Issue 5 ( March 2009 ) pp. 1287–1304 .
I commented on this paper in my post in May 2006
Tropical Water Vapor and Cloud Feedbacks in Climate Models : A Further Assessment Using Coupled Simulations by De-Zheng Sun , Yongqiang Yu , and Tao Zhang
Their study indicates that the IPCC models are overpredicting global warming in response to positive radiative forcing .
Their abstract includes the text ( referring to global climate models ]
“ All models we have examined in this analysis are found to have a weaker negative feedback from the net surface heating than that from observations , indicating that deep convection over the equatorial Pacific in the models has a weaker regulatory effect over the SST in that region . ”
This means that for Sherwood and Huber to be correct , the ocean surface temperatures over large areas must warm to over 95 F ( 35C ) .
Since , as reported in their article , the current wet bulb temperatures do not rise above about 31C ( F ) , the ocean over large areas would need to warm to 35C and warmer .
However , the resulting deep cumulus convection would not only significantly warm the troposphere ( i.e. to at and above 14C at 500 hPa ) , but produce considerable cloud cover and precipitation .
As discussed in the Sun et al 2009 paper , the couple atmosphere - ocean climate models inaccurately represent the cloud - precipitation feedback , and thus incorrectly overstate the positive feedback with respect to ocean surface warming .
The Sherwood and Huber 2010 paper is not a scientifically robust examination of this issue with respect to their claims of the elevation of the wet bulb temperature .
Finally , the PNAS article is yet another example of the publication of model results that are not testable .
The Sherwood and Huber paper is not a proper scientific study as I discussed in my post
Short Circuiting The Scientific Process – A Serious Problem In The Climate Science Community
I wrote in that post
“ What the current publication process has evolved into , at the detriment of proper scientific investigation , are the publication of untested ( and often untestable ) hypotheses … the policy community is being significantly misinformed about the actual status of our understanding of the climate system and the role of humans within it . ”
The Sherwood and Huber paper is just a model sensitivity study , not a verifiable prediction .
Moreover , not only is it scientifically flawed , but the dissemination of a press release illusrates that this is really not a science study .
The funding of such a study by the National Science Foundation ( whose predictions cannot be verified ) illustrates another failure by the NSF to properly support climate science .

STRANGE as it sounds , we know more about distant planets than we do about the deep sea .
Light - years may measure greater distances , but fathoms can be  unfathomable .
Inky darkness , icy temperatures and , most of all , crushing pressures conspire to make deep exploration daunting if not impossible .
That is why scientists estimate that humans have glimpsed perhaps only a millionth of what there is down there to see .
That also helps explain why a runaway oil well on the seabed in the Gulf of Mexico is a massive calamity , with crews struggling to stop the gushing crude .
It is the brutal nature of the abyss .
The biggest challenge is water ’s inherent density .
Accumulations crush all but the strongest gear .
For every 33 feet of seawater , the pressure exerted on an object increases by the equivalent of what a human experiences at sea level  14.7 pounds per square inch .
At the wellhead , roughly a mile down , that translates into a pressure of more than one ton per square inch .

Czech Elections Economic Concerns Push Voters Towards Center - Right Government
Disappointment in traditional politics was evident in the Czech elections this weekend , with the two biggest parties seeing a massive slump in votes .
The country is now on course for a center - right coalition , with two newly formed parties likely to be part of any coalition government .
On the bright side , other people have made objects with the same exact design with the same amount of uselessness , but this one wins by being able to be completely dismantled without issue .
Real - estate speculator Tom Chapman has long thrived on threats .
His threats to bulldoze roads for a community on the rim of Black Canyon along the Gunnison River .
Threats to build helicopter - access luxury homes in the heart of wilderness areas .
Threats to burn down famed mining structures to make room for mansions .
Threats to close off recreational access .
Over the years , federal and local officials have caved and paid his price before anything gets built .
This time , he has moved beyond brinkmanship and built a 4,700 - square - foot luxury home , now for sale , on 33 acres atop the south rim of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park .
Last week , he sold 79 acres inside the park to an out - of - state buyer in an undisclosed deal .
The Black Canyon home marks Chapman ’s return , after a break of several years , to high - end , high - stakes development on islands within public land .
He ’s foreclosing on a conservation - minded buyer who acquired 19 of Chapman ’s wilderness parcels in Colorado in 2007 and says he will again market the remote acres as home sites .
He also vows to block skiers and hikers on land he owns in a popular backcountry drainage next to Telluride ski area .
“ I ’m a private - property advocate and a capitalist , for which I would never apologize , ” Chapman said in a statement .
“ My job is to represent landowners whose Fifth Amendment private - property rights have been abused by vote - seeking politicians , overzealous regulators and an environmental community that consistently shows little to no respect for private - property rights . ”
Chapman ’s David-vs .
- Goliath soliloquy sounds like it comes from the front porch of his besieged family ’s homestead .
But that ’s not the case .
The 60 - year - old Paonia native seeks out Colorado landowners with parcels inside federally protected lands .
He finds investors — such as the TDX investment group from Alabama — that pay those owners well above appraised values for remote , seemingly undevelopable plots .
Then come the promises of palaces — and the pristine parcels become pawns in a dare - me - to - build real - estate game .
Chapman , who said he chose to build on the rim of Black Canyon after federal officials rebuffed his repeated pleas to trade the park property for public lands near Las Vegas and Rifle , has grown calloused to accusations of being a “ bad capitalist . ”
“ Of course , ( my accusers ) ca n’t be bothered by the fact that the Park Service came along and surrounded the place in 2000 , with the supreme arrogance it takes to do so and not even ask the landowner if they might like to be included in a national park , ” Chapman said .
“ The federal government approach to creating wilderness inholdings is the same : Screw the landowners .
Surround them ; deal with the consequences later . ”
Chapman elevates those consequences .
It ’s an unlikable but legal strategy that in the past quarter century has earned Chapman and his clients millions .
A profit of $ 3.5 million
In 1993 , Chapman burned a log home he was building on a private parcel inside the West Elk wilderness and swapped the land for 107 Forest Service acres above Telluride , which he promptly sold for a $ 3.5 million profit .
“ Basically , he has a game of extortion going on , and the more that agencies or private landowners play into that , the more successful he is , ” said Hil ary White , executive director of the Sheep Mountain Alliance , which works to protect the high country around Telluride .
“ We do n’t play that game with him , and nobody is going to be too interested anymore .
More people are aware of his schemes , so they do n’t work anymore . ”
Chapman knows that cold shoulder .
Before beginning construction on the Black Canyon home in 2005 — dubbed “ Casa Barranca ” — Chapman said he sent letters to all of Colorado ’s congressional delegates , state legislators , the director of the Park Service and “ about 20 ” state and national conservation organizations .
He said the letters asked for input in finding “ nondevelopment solutions ” for the Black Canyon lands .
“ The response was a large , ominous silence .
Not one person , not one politician and not one conservation organization could find the time to respond , ” Chapman said .
“ No one cares one iota about this magnificent canyon .
The Park Service drove by ( the construction project ) every day .
Their efforts at preserving these lands have been feckless , an embarrassment .
They have expressed zero interest in protecting these lands — hiding behind their ancient ‘ Let - us - steal - your - land ’ appraisal . . . and a forlorn ‘ What can we do now ? ’ lament expressed now . ”
Each of his most controversial deals , Chapman said , involved “ a prior abused landowner , abused by the purveyors of the public ’s interest . ”
Chapman is very private , rarely speaks publicly and is seldom photographed .
He lives near Delta , enjoys ballroom dancing and occasionally plays piano at retirement homes and high school dances .
He bristles at the notion of defending the real - estate deals he has brokered with the government — deals once labeled by former Sen .
Ben Nighthorse Campbell as “ taxpayer terrorism . ”
He is certainly a clever broker , able to finagle the highest price possible for overlooked land .
It ’s when those lonely parcels suddenly become important — when acreage is eyed for a national park , when conservation groups target land for protection or when businesses such as ski resorts plot potential expansions — that Chapman pounces .
“ We knew that he could be one of the outcomes , ” said Bob Risch , who in 1998 helped form the Red Mountain Project to corral historic mining structures atop Red Mountain Pass into federal protection .
The effort lured Chapman , whose clients scooped up the region ’s famous Yankee Girl mining structure and , after a land swap with the Forest Service failed , announced plans to bulldoze the iconic head frame to make room for a client ’s home .
“ Every mining claim we purchased and added to national forest , it sort of enhanced the value of nearby mining claims , ” Risch said .
“ There are people for whom the dollar is the bottom line .
They do n’t have really any kind of altruistic streak .
We have had people flat - out donate claims , but Tom is so far beyond anybody else we ever encountered in trying to strike reasonable deals . ”
The wildlife experience
As Colorado ’s wilderness advocates ponder expansions such as the proposed 380,000 - acre Hidden Gems Wilderness or the 63,000 - acre San Juan Wilderness , they are reaching out to inholders and adjacent property owners .
The idea , said Gems campaign director Pete Kolbenschlag , is to smooth relations with owners who could disrupt the wilderness experience with development .
Montrose County officials , in reaction to Chapman ’s house and plans for the 79 - acre parcel he just sold atop the highest point in Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park , are tweaking their master plan to address building designs in agricultural zones .
Planners in Pitkin , San Miguel , Gunnison , Eagle and Summit counties long ago adopted strict building guidelines for islands of private land surrounded by publicly owned mountains .
“ The high - country zoning has been a good incentive for landowners to come in and work on creative development rights or conservation easements or just selling their land at reasonable rates , ” said White , who recently helped a landowner in the middle of the proposed San Juan Wilderness lock his mining claims in a conservation easement .
Montrose County ’s new regulations will govern building height , view corridors , colors , materials and general aesthetics of construction inside the park .
“ Until we change the regulations , he will be able to do anything without any real building standards beyond a building permit , ” said Steve White , Montrose County ’s planner .
Property - rights activists , while agreeing with Chapman that landowners inside federal lands should be more protected from condemnation or low - ball acquisition from the government , do not condone his tactics .
Chapman gives all inholders a bad name , said Chuck Cushman , founder and head of the American Land Rights Association , which formed in 1978 as the National Park Inholders Association .
“ It ’s disappointing that Mr. Chapman wants to continually bait the government by building completely inappropriate houses in places where houses should not be built , ” Cushman said .
“ He is hurting all inholders nationwide because he gives the government an excuse to develop eminent - domain programs to stop this kind of development .
We do not support deliberately destroying property inside national parks for speculative ventures to make money . ”

Chapman ’s blazed trails
1984 : Tom Chapman announced plans for 132 homes on 4,200 acres on the north rim of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison , then a national monument .
The Park Service paid $ 500 an acre , compared with the $ 210 - an - acre appraised value .
1987 : Chapman helped a rancher close a trail through his ranch , blocking access to a Gold Medal Fishery on the Gunnison River .
The Bureau of Land Management and local fishermen paid $ 400,000 to buy back a pathway and restore traditional access .
1993 : Chapman sent out pictures of helicopters lugging timber for a home on 240 acres in the West Elk wilderness he had purchased with investors for what he said was $ 960,000 .
The Forest Service in 1994 swapped the West Elk land for 107 federal acres in Alta Lakes Basin , above Telluride , which the agency assessed as comparable land .
The following year , Chapman sold the alpine acreage in two deals worth $ 4.2 million .
1998 : Chapman and Alabama investment firm TDX acquired 112 acres in Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument , the year before Congress designated the Montrose County area as a national park .
He paid $ 240,000 .
Park officials appraised the acreage at $ 500,000 in 2003 , the same year Chapman listed the land on eBay for $ 1.24 million .
Early this year , Chapman and partner Ron Curry finished construction of a 4,700 - square - foot home on 33 acres inside the park .
Last week , he sold the remaining 79 acres — which hosts five home sites — to an out - of - state buyer in an undisclosed deal .
1999 : Chapman and TDX printed glossy brochures of mining claims inside wilderness areas near Vail , Durango , Crested Butte and Cañon City , with prices including potential homes ranging from $ 2 million to $ 8 million .
Montrose businessman and conservationist Mark Young bought those 19 wilderness parcels from Chapman for $ 950,000 in 2007 , but they are now in foreclosure .
2005 : Chapman sent conservation groups and the Forest Service pictures of a bulldozer poised at the base of Red Mountain ’s famed Yankee Girl mine .
Young bought the Yankee Girl in 2006 for $ 246,300 and put the historic property into a conservation easement .
April 2010 : Chapman announced his Gold Hill Development Co. investment group had spent $ 246,000 on 103 acres of mining claims in the Bear Creek drainage above Telluride ( pictured below ) .
The Telluride ski area had recently won Forest Service approval for guided backcountry skiing in the popular Bear Creek .
Chapman , citing avalanche danger , promised to prohibit skiing and hiking on his belt of land that bisects the roadless valley .
AURORA — Looking for anyone and everyone to sue is nothing new for lawyers and plaintiffs .
That appears to be the case for the parents of the 3 - year - old boy killed in an accident at an Aurora ice cream shop on South Havana Street in 2008 .
The parents are suing many who came into contact with Francis Hernandez , an illegal immigrant found guilty of causing the crash .
They are going after the car dealership that sold the Chevy Suburban he drove in the crash because the person who purchased it , using one of Hernandez ’s aliases , had an invalid driver ’s license — and could be Hernandez himself .
Because of that , they claim in the suit , the dealership and the selling agent were negligent .
The family of 3 - year - old Marten Kudlis also is suing Hernandez , as well as the parents of his common - law wife because they may have provided him with the Suburban and knew he was n’t legally licensed to drive it .
The 60 - page lawsuit , filed in Arapahoe County District Court , lists more than 20 defendants .
One is Xcel Energy , which according to the suit , failed to “ reasonably supervise , control and maintain ” a switch box that was hit in the accident .
The cover of the box hit Marten .
Both the Colorado Department of Transportation and the city of Aurora are being sued in connection with Havana being widened in 2003 to only 7 feet from a Baskin - Robbins .
Aurora City Attorney Charlie Richardson said the claim against the city is puzzling .
“ It is certainly the first time that someone has alleged that an injury is due to improper setback on a city street and state highway , ” Richardson said .
In addition , the suit names the parent company of Baskin - Robbins because the store ’s wall facing Havana was made of glass and did not have safety barriers .
The owner of the property where the shop sits is also a defendant .
Attorneys for the Kudlis family declined to comment .
Hernandez , 25 , was convicted last week of 19 criminal counts and will be sentenced in April .
He could face more than 100 years in prison .
Hernandez was driving about 80 mph when he hit a pickup driven by Patricia Guntharp .
Her pickup hit the Baskin - Robbins , killing Guntharp , 49 , and her passenger , Debra Serecky , 51 .
Marten Kudlis was in the shop with his mother .
The family of Guntharp , who was high on methamphetamine at the time of the crash is being sued as are several law enforcement agencies that arrested or cited Hernandez but did not report him to federal authorities for deportation .

In a move that has echoes of Gordon Brown 's attempts to build a government of " all talents " by bringing in the likes of Digby Jones , the former CBI director general , Hutton will be asked to look at the gap between the highest - and lowest - paid public servants .
The appointment will be seen as an attempt to appease centre - left critics of the Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition .
David Cameron has also invited Labour 's Frank Field to advise the government as the new poverty tsar .
The maverick MP appeared alongside the Cameron at an event in January and has a history of cross-party alliances .
However , Hutton 's appointment is more unexpected .
The former Observer editor was closely linked to the New Labour project and is seen as a leading liberal commentator .
He is also executive vice - chair of the Work Foundation , a high profile think - tank .
The appointment places Hutton at the heart of one of the most challenging policy areas for the new coalition .
Before the election , the party promised to set up the fair pay review to ensure no senior manager in the public sector could earn more than 20 times the lowest paid person in their organisation .
As well as tackling unfairness , they hoped the move would cut the cost of public sector pay .
Hutton said the review will look at how to limit the pay - gap in the public sector and over what period such a cap could be brought in .
" It will also address the level of remuneration needed to retain , attract and motivate staff of the quality required — especially given what is happening to private sector pay , and the extent to which distortions and market failures in private sector pay create pressure for unfair pay multiples in the public sector , " he said .
" The review will include staff covered by the senior salaries review body , non- departmental bodies and managers in local government and the NHS . "
Hutton , who is author of the best - selling The State We 're In , will be supported by Stephen Bevan , managing director of The Work Foundation , who is a public sector pay specialist , and Philippe Schneider , an independent research consultant .
All three roles are unpaid .
The review will be based in the Treasury and is scheduled to report in December .
Field , meanwhile , has been asked to lead a major review into levels of poverty across Britain – and will also look at how poverty ought to be measured in the future .
The Labour MP caused controversy in 2008 when he teamed up with senior Tories to demand a cap on the number of immigrants settling in Britain .
Field , a former welfare minister under Tony Blair , joined Nicholas Soames – a Tory MP who is a figure disliked by many in the Labour party – in the call .
Along with the pressure group , Migrationwatch , the MPs aimed to push Brown to end Britain 's open door immigration policy which they claimed was deeply unpopular .
As a backbench MP , Field was highly critical of Gordon Brown and regularly called for him to step down .
According to the Sunday Telegraph , Field 's appointment will be officially confirmed in the next few days .
It says the MP is likely to work with Iain Duncan Smith , the former Tory leader who is now secretary of state in the Department for Work and Pensions .
Philippa Stroud , co-founder of the Centre for Social Justice – along with Duncan - Smith – has been made a special adviser in DWP after missing out on winning a seat in parliament .
The newspaper also revealed the results of an ICM survey that found 64 % of voters thought the Lib - Con coalition was the right way forward after the election results .
It was backed by 87 % of those who voted Conservative and 77 % who backed the Lib Dems .
Meanwhile , a poll for the think - tank Demos found that voters want a new electoral system .
The YouGov poll of 2.076 people found that , when asked about the alternative vote system , 49 % supported it compared to just 34 % who wanted to keep the current system .
There was also a high level of support for proportional representation .
London , England ( CNN ) --
The days of discussions have ended , demands issued , concesssions made and a decision finally reached -- but even before they formed a government , the UK 's political parties must wait for approval from one more person :
The queen .
Labour leader Gordon Brown on Tuesday announced his resignation as prime minister and said he was recommending his Conservative rival David Cameron as successor .
As a head of state , Queen Elizabeth has numerous traditional roles when it comes to elections and government .
Although these are usually no more than ceremonial , they are a key part of the protocol without which nothing can happen .
Before he could fully resign Brown asked the queen 's permission .
Likewise , David Cameron -- whose Conservative party is trying to form an alliance with the third placed Liberal Democrat to secure a parliamentary majority -- had to be invited by the queen to replace Brown .
Full story : Political rivals jockey for power
The queen is the embodiment of Britain 's constitutional monarchy and everything is done in her name .
No laws can be passed nor parliaments opened or dissolved without her approval .
Such strict protocols bind all stages of the process to install a new prime minister -- often with a pomp and grandeur far removed from the boisterous world of British politics .
The 2006 film " The Queen " offered insight into this when Helen Mirren , playing the monarch , invites a nervous and kneeling Tony Blair to become prime minister after his 1997 landslide victory .
In her six decade reign , Queen Elizabeth has dealt with 11 prime ministers , including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher , who reputedly had a tense relationship with the monarch during the weekly audiences that are also a traditional necessity .
Typically , although it is her role to anoint prime ministers , the queen does not get involved in the political process , remaining above the fray .
After an election , the queen will wait to see if the current prime minister gets a majority or assembles a coalition before inviting them to form a government .
Only if they admit defeat and resign can she start to look elsewhere .
As negotiations to form a coalition progress , the queen will be kept informed from a distance , avoiding any direct involvement in the decision .
A high level group including her private secretary and the Cabinet secretary will brief her , but she will not be drawn into controversy .
But , in the unlikely event that no decision can be reached among the parties over who should become prime minister the queen does have powers to intervene .
She can , in theory , call a fresh election or stop a new election being called if she thinks there is another solution .
The queen has faced election hiccups before .
The last was in 1974 when after days of party negotiations , she invited Labour to form a minority government .
That administration lasted less than a year before Britain was back at the polls .
It usually falls to royal advisers to ensure the rules work and that the queen is kept well away from the political wheeling and dealing .

The hobo , Americas last great nomad .
Whether its jumping onto boxcars or strutting around city streets hobos have always been true wanderers , and what stereotypical image of a hobo would be complete without a shopping cart .
The average grocery store shopping cart is the perfect accessory for todays hobo on the go .
It contains just the right amount of space for all of their possessions .
The shopping cart has ample room for bottles / cans , dirty blankets ( for those extra nippy nights on the streets ) , random treasures found while scavenging , and even enough room for relics from a broken former life ; however , there comes a time in every hobos life , when they will ask , if this amazing creation called a shopping cart , is capable of more than just storage ? "
Today , ladies and gentleman , I finally have an answer for them ...... allow me to present to you , the perfect modification for the perfect hobo accessory ... The Hobobeque ! Forged from scavenged parts , in true hobo style , the Hobobeque provides a great alternative to those unfashionable 40 gallon drum fires .
You 'll be the most popular hobo on the street , strutting around with your new Hobobeque .
You can use it to cook , provide warmth ( replace those dirty old blankets , with FIRE ! ) , or for self defense ( teach that other hobo trying to move into your alley a lesson by rolling a flaming shopping cart at him , I 'm sure he wont be back ) , yes the Hobobeque does it all !
So ladies , gentlemen , bums , tramps , and ( most importantly ) hobos , allow me to take you on a journey through the process of building this amazing device .
Many of us will laugh a little , some of us may cry a little , and some others may even die little ( does that count as a disclaimer ? ) .
The tribespeople hope Mr Cameron will now highlight their campaign .

A province of Indonesia watched the outcome of the UK general election with great interest .
Since David Cameron became the UK's prime minister , the tribespeople of West Papua have been celebrating .
They hope Mr Cameron will help them in their bid to gain independence from Indonesia .
David Cameron previously met an exiled West Papuan , Benny Wenda , who now lives in the UK .
Soon after being granted political asylum in the UK in 2002 , Mr Wenda began campaigning for independence for West Papua from Indonesia .
There is widespread resistance to Indonesian rule .

He set up the Free West Papua Campaign which raises awareness of alleged human rights abuses in the region .
Albert Tabuni , a human rights activist , has described the announcement as " happy news " for the people of West Papua .
Mr Tabuni said : " All over the highlands people are celebrating .
We hope that Mr David Cameron will see our messages and help us .
" We need to be free from Indonesia rule .
The situation is now very bad here . "
All over the highlands people are celebrating

Human rights activist Mr Tabuni also said friends of his , Buchtar Tabuni and Victor Yiemo , are now political prisoners after being jailed by the government for taking part in a demonstration .
West Papua is the western half of the island of New Guinea , with the eastern half being the independent state of Papua New Guinea .
The region has had a troubled past following independence from Dutch colonial rule in the 1950s .
Buchtar Tabuni and Victor Yiemo are now political prisoners .

At the end of 1961 , West Papua held a Congress at which its people declared independence , and raised their new flag - the Morning Star .
Soon after , Indonesia asserted its claim to the territory and invaded , but was held back by Dutch and local forces .
Indonesia turned to Russia for support , forcing the US to lean on the Dutch to accept Indonesia 's claims .
It was temporarily handed over to the UN but control was later handed over to Indonesia .
In 1969 there was widespread resistance to Indonesian rule so the people of West Papua were asked to vote in a referendum - the Act of Free Choice .
The vote , widely criticised as rigged , voted for Indonesia control .

ARSONISTS torched a mosque in the north of the occupied West Bank before dawn local time today in an attack blamed on Jewish settlers .
The mosque , located in Lubban ash - Sharqiya some 10 km south of Nablus , was largely destroyed in the attack , said the town 's mayor , Jamal Daraghma .
" The settlers set fire to the mosque .
Witnesses heard the sound of their cars near the mosque at around 3 am and saw them through the window setting fire to the books inside , " Mr Daraghma said , saying most of the mosque had been destroyed .
The town is located next to three Jewish settlements : Eli , Maaleh Levona and Shiloh .
Israel radio said the civil administration , the Israeli military arm that controls the occupied West Bank , had opened an inquiry into the cause of the blaze .
Contacted by AFP , the army could not immediately confirm or deny the report .
On April 14 , a mosque in Huwara near Nablus was desecrated by settlers who scrawled Hebrew graffiti and a Star of David over the walls , Palestinian security sources said .
Two cars were also torched during the incident , prompting the Israeli army to open an investigation .
In December , settlers vandalised another mosque in the northern West Bank village of Yasuf , torching Muslim holy books and spraying hate messages in Hebrew .
The incident triggered clashes between villagers and Israeli troops .
A 17 - year - old from a nearby settlement was later detained .

The voyage of the " little ships " is being recreated for the anniversary
The rescue of allied troops from Dunkirk remains the central focus of this weekend 's 70th anniversary commemorations , but the story of those days in May 1940 extends far beyond the beaches .
When Operation Dynamo was formally wound up , more than 100,000 men were still in France , some fighting with the rearguard against the advancing German army , others looking for other ways to escape .
John Borland was a Cameron Highlander serving with the 51st Highland Division .
He never reached Dunkirk but was forced to hold the line further west .
At his home in Glasgow , he recalled long , hungry days on the road .
" You really got used to it as the days went on ... taking up your positions ... being ready , " said Mr Borland , now 90 .
" The odds were stacked against us , but we fought on .
" You 're not really afraid , because you know there 's a job to be done , though today I get scared just thinking about it . "
I was saved because I was under a pile of bodies Bert Evans , Ex-Warwickshire Regiment
Bert Evans , serving with the Warwickshire Regiment , was facing an elite German SS division near the town of Wormhout .
" We were the ones who stopped them breaking through , " said the 89 - year - old from Redditch , Worcestershire .
" And we suffered for it .
" We 'd heard about the SS and we knew they did n't take prisoners . "
Mr Evans 's fears were well - founded : after he and 80 other soldiers were herded into a small barn , the SS threw hand grenades into the building before firing indiscriminately .
" I was saved because I was under a pile of bodies , " he told me .
" I thought I was lucky to be alive . "
Fewer than 20 of the men forced into the barn came out alive .
Mr Evans 's injuries would eventually cost him his right arm , but he managed to escape by crawling along a ditch and taking cover in a small pond .
The company commander hiding with him was gunned down when he tried to make a run for it .
The memories haunt Mr Evans , visibly upset at their recollection .
" It 's an ordeal and I do n't wish to remember it , I wish to forget it , " he said .
" It 's an ordeal just thinking about it ...
I do n't want to remember what happened , but it keeps me awake at night . "
' Do n't give up '
Mr Borland and the Highlanders eventually ended up in St Valery , a tiny fishing village near Dieppe .
" There was quite a bit of wreckage lying about and then after that came a lot of refugees , which hampered us quite a bit , " Mr Borland said .
" We were very , very much exhausted because of being alert 24 hours a day .
There was very little sleep . "
The rearguard now had little chance of escape , with the town ablaze and the Germans shelling them from the clifftops above .
The ships waiting offshore could not reach them .
Image caption German shelling from the cliffs above St Valery trapped the allies ' rearguard
The scene was littered with the bodies of dead and injured allied troops , many having tried to reach safety by climbing down the towering cliffs .
Surrender was now the only option to prevent more lives being lost .
" There was a major who informed us that the word had come from Britain that we must lay down our arms , " said Mr Borland .
" There was quite a bit of argument about it but , coming from a major , we had to obey orders . "
By the time of the surrender it was mid-June , more than two weeks after the start of the Dunkirk evacuation .
Of the Britons left behind by Operation Dynamo , 11,000 died and 40,000 were captured and imprisoned .
As he was marched away to five years of captivity , Mr Borland spotted a scrap of paper blowing across his path .
He has it still .
" It was a biblical text , with the words ' Do n't give up ' scrawled in pencil , probably by the man who 'd dropped it .
" Those words stayed with me through my time in the POW camps . "
Had he ever given up , I asked him .
The answer was unequivocal : " Never . "
A BBC News special programme on the 70th anniversary of the " little ships " evacuation of Dunkirk will be shown on Sunday 30 May at 1130 BST on BBC Two .

Obama Criticizes New Media , Ipads , Rumors
PRESIDENT OBAMA : " Meanwhile , you 're coming of age in a 24/7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments , some of which do n't rank all that high on the truth meter .
With iPods and iPads ; Xboxes and PlayStations ; information becomes a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment , rather than a tool of empowerment .
All of this is not only putting new pressures on you ; it is putting new pressures on our country and on our democracy . "

To head off the worst impacts of climate change , should human beings deliberately engineer the earth ’s climate ?
Or rather , should they try , with uncertain odds of success and at least some chance of inadvertent catastrophe ?
Should they even learn how , or would the knowledge itself wreak havoc ?
These are the sorts of questions journalist Jeff Goodell grapples with in How to Cool the Planet : Geoengineering and the Audacious Quest to Fix Earth ’s Climate , due out on April 15 .
As readers of his previous book Big Coal know , Goodell ’s talent lies in addressing heavy economic and political issues through the prism of individual human narratives .
Once again he ’s gathered a cast of eccentric characters and darkly entertaining stories that carry the reader through choppy conceptual waters .
Goodell and I discussed the promise and perils of geoengineering in wide - ranging conversation earlier this month .
Here are some highlights , followed by more in - depth excerpts from our conversation .
On geoengineering of the crazier sort :
This is field of wacky ideas .
I talked to a guy who thought it would be great to spread Special K out in the ocean to reflect sunlight and cool the earth ’s temperature .
People who want to launch nuclear bombs at the moon , to shoot moon dust into the outer space to reflect sunlight away .
On the two serious forms of geoengineering :
“ Solar radiation management ” or “ solar shielding . ”
It ’s about blocking sunlight .
In order to offset the temperature change from a doubling of CO2 emissions , you only have to reflect a small amount of sunlight away from the earth — one or two percent .
The other category is carbon dioxide removal — machines and technologies that can pull CO2 out of the atmosphere .
These are far less problematic , politically and morally .
On environmental groups ’ concerns about geoengineering :
It ’s not so much the fear that we ’re going to screw this up , though that ’s part of it , but more the fear that we ’re still trying to get a cap on CO2 and this is just seen as a kind of a political nightmare .
It becomes an alternative , a quick fix , an easy sell .
Why do we have to go through all the pain and hassle of political coalitions to cut emissions if we can just spray some particles in the atmosphere ?
On whether knowledge about geoengineering should be restricted :
I went to Pompeii once a few years ago .
They had all the porn in a separate room at the museum .
It used to be that only men could go in there .
It was seen as dangerous for women to go look at giant phalluses , because they ’d get corrupted morally .
It ’s a bad idea for geoengineering to be the equivalent of the Pompeii sex room .
On whether geoengineering can be humane :
[ There ’s ] a kind of parallel between geoengineering and gardening .
This is about learning to garden the planet .
I was inspired to think about this because of my wife ’s garden , seeing this partnership with nature she has in her garden .
It leads to a beautiful thing .
The hopeful side of me thinks geoengineering can be smaller , smarter .
It can be modest , about regional stuff , experimenting , learning what works , what does n’t work .
Being humble about this , being open about this .
On his worse fears about geoengineering :
The idea that a nation or a group of nations will decide , for nationalistic or militaristic reasons , or a genuine belief that they can fix their problems , to do this .
They will do it badly , and cause a lot of climate chaos . …
You can imagine the island nations getting together and saying , “ You guys have been fucking around for 30 years , and we do n’t want to drown , so we ’ve got a couple of billionaires that are helping us with some airplanes .
We are going to do this . ” …
It ’s going to get taken up by the guys who want to blow up New York City .
But my nightmare scenario is that we wo n’t do anything .
It will just be decades more of apathy .
We ’ll block progress on research on geoengineering , we wo n’t reform our energy system , we will just continue with the status quo for another two or three decades .
We ’ll just ride straight ahead into climate chaos .
On reactions to his book :
I ’m already getting people who are pissed off at me for writing this book .
It ’s going to be controversial .
Read more from the conversation with Jeff Goodell :
There 's an office in this grandiose and sprawling city of Buenos Aires that holds a somewhat macabre collection : over 700 human skeletons .
They are presumed to be but a small fraction of the unidentified remains of the over 30,000 supposed " subversives " who the rightwing military government of the late 70s and early 80s tried to make disappear from the face of the earth .
" In our profession , we always arrive late in a way .
We use whatever documentation was left by the military to find the bodies . "
Luis Fondebrider tells me , co-founder of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team ( EAAF ) .
" The most complicated part is getting DNA information from bones , but the latest advances in genetic testing has helped .
Some of our more recent identifications are of skeletons we 've had for 15 years . "
For years the nonprofit team of bone hunters and forensic investigators , with offices in Buenos Aires , the western Argentine city of Córdoba , and New York , have been working with human rights activists and judicial authorities in Argentina and around the world on a project that should give war criminals everywhere pause – they help undisappear the disappeared .
The team has identified victims of state terrorism in Argentina and elsewhere , providing key evidence that has led to convictions of a number of assassins who might have gotten away with it , if not for advances in modern forensic science .
Last week their work was once again vindicated when a very big fish was caught and charged with almost 50 cases of kidnapping , torture and murder .
Thanks to the tireless work of human rights groups in Argentina over the years , justice had already caught up with former Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla , who ruled from 1976 to 1981 .
He is due to stand trial in September for his role in a particularly twisted racket during the dictatorship – the kidnapping of babies of assassinated political opponents , which were then " gifted " to families sympathetic to the regime .
The new murder charges , filed by federal judge Daniel Rafecas , are drawn directly from positive identifications that EAAF investigators made in the last two years , from skeletons exhumed from unmarked graves in 10 cemeteries in or around Buenos Aires .
" For us it means – I can't say happiness – but satisfaction , " Fondebrider told me the day after the new charges were announced against Videla .
The ex-dictator will now appear in court at the end of the month , for the first time in 25 years .
( Videla was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 , but was pardoned along with other military leaders in 1990 ) .
" In our part of the world perpetrators of state terrorism often are n't charged , or often there 's not enough information to bring them to justice .
So it 's one of the few times that our work helps to break through that impunity . "
There 's an undeniable poetic justice at play .
For years it was up to family members and human rights groups such as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo , and HIJOS to keep the memories alive of those who disappeared , against an official culture of impunity that pushed people to " stop dredging up the past " .
But the brutal charnel house that was Argentina in the late 70s and early 80s also led to the development of an organisation with a particularly sophisticated expertise in digging through mass graves – and using continued advances in forensics to reclaim the identities of those who were so meticulously extinguished during those years of blood and fire .
Some victims will likely never be found – one common form of disappearing kidnapped victims at the time was by drugging them and throwing them live in to the ocean .
Luckily for forensic investigators , though , some of the perpetrators in the armed forces maintained at least some semblance of propriety .
" Many of the military men were Catholics , " Mercedes Doretti tells me , an EAAF co-founder who works out of the New York office .
" They believed that even subversives should receive a Christian sepulture . "
The team 's expertise is now increasingly in demand around the world as its members consult with human rights activists , prosecutors , and family members in countries where human rights crimes , disappearances and other forms of state terrorism are also finally being investigated ( South Africa , Colombia , El Salvador , East Timor ) .
Doretti is working with investigators from the US and Mexico to study the cases of unidentified murder victims along the vast border .
Excavations continue apace in the Argentine provinces of Córdoba , Tucuman and Mendoza .
And the organisation continues to grow a massive genetic database containing DNA information of family members of the disappeared to help identify future remains , or to confirm the identities of kidnapped and misappropriated children .
And at least one dictator will have to stand trial and account for the lives extinguished under his rule .
Political violence is nothing new , of course , and sadly we 'll still likely be in need of the EAAF 's specialised expertise well in to the future .
But it 's heartening to know that at least the science continues to catch up with the human heart 's demands for justice .

The US ’s largest Muslim advocacy group has filed a complaint with the FCC over what it says is a Houston radio talk show host who “ advocated bombing a proposed New York City mosque . ”
In a statement released Thursday , the Council on American - Islamic Relations said Michael Berry of KPRC 950 AM “ made a call to violence ” when he said he hoped someone would blow up the mosque being proposed for a location in lower Manhattan , near the site of the 9/11 attacks .

During an argument with a caller who supported the mosque ’s construction , Berry said , “ You ca n’t build a mosque at the site of 9/11 .
No you can ’t .
No you can ’t .
And I ’ll tell you this — if you do build a mosque , I hope somebody blows it up . …
I hope the mosque is n’t built , and if it is , I hope it ’s blown up , and I mean that . ”
Download audio of Berry ’s comments here ( WAV file ) .
“ Calls for acts of violence against houses of worship must never be tolerated or excused , ” CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said .
“ We ask the FCC to demonstrate that incitement to violence is never acceptable on our nation ’s airwaves . ”
In a statement on the KPRC Web site , Berry denied that he advocated terrorism against a house of worship , and said CAIR was trying to intimidate political opponents into silence .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ This is how CAIR intimidates people into silence , ” he said in the statement .
“ They want to scare people into believing that having differing opinions will cost you your job .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 

But CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper told the Houston Chronicle that his group is n’t calling for Berry ’s firing because “ then we ’re accused of censorship and stifling his free speech . ”
But he said he wanted to see Berry ’s employer take “ some action ” in response to the incident .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ While I stand by my disagreement of the building of the mosque on the site , I SHOULD NOT have said Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœI hope someone blows it up , Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ” Berry wrote on the KPRC site .
” That was dumb , and beneath me .
…
For that , I apologize to my listeners . ”
CAIR notes that Berry “ has in the past been a guest host for nationally - syndicated broadcasters like Mark Levin , Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly . ”

The group said Berry ’s remarks were “ of particular concern ” as they came shortly after the pipe - bombing of a Florida mosque earlier this week .
A Muslim group known as the Cordoba Initiative is planning to build a mosque inside a former Burlington Coat Factory building two blocks from the World Trade Center site .
The 13 - story building was damaged during the 9/11 attacks .

Earlier this month , a New York City community planning board approved the plan , stirring up opposition from some residents of the city and from conservative commentators around the country .
This is the actual picture that they are using .
Hat tip to Pamela .
The difference is that you draw Lies about Muhammad and we draw Truth about you .
That you seek to bring unrest and conflict , and we wish to uncover the reality so injustice is no more
We are here to reflect about the foundational myth of the secular cult .
A cult which has delivered human kind the biggest genocides recorded in history :
From the tens of millions massacred by the Atheist Soviet regime , to the other several millions wiped off the face of the earth by the hand of the Western secular fanaticism in Vietnam , Iraq , Afghanistan , Palestine , Iran , and an endless list of nations who have suffered the arrogance of Man over God .
Much of the injustice that takes place in our world stems from ignorance .
We reject being emotionally blackmailed by Hollywood tales and holocaust museums which legitimize the war crimes and crimes against humanity of the extremist Atheist regime of Tel - Aviv .
Seems rude ?
Or insulting ?
Or immoral ?
Actually it does n’t matter .
Because the secular brand of Freedom of Speech never cares about any of the above .
Right ?
Today I learned my lesson .
Never be quiet .
You have to be intensely speaking out insulting to people , even innocent ones .
Is that how freedom goes ?
It seems that they want to practice ‘ Freedom of Speech ’ not for bringing up any kind of logic , but to insult a person who is not even present to defend himself .
Ok. Lesson learned .
Thanks for your “ morals ” .
I know who they are .
They are the ones who do not care that you are Muslim , Jew , Christian .
They want religions and morals to be wiped off from the face of the earth .
The only things that they care about are power and money and “ The Zionist state of Israel ” .
Their excuse is Holocaust .
Now , I have a simple question for you guys .
Am I as free as you ?
May I practice my Freedom of Speech too ?
Let ’s research critically about the Holocaust then .

Police in Jamaica have more than 500 people in custody , the government said , after a failed attempt to arrest a suspected drug kingpin resulted in violence that left at least 44 people dead .
Security forces are " processing " people , with students and young people getting first priority , the government said .
" The Security Forces are also helping residents of Tivoli Gardens " - a neighborhood , where much of the violence took place - " taking those needing medical care to hospitals .
Medication is also being provided to residents , " the government said .
[ Posted at 11:08 a .m. ]
The death toll has risen to 44 as a result of clashes in Jamaica between security forces and alleged drug gang members and their supporters , according to Jamaican Public Defender Earle Witter and Political Ombudsman Hero Blair .
Security forces have been fighting people who want to prevent the extradition to the United States of Christopher " Dudus " Coke , who was charged last year in U.S. federal court with conspiracy to distribute marijuana and cocaine and with conspiracy to illegally traffic in firearms .
The street battles have taken place in the Kingston neighborhoods of Tivoli Gardens and Denham Town , officials said .
If James Cameron gets his way , Mars could be getting the Pandora treatment when NASA launches its newest rover Curiosity on an ambitious mission to the red planet next year .
The famed " Avatar " director , whose own 3 - D camerawork has revolutionized the cinematic industry , has convinced NASA to mount a 3 - D camera on top of Curiosity 's mast for the upcoming Martian mission , scheduled to launch in 2011 .
Cameron believes that including a camera with 3 - D capabilities will help engage the public and generate more excitement about Curiosity 's work .

" It 's a very ambitious mission .
It 's a very exciting mission , " Cameron said according to the Pasadena Star - News .
" ( The scientists are ) going to answer a lot of really important questions about the previous and potential future habitability on Mars . "
Cameron spoke in a Tuesday event at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , which is near NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena where the Curiosity rover is being built .
Cameron lobbied the space agency to include the 3 - D camera on Curiosity 's mission after JPL scaled back plans for such a device in 2007 , as a way to compensate for the $ 2.3 billion mission being consistently over budget and behind schedule .
In January , Cameron met NASA chief Charles Bolden and was able to convince him and the space agency to purchase a 3 - D camera for Curiosity , the director said .
It would replace the mast camera ( without 3 - D capabilities ) that has already been built and was delivered to JPL this month .
While the Curiosity team is unsure whether the new camera will be ready in time , they are eagerly anticipating the camera 's potential to record Martian movies at a rate of 10 frames per second , reported the Star - News .
" You could take a movie and image clouds moving in the sky or a dust devil moving , " said Joy Crisp , JPL deputy project scientist on Mars Science Laboratory , the official name for the rover project .
" As you 're driving , you could take a movie . "
Now , it will be up to the Malin Space Science Systems , the San Diego - based company charged with building several of Curiosity 's cameras , to scramble to build the 3 - D camera in time .
" It 's a thrill to be on even a tiny part of the mission , " Cameron told the Star - News .
Cameron also spoke about the Earthly inspirations used to create the fictional world of Pandora , the moon location of his mega - hit " Avatar . "
The filmmaker revealed that Pandora was created to look exotic and foreign , while still maintaining elements that audiences could identify and relate to .
" We tried to make it not completely fanciful , " Cameron told the audience at the event titled " Is Pandora Possible ? "
" If it was too outlandish , there would be a believability gap . "
To achieve this , Cameron took cues from flora , fauna and various other phenomena on Earth to create Pandora , which was conceived as a moon in the Alpha Centauri system .

Finding an effective treatment for post - traumatic stress disorder has been a top Pentagon priority for years .
And with an estimated one in five veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from PTSD , the military 's been willing to consider anything and everything , including yoga , dog therapy and acupuncture , to alleviate symptoms .
But a small new study out of Walter Reed Army Medical Center might offer more than temporary relief – with nothing more than a quick jab to the neck .
It 's a procedure called stellate ganglion block ( STB ) , and involves injecting local anesthetic into a bundle of nerves located in the neck .
The bundle are a locus for the sympathetic nervous system , which regulates the body 's " fight - or - flight " stress response .
Led by Lieutenant Colonel Sean Mulvaney , Pentagon scientists gave STB injections to two soldiers , one on active duty and another who'd been suffering from PTSD symptoms since serving in the Gulf War nearly two decades ago .
Their study reports that both men " experienced immediate , significant and durable relief " after the 10 - minute procedure , and no longer exhibit symptoms that would qualify them for a PTSD diagnosis .
Seven months later , both had successfully stopped using antidepressant and antipsychotic medications with the guidance of a psychiatrist .
While the research out of Walter Reed only tested two patients , a Chicago - based doctor named Eugene Lipov is already conducting his own double - blind trial on war - vet volunteers .
One of his patients , 28 - year - old John Sullivan , found little relief with prescription anti-anxiety meds .
But the former Marine Corps Sergeant told ABC News that the STB injection completely eliminated his nightmares , flashbacks and ongoing anxiety .
" [ It was ] not painful and the results were within five minutes – I felt more relaxed and calmed down .
It 's been great . "
Lipov has also conducted before - and - after brain scans on patients .
Those suffering from PTSD usually exhibit characteristic " hot spots " that light up when a patient is exposed to violent imagery .
After an STB treatment , the brains of PTSD patients no longer displayed the abnormal reactions .
But STB treatments , which have been used for decades to treat a handful of illnesses , including Raynaud 's Syndrome , are n't without risks .
Injuries to the nervous or vascular system are the most common , usually from a misplaced needle .
Still , STB is likely to be met with more enthusiasm from the Pentagon than another potential PTSD treatment .
MDMA , the key ingredient in ecstasy , was in the spotlight last week after successful results of a study on 21 veterans .
But according to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , who sponsored the study , the Department of Veterans Affairs has thus far refused to collaborate on future research .

I raise tomatoes for sun drying .
I do about 1000 to 2000 lbs a year which I sell to the upscale restaurants in Cody Wyoming & Billings Montana .
I wanted to pass on my favorites for you considering doing some drying .
Any tomato can be used for drying but some varieties are better than others .
I grow 15 mainstay varieties that I have kept as I culled others that did not meet my criteria .
I also try at least 5 new varieties of paste types each year and am lucky if one makes it into my herd .
I am looking for specific things :
Meaty with a low moisture content
Â Few seeds
Â A rich and tangy flavor
Â Size - Small tomatoes are just more work for me .
Â Not fussy - Take heat and cold and wind .
No primadonnas !
Â Bloom well and set lots and lots of fruit
Â Indeterminate
Â Dry to a nice pliable consistency
These are my Top Five
Chinese Giant
Carol Chyko
Cuoro D Toro

I wanted to add that were I to be stranded on a desert Island with only one tomato it would be Russo Sicilian Togeta .
This is my ÂgallstarÂh that sets fruit first , ripens the earliest , bears heavy crops in any weather and is producing right up until hard frost .
It is not a true paste but rather a stuffing tomato .
None - the - less , the flavor of these dried is as good as it gets .
It is also wonderful for just eating or slicing and the fruit is extra large .
For those wanting to know my Secret Recipe for drying , here you go :
Wash , stem and slice each tomato into 1/ 4 " thick slices .
Place in a very large bowl or clean bucket and cover with cheap red wine .
I use Merlot but if you prefer something else , knock yourself out .
I have a friend that swears by cheap Chianti !
Soak tomato slices 24 hours in the wine .
Drain well .
Lay tomatoes just touching on dehydrator shelves or on screen in your sun-drying apparatus .
Sprinkle each slice with a mixture containing equal parts of dried basil - oregano - parsley and then sprinkle each slice with Kosher Salt .
You may choose to forego the salt if you wish but tomatoes will take longer to dry .
Dry tomatoes until they are firm and leatherlike with no moisture pockets , but NOT brittle .
( If you get them too dry , soak them in lemon juice for a few minutes . )
To store , place in vacuum bags or ziplock bags and freeze .
IMPORTANT !!!
If you will be storing sun-dried tomatoes in Olive oil you !!!
MUST !!!
dip each slice in vinegar before adding to oil .
To pack in oil :
Dip each tomato into a small dish of white wine vinegar .
Shake off theexcess vinegar and pack them in olive oil adding 1/4 cup red wine .
For tomatoes in oil I am selling , I put the tomatoes into the oil two weeks ahead of time and store in the refrigerator .
Make sure they are completely immersed in the oil .
When the jar is full , cap it tightly .
I use my vacuum sealer to seal the canning lids on .
Store at * cool * room temperature for at least a month before using .
They may be stored in the refrigerator , but the oil will solidify at
refrigerator temperatures ( it quickly reliquifies at room temperature however ) .
As tomatoes are removed from the jar , add more olive oil as necessary to keep the remaining tomatoes covered .
I have stored oil - packed tomatoes in m root cellar for over a year . .
I have tried a number of methods to pack the tomatoes in oil , but the vinegar treatment is the difference between a good dried tomato and a great one .
It is also important from a food safety standpoint , as it acidifies the oil and discourages growth of bacteria and mold .
Soaking in the wine also acidifies them .
****** WARNING ********
Do * NOT * add fresh garlic cloves or fresh herbs of any kind to oil - packed dried tomatoes , UNLESS you store them in the refrigerator and plan on using them within 7 days .
Garlic is a low - acid food which , when placed in oil , creates a low - acid anaerobic environment just
perfect growth medium for botulinum bacteria if the mixture is not refrigerated .
Be safe and add your garlic to the dried tomatoes as part of the recipe for them * after * they come out of the oil .
IT 'S not often the boss sacks himself on live radio .
But that 's just what The Office star Steve Carell seemed to do in a BBC radio interview while doing the rounds with Tina Fey promoting their latest movie Date Night .
Steve Carell , who plays inept stationery supply honcho Michael Scott on the hit U.S. series , told BBC radio he will probbly quit the role after next season , the seventh in the series .
" How long does your contract run ? " asked the interviewer .
" Contract through next season , " Carell answered .
" And will you stay after that ? " the interviewer followed up .
" I do n't think so , " Carell said .
" That will probably be my last year . "
NBC has yet to comment on the statement or to claify if the series could continue without Carell .
Carell took home a Golden Globe award for best performance by an actor in a television series , musical or comedy , in 2006 and has been nominated in every subsequent year .

For sale : a smoker 's lung , a slice of human head , a piece of hand .
A mail - order service has been set up by a controversial German anatomist offering these and many more human and animal body parts , including preserved slivers of duck and cross-sections of giraffe neck and crocodile jaw .
Gunther von Hagens , inventor of a system known as plastination in which fluids are removed from dead humans or animals and replaced with hardened silicone , allowing body parts to be preserved indefinitely , said his aim was to open access to the samples to a wider audience .
The body parts store , which has been dubbed a supermarket of horrors by opponents , has opened in the German town of Guben , near the Polish border , on the same site as the factory or " plastinarium " where Von Hagens converts dead beings into plastinated objects .
Body part prices range from around € 600 ( £ 507 ) for a cross-section of a fish to € 1,500 for a sliver of human head or € 15,000 for a section of the entire length of a human body .
Smokers ' lungs are available for € 3,600 and a slice of human hand for as little as € 185 .
The objects will be dispatched by post and can be sent around the world .
Von Hagens , 65 , collects his specimens from body donors who sign a contract allowing him to plastinate their bodies after their deaths .
Among the most controversial tableaus of specimens he has produced are a copulating couple , a woman in the eighth month of pregnancy – complete with foetus – and aborted foetuses .
An investigation was carried out several years ago into claims that Von Hagens had made use of the bodies of execution victims from China and prisoners from Russia .
Tens of millions of people around the world have visited Von Hagens 's touring Body Worlds exhibition .
The shop 's opening was delayed for two years following severe criticism from body donors and religious groups , which have been at loggerheads with the so - called plastinator for years over his repeated claims that " corpses have no souls " .
• This article was amended on 1 June 2010 .
The original said plastination involves replacing fluids with hardened silicon .
This has been corrected .
The Spanish EU presidency said on Sunday that uo to 50 percent of the flights in Europe could operate on Monday following disruption caused by clouds of volcanic ash from Iceland .
" The forecast is that there will be half of flights possibly operating tomorrow .
It will be difficult ; that 's why we have to coordinate , " Spain 's secretary of state for EU affairs Diego Lopez Garrido told reporters after a meeting at European aviation control agency Eurocontrol .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he had assembled a team of industry experts to determine how much the air travel chaos would cost the European economy .
Many passengers have been stranded at airports all weekend
" The volcanic ash cloud has created an unprecedented situation , " Barroso said in a statement on Sunday .
" I have asked ( EU Transport Commissioner Siim ) Kallas to coordinate the Commission 's response and fully assess the impact of the situation created by the volcanic ash cloud on the economy , and the air travel industry in particular .
It is important that all measures to be considered are coordinated at the European level . "
A Lufthansa spokesman said Sunday the company had already lost over a billion euros since the disruptions began on Thursday .
After temporarily allowing some flights over the course of the afternoon , only Berlin 's airports will be permitted to operate selected flights overnight .
German railway operator Deutsche Bahn has added hundreds of additional trains across the country to meet the rise in demand for alternatives to aviation .
Test flights provide hope
European aviation agency Eurocontrol said civilian flights across the bulk of northern and central Europe were prevented from landing or taking off on Saturday and most of Sunday .
More than three in four flights across the continent were halted as drifting volcanic ash continued to be spewed from its source in Iceland .
Lufthansa is pushing for the ban to be lifted
Airlines are calling for the airspace to be reopened across the continent .
Dutch and German test flights carried out on Saturday without apparent damage seemed to offer hope that Europe 's travel lockdown may ease in the coming days .
Germany 's Lufthansa said it had flown several planes to Frankfurt from Munich .
" All airplanes have been inspected on arrival in Frankfurt but there was no damage to the cockpit windows or fuselage and no impact on the engines , " a spokesman said .
Spread of restrictions
More than 20 European countries have closed their airspace until as late as Monday afternoon .
Budget airline Easyjet cancelled flights in northern Europe until at least the beginning of Monday , with rival Ryanair imposing similar cancellations until at least Monday afternoon .
Weather experts have warned that the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland was unlikely to move far until later in the week .
Southern Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull volcano began erupting for the second time in a month on Wednesday , sending a plume of ash 8.5 km ( 5.3 miles ) high into the air .
Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull continued to erupt on Sunday
Winds blowing the cloud from Iceland to Russia were expected to continue in the same direction , possibly until the middle of the week , according to some experts .
" The ash will continue to be directed towards Britain and Scandinavia , " Teitur Arason , a meteorologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office , told the AFP news agency .
" That 's the general situation for the coming days - more or less for the next two days or maybe the next four or five days , " he said .
Dangerous mixture for jets
The airborne ash is a mixture of glass and sandy rock particles , which poses a significant danger to the working of jet engines .
Experts tracking the volcano beneath Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on Friday .
After a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on Wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
That last recorded eruption continued , with varying levels of severity and activity , for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .

This is precisely the case Barry Goldwater , the leader of the Republicans ’ conservative wing , made on the Senate floor just before the final vote on the Civil Rights Act .
“ I am unalterably opposed to discrimination of any sort , ” Mr. Goldwater said , even as he attacked provisions of the bill that “ would embark the Federal Government on a regulatory course of action with regard to private enterprise and in the area of so - called ‘ public accommodations ’ and in the area of employment . ”
Public accommodations included gas station rest rooms , drinking fountains , lunch counters , hotels , movie houses and sports arenas .
It is hard to imagine a candidate today making the case that discrimination in such places should be allowed .
Indeed Mr. Paul has said he favors the “ public accommodations ” provision .
But in advancing the autonomy of private businesses , he is reviving libertarian thought in its peak period .
In his 1962 book “ Capitalism and Freedom , ” Milton Friedman , the right ’s most influential economist , equated the Fair Employment Practices Commissions — created to prevent workplace discrimination — with “ the Hitler Nuremberg laws . ”
But he also applied the comparison to “ the Southern states imposing special disabilities upon Negroes . ”
In other words , he recognized that Jim Crow was itself a form of intrusive government , only enacted at the state level .
This points to the bind Mr. Paul is in .
However attractive it may be just now to depict all political conflict as a neatly bifurcated either / or , with the heroic individual pitted against the faceless federal Leviathan , the truth is that legislative battles over civil rights laws were waged within government , and between competing incarnations of it , federal vs. state .
Passage of the Civil Rights Act , as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina observed last week , hinged on the Interstate Commerce Clause , which “ was properly used by the courts and the Congress . ”
The reasoning was clear : since the federal government built the highways that goods were shipped on and created tax codes favorable to businesses , it had jurisdiction over how businesses operated .
Even Mr. Friedman acknowledged that racial discrimination could not be interpreted in the exclusive terms of individual choice .
“ When the owner of the store hires white clerks in preference to Negroes in the absence of the law , he may simply be transmitting the tastes of the community , ” he wrote .
But he stopped short of noting the obvious , that in such instances the white community ’s “ taste ” had made it the enemy of individual African - Americans who were forbidden to sit at a luncheonette or take their children into a Woolworth ’s rest room .
Mr. Paul has tangled himself up in a similar contradiction .
His championing of private businesses , ignoring the rights of just about everyone else , places him on the wrong side of history , just like the first opponents of the Civil Rights Act .
One fierce opponent of civil rights legislation , William F. Buckley Jr. , admitted as much .
“ I once believed we could evolve our way up from Jim Crow , ” Mr. Buckley said in 2004 .
“ I was wrong : federal intervention was necessary . ”
NEW ORLEANS -- BP conceded Thursday that more oil than it estimated is gushing into the Gulf of Mexico as heavy crude washed into Louisiana 's wetlands for the first time , feeding worries and uncertainty about the massive monthlong spill .
Mark Proegler , a spokesman for oil giant BP PLC , said a mile - long tube inserted into a leaking pipe over the weekend is capturing 210,000 gallons a day -- the total amount the company and the Coast Guard have estimated is gushing into the sea -- but some is still escaping .
He would not say how much .
Several professors who have watched video of the leak have said they believe the amount spewing out is much higher than official estimates .

If you have suggestions for a story , or if you belong to an organization in need of such help , please call Press - Register Editor Mike Marshall at 251-219-5674 or email him at
.
Proegler said the 210,000 gallons -- 5,000 barrels -- has always been just an estimate because there is no way to measure how much is spilling from the seafloor .
" I would encourage people to take a look at the changing amount of oil coming from the ocean floor , " said Steve Rinehart , another BP spokesman .
" It 's pretty clear that now that we 're taking 5,000 barrels of oil a day , there 's a significant change in the flow reaching the sea . "
A live video feed of the leak posted online Thursday at the insistence of U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey , D - Mass. , shows what appears to be a large plume of oil and gas still spewing next to the tube that 's carrying some of it to the surface .
The well blew out after an explosion a month ago on the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 people .
At least 6 million gallons have spilled so far , making it the worst U.S. environmental disaster in decades .
The Exxon Valdez tanker spilled 11 million gallons in Alaska in 1989 .
Small amounts of light oil have washed up in delicate coastal areas of Louisiana over the past several weeks , but nothing like the brown ooze from the spill that started coating marsh grasses and hanging in the shallow water of a wetland Wednesday .
" This is the heavy oil that everyone 's been fearing that is here now , " Gov. Bobby Jindal said during a boat tour Wednesday in southeastern Louisiana .
The wetlands at the mouth of the Mississippi River are home to rare birds , mammals and a wide variety of marine life .
Much of southeast Louisiana 's coastal waters have been closed to fishing and oyster harvesting because of the oil .
A vast area stretching east toward Florida in federal waters also has been closed to seafood harvesting .
Officials in Florida sought to reassure tourists that the state 's beaches are clean and safe as government scientists said a small portion of the slick had entered the so - called loop current , a stream of fast - moving water that circulates around the Gulf before bending around Florida and up the Atlantic coast .
During a news conference , David Halstead , director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management , showed off a picture of a Coppertone bottle on a beach .
" What 's the only oil on the beaches ?
Suntan oil , " he said .
Tracking the unpredictable spill and the complex loop current is a challenge for scientists , said Charlie Henry , a NOAA environmental scientist .
The loop moves based on shifting winds and other environmental factors , so even though oil is leaking continuously it may be in the current one day , and out the next .
The slick itself has defied scientists ' efforts to track it and predict its path .
Instead , it has repeatedly advanced and retreated , an ominous , shape - shifting mass in the Gulf , with vast underwater lobes extending outward .
Florida 's state meteorologist said it will be at least another seven days before the oil reaches waters west of the Florida Keys .
U.S. officials were also talking to Cuba about how to respond to the spill should it reach the island 's northern coast , a U.S. State Department spokesman said .
BP , which was leasing the rig when it exploded , was marshaling equipment and conducting tests Thursday ahead of a new effort to choke off the oil flow .
Crews hoped that by Sunday they can start a procedure known as a " top kill , " which involves pumping heavy mud into the crippled equipment on top of the well , then permanently sealing it with cement .
The procedure has been used before to halt gushing oil above ground , but like other methods BP is exploring it has never been used 5,000 feet below the sea .
That 's why scientists and engineers have spent much of the past week preparing and taking a series of measurements to make sure the mission does n't backfire .
" The philosophy from the beginning is not to take any action which could make the situation worse , and those are the final steps we 're doing , " said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer .
Anger over the spill has mounted as the efforts to stop the leak have dragged on .
Greenpeace activists scaled BP's London headquarters Thursday to hang a flag accusing the oil company of polluting the environment .
The group said the action was prompted by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as well as a controversial project in Canada .
" It takes some cheek to go and use a sunflower logo when your business is dirty oil , " Greenpeace activist Ben Stewart said from a balcony above the headquarters ' front door in a telephone interview .
BP spokesman Robert Wine called the action " a very calm and genteel protest , " and said no employees had been prevented from getting to work .

( CNN ) -- Tiger Woods ' troubled career took another blow Monday , when one of his coaches said he would no longer be working with golf 's No. 1 player .
" Just so there is no confusion , I would like to make it clear that this is my decision , " Hank Haney , Woods ' swing coach , said in a statement posted to his website .
" Tiger Woods and I will always be friends , but I believe that there is a time and place for everything , and I feel at this time and at this place in my life I want to move forward in other areas . "
The announcement came a day after Woods dropped out of the final round of The Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida , complaining of " a bulging disk " in his neck .
" I 'm having a hard time with the pain , " Woods said at a news conference Sunday .
" There 's tingling down my fingers , just the right side .
Setting up over the ball is fine but once I start making the motion , it 's downhill from there . "
Woods said anti-inflammatory drugs have been ineffective and plans to have an MRI .
Woods has been at the white - hot center of controversy since revelations of extramarital affairs arose following a car accident in late November .
In the ensuing months , several alleged lovers have come forth , and Woods spent 45 days at a rehabilitation center for what the golfer called " personal " issues .
He returned to competition in early April for the Masters tournament in Augusta , Georgia , in which Woods placed fourth .
" As we all know , Tiger has been through a lot in the last six months , and I really believe that given the chance , mind free and injury free , we will all see Tiger Woods play once again like we all know he can , " Haney said .
" I wish Tiger well , not only with his golf , but in finding peace and happiness in all aspects of his life .
Tiger knows that if he ever needs me in anyway , whether it be with his golf or just as a friend he can always call , " he added .
" I will always , as I have been in the past , be there for him . "
IT IS not yet clear exactly who won the election on May 9th in North Rhine - Westphalia ( NRW ) , Germany 's most populous state , but it is clear who lost : the two parties that govern both the state and Germany , the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) and the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , and their leaders .
Foremost among the losers are Angela Merkel , Germany 's chancellor and head of the CDU , as well as her foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle , who leads the FDP .
Mr Westerwelle called the election results a “ warning shot ” to the governing parties .
That is an understatement .
A majority of NRW voters said the decision to bail out Greece , approved by the Bundestag two days before the election , influenced their decision .
Though voters went to the polls before European finance ministers and the IMF unveiled a € 750 billion ( $ 965 billion ) to ease fears of contagion from Greece 's solvency crisis , it is unlikely that Germans will be delighted with that either .
Both the CDU and the opposition Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) won a bit more than 34 % of the vote .
Although the CDU apparently finished in front by a tiny margin this is in fact a disastrous setback for the party and for the state 's premier , Jürgen Rüttgers .
The CDU lost ten percentage points of the vote since the last election in 2005 .
Its partnership with the FDP in the state will now be dissolved .
This will be seen as the beginning of a comeback for the SPD , which suffered its worst post - war defeat in last September 's federal elections .
But it is also further evidence of a long - term decline in support for both of the big-tent Volksparteien : the SPD outperformed expectations , but still won its lowest share of the vote in NRW since 1954 .
For two smaller parties the results are an unalloyed triumph ( see graphic , below ) : the Green Party , which doubled its share of the vote , and the ex-communist Left Party , which enters NRW 's legislature for the first time ( and complicates the arithmetic of coalition building ) .
Several coalitions are now thinkable , any one of which would reverberate beyond NRW .
The most difficult decision may face the SPD 's leader , Hannelore Kraft .
Her preferred alliance — with the Greens — has apparently fallen short of a majority .
She might now have to choose between joining a “ grand coalition ” with the CDU , possibly as a junior partner , or bringing the Left Party into the government of a western state for the first time to top up its alliance with the Greens .
This would be risky .
The Left Party is a reasonable governing partner in eastern Germany , where it has participated in several coalitions , including the current one in Berlin .
But in NRW the party is a ramshackle grouping that includes professed communists .
It is not clear whether a partnership with the SPD and the Greens would make the Left Party more respectable or sully the reputation of the other two .
Another possible alliance would be an exotic three - party ménage consisting of the SPD , Greens and the FDP , but this looks unlikely .
Whatever coalition eventually emerges in NRW , the results are a severe blow for Mrs Merkel .
Her CDU - FDP coalition will lose its majority in the Bundesrat , the upper house of the legislature .
Any legislation that affects the states can now be blocked by the opposition .
Worse than that , the NRW election discredits the course Mrs Merkel has set since winning a second term last September and inviting the FDP to be her governing partner .
It soon became apparent that the two parties had less in common than they had proclaimed .
The FDP 's top priority was to cut taxes , but voters found the idea laughable in light of the government 's record deficit ; the CDU was hardly less sceptical .
The FDP proposed embarking on a radical reform of health - care financing , which proved unpopular both within the coalition and on the streets .
Mr Westerwelle touched off a divisive debate about welfare , which many thought unbecoming the country 's chief diplomat .
Mrs Merkel appeared to be putting off the government 's most difficult decisions until after the NRW election .
As a result , voters had no clear idea where she proposed to lead the country .
And now leadership will become more difficult .
Mrs Merkel must now negotiate a new framework for managing the euro without further angering an electorate already resentful at having to aid irresponsible neighbours and fearful for the currency 's stability .
Falling tax revenues and a new balanced - budget amendment to the constitution mean that rather than offering tax relief Mrs Merkel will have to preside over unpopular spending cuts .
A consensus - loving tactician , Mrs Merkel has done too little to prepare Germans for tough decisions .
It will not be easier if Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble , who was hospitalised during a crisis meeting on the euro in Brussels , is not at full strength .
Mr Westerwelle is also in trouble .
The FDP , which won a record 14.6 % of the vote in the federal election , managed less than half that in NRW .
His pugnacious behaviour , which served him well in opposition , looks inappropriate in office .
He may eventually face a challenge to his leadership of the FDP .
Mrs Merkel is also looking politically mortal for the first time .
A latecomer to politics from eastern Germany and to the CDU , she has always been more popular with voters than in her own party .
As the CDU 's biggest electoral asset she had little trouble keeping rivals in line .
Now that the party has performed so badly in Germany 's most important state , Mrs Merkel will have to regain its confidence while she struggles to restore a sense of direction to her government .
( CNN ) --
The FBI in Seattle , Washington , is looking into allegations of civil rights violations in the case of a police officer caught on video kicking a Latino detainee , an agent said Wednesday .
The preliminary inquiry comes a day after the NAACP sent a letter to the King County prosecuting attorney 's office requesting Seattle police Detective Shandy Cobane be charged with malicious harassment , a hate crime .
Video captured by a freelance video photographer April 17 shows Cobane using racial slurs against the detainee and kicking him in the head , and another officer stomping on his leg while he is lying face down on the ground without handcuffs .
The second officer was identified this week as Mary Lynne Woollum , Seattle police said .
The detainee was released after officers determined he was a not a suspect in an armed robbery , according to CNN affiliate KOMO .
" We give officers guns , batons and badges with the hope that they will not violate our public trust , with the hope that they will enforce the law , provide public safety and honor the Constitution , " James Bible , president of the Seattle chapter of the NAACP , said Tuesday in denouncing the police officers ' actions .
" In this specific case ... the Constitution was violated in a most egregious way .
...
We have no choice but to request that charges be filed . "
FBI Special Agent Fred Gutt told CNN Wednesday that investigators will gather information on the incident and send it to the Civil Rights Section of the U.S. Department of Justice .
" They will then decide if a formal investigation is warranted , " he said .
Cobane issued a tearful apology Friday after the video was shown on local news stations .
In the statement , Cobane called his comments " offensive and unprofessional " and said they " do not reflect who I am or what I am as a person nor as a member of the Seattle Police Department . "
Cobane , a 15 - year veteran , and Woollum , a veteran of more than 10 years , have been placed on administrative reassignment while investigations are under way , according to Seattle police .

The Self - Help Movement in California in the Great Depression
By John Curl
The Self - Help movement of the early 1930s attempted to overcome the social effects of the Great Depression through barter cooperatives of the unemployed .
This article focuses on California , where the movement had its greatest impact , and on the Unemployed Exchange Association ( UXA ) of Oakland , probably the most highly developed group in the country .
Included are photos by Dorothea Lange and Imogen Cunningham , quotes from a novelized history of the movement by Upton Sinclair , and an interview fifty years later with a former member of the UXA .

ORIGINS
July 1932 .
The economy stopped .
Factories locked , money scarce .
One out of seven Californians unemployed .
Almost no social welfare programs .
Large numbers homeless , destitute , hungry .
All around vacant buildings stand boarded up .
The fields are rotting with tons of unharvested fruit and vegetables .
Small farmers have no cash to pay harvesters , and there is no market ; many are losing their land .
Food prices are next to nothing , but many thousands in the cities and towns have nothing at all .
California highways and rails are crowded with the homeless searching for survival , including thousands of " wild children . "
While over the static of every radio station flows the soothing voice of Franklin Roosevelt promising if elected to bring a New Deal .
" Hoovervilles , " shantytowns of the homeless , have sprung up around the country over the past three years .
The largest in the San Francisco Bay Area is Pipe City , near the railroad tracks by the Oakland waterfront , where hundreds live in sections of large sewer pipe that have never been laid due to lack of funds .
Carl Rhodehamel , unemployed and down on his luck , walks through Pipe City , talking to the inhabitants .
Rhodehamel was once an electrical engineer at GE , a cellist , an inventor of several key technological developments in radio and early " talkies , " an orchestra conductor and composer whose " Little Symphony " had once been a favorite with KGO fans .
There is a streak of genius in him , that will sweep him into the leadership of an organization that will stir California and the country .
He and two others he met in Pipe City , find an abandoned grocery store that can be used for meetings , and a group of six unemployed begin to meet and discuss ways out of their problems .
Rhodehamel says ,
Since the money system is n't working , we should form our own system , and not use money at all : we should aim at providing ourselves with everything we need to live , by barter .
He is not the only one with that idea .
Barter groups of the unemployed are already operating in Seattle and L.A. , and are forming all around the country .
The other five , like Rhodehamel , are skilled and experienced workers , but all realize it could be years , if ever , before they 'd find work in their fields again .
They decide to try the idea .
They begin going door to door in the neighborhood , the Dimond - Allendale district of East Oakland , offering to do home repairs in exchange for " junk " from people 's basements and garages .
It works .
They decide to try to gather all the unemployed in the neighborhood into their group ; they distribute fliers throughout the area .
On the evening of July 20 , 1932 , about twenty people meet at the Hawthorne School and organize the U.X.A. , the Unemployed Exchange Association ( or Universal Exchange Association , as they 'll call it later ) .
The X stands not only for eXchange , but for the " unknown factor " in an algebraic equation , a social algebraic equation .
Six months later the UXA will be the object of a series of five articles in the San Francisco Chronicle .
and another series of three in the Examiner .
It will be noticed in news media around the country as the most highly developed group in the Self - Help cooperative movement springing up everywhere in America .
Two young photographers , Dorothea Lange and Imogen Cunningham , will journey around the UXA together snapping a series of now - classic shots .
Upton Sinclair will take the UXA as his model for the EPIC ( End Poverty In California )
Plan that he will run for governor on , and will come close to winning ; later he 'll write a thinly fictionalized account of the UXA and EPIC in Co-op , a Novel of Living Together .
For a brief moment the country 's consciousness will turn to East Oakland .
Even FDR will look and listen .
To a nation of dispossessed people hungry for a new social equation , it will seem that all that is required to get from the U.S.A. to the U.X.A. is a daring leap into the unknown .

GROWTH AND GROWING PAINS
Their first focus was the neighborhood itself , a depressed workingclass area , then ( but not today . ) predominantly white .
They began organizing the residents to fix up each others ' houses and to recirculate every variety of article and item among themselves to where it would be useful .
There had been little work done in the three years since the crash of 1929 , so there was a great backlog of home repairs to be done .
The abandoned grocery became their first storeroom and commissary , soon overflowing with household and industrial articles .
Broken items were repaired or rebuilt .
The neighborhood , previously choked with despair and immobility , was suddenly bursting with activity and confidence .
People poured into the new organization .
They soon began sending scouts around Oakland and into the surrounding farm areas , to search out salvageable things and make deals with their owners for them .
Labor teams followed .
All work was credited at one hundred points per hour .
Members exchanged points earned for their choice of items in the commissary .
Each article brought in was given a point value , which approximated the labor time that went into it , with some adjustment for comparable money value .
They also offered many services for points , including complete medical and dental , garage , nursery school , barber .
They provided some housing and all of their firewood needs .
At their peak they would distribute forty tons of food per week to their 1500 members .
They called it Reciprocal Economy .
They made no distinction in labor value between men and women , skilled and unskilled , lesser and greater productivity .
At first they functioned entirely by barter ; it was all done on the books , without a circulating scrip .
Members could write " orders " - like checks - against their account to other members far services provided .
Eventually they began making trades that involved part payment in cash .
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
The General Assembly of members held final power , They selected an Operating Committee in semi-annual elections , to coordinate functioning .
The UXA was divided into various " sections " : Manufacturing , Trading , Food , Farm , Construction , Gardening , Homeworkers , Communication , Health , Transportation , Bookkeeping , Maintenance , Fuel , Personal Services , Placement , Food Conservation , Headquarters Staff , Saw Mill , Ranch .
The workers in each section decided issues relevant to their work , approved or disapproved Committee and Assembly actions , and determined the admittance of new members into their section .
They kept the numbers in each section down to about twenty - five , to make decision - making viable ; when numbers got much larger , the section split into two .
The Operating Committee met four nights a week at their headquarters on East 14th Street at 40th Avenue .
These were open meetings at which plans and decisions were thrashed out in democratic discussions .
Sitting about a huge round table , the only rule was to speak one at a time .
Anybody with an idea , member or not , was welcome to sit in and was heard after the current commitments of jobs that individuals had agreed to had been dealt with .
On Friday nights the Coordinators of the sections met with the Operating Committee to form the Coordinating Assembly , the basic ongoing decision - making body , The section Coordinators were appointed by the Operating Committee , with the workers of each section holding veto power .
The Coordinators had no authority over members , and could be recalled at any time .
Power was from the bottom up .
Outsiders often expressed amazement at how well they functioned with " no boss , no foreman , no manager . "
THE RED SQUAD
Word of the new organization quickly reached certain vigilant ears .
Word was passed to the Oakland police department that the UXA was a " revolutionary " group with " Communist " leaders .
UXA meetings were raided and shut down by the Red Squad .
The commissary was closed on the pretext that they were violating an ordinance prohibiting the sale of food and clothing from the same store .
Utilities were shut off .
The core group , in the fall of 1932 about thirty strong , met in secret to decide what to do .
In the early hours of the following dawn they finally agreed on an unusual plan .
Here becomes apparent for the first time the particular genius of Rhodehamel who , as chairman , would steer the UXA through its life cycle .
The entire organization , then about one hundred members , went around town spreading a rumor that the police and fire departments had changed their mind , and were now helping the UXA ,
They made sure that the story found its way into the rank - and - file of the police .
Then they began holding open meetings again and , as they 'd hoped , members of the police force came , not on orders evidently , but out of curiosity .
Some of them wound up participating constructively in the meetings .
The raids stopped and relations between the local government and the UXA actually became helpful .
They had forced the Oakland police to open their minds , no small order then or now .
By the beginning of 1933 the UXA had a labor force of six hundred .
Anyone over eighteen could join ; applicants were screened , but only a small number with unconstructive motivations were rejected .
There were provisions for expelling people but these were almost never used .
Such matters were dealt with in a different way : when someone was known to be stealing , for example , instead of making accusations , " We make it easy for them , " Rhodehamel said .
Before long the offender , becoming aware that others knew , would either stop stealing or shamefully disappear .
Beyond organizing barter and labor exchange , they began producing articles for trade and sale .
They set up a foundry and machine shop , a woodshop , garage , a soap factory , a print shop , a food conserving project , nursery and adult school .
They had eighteen trucks that they 'd rebuilt from junk .
They branched outside of town , and maintained a woodlot in Dixon , ranches near Modesto and Winters , lumber mills near Oroville and in the Santa Cruz mountains .

THE COORDINATING ASSEMBLY
Twenty - five men and women crowd about the table , elbows touching .
Another twenty form a second circle around them .
At the table 's center a foot - high lighthouse stands , its top constantly revolving , with the letters UXA flashing .
8 PM : Rhodehamel ( " Rhodie " ) calls the meeting to order .
Mary McCanna takes down the day 's commitments , detailed in an indexed looseleaf book and written on small yellow slips of paper .
They go through the commitments one by one .
What has been done and what not ?
What deals made ?
Which jobs progressed and which finished ?
The different coordinators speak about their sections .
They quickly go through twenty or thirty items .
Fields have been harvested ; trenches have been dug ; wheelbarrows have been salvaged ; cars have been painted ; orders have come into the foundry ; carpenting and plastering have been done ; a deal has been made for wood ; arms have been made for dental chairs ; a contract to build a barn has been agreed on ; a barge and tug have been leased to haul produce and wood ; a group of apartments have been rented for labor and services ; a wrecking deal has been discussed ; an idle planing mill has been discovered ; an order for office furniture has come in ; a gasoline trade is in the works ; a potato chip slicer is being converted for a sauerkraut project .
Voorhies reports that a farmer near Hayward will trade sixty percent of his apricot and plum crops for harvesting labor .
Can we do it ?
Rutzebeck of Personnel says labor is available , Hill is made coordinator .
Price of Manufacturing reports that the swing saw bearings have been cast and are ready .
Hanson says they need a new motor for it , Llewellan knows of a motor but the owner wants a piano .
Pugh says the Trading Section has one listed , and they can get it for digging out part of a cellar ; but it needs tuning .
Is a piano tuner on the exchange list ?
Yes , three of them .
After all the items are finished , there is a general discussion of ideas for new activities , how to get more labor power , and how to build leadership .
By that time it is eleven o'clock and , since all have had their say , Rhodie calls the meeting to a close .
But people linger afterward , and far into the night the discussion continues , of how to implement barter on a societal scale , so all who can find no place in the capitalist economy might join a cooperative and create a whole new American way of life .
THE MOVEMENT
The UXA was far from the only Self - Help group in California or in the Bay Area .
In the summer and fall of 1932 , at the same time as the UXA was forming , similar groups were organizing around the state and across the country , over one hundred in California alone .
They appeared wherever conditions were ripe among the unemployed and underemployed , particularly near farming areas ,
It was truly a spontaneous mass movement , spread by the wind , an idea whose time seemed to have come .
By the spring of 1933 , there were at least 100,000 members in about 175 groups in California , and another 50,000 in 100 groups around the nation .
Over the next two years over half a million people were involved in at least 29 states .
A survey in December 94 counted 310 different groups , Among the earliest was the Seattle Unemployed Citizens League , which set up labor exchanges with farmers in the summer of ' 31 .
By 93 California clearly assumed national leadership , with about two - thirds of the groups .
Although not the largest in the country , the UXA was seen by almost all observers to be the most highly developed of all the self - help co-ops in America .
Numerically the largest concentration was in Los Angeles county , vhere about 75,000 people in 107 groups participated in the harvest of fall 1932 , Among the earliest in the state were the LA Exchange , started by Bessie Mays , the Compton Relief Association , begun by a group of World War I veterans , and the Unemployed Association of Santa Ana ( in Orange county ) .
Since farming areas were easily accessible in the south , most of these groups organized large numbers of people to harvest produce in exchange for a share of the crops .
Nearby Orange county was also an area of concentration .
Several forms of Self - Help were usually distinguished , although most groups practiced them all to varying degrees : exchange among members , exchange of labor for goods or services , cooperative production for trade or sale .
Exchange among members was the most widespread , and commonly involved part - payment in cash .
It was only in the later stage of the movement that many groups turned to production , and most never did to an appreciable extent .

BAY AREA GROUPS
By March 93 there were 32 Self - Help groups ringing the Bay : 22 in the East Bay , 9 in San Francisco and the Peninsula , one in San Jose .
All had begun the previous summer and fall .
Besides the UXA there were a number of other distinctive ones .
The Berkeley Unemployed Association , at 2110 Parker Street , had sections that included sewing , quilting and weaving , shoe repair , barber , conserving , wood yard , kitchen and dining room , commissary , garage , machine shop , woodshop , and mattress factory .
At their height they involved several hundred people and had full medical and dental coverage .
A visitor to the wood shop in December 1934 reported them working on office desks and furniture , as well as fruit lugs for the farm exchange section .
They later changed their name to the Berkeley Self - Help Cooperative , typical of many groups who considered themselves no longer unemployed .
A few blocks away , on Delaware Street , was the Pacific Cooperative League ( PCL ) , which operated a garage , flour mill , wood yard , store , canning and weaving projects , and ran a newspaper , the Herald of Cooperation , later called the Voice of the Self - Employed ..
They laid claim to having organized one of the earliest labor exchanges of the Depression , when they traded an Atascadero rancher their harvesting labor for part of his apricot crop in September 1930 .
The PCL was not a new organization like almost all the rest , but dated back decades to when it had been part of a consumer co-op store movement of the same name , begun in 1913 .
The chain , based in San Francisco , had at its peak fourteen stores in California and 33 more in seven other western states .
It was promoted at one point by Upton Sinclair .
But the old PCL collapsed in 1921 , strangled by centralization and by a feud with the Atlantic coast based Cooperative League .
The East Bay PCL group managed to survive the death of the parent organization , and staggered along at a low level until sparked to rebirth by the depression and by the other Self - Help groups nearby .
The San Jose Unemployed Relief Council ( later called the SJ Self - Help Co-op ) was formed by a group of laid - off cannery workers .
They soon had a wood yard , a fruit - and - vegetable drying yard , a store , laundry , farm , soap factory , barbershop , shoe shop , commissary , sewing project and contracted for a wide variety of jobs and services ,
At their height they were about 1200 strong .
The Peninsula Economic Exchange , in Palo Alto , was organized by a group of unemployed white collar workers , professionals , and bankrupt merchants .
With about a hundred member families , they had a store on Emerson Street , a farm , a cannery , woodyard , and fishing boat .
Unlike most of the other northern groups , they issued scrip , in - house currency , to members for hours worked .
" Scrip exchanges " were more common at first in southern California , but were usually plagued with problems .
UCRA and UCDA
The southern California co-ops , in general , developed a different approach from those in the north .
While the UXA and other northern groups defined their goal as developing permanent production facilities to create an independent survival system for their members , the southern groups , with the early leadership of C.M. Christofferson , saw their aim as getting food , clothing , and shelter for their members by any means necessary .
These means included direct action and " chiseling . "
Most southern groups never developed from simple " vegetable exchanges " into a production phase .
They took to direct action to put evicted members back into their homes , and to turn disconnected utilities back on .
They " chiseled " necessities out of farmers , businesses , and local governments .
Unlike the northern groups , which distributed items to members according to work performed , many southern groups distributed " according to need , " in a somewhat indiscriminate manner .
In the late fall of 1932 many of the southern groups came together and set up the Unemployed Cooperative Relief Association ( UCRA ) .
Christofferson was first chairman , and later " Pat " May of the Huntington Park unit .
Under Ray 's leadership , UCRA changed from a loose federation to a highly centralized organization claiming to speak for a combined membership of 200,000 state - wide .
The first form " chiseling " took was workers not showing up to perform promised labor , although the items exchanged for had already been taken .
Soon they began to " chisel " the local government for grants .
Mass " hunger marches " and large demonstrations forced the LA County Board of Supervisors and municipal government to grant them gasoline , trucks , and food staples .
UCRA took to supporting candidates favorable to their goals in local elections , and packed considerable clout .
The focus of the southern groups shifted from labor exchange as they became primarily distribution organizations .
" No more work !
We 've produced too much already , " became a rallying cry .
The worst tendencies of " chiseling " culminated in one southern town in a " co-op " run by a sort of ward - boss using a goonsquad , who used the elimination of UCRA " radicals " as a lever for his rise to power , backed by the local business community .
The northern co-ops criticized " chiseling , " scorned the idea of trying to get " something for nothing , " objected to getting involved in electoral politics , and declined becoming relief organizations .
Nonetheless , when UCRA moved to become state - wide , many of the northern groups , including the UXA , affiliated .
In January 1933 , UCRA parented five units in San Francisco and several others in the East Bay .
San Francisco UCRA # 1 was quartered at 101 Webster Street , with Emily Martin as chairperson .
By the next month there were five units in the city with over 900 member families .
But the SF groups suffered from long distances to farming areas , from intense political factionalization , and from comparatively available government " relief " .
In July 1933 UCRA held its quarterly convention in San Francisco and , in the midst of bitter fighting , split into two .
The local groups never recovered , and by the end of the year four had totally collapsed .
Down in LA , UCRA was undercut by governmental agencies creating and fostering parallel organizations , first the Area Conference , to which most UCRA units became affiliated , and later the Unemployed Cooperative Distribution Association ( UCDA ) , fostered by the federal government in the fall of 1933 .
May 's group from UCRA took over the administration of UCDA , while UCRA became functionally defunct .
Over the year , May managed to preside over the " chiseling " and distribution of $ 120,000 in federal grants for staple foods and gasoline .
NEW DEAL
With the New Deal came the Federal Emergency Relief Act ( FERA ) .
Rhodehamel , H.S. Calvert of the Pacific Cooperative League , and other California leaders were called by the congressional committees drafting the bill to confer on provisions concerning grants to cooperatives to purchase means of production .
Due in part to " Rhodie " and " Cal "s efforts , funds were suddenly available .
Rhodehamel however argued in vain that they should not be outright grants , but loans repayable in labor exchange .
Furthermore , the law stipulated that production facilities set up with FERA funds could not be used in money transactions , while the self - help groups usually tried to include money in their exchange arrangements whenever possible .
This last provision seriously undercut the co-ops ' ability to function .
Rhodehamel tried to prevent the UXA from applying for a FERA grant , out of fear of the strings attached , but the membership decided to anyway .
It was written in the UXA books as a loan , although the feds considered it a grant .
By the end of 1934 , FERA had distributed $ 411,000 to 81 groups .
The UXA received grants for their sawmill , for printing equipment , gardening , and canning .
The Berkeley Self - Help Co-op received grants for furniture , mattress , and shoe operations .
The Pacific Cooperative League received grants for housing , milling , and weaving .
The San Jose Self - Help Co-op for dehydrating and other equipment , and for renting farm land .
In southern California , under a different program administrator , in order to become eligible for a production grant a co-op was first forced to " demonstrate its managerial ability " by running a distribution program for government staples and gasoline .
It was in order to administer this program that the federal government set up UCDA and got the co-ops to join , making the independent UCRA functionally obsolescent .
Large " blanket grants " for gas and staples were issued to UCDA , to be passed on to the affiliated groups .
There was a double - bind however : acceptance of blanket grant money by a unit made it ineligible to obtain an individual federal grant for productive equipment ; UCDA applied for a blanket million - dollar production grant , but this was eventually denied .
Later however , after federal blanket grant money stopped , the southern co-ops became individually eligible again .
Some did get production grants and turned in that direction , but with not as much success as in the north ,
Federal money was used as a carrot to influence the internal affairs of many co-ops .
A typical case was the San Jose Co-op , whose grant was held up due to the presence of a " radical faction " in the organization .
This touched off a bitter struggle in the group .
The " Reds " lost and the grant came through .
Thus FERA money was a double - edged sword for the Self - Help movement .
But the co-ops would have survived it .
The real kiss of death for the movement was the WPA .
But before that kiss descended , the co-ops sparked one of the great grassroots electoral uprisings in American history , EPIC .

EPIC
In September 1933 , Upton Sinclair , novelistic chronicler of American social reality , long a leading member of the California Socialist Party , suddenly changed registration and threw his hat into the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination with a program he called EPIC : End Poverty In California .
With " Production For Use " as its rallying cry , the EPIC plan would have created state agencies to take over idle farms and production facilities and turn them over to the unemployed , to " establish State land colonies whereby the unemployed may become self - sustaining , to acquire factories and production plants whereby the unemployed may produce the basic necessities required for themselves and for the land colonies , and to operate these factories and house and feed and care for the workers ... , ( to ) maintain a distribution system of each other 's products ... , thus constituting a complete industrial system , a new and self - sustaining world for those our present system cannot employ . "
Public bodies titled California Authority for Land ( CAL ) , for Production ( CAP ) , and for Barter ( CAB ) would reside respectively over rural , urban , and exchange .
Besides this central plan were provisions for a series of social welfare programs ( there were virtually no state programs at the time ) , and for a general redistribution of the wealth downward through changes in tax laws .
EPIC took its immediate inspiration from the Self - Help cooperatives , with the UXA as the classical model .
Here was living proof that these were not idle utopian dreams , but could actually work .
They did n't shun the label Utopian as pejorative , but wore it as a badge of pride .
EPIC clubs sprang up around the state like grass after rain , ultimately 2000 of them .
The EPIC News reached a circulation of 1.5 million .
Most of the co-ops , considering themselves economic and not political organizations , decided it was out of their sphere to endorse electoral candidates directly .
Sinclair declared this position correct , even though much of his core support came from them and from the unemployed who had created them .
The support of local candidates by UCRA in LA and by the Unemployed Citizens League up in Seattle had led to betrayal in the first case and defeat in the second .
It was better left to members to participate individually .
And participate they did .
As Sinclair said later , " Of course ( self - help ) was ' production for use ' , and those people automatically became EPICs . "
Hjalmar " Hans " Rutzebeck , personnel coordinator of the UXA , took a leave of absence and became a key aide in the campaign .
Sinclair , who had garnered 50,000 votes running as a Socialist for governor four years previously , now swept the 1934 Democratic primary with 436,000 votes , more than the other six candidates combined .
But the California Right , entrenched for decades , had not yet begun to fight .
Most of the Democratic Old Guard defected to the Republicans ; the state organization declined to be of any support .
Newsmedia , which at first had usually reported favorably on the Self - Help movement and on Sinclair , now turned around and attacked without quarter .
Almost every newspaper and radio station came out against him .
An anti-EPIC newsreel was shown in every theater in the state .
Gigantic sums of money ( for that era ) were spent to defeat Sinclair , in possibly the most vicious and libelous campaign in California history .
Sinclair countered by going to the New Deal for support .
Roosevelt , in office only a year and a half , had decided not to single out any particular Democrats for special endorsement .
Sinclair noted that this did not exclude his endorsing any particular plan .
He conferred with Harry Hopkins , the Relief Administrator ( later to set up the WPA ) .
Hopkins announced that he was ready to work with EPIC ; he presented it to FDR as a potential hothouse for a national plan .
Sinclair met with Roosevelt .
Sinclair recounts the conversation :
" At the end he told me that he was coming out for production for use .
I said , ' If you do that , Mr. President , it will elect me . '
' Well , ' he said , ' I am going to do it . ' "
FDR indicated he would come out for the plan during a nationwide radio address scheduled for the week before the election , and Sinclair hinted publicly that this would happen .
On the night of the broadcast , the entire EPIC movement was glued to the radio .
When Roosevelt signed off , few could believe the speech was over and he'd said nothing about production for use .
A mood of doubt suddenly permeated the organization , where joyous optimism had reigned .
Sinclair 's main antagonist was the incumbent Frank Merriam , seventy and somewhat senile , who 'd saved himself from being dumped by his own party by his violent suppression of the San Francisco longshore strike and general strike , which took place shortly before .
THE GENERAL STRIKE
The unions and the Self - Help groups had mostly positive relations .
A good number of workers belonged to both a union and a co-op .
Some Self - Help co-ops , such as the San Jose Unemployed Relief Council , were staffed by unionists .
Others , such as the UXA , decided specifically that they would not seek to take over any jobs already being performed by steadily employed labor .
This friendship paid off in mutual solidarity during the San Francisco General Strike .
The co-ops of the Bay Area were able to move about freely , while " normal " commerce was blockaded .
Both the unemployed and the strikers had fruit and vegetables " at a time when money could not procure them . "
Upton Sinclair gives a fictionalized account in Co-op :
The cutting of wages and discharge of union workers brought its inevitable result ...
For a week the unions ran the town ...
They issued a list of restaurants which were allowed to remain open ; the hospitals and a few such institutions would be served ; everything else was blockaded ...
The Self - Help Exchange was of course on the white list .
There were numbers of unemployed teamsters and longshoremen who belonged to it , and all the trucks got permits and went freely through the picket lines .
They were hauling food for the workers ; and you may be sure their contact men were out picking up all the perishable stuff that was lying about ...
Everybody connected with the strike had bananas for breakfast , lunch and supper for several days .
And just as they were beginning to tire of them , came sauerkraut , barrels and barrels of it ; and then crates of lettuce , and sacks of sprouting onions and potatoes .
Can there be any doubt that those barrels came from the UXA kraut factory ?
The unions , like the co-ops , declined to get directly involved in EPIC in any major way , though Sinclair did have the support of the working as well as the " workless " , and offered them the thirty - hour week .
THE ELECTION
For his repression of the General Strike Republican Governor Frank Merriam suddenly became the darling of the reactionary right , who threw all their forses behind his re-election campaign .
In the end , Sinclair got almost 900,000 votes , 37 % , to Merriam 's 49 % , while a liberal third party candidate got the difference .
The EPIC uprising , even in electoral defeat , took much of the bite out of the state 's right wing for decades afterwards .
The reflection of many of EPIC 's proposals can be seen in later New Deal programs .
Sinclair went on to offer a national version of EPIC , win a Pulitzer Prize for fiction , and later be nominated for a Nobel Prize by a group that included Mahatma Gandhi , George Bernard Shaw , and Bertrand Russell .

CONSUMER CO-OPS
After the electoral defeat , EPIC leaders split on what to do next .
While Sinclair took off on a national speaking tour , a group led by Frank Taylor set up a Production for Use Committee and worked to turn the EPIC energy into a consumer co-op movement .
The consolidation of buying power would be a step to gaining control of the economy , they hoped .
A large number of EPIC groups planned buying clubs and stores ; by the next fall there were 210 consumer co-ops in California , with 50,000 members , almost all the groups newly organized .
Among the most successful at first were New Day Co-op in Oakland , with 1000 members , and Producers - Consumers Co-op at 668 Haight Street in San Francisco .
But these and the great majority of the others quickly collapsed .
Former members of New Day however became leaders in Pacific Cooperative Services , organized in 1936 .
In January of the next year they opened a tiny store , to which the Berkeley Co-op , with around 100,000 member families at its height , traced its central root .
WPA AND THE COLLAPSE OF SELF -HELP
The Works Progress Administration of 1935 , promising a cash job at a decent wage to every unemployed person able to work , undercut the entire Self - Help movement .
The government had cut off cash incomes for cooperators using FERA - funded production facilities , and now dropped the other shoe .
Members could not be in two places at once , and had to choose between the limitations of barter or an assured cash income .
The New Deal did not really want independent cooperatives as a permanent part of the economy ; Sinclair wound up calling WPA " that arch - enemy of self - help . "
Rhodehamel tried to prevent a mass exodus from the UXA by arguing that these government programs would be temporary and , if they let the UXA collapse , members would have no cooperative to come back to when WPA was shut down .
Nonetheless the exodus took place .
Hundreds of groups around the country collapsed .
The UXA , like the rest , found a sudden labor shortage , They now had difficulty delivering on work promised , and fell deeper and deeper into a hole .
Sinclair pleaded with Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins to no avail to let work in the cooperatives count as WPA hours .
This would have saved the co-ops .
As a last - ditch effort , the UXA sent Rutzebeck , their personnel director , to Washington to try to plead their case directly to FDR .
Rutzebeck describes the interview in a fictionalized account of the movement he later wrote , Hell 's Paradise , which covers much of the same area as Sinclair 's book Co-op .
( Sinclair made Rutzebeck the central character in Co-op , so Hjalmar wrote his own version in part to set the record straight . )
Even though FDR showed interest and openness , Rutzebeck knew that WPA director Hopkins was no longer favorable toward independent co-ops .
Hopkins was committed to the top - down centralized WPA bureaucratic approach .
Rutzebeck left the interview with Hopkins knowing that " the Relief Administrator would see to it that the papers on Reciprocal Economy were kept as far away as possible from the occupant of the White House . "
It is one of the little - known ironies of history that at the same time as Adolph Hitler was destroying the German cooperative movement with blood and fire ( as Mussolini had done earlier ) , Roosevelt was destroying the American movement with love .
PROBLEMS
The New Deal was far from the only problem of the Self - Help movement .
Besides the usual personality clashes and leadership disputes that are a fact of life in all organizations , especially democratic ones , the co-ops were beset by a number of particular difficulties .
In production - oriented groups , such as the UXA , productivity was an ongoing problem .
When they decided that all work would be worth the same on a time basis , they hoped that spirit and education would make up for the inevitable unproductive attitudes in same members .
Despite weekly classes , the UXA School of Reciprocal Economy was never able to overcome the " employee mentality " of some members , who tried to put in as many hours as possible with no care for productivity .
The result was the piling up of more points on the books than the organization had products to redeem them with .
This was a problem in all the groups that kept track of hours .
The southern co-ops which distributed " according to need " circumvented this problem on paper but in reality had a similar affliction .
The scrip exchanges were hit with particular severity , as the groups tended to issue too much and it quickly depreciated in value .
They were further hampered by a state law prohibiting scrip to be used in the payment of wages .
The field of scavenging operations of the co-ops became slowly diminished .
Their work eventually decreased the surplus products in their areas .
This was a natural and unavoidable process , as the depression was brought on in part by " over production , " and time depleted surpluses over a few years .
High turnover rate of younger members was a problem .
These tended to move on when they found job openings , while the older members , largely " unemployable , " tended to stay in the co-ops for the long run .
The result in some instances was a dearth of muscle power .
The median age of the UXA was 48 .
Many co-ops were " entered into " by members of radical groups who had little interest in the actual day - to - day work , but were there mainly in an attempt to turn the co-ops to political ends .
Since by their very nature co-ops have a radical aspect , this was inevitable ; many co-ops were founded by social revolutionaries .
Outsiders guilty of disruptive " entrism " were usually isolated and soon gone .
The attitude of the Communist Party of the time ( pre-Popular Front ) was that the co-ops and EPIC were not far enough " left ; " they attacked Sinclair continually during his campaign , while a short time later they were supporting people far to his right .

OSER PRICE
Oser Price was Coordinator of the Manufacturing section of the UXA from late in 1932 until the organization started to collapse in mid-1935 , He joined the UXA after having been laid off from his job as a tractor tool designer in June 1930 .
Born in northern California in 1900 , he was a Berkeley resident when I interviewed him in 1983 , a student of welding , and as vehement a proponent of cooperation and self - help as he was fifty years before .
Here are some of his thoughts about the UXA fifty years later :
" The Coordinating Assembly had a big round table - nobody was at the head .
There we held weekly brainstorming sessions .
We could solve some of the most difficult problems by everybody tossing in their ideas , no matter how wild they were , and we would come up with answers that would work .
" We were too busy scratching around getting all the things we needed to survive to have any sort of hassle .
" Initially the organization had no capital .
Member production generated most of it .
The accumulated capital would have formed the basis for ownership of natural resources had not member - created inflation intervened .
Timekilling caused fatal inflation .
Production was no longer the name of the game for many members .
" The thing that killed it was the cash flow from the WPA .
It drained off people who needed money - and everybody did need some .
People could n't be in both the UXA and in WPA at the same time .
Those who had to have cash took WPA .
Soon there were n't enough people available to make the UXA work .
" Consider this : socialism as far as absolute necessity goes , and free enterprise the rest of the way .
All of us work a certain amount of time or produce a certain amount , whatever it takes to produce a minimal survival : one - and - a - half , two , four hours a day , whatever it takes .
Beyond that everybody 's on his own , and can produce or make all he can .
That way you do n't squelch creativity or initiative .
To reduce bureaucracy to zero , you have to have as much as possible of what 's done and how it 's done in the hands of the people who are doing it .
" Worker ownership , that 's the key .
I do n't care how big the organization , if you have nothing but worker ownership , it 'll work .
" Franklin Roosevelt was criticized bitterly by business for instituting the relief programs , but he kept this country from going into a revolution , and a bloody one ...
Maybe it would have been good : we could have cleaned house on a lot of evils that were going on .
" As to the future , it can happen again if you make it happen ; it 's all up to you . "
THE PAST AND THE FUTURE
Although Roosevelt 's programs alleviated some of the problems of the depression , the " New " Deal turned out to be temporary , and California , like the nation , slumped back into lethargy as the late thirties progressed .
WPA ended , but the Self - Help movement did not revive , as the country and the world braced for war .
Rhodehamel , like many others , saw it coming , and felt that the movement would not revive until after it was over .
" But all wars end , and when this one is ended ... we or such as we shall proceed again . "
Finally World War II snapped the country and the economy out of the depression , created " full employment , " and gave birth to the mighty industrial machine that emerged at the war 's end .
By that time Rhodehamel and many of the others who made the movement were no longer with us , and the movement on which they pinned their hopes and dreams was but a faint memory in America 's mind .
If the government had not undercut the cooperatives , would they have become a permanent part of the economy ?
What if EPIC had won : could it have actually ended poverty and unemployment ?
Rather than speculate about what might have been , let us instead note that around us today is a situation in many ways reflecting that of 1932 , and consider what might yet be .
Rhodehamel stressed that a primary reason that cooperatives were needed was that a growing body of people were being permanently displaced by technological changes .
The ranks of the unemployed in the thirties , like today , were filled with highly trained and skilled people who would never find a job in their fields again , particularly middle - aged people .
Today that process has accelerated ; we are being told continually to prepare ourselves for a permanent situation of high unemployment .
As America changes from a production economy to a " service economy " and production shifts to multinational firms with factories in Asia , a " permanent " underclass of unemployed , underemployed , and never - employed is being formed .
Unemployed associations and self - help cooperatives are the natural organizational forms that spring from people in this situation , just as labor unions are natural for the employed .
Will the unemployed settle for " permanent unemployment " ?
Or might the unemployed rise again in a social movement ?
Could there be a new version of EPIC and the UXA ?
Perhaps the final curtain on the Self - help movement has not yet been dropped .

CHICAGO -- Chris Bosh 's agent has told the Toronto Raptors that he 's narrowed his list of preferred teams to five , two sources told ESPN.
com 's Chad Ford at the NBA draft camp .
The list of five teams -- Toronto plus the Chicago Bulls , Los Angeles Lakers , Miami Heat and New York Knicks , sources said -- was given to Toronto management in case the Raptors want to construct a sign - and - trade deal ( assuming Bosh does n't re-sign with Toronto ) .
Bosh likes that option , sources told Ford , because he'd get one more year on his contract and could make more money .
" It has been narrowed down to a handful of teams , including us , " Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo told the Toronto Star without providing more detail .
Sources said the Raptors prefer a sign - and - trade if Bosh is intent on leaving as well .
They likely would want a big man to replace the 6 - 10 , 230 - pound Bosh in the lineup .
One source said Bosh 's decision hinges on where LeBron James signs .
" If LeBron decides to go to either New York or Chicago , I think that 's where you 'll see Chris land , " the source told Ford .
" If LeBron stays in Cleveland , I think the process is more wide open . "
Bosh , 26 , is an unrestricted free agent .
He averaged 24 points per game last season and has averaged 20.2 points per game for his career .
Hockey fans in Carolina got some great news February 10th when it was announced that the Hurricanes ’ American Hockey League affiliate was moving to Charlotte .
The logic of the move was inescapable ; last August , Canes Country 's blogmeister Bob took a thoughtful ( and prescient ) look at the potential synergies in this post .
The excitement of what this new arrangement means for the teams and their fans is playing out now in the Checkers ’ offices on the 6th floor of a beautiful , historic building at 212 Tryon Street , a block or two away from the Time Warner Cable Arena , where the new and improved Charlotte Checkers will take the ice when the 2010 - 11 season opens in the fall .
It was my great privilege to sit down with Checkers COO Tera Black and Director of Media and Public Relations Mike Lappan last week at their offices in Charlotte .
They ( like many fans and followers ) are thrilled by what the future holds for hockey in Carolina and are brimming with enthusiasm as they devote this off - season to laying the groundwork for the transition .
After the jump , a snapshot of Charlotte hockey history , some events on tap this summer , and a preview of what we can look forward to next season , as the front office gets ready for the Checkers to make their debut in the American Hockey League .
And later this week , watch for my feature focusing on Tera Black 's unique window into the world of professional hockey .
[ UPDATE : Here 's the link to " Meet Tera Black : Charlotte Checkers Chief of Hockey " ]
Professional hockey is hardly new to Charlotte ; the roots of the Checkers reach back to the 1950s with the now - defunct Southern Hockey League , which lasted until the mid-70s
The team was re-born in 1993 as part of the ECHL , and was acquired by current owner Michael Kahn in 2006 ( Cory Lavalette did this 2 - part Q&A interview with Kahn in February , that is well worth checking out ) .
With the team enjoying the venue of the spacious ( capacity : 14,100 ) and sparkling TWC Arena downtown , the attendance numbers continued to grow steadily each season , crowds of nine or ten thousand becoming the standard for a Saturday night , with over twelve thousand fans packing the arena on occasion .
Yep , twelve thousand rockin ' the house for ECHL hockey .
I , for one , was impressed .
And it seems those Queen City fans are paying attention and are ready for more .
In the weeks following the announcement in February , Black described seeing the fans sporting Hurricanes attire throughout the arena at the Checkers games .
What ’s more , the fans were apparently googling the River Rats roster in Albany , and sporting Rats ' jerseys from those AHL players who will become the pride of the Checkers fans looking forward .
With the pool of talent in the Hurricanes organization that is arriving this summer , along with Coach Jeff Daniels and his staff , and frequent drop-ins by the Hurricanes ’ Ron Francis as Director of Player Development or Glen Wesley minding the young blueliners , it ’s safe to say those fans will be thrilled and entertained by the high caliber hockey coming to town .
The Hurricanes GM Jim Rutherford said in his season - ending press conference that he intends to take full advantage of the proximity of the farm team to develop the young , smart and talented players in the system , tapping the top prospects on short notice to join the Big League action with the NHL team in Raleigh .
Expect the rosters to be fluid and intermingled , especially in the first half of the season .
A Mission
How did the following of a lower - level minor league hockey team in " the South " get to be so large and , equally as important , so loyal ?
This is where the vision of owner Michael Kahn and his front office master of all - things - hockey , Tera Black , become the story .
For Kahn and Black , it ’s about " Building the Community " , and they back those words with the money , attention and energy that they pour back into the Charlotte Metro region .
Black , who describes the owner as " under the radar " in his presence running the team , elaborated with heartfelt pride on their team ’s " mission " :
" Michael Kahn wants us to utilize this team as a resource to build this community .
Really , that was his initiative when he bought the team . "
In the four years since he acquired the Checkers in 2006 and Tera Black arrived ( later promoted in 2008 to run the show ) , she explains , " we took our community perspective and our relationship with the Charlotte Metro region and escalated it significantly ; and in that time we donated … close to $ 2 million back to the community . "
She continued , " The last four seasons have been a mission ; it ’s a belief , really .
We believe first , that we take care of the people who surround us and come to our games , and then the rest follows .
And if you look at our history , we ’ve had some amazing nights .
… If you 're going to expect [ the community 's ] support you really need to support them first .
We get 10,000 people coming in for this and the energy in there is wicked .
It ’s just unbelievable . "
From all accounts , it is a formula for success benefiting all involved .
At this point in the conversation , both Black and Lappan immediately recalled the name of Ellie Potvin , a young girl whose cause evokes a most vivid and touching example of Checkers hockey supporting a local child , transforming a life , and carrying their team .
Eight - year - old Ellie Potvin , who has been fighting a rare form of cancer since the age of six , is supported by a charitable effort called " Lift up Ellie " which the Checkers have been part of for the last two seasons .
More than a slogan , the players all met her and followed her story and progress , wearing pink butterfly stickers on their helmets to reinforce the connection .
In a game played this past March 28th against the Reading Royals , the strength of the relationship played out emotionally in front of the crowd during an intense 5 - round shootout .
In the Sunday matinee game dedicated to the cause of " Lift up Ellie " , the Checkers ’ leading goal - scorer , rookie winger Andrew Carroll , was next up for the home team .
With the game on his stick , Carroll skated in with a special purpose in mind and beat the Royals ' goalie , winning the game for the Checkers .
The crowd went wild .
Lappan ( a native of Ontario who also serves as the front office ’s unofficial in - house Canadian guru of Hockey Culture ) picked it up there :
" So it was one of those things where after you saw it happen , you know that [ Carroll ] was thinking about her before he scored .
So that , after he scored , he went to spin around on the glass and then bolt straight across the ice , diagonally , right to where she [ Ellie ] was sitting .
And it was pretty much like ‘ that was for you ’ and then all the team met him there .
It was just like .... " and Lappan dabbed his eyes to describe the emotion in the arena at that moment .
He was quick to get me the youtube link too – if you go to the closing moments ( beginning at 2:45 ) you can watch it unfold .
Bring a tissue .
As Black aptly summarized the Checkers ' track record for success , " People are coming to our games because of the event we ’re throwing , and they come to love hockey because they see it . "
This is the Checkers tradition upon which they intend to build .
So , Carolina hockey fans , what ’s next ?
Look for a series of summer events that are part of these Community Initiatives that are jointly sponsored with the Hurricanes organization in Raleigh .
Doug Warf , well - known among the Triangle 's hockey faithful for his strong and caring leadership of the Canes ’ Kids 'N Community Foundation , has been active in his support of the new Checkers ' efforts and Black is excited by the synergy that is coming from the relationship .
" Yes , in fact we ’re groundbreaking in our affiliation with the Hurricanes , " said Black .
Beyond the hockey , " there is a marketing affiliation that is largely based on the community initiatives that we ’re going to establish together .
" You ’ll see several programs rolling out over the summer that are based on those initiatives .
Things going into the Charlotte / Mecklenburg schools that are similar to the Raleigh area …. things we would not have been able to do without this relationship : education , non-profits , youth hockey .
Doug has been instrumental , asking our staff : ' How can we help ? '
With strength in numbers , we will have a much bigger impact . "
A few other events on the Checkers Summer 2010 calendar :
th , watching together as the NHL franchises make their selections in Los Angeles .
The Hurricanes are slated for the 7th overall pick , but A NHL Entry Draft Party for " Hockey 's Future " devotees on June 25 , watching together as the NHL franchises make their selections in Los Angeles .
The Hurricanes are slated for the 7th overall pick , but that could change
Announcement of joint ticket packages together with the Hurricanes ; they ’ll include tickets to a " handful of games " for both the teams and will have an option of bus transportation between the cities .
I got a sneak preview of the Home and Away design which will not vary much from those worn by the River Rats , with the Checkers ' Introduction of the re-designed Checkers ’ jerseys and logos .
I got a sneak preview of the Home and Away design which will not vary much from those worn by the River Rats , with the Checkers ' Polar Bear now taking the place of honor on the front , and a red , black and white color scheme .
The totally new look " Third Jersey " is a closely - guarded secret still , but I can tell you Black was all smiles when she referred to it .
( Hockeymom is thinking retro , with laced - up neck , maybe .
You may want to wait to pick out your jersey till you know all your options . )
Hockeytown Detroit , whom I also met at the Checkers offices .
Both Black and Lappan were very quick to assure me that Shaya is " really good " with heads nodding in unison to emphasize their point .
They are currently working through details of having the radio broadcasts carried by a Raleigh station , as well as through the Charlotte airwaves ( with online streaming as well ) , to expand the team 's reach to a statewide audience .
Announcements regarding broadcast agreements on radio , with the addition of broadcaster Jason Shaya , a native of Detroit , whom I also met at the Checkers offices .
Both Black and Lappan were very quick to assure me that Shaya is " good " with heads nodding in unison to emphasize their point .
They are currently working through details of having the radio broadcasts carried by a Raleigh station , as well as through the Charlotte airwaves ( with online streaming as well ) , to expand the team 's reach to a statewide audience .
Not satisfied , and knowing you 'd want more , I asked about TV coverage .
Black said she was in fact " optimistic " , though nothing is official , that " we ’ll have games televised .
We plan to start small , do at least one game a month and grow it from there . "
That 's a big improvement from the effort required to see the prospects take the ice in Albany last year , no ?
The schedule , tickets and fan promotions
The game schedule will be announced following the AHL Annual Meeting in Hilton Head , SC , July 3 - 8 .
Coming with this , we can expect to see a re-alignment of teams across the AHL ’s four divisions .
With the addition of the Oklahoma City Barons , there are , for the first time , thirty teams corresponding to the thirty NHL teams .
Add in the relocation of Albany to Charlotte , and almost - officially Lowell to Albany , the necessity is obvious .
As Checkers ' COO and Alternate Governor , Black will be involved in the discussions in July .
This spring , she attended American League meetings in Chicago and has enjoyed the support and guidance of League President Dave Andrews during the transition , speaking highly of his leadership in growing the quality and success of American League hockey .
Once the game schedule is known , individual game tickets will be available .
Black used the descriptor " satellite " to characterize her new AHL outpost in Carolina , well outside the northeastern US core occupied by most other AHL Eastern Conference teams .
With the Norfolk ( VA ) Admirals as the closest team on the map , she anticipates that the Checkers and Admirals will be grouped in the same division as southeastern rivals .
Beyond that , we can expect the Checkers ’ schedule ( which is also contingent on that of the NBA ’s Bobcats as the # 1 tenant at TWC Arena ) to have longer road trips .
Ideally , the team will fly to a region and travel to a number of games in that vicinity via bus .
On the flip side , we should see longer homestands , where an opponent may arrive in Charlotte and play a 3 - game series over a long weekend .
The Checkers will offer special packages for such weekends , which will include a hotel option for those who would like to enjoy the entire mini-series in Charlotte ’s upscale yet family - friendly downtown .
( I ’m thinking the Hershey Bears are ripe for that sort of offer .
Imagine these Checkers exacting revenge for that second - round sweep this post - season , this time with 12,000 Carolina fans cheering them on ) .
They also are hopeful that the Hurricanes and Checkers home game schedule will dovetail rather than overlap , allowing hockey fans in Carolina to have an almost continuous supply of home games they can attend .
I like how they think .
( At this point , they may have realized they were preaching to the choir .
So much for my attempts at journalistic objectivity . )
When it comes to ticket pricing , the Checkers ’ mantra will continue to be : " We are the most affordable sports entertainment option in town " .
And here 's why : the city of Charlotte offers many more choices than we have here in the Triangle for professional sports , with the NFL , NBA and NASCAR all vying for attention and family budget dollars .
Black reiterated that it is part of Kahn 's commitment , even in a tough economy , " that everyone can enjoy the game that he has worked so hard to grow . "
Full - season ticket packages ( forty games ) start at $ 400 in the lower bowl ( not surprisingly , those $ 200 seats have sold out ) .
The 10 - and 20 - game Mini- packages are similarly affordable .
Black was proud to tell me that since season tickets went on sale in March , the response has been " phenomenal " ; in only two months , sales have " already eclipsed total sales for all of last season " .
The players
When I asked , neither Black nor Lappan were aware if any players from Albany had independently made the trip to Charlotte yet , to scope out the arena or begin to look for housing .
From their contacts with the team this spring , they said that the players are excited about the relocation to the bustling city , which offers so much to young people and their families .
( Walking through the active urban neighborhood surrounding the TWC , we joked that they may have " issues " to address this fall due to the very natural attraction of twenty - somethings to Charlotte 's Uptown district . )
During the conversation , it was my impression that regarding the 2010 - 11 Checkers players , a few of us puckheads here at Canes Country just might have better insight to their stats and stories than Black does at present .
But I am confident that will change by October , once the guys arrive and Black turns her attention from the Community Initiatives , Re-branding , and American League coordination to learning about these players who will live and play in her slice of Southern hockey heaven .
With the parent team only 2 + hours ' drive away , the Checkers organization will , for the first time , be able to focus on the players as individuals as they introduce and present the new team to the community .
Whether Zach Boychuk , Drayson Bowman , Jared Staal , or Justin Peters ( and maybe a half dozen others we could argue about ) are playing at the AHL or NHL level , they ’ll always be nearby and visible to their fans .
Black says her marketing staff is looking forward to the opportunity and options available when they showcase the talents of the young prospects who skate in the Carolina system .
More specifically , as we wrapped up , I was told to be sure I mentioned this : " There will be bobbleheads . "

​ Two Vancouver MPs are criticizing a decision to support the extradition of marijuana activist Marc Emery , the self - styled “ Prince of Pot , ” to the United States .
Emery was arrested in 2005 as part of a joint Canada - United States law enforcement operation .
He was charged in connection with an alleged online marijuana seed - selling business based in Vancouver , British Columbia , reports Stephen Thomson at the Vancouver
The Prince of Pot has been out on bail for the past six months .
With the period of his release expiring , Emery surrendered himself to authorities Monday at the Vancouver courts .
​ Emery kissed his crying wife , Jodie , goodbye as he handed himself over to Sheriffs at the Vancouver Law Courts .
He also hugged and thanked his supporters .
Emery , 51 , now faces a five - year U.S. prison sentence under the terms of his agreement with American prosecutors last year .
Justice Minister Robert Nicholson has reportedly approved an extradition order .
Nicholson ’s decision has already come under fire from NDP MP Libby Davies and Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh .
Both MPs presented a 12,000 - signature petition earlier this year in the House of Commons opposing Emery ’s extradition .
“ It ’s about Canadian sovereignty , ” said Davies .
“ Why would we cart off a Canadian to serve time in America for something he would n’t have been charged with in Canada ?
Now what we ’re left with is trying to press that he at least be allowed to serve his time in Canada . ”
Dosanjh said Emery faces a “ disproportionate sentence that he would n’t have received in Canada . ”
“ I believe in that case we as a country should ensure that he ’s at least able to serve his sentence in a Canadian prison , ” Dosanjh said .
“ He ’s not a dangerous offender . ”
“ If he sends me away , it will anger millions of Americans and millions of Canadians , Emery said Monday .
“ I need them to be angry , otherwise we wo n’t get any change in this drug war . ”
Emery has said previously that he made the plea agreement with U.S. prosecutors so that his two co-accused Cannabis Culture employees — Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams — would each be given two years ’ probation and to avoid a criminal trial that could have resulted in a 50 - year prison sentence .
Demon Sheep II - The Fleecing of California
As political ads go this one should win an academy award .
It is brilliant and guaranteed to terrify .
Remember the Demon Sheep is the only successful predator of the Hypnotoad .

Alibi for militarist interventions , sacralization for the tyranny of the market , ideological foundation for the fundamentalism of the politically correct : can the ‘ symbolic fiction ’ of universal rights be recuperated for the progressive politicization of actual socio-economic relations ?
SLAVOJ ŽIŽEK AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS
Contemporary appeals to human rights within our liberal - capitalist societies generally rest upon three assumptions .
First , that such appeals function in opposition to modes of fundamentalism that would naturalize or essentialize contingent , historically conditioned traits .
Second , that the two most basic rights are freedom of choice , and the right to dedicate one ’s life to the pursuit of pleasure ( rather than to sacrifice it for some higher ideological cause ) .
And third , that an appeal to human rights may form the basis for a defence against the ‘ excess of power ’ .
Let us begin with fundamentalism .
Here , the evil ( to paraphrase Hegel ) often dwells in the gaze that perceives it .
Take the Balkans during the 1990s , the site of widespread human - rights violations .
At what point did the Balkans — a geographical region of South - Eastern Europe — become ‘ Balkan ’ , with all that designates for the European ideological imaginary today ?
The answer is : the mid-19th century , just as the Balkans were being fully exposed to the effects of European modernization .
The gap between earlier Western European perceptions and the ‘ modern ’ image is striking .
Already in the 16th century the French naturalist Pierre Belon could note that ‘ the Turks force no one to live like a Turk ’ .
Small surprise , then , that so many Jews found asylum and religious freedom in Turkey and other Muslim countries after Ferdinand and Isabella had expelled them from Spain in 1492 — with the result that , in a supreme twist of irony , Western travellers were disturbed by the public presence of Jews in big Turkish cities .
Here , from a long series of examples , is a report from N. Bisani , an Italian who visited Istanbul in 1788 :
A stranger , who has beheld the intolerance of London and Paris , must be much surprised to see a church here between a mosque and a synagogue , and a dervish by the side of a Capuchin friar .
I know not how this government can have admitted into its bosom religions so opposite to its own .
It must be from degeneracy of Mahommedanism , that this happy contrast can be produced .
What is still more astonishing is to find that this spirit of toleration is generally prevalent among the people ; for here you see Turks , Jews , Catholics , Armenians , Greeks and Protestants conversing together on subjects of business or pleasure with as much harmony and goodwill as if they were of the same country and religion . [ 1 ]
The very feature that the West today celebrates as the sign of its cultural superiority — the spirit and practice of multicultural tolerance — is thus dismissed as an effect of Islamic ‘ degeneracy ’ .
The strange fate of the Trappist monks of Etoile Marie is equally telling .
Expelled from France by the Napoleonic regime , they settled in Germany , but were driven out in 1868 .
Since no other Christian state would take them , they asked the Sultan ’s permission to buy land near Banja Luka , in the Serb part of today ’s Bosnia , where they lived happily ever after — until they got caught in the Balkan conflicts between Christians .
Where , then , did the fundamentalist features — religious intolerance , ethnic violence , fixation upon historical trauma — which the West now associates with ‘ the Balkan ’ , originate ?
Clearly , from the West itself .
In a neat instance of Hegel ’s ‘ reflexive determination ’ , what Western Europeans observe and deplore in the Balkans is what they themselves introduced there ; what they combat is their own historical legacy run amok .
Let us not forget that the two great ethnic crimes imputed to the Turks in the 20th century — the Armenian genocide and the persecution of the Kurds — were not committed by traditionalist Muslim political forces , but by the military modernizers who sought to cut Turkey loose from its old - world ballast and turn it into a European nation - state .
Mladen Dolar ’s old quip , based on a detailed reading of Freud ’s references to the region , that the European unconscious is structured like the Balkans , is thus literally true : in the guise of the Otherness of ‘ Balkan ’ , Europe takes cognizance of the ‘ stranger in itself ’ , of its own repressed .
But we might also examine the ways in which the ‘ fundamentalist ’ essentialization of contingent traits is itself a feature of liberal - capitalist democracy .
It is fashionable to complain that private life is threatened or even disappearing , in face of the media ’s ability to expose one ’s most intimate personal details to the public .
True , on condition that we turn things around : what is effectively disappearing here is public life itself , the public sphere proper , in which one operates as a symbolic agent who cannot be reduced to a private individual , to a bundle of personal attributes , desires , traumas and idiosyncrasies .
The ‘ risk society ’ commonplace — according to which the contemporary individual experiences himself as thoroughly ‘ denaturalized ’ , regarding even his most ‘ natural ’ traits , from ethnic identity to sexual preference , as being chosen , historically contingent , learned — is thus profoundly deceiving .
What we are witnessing today is the opposite process : an unprecedented re-naturalization .
All big ‘ public issues ’ are now translated into attitudes towards the regulation of ‘ natural ’ or ‘ personal ’ idiosyncrasies .
This explains why , at a more general level , pseudo - naturalized ethno- religious conflicts are the form of struggle which best suits global capitalism .
In the age of ‘ post - politics ’ , when politics proper is progressively replaced by expert social administration , the sole remaining legitimate sources of conflict are cultural ( religious ) or natural ( ethnic ) tensions .
And ‘ evaluation ’ is precisely the regulation of social promotion that fits with this re-naturalization .
Perhaps the time has come to reassert , as the truth of evaluation , the perverted logic to which Marx refers ironically in his description of commodity fetishism , quoting Dogberry ’s advice to Seacoal at the end of Capital ’s Chapter 1 : ‘ To be a well - favoured man is the gift of fortune ; but to write and read comes by nature . ’
To be a computer expert or a successful manager is a gift of nature today , but lovely lips or eyes are a fact of culture .
Unfreedom of choice
As to freedom of choice : I have written elsewhere of the pseudo - choice offered to the adolescents of Amish communities who , after the strictest of upbringings , are invited at the age of seventeen to plunge themselves into every excess of contemporary capitalist culture — a whirl of fast cars , wild sex , drugs , drink and so forth . [ 2 ]
After a couple of years , they are allowed to choose whether they want to return to the Amish way .
Since they have been brought up in virtual ignorance of American society , the youngsters are quite unprepared to cope with such permissiveness , which in most cases generates a backlash of unbearable anxiety .
The vast majority vote to return to the seclusion of their communities .
This is a perfect case of the difficulties that invariably accompany ‘ freedom of choice ’ : while Amish children are formally given a free choice , the conditions in which they must make it render the choice unfree .
The problem of pseudo - choice also demonstrates the limitations of the standard liberal attitude towards Muslim women who wear the veil : acceptable if it is their own free choice rather than imposed on them by husbands or family .
However , the moment a woman dons the veil as the result of personal choice , its meaning changes completely : it is no longer a sign of belonging to the Muslim community , but an expression of idiosyncratic individuality .
In other words , a choice is always a meta- choice , a choice of the modality of the choice itself : it is only the woman who does not choose to wear a veil that effectively chooses a choice .
This is why , in our secular liberal democracies , people who maintain a substantial religious allegiance are in a subordinate position : their faith is ‘ tolerated ’ as their own personal choice , but the moment they present it publicly as what it is for them — a matter of substantial belonging — they stand accused of ‘ fundamentalism ’ .
Plainly , the ‘ subject of free choice ’ , in the ‘ tolerant ’ , multicultural sense , can only emerge as the result of an extremely violent process of being uprooted from one ’s particular life - world .
The material force of the ideological notion of ‘ free choice ’ within capitalist democracy was well illustrated by the fate of the Clinton Administration ’s ultra-modest health reform programme .
The medical lobby ( twice as strong as the infamous defence lobby ) succeeded in imposing on the public the idea that universal healthcare would somehow threaten freedom of choice in that domain .
Against this conviction , all enumeration of ‘ hard facts ’ proved ineffective .
We are here at the very nerve - centre of liberal ideology : freedom of choice , grounded in the notion of the ‘ psychological ’ subject , endowed with propensities which he or she strives to realize .
And this especially holds today , in the era of a ‘ risk society ’ in which the ruling ideology endeavours to sell us the very insecurities caused by the dismantling of the welfare state as the opportunity for new freedoms .
If labour flexibilization means you have to change jobs every year , why not see it as a liberation from the constraints of a permanent career , a chance to reinvent yourself and realize the hidden potential of your personality ?
If there is a shortfall on your standard health insurance and retirement plan , meaning you have to opt for extra coverage , why not perceive it as an additional opportunity to choose : either a better lifestyle now or long - term security ?
Should this predicament cause you anxiety , the ‘ second modernity ’ ideologist will diagnose you as desiring to ‘ escape from freedom ’ , of an immature sticking to old stable forms .
Even better , when this is inscribed into the ideology of the subject as the ‘ psychological ’ individual , pregnant with natural abilities , you will automatically tend to interpret all these changes as the outcome of your personality , not as the result of being thrown around by market forces .
Politics of jouissance
What of the basic right to the pursuit of pleasure ?
Today ’s politics is ever more concerned with ways of soliciting or controlling jouissance .
The opposition between the liberal - tolerant West and fundamentalist Islam is most often condensed as that between , on the one side , a woman ’s right to free sexuality , including the freedom to display or expose herself and to provoke or disturb men ; and , on the other side , desperate male attempts to suppress or control this threat .
( The Taliban forbade metal - tipped heels for women , as the tapping sounds coming from beneath an all - concealing burka might have an overpowering erotic appeal . )
Both sides , of course , mystify their position ideologically and morally .
For the West , women ’s right to expose themselves provocatively to male desire is legitimized as their right to enjoy their bodies as they please .
For Islam , the control of female sexuality is legitimized as the defence of women ’s dignity against their being reduced to objects of male exploitation .
So when the French state prohibits Muslim girls from wearing the veil in school , one can claim that they are thus enabled to dispose of their bodies as they wish .
But one can also argue that the true traumatic point for critics of Muslim ‘ fundamentalism ’ was that there were women who did not participate in the game of making their bodies available for sexual seduction , or for the social exchange and circulation involved in this .
In one way or another , all the other issues — gay marriage and adoption , abortion , divorce — relate to this .
What the two poles share is a strict disciplinary approach , differently directed : ‘ fundamentalists ’ regulate female self - presentation to forestall sexual provocation ; pc feminist liberals impose a no-less - severe regulation of behaviour aimed at containing forms of harassment .
Liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness , openness to it , and an obsessive fear of harassment .
In short , the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive , insofar as it is not really the other .
Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite .
My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her , not intrude into his space — in short , that I should respect his intolerance towards my over - proximity .
This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society : the right not to be ‘ harassed ’ , that is , to be kept at a safe distance from others .
The same goes for the emergent logic of humanitarian or pacifist militarism .
War is acceptable insofar as it seeks to bring about peace , or democracy , or the conditions for distributing humanitarian aid .
And does the same not hold even more for democracy and human rights themselves ?
Human rights are ok if they are ‘ rethought ’ to include torture and a permanent emergency state .
Democracy is ok if it is cleansed of its populist excesses and limited to those mature enough to practise it .
Caught in the vicious cycle of the imperative of jouissance , the temptation is to opt for what appears its ‘ natural ’ opposite , the violent renunciation of jouissance .
This is perhaps the underlying motif of all so - called fundamentalisms — the endeavour to contain ( what they perceive as ) the excessive ‘ narcissistic hedonism ’ of contemporary secular culture with a call to reintroduce the spirit of sacrifice .
A psychoanalytic perspective immediately enables us to see why such an endeavour goes wrong .
The very gesture of casting away enjoyment — ‘ Enough of decadent self - indulgence !
Renounce and purify !’— produces a surplus - enjoyment of its own .
Do not all ‘ totalitarian ’ universes which demand of their subjects a violent ( self - ) sacrifice to the cause exude the bad smell of a fascination with a lethal - obscene jouissance ?
Conversely , a life oriented towards the pursuit of pleasure will entail the harsh discipline of a ‘ healthy lifestyle ’— jogging , dieting , mental relaxation — if it is to be enjoyed to the maximum .
The superego injunction to enjoy oneself is immanently intertwined with the logic of sacrifice .
The two form a vicious cycle , each extreme supporting the other .
The choice is never simply between doing one ’s duty or striving for pleasure and satisfaction .
This elementary choice is always redoubled by a further one , between elevating one ’s striving for pleasure into one ’s supreme duty , and doing one ’s duty not for duty ’s sake but for the gratification it brings .
In the first case , pleasures are my duty , and the ‘ pathological ’ striving for pleasure is located in the formal space of duty .
In the second case , duty is my pleasure , and doing my duty is located in the formal space of ‘ pathological ’ satisfactions .
Defence against power ?
But if human rights as opposition to fundamentalism and as pursuit of happiness lead us into intractable contradictions , are they not after all a defence against the excess of power ?
Marx formulated the strange logic of power as ‘ in excess ’ by its very nature in his analyses of 1848 .
In The Eighteenth Brumaire and The Class Struggles in France , he ‘ complicated ’ in a properly dialectical way the logic of social representation ( political agents representing economic classes and forces ) .
In doing so , he went much further than the usual notion of these ‘ complications ’ , according to which political representation never directly mirrors social structure — a single political agent can represent different social groups , for instance ; or a class can renounce its direct representation and leave to another the job of securing the politico - juridical conditions of its rule , as the English capitalist class did by leaving to the aristocracy the exercise of political power .
Marx ’s analyses pointed towards what Lacan would articulate , more than a century later , as the ‘ logic of the signifier ’ .
Apropos the Party of Order , formed after the defeat of the June insurrection , Marx wrote that only after Louis - Napoleon ’s December 10 election victory allowed it to ‘ cast off ’ its coterie of bourgeois republicans
was the secret of its existence , the coalition of Orléanists and Legitimists into one party , disclosed .
The bourgeois class fell apart into two big factions which alternately — the big landed proprietors under the restored monarchy and the finance aristocracy and the industrial bourgeoisie under the July Monarchy — had maintained a monopoly of power .
Bourbon was the royal name for the predominant influence of the interests of the one faction , Orléans the royal name for the predominant influence of the interests of the other faction — the nameless realm of the republic was the only one in which both factions could maintain with equal power the common class interest without giving up their mutual rivalry . [ 3 ]
This , then , is the first complication .
When we are dealing with two or more socio- economic groups , their common interest can only be represented in the guise of the negation of their shared premise : the common denominator of the two royalist factions is not royalism , but republicanism .
( Just as today , the only political agent that consistently represents the interests of capital as such , in its universality , above particular factions , is the ‘ social liberal ’
Third Way . )
Then , in The Eighteenth Brumaire , Marx dissected the makeup of the Society of December 10 , Louis - Napoleon ’s private army of thugs :
Alongside decayed roués with dubious means of subsistence and of dubious origin , alongside ruined and adventurous offshoots of the bourgeoisie , were vagabonds , discharged soldiers , discharged jailbirds , escaped galley slaves , swindlers , mountebanks , lazzaroni , pickpockets , tricksters , gamblers , maquereaux [ pimps ] , brothel - keepers , porters , literati , organ - grinders , rag - pickers , knife - grinders , tinkers , beggars — in short , the whole indefinite , disintegrated mass , thrown hither and thither , which the French call la bohème ; from this kindred element Bonaparte formed the core of the Society of December 10 . . .
This Bonaparte , who constitutes himself chief of the lumpen proletariat , who here alone rediscovers in mass form the interests which he personally pursues , who recognizes in this scum , offal , refuse of all classes the only class upon which he can base himself unconditionally , is the real Bonaparte , the Bonaparte sans phrases . [ 4 ]
The logic of the Party of Order is here brought to its radical conclusion .
In the same way that the only common denominator of all royalist factions is republicanism , the only common denominator of all classes is the excremental excess , the refuse , the remainder , of all classes .
That is to say , insofar as the leader perceives himself as standing above class interests , his immediate class base can only be the excremental remainder of all classes , the rejected non-class of each class .
And , as Marx develops in another passage , it is this support from the ‘ social abject ’ which enables Bonaparte to shift his position as required , representing in turn each class against the others .
As the executive authority which has made itself independent , Bonaparte feels it to be his task to safeguard ‘ bourgeois order ’ .
But the strength of this bourgeois order lies in the middle class .
He poses , therefore , as the representative of the middle class and issues decrees in this sense .
Nevertheless , he is somebody solely because he has broken the power of that middle class , and keeps on breaking it daily .
He poses , therefore , as the opponent of the political and literary power of the middle class . [ 5 ]
But there is more .
In order for this system to function — that is , for the leader to stand above classes and not to act as a direct representative of any one class — he also has to act as the representative of one particular class : of the class which , precisely , is not sufficiently constituted to act as a united agent demanding active representation .
This class of people who cannot represent themselves and can thus only be represented is , of course , the class of small - holding peasants , who
form a vast mass , the members of which live in similar conditions but without entering into manifold relations with one other .
Their mode of production isolates them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse . . .
They are consequently incapable of enforcing their class interests in their own name , whether through a parliament or through a convention .
They cannot represent themselves , they must be represented .
Their representative must at the same time appear as their master , as an authority over them , as an unlimited governmental power that protects them against the other classes and sends them rain and sunshine from above .
The political influence of the small - holding peasants , therefore , finds its final expression in the executive power subordinating society to itself . [ 6 ]
These three features together form the paradoxical structure of populist - Bonapartist representation : standing above all classes , shifting among them , involves a direct reliance on the abject / remainder of all classes , plus the ultimate reference to the class of those who are unable to act as a collective agent demanding political representation .
This paradox is grounded in the constitutive excess of representation over the represented .
At the level of the law , the state power merely represents the interests of its subjects ; it serves them , is responsible to them , and is itself subject to their control .
However , at the level of the superego underside , the public message of responsibility is supplemented by the obscene message of the unconditional exercise of power : ‘ Laws do not really bind me , I can do to you whatever I want , I can treat you as guilty if I decide to do so , I can destroy you on a whim ’ .
This obscene excess is a necessary constituent of the notion of sovereignty .
The asymmetry here is structural : the law can only sustain its authority if subjects hear in it the echo of the obscene , unconditional self - assertion of power .
This excess of power brings us to the ultimate argument against ‘ big ’ political interventions which aim at global transformation : the terrifying experiences of the 20th century , a series of catastrophes which precipitated disastrous violence on an unprecedented scale .
There are three main theorizations of these catastrophes .
First , the view epitomized by the name of Habermas : Enlightenment is in itself a positive , emancipatory process with no inherent ‘ totalitarian ’ potential ; the catastrophes that have occurred merely indicate that it remains an unfinished project , and our task should be to bring this project to completion .
Second , the view associated with Adorno and Horkheimer ’s Dialectic of Enlightenment and , today , with Agamben .
The ‘ totalitarian ’ bent of Enlightenment is inherent and definitive , the ‘ administered world ’ is its true consequence , and concentration camps and genocides are a kind of negative - teleological endpoint of the entire history of the West .
Third , the view developed in the works of Etienne Balibar , among others : modernity opens up a field of new freedoms , but at the same time of new dangers , and there is no ultimate teleological guarantee of the outcome .
The contest remains open and undecided .
The starting point of Balibar ’s text on violence is the insufficiency of the standard Hegelian - Marxist notion of ‘ converting ’ violence into an instrument of historical Reason , a force which begets a new social formation . [ 7 ]
The ‘ irrational ’ brutality of violence is thus aufgehoben , ‘ sublated ’ in the strict Hegelian sense , reduced to a particular ‘ stain ’ that contributes to the overall harmony of historical progress .
The 20th century confronted us with catastrophes — some directed against Marxist political forces , others generated by Marxist engagement itself — which cannot be ‘ rationalized ’ in this way .
Their instrumentalization into the tools of the Cunning of Reason is not only ethically unacceptable but also theoretically wrong , ideological in the strongest sense of the term .
In his close reading of Marx , Balibar nonetheless discerns an oscillation between this teleological ‘ conversion - theory ’ of violence , and a much more interesting notion of history as an open - ended process of antagonistic struggles , whose final ‘ positive ’ outcome is not guaranteed by any encompassing historical necessity .
Balibar argues that , for necessary structural reasons , Marxism is unable to think the excess of violence that cannot be integrated into the narrative of historical Progress .
More specifically , it cannot provide an adequate theory of fascism and Stalinism and their ‘ extreme ’ outcomes , Shoah and Gulag .
Our task is therefore twofold : to deploy a theory of historical violence as something which cannot be instrumentalized by any political agent , which threatens to engulf this agent itself in a self - destructive vicious cycle ; and also to pose the question of how to turn the revolutionary process itself into a civilizing force .
As a counter - example , take the process that led to the St Bartholomew ’s Day Massacre .
Catherine de Medici ’s goal was limited and precise : hers was a Machiavellian plot to assassinate Admiral de Coligny — a powerful Protestant pushing for war with Spain in the Netherlands — and let the blame fall on the over - mighty Catholic family of de Guise .
Thus Catherine sought to engineer the fall of both the houses that posed a menace to the unity of the French state .
But the bid to play her enemies off against each other degenerated into an uncontrolled frenzy of blood .
In her ruthless pragmatism , Catherine was blind to the passion with which men clung to their beliefs .
Hannah Arendt ’s insights are crucial here , emphasizing the distinction between political power and the mere exercise of violence .
Organizations run by direct non-political authority — Army , Church , school — represent examples of violence ( Gewalt ) , not of political power in the strict sense of the term . [ 8 ]
At this point , however , we need to recall the distinction between the public , symbolic law and its obscene supplement .
The notion of the obscene double - supplement of power implies that there is no power without violence .
Political space is never ‘ pure ’ but always involves some kind of reliance on pre-political violence .
Of course , the relationship between political power and pre-political violence is one of mutual implication .
Not only is violence the necessary supplement of power , but power itself is always - already at the root of every apparently ‘ non-political ’ relationship of violence .
The accepted violence and direct relationship of subordination within the Army , Church , family and other ‘ non-political ’ social forms is in itself the reification of a certain ethico - political struggle .
The task of critical analysis is to discern the hidden political process that sustains all these ‘ non ’ or ‘ pre’- political relationships .
In human society , the political is the encompassing structuring principle , so that every neutralization of some partial content as ‘ non- political ’ is a political gesture par excellence .
Humanitarian purity
It is within this context that we can situate the most salient human rights issue : the rights of those who are starving or exposed to murderous violence .
Rony Brauman , who co-ordinated aid to Sarajevo , has demonstrated how the very presentation of the crisis there as ‘ humanitarian ’ , the very recasting of a political - military conflict into humanitarian terms , was sustained by an eminently political choice — basically , to take the Serb side in the conflict .
The celebration of ‘ humanitarian intervention ’ in Yugoslavia took the place of a political discourse , Brauman argues , thus disqualifying in advance all conflicting debate . [ 9 ]
From this particular insight we may problematize , at a general level , the ostensibly depoliticized politics of human rights as the ideology of military interventionism serving specific economico - political ends .
As Wendy Brown has suggested apropos Michael Ignatieff , such humanitarianism
presents itself as something of an anti-politics , a pure defence of the innocent and the powerless against power , a pure defence of the individual against immense and potentially cruel or despotic machineries of culture , state , war , ethnic conflict , tribalism , patriarchy , and other mobilizations or instantiations of collective power against individuals . [ 10 ]
However , the question is : what kind of politicization do those who intervene on behalf of human rights set in motion against the powers they oppose ?
Do they stand for a different formulation of justice , or do they stand in opposition to collective justice projects ?
For example , it is clear that the us-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein , legitimized in terms of ending the suffering of the Iraqi people , was not only motivated by hard - headed politico - economic interests but also relied on a determinate idea of the political and economic conditions under which ‘ freedom ’ was to be delivered to the Iraqi people : liberal - democratic capitalism , insertion into the global market economy , etc .
The purely humanitarian , anti-political politics of merely preventing suffering thus amounts to an implicit prohibition on elaborating a positive collective project of socio-political transformation .
At an even more general level , we might problematize the opposition between the universal ( pre-political ) human rights possessed by every human being ‘ as such ’ and the specific political rights of a citizen , or member of a particular political community .
In this sense , Balibar argues for the ‘ reversal of the historical and theoretical relationship between “ man ” and “ citizen ” ’ that proceeds by ‘ explaining how man is made by citizenship and not citizenship by man . ’ [ 11 ]
Balibar alludes here to Arendt ’s insight on the condition of refugees :
The conception of human rights based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships except that they were still human . [ 12 ]
This line , of course , leads straight to Agamben ’s notion of homo sacer as a human being reduced to ‘ bare life ’ .
In a properly Hegelian dialectics of universal and particular , it is precisely when a human being is deprived of the particular socio-political identity that accounts for his determinate citizenship that — in one and the same move — he ceases to be recognized or treated as human . [ 13 ]
Paradoxically , I am deprived of human rights at the very moment at which I am reduced to a human being ‘ in general ’ , and thus become the ideal bearer of those ‘ universal human rights ’ which belong to me independently of my profession , sex , citizenship , religion , ethnic identity , etc .
What , then , happens to human rights when they are the rights of homo sacer , of those excluded from the political community ; that is , when they are of no use , since they are the rights of those who , precisely , have no rights , and are treated as inhuman ?
Jacques Rancière proposes a salient dialectical reversal : ‘ When they are of no use , one does the same as charitable persons do with their old clothes .
One gives them to the poor .
Those rights that appear to be useless in their place are sent abroad , along with medicine and clothes , to people deprived of medicine , clothes and rights . ’
Nevertheless , they do not become void , for ‘ political names and political places never become merely void ’ .
Instead the void is filled by somebody or something else :
if those who suffer inhuman repression are unable to enact the human rights that are their last recourse , then somebody else has to inherit their rights in order to enact them in their place .
This is what is called the ‘ right to humanitarian interference ’— a right that some nations assume to the supposed benefit of victimized populations , and very often against the advice of the humanitarian organizations themselves .
The ‘ right to humanitarian interference ’ might be described as a sort of ‘ return to sender ’ : the disused rights that had been sent to the rightless are sent back to the senders . [ 14 ]
So , to put it in the Leninist way : what the ‘ human rights of Third World suffering victims ’ effectively means today , in the predominant discourse , is the right of Western powers themselves to intervene politically , economically , culturally and militarily in the Third World countries of their choice , in the name of defending human rights .
The reference to Lacan ’s formula of communication ( in which the sender gets his own message back from the receiver - addressee in its inverted , i.e. true , form ) is very much to the point here .
In the reigning discourse of humanitarian interventionism , the developed West is effectively getting back from the victimized Third World its own message in its true form .
The moment human rights are thus depoliticized , the discourse dealing with them has to change : the pre-political opposition of Good and Evil must be mobilized anew .
Today ’s ‘ new reign of ethics ’ , clearly invoked in , say , Ignatieff ’s work , thus relies on a violent gesture of depoliticization , depriving the victimized other of any political subjectivization .
And , as Rancière points out , liberal humanitarianism à la Ignatieff unexpectedly meets the ‘ radical ’ position of Foucault or Agamben with regard to this depoliticization : their notion of ‘ biopolitics ’ as the culmination of Western thought ends up getting caught in a kind of ‘ ontological trap ’ , in which concentration camps appear as ontological destiny : ‘ each of us would be in the situation of the refugee in a camp .
Any difference grows faint between democracy and totalitarianism and any political practice proves to be already ensnared in the biopolitical trap ’ . [ 15 ]
We thus arrive at a standard ‘ anti-essentialist ’ position , a kind of political version of Foucault ’s notion of sex as generated by the multitude of the practices of sexuality .
‘ Man ’ , the bearer of human rights , is generated by a set of political practices which materialize citizenship ; ‘ human rights ’ are , as such , a false ideological universality , which masks and legitimizes a concrete politics of Western imperialism , military interventions and neo-colonialism .
Is this , however , enough ?
Universality ’s return
The Marxist symptomal reading can convincingly demonstrate the content that gives the notion of human rights its specific bourgeois ideological spin : universal human rights are effectively the right of white , male property - owners to exchange freely on the market , exploit workers and women , and exert political domination .
This identification of the particular content that hegemonizes the universal form is , however , only half the story .
Its crucial other half consists in asking a more difficult , supplementary question : that of the emergence of the form of universality itself .
How — in what specific historical conditions — does abstract universality become a ‘ fact of ( social ) life ’ ?
In what conditions do individuals experience themselves as subjects of universal human rights ?
Therein resides the point of Marx ’s analysis of ‘ commodity fetishism ’ : in a society in which commodity exchange predominates , individuals in their daily lives relate to themselves , and to the objects they encounter , as to contingent embodiments of abstract - universal notions .
What I am , in terms of my concrete social or cultural background , is experienced as contingent , since what ultimately defines me is the ‘ abstract ’ universal capacity to think or to work .
Likewise , any object that can satisfy my desire is experienced as contingent , since my desire is conceived as an ‘ abstract ’ formal capacity , indifferent to the multitude of particular objects that may , but never fully do , satisfy it .
Or take the example of ‘ profession ’ : the modern notion of profession implies that I experience myself as an individual who is not directly ‘ born into ’ his social role .
What I will become depends on the interplay between contingent social circumstances and my free choice .
In this sense , today ’s individual has a profession , as electrician , waiter or lecturer , while it is meaningless to claim that the medieval serf was a peasant by profession .
In the specific social conditions of commodity exchange and the global market economy , ‘ abstraction ’ becomes a direct feature of actual social life , the way concrete individuals behave and relate to their fate and to their social surroundings .
In this regard Marx shares Hegel ’s insight , that universality becomes ‘ for itself ’ only when individuals no longer fully identify the kernel of their being with their particular social situation ; only insofar as they experience themselves as forever ‘ out of joint ’ with it .
The concrete existence of universality is , therefore , the individual without a proper place in the social edifice .
The mode of appearance of universality , its entering into actual existence , is thus an extremely violent act of disrupting the preceding organic poise .
It is not enough to make the well - worn Marxist point about the gap between the ideological appearance of the universal legal form and the particular interests that effectively sustain it .
At this level the counter - argument ( made , among others , by Lefort and Rancière ) , that the form is never ‘ mere ’ form but involves a dynamics of its own , which leaves traces in the materiality of social life , is fully valid .
It was bourgeois ‘ formal freedom ’ that set in motion the very ‘ material ’ political demands and practices of feminism or trade unionism .
Rancière ’s basic emphasis is on the radical ambiguity of the Marxist notion of the ‘ gap ’ between formal democracy — the Rights of Man , political freedoms — and the economic reality of exploitation and domination .
This gap can be read in the standard ‘ symptomatic ’ way : formal democracy is a necessary but illusory expression of a concrete social reality of exploitation and class domination .
But it can also be read in the more subversive sense of a tension in which the ‘ appearance ’ of égaliberté is not a ‘ mere appearance ’ but contains an efficacy of its own , which allows it to set in motion the rearticulation of actual socio- economic relations by way of their progressive ‘ politicization ’ .
Why should n’t women also be allowed to vote ?
Why should n’t workplace conditions be a matter of public concern as well ?
We might perhaps apply here the old Lévi-Straussian term of ‘ symbolic efficiency ’ : the appearance of égaliberté is a symbolic fiction which , as such , possesses actual efficiency of its own ; the properly cynical temptation of reducing it to a mere illusion that conceals a different actuality should be resisted .
It is not enough merely to posit an authentic articulation of a life - world experience which is then reappropriated by those in power to serve their particular interests or to render their subjects docile cogs in the social machine .
Much more interesting is the opposite process , in which something that was originally an ideological edifice imposed by colonizers is all of a sudden taken over by their subjects as a means to articulate their ‘ authentic ’ grievances .
A classic case would be the Virgin of Guadalupe in newly colonized Mexico : with her appearance to a humble Indian , Christianity — which until then served as the imposed ideology of the Spanish colonizers — was appropriated by the indigenous population as a means to symbolize their terrible plight .
Rancière has proposed a very elegant solution to the antinomy between human rights , belonging to ‘ man as such ’ , and the politicization of citizens .
While human rights cannot be posited as an unhistorical ‘ essentialist ’
Beyond with regard to the contingent sphere of political struggles , as universal ‘ natural rights of man ’ exempted from history , neither should they be dismissed as a reified fetish , the product of concrete historical processes of the politicization of citizens .
The gap between the universality of human rights and the political rights of citizens is thus not a gap between the universality of man and a specific political sphere .
Rather , it ‘ separates the whole of the community from itself ’ . [ 16 ]
Far from being pre-political , ‘ universal human rights ’ designate the precise space of politicization proper ; what they amount to is the right to universality as such — the right of a political agent to assert its radical non-coincidence with itself ( in its particular identity ) , to posit itself as the ‘ supernumerary ’ , the one with no proper place in the social edifice ; and thus as an agent of universality of the social itself .
The paradox is therefore a very precise one , and symmetrical to the paradox of universal human rights as the rights of those reduced to inhumanity .
At the very moment when we try to conceive the political rights of citizens without reference to a universal ‘ meta - political ’ human rights , we lose politics itself ; that is to say , we reduce politics to a ‘ post - political ’ play of negotiation of particular interests .

THERE are many theories for why very conservative Republicans seem to be doing so well lately , taking their party ’s Senate nominations in Florida , Kentucky and Utah , and beating Democrats head - to - head in Massachusetts , New Jersey and Virginia .
Some attribute this to a generalized anti-incumbent mood .
Others say it reflects the tendency of parties in power to falter in midterm elections .
Recently it has been fashionable to ascribe right - wing success to the Tea Party movement .
But the most obvious explanation is the one that ’s been conspicuously absent from the gusher of analysis .
Republican success in 2010 can be boiled down to two words : Rush Limbaugh .
Mr. Limbaugh has played an important role in elections going back to 1994 , when he commanded the air war in the Republican Congressional victory .
This time , however , he is more than simply the mouthpiece of the party .
He is the brains and the spirit behind its resurgence .
How did this happen ?
The Obama victory in 2008 left Republicans dazed , demoralized and leaderless .
Less than six weeks after the inauguration , in a nationally televised keynote address to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference , Mr. Limbaugh stepped into the void with a raucous denunciation of the new president ’s agenda and a strategic plan based on his belief that real conservatism wins every time .
He reiterated his famous call for Mr. Obama to fail and urged the party faithful to ignore the siren song of bipartisanship and moderation and stay true to the principles of Ronald Reagan .
These past few days I have been trying ( unsuccessfully ) to get Windows 7 to run in a virtual machine .
My OS is Ubuntu and I need Windows for some things ( mainly iTunes ) , so I decided to virtualise my physical partition so I would n’t have to reboot .
After following various guides trying to get VirtualBox to read directly from my physical partition , I had luck with the following command :
VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk - filename Windows.vmdk - rawdisk \ /dev/sda - partitions 4 - mbr Windowsfull.mbr - relative - register
This is because my Windows partition is / dev/sda4 , change yours as you see fit .
I never could get the MBR working , but I had luck with the PLoP boot manager , which was finally able to run the Windows bootloader and get it to boot .
Unfortunately ( again ) , after getting a bit past the spinning balls that form the Windows logo , it gave me a blue screen with the STOP error 0x0000007B , INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE .
I searched high and low for people with the same problem , but either nobody had it , or nobody could solve it .
I figured it had something to do with the boot driver , so I booted in Window and installed the VirtualBox guest additions ( I imagine it is the same with VMware Tools ) , but it still would n’t boot .
After Googling the error a bit , I came upon this knowledgebase entry , which instructs me to change the “ Start ” value to 0 in the following keys :
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Msahci HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\IastorV
After doing this , Windows now boots correctly and everything works fine !
Glenn Beck says progressives are trying to “ fundamentally transform the country ” by rendering the Constitution “ irrelevant ” ( “ In 1920 , they stopped studying the Constitution in law school and started studying case law ! ” ) , and by expunging from history the role “ religion and morals ” played in our founding .
On his April 28 show , Beck announced the launch of Founders Fridays segment , a special feature by which Beck intends to counter these progressive lies with … the truth :
Every Friday is going to be Founders ’ Fridays on the program , at least for the next month .
And if nobody watches , well , then , we ’ll keep doing it anyway .
We are going to try to repair some of the damage that is being done by truth .
Truth .
Truth is like fire .
It will burn .
It will burn everything that is impure .
It will set on fire all lies .
But it will not consume the truth .
So we ’ll set a few fires by spewing the truth .
Do n’t think that Beck will have to do all this truth - spewing and fire - setting by himself ; he ’ll have help from guests who “ have history ” :
We ’re going to have some people in here who have history , who know the Founders better than anybody else on Earth .
One of the guys who ’s going to be joining us for some of these is David Barton , author of Original Intent and founder of Wall Builders , an organization dedicated to presenting America ’s forgotten history and heroes .
In “ The Right ’s Library of Fake Quotes , ” Extra ! ( 4/10 ) documents many instances where conservatives have promoted fabricated historical quotes , religious and otherwise :
One of the most prolific purveyors of bogus founder quotes is Christian theocrat David Barton .
Though not a household name , Barton ’s tireless efforts to construct a Christian origin story for the United States have been praised by the likes of Pat Robertson and Newt Gingrich ( Church & State , 7-8/96 ) .
His 1989 book The Myth of Separation attributed bogus quotes to Washington ( ” It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible ” ) , Jefferson ( “ I have always said and always will say that the studious perusal of the Sacred Volume will make us better citizens ” ) and Patrick Henry ( “ It can not be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded , not by religionists , but by Christians ; not on religions , but on the gospel of Jesus Christ ” ) .
Barton has also misattributed the “ Ten Commandments ” quote to Madison .
In 1996 Barton admitted that these and nine other quotes he ’d been circulating in his writings , videotapes and live appearances were either false or unverifiable ( Church & State , 7-8/96 ) .
But Barton ’s reputation suffered little from the fraud , according to Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church & State .
“ He ’s doing better than ever , ” Boston told Extra ! , noting that since 1996 Barton has served as vice - chair of the Texas GOP , and now sits on the Texas state committee advising the state ’s board of education on history and social studies curriculum , “ despite no history credentials . ”
But Barton is no stranger to the show , having appeared several times with Beck in the recent past ( e.g .
4/30/10 , 4/8/10 , 3/15/10 . )
And Barton has apparently had a real impact on Beck , who repeated one of the spurious George Washington quotes he is famous for promoting on his March 5 show : “ It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible . ”
Beck and Barton should thank God that truth does n’t really burn lies .

[ In this opinion piece , our own Christian Nutt analyzes why so few games have characters " you can even imagine having ... a meaningful inner life " , and highlights what gives game worlds emotional realism . ]
Recently , I had a brief Twitter conversation -- is there any other kind ? -- with @ 33 mhz , another gay guy and gamer .
He 'd been playing through Rockstar 's The Ballad of Gay Tony and live - tweeting his reactions to , essentially , the game 's portrayal of the reality of being gay .
What makes this interesting is that he's not being a watchdog for political correctness ; he 's critiquing what the GTA series , in its continued quest for gritty realism , gets right , and what it gets wrong .
When he pointed out a badly written bit of dialogue from a gay character , I replied , " Is it a bit sad that this is the only mainstream game we could have this conversation about ? "
His response : " I know , right ?
Partly because so few games are set in a recognizable present . "
I do n't think that 's the problem , precisely , though it certainly does n't help .
My response was , " So few have characters that you can even imagine having any sort of meaningful inner life . "
That 's it .
While it would be nice to have more believable gay characters in games , it would be even nicer to have more believable characters in games -- period .
But I think there 's an important , rarely - considered reason for this .
Believable characters make what they inhabit believable .
In fact , I 'd argue that having believable characters would strengthen games on every front : it would not just make their stories more enjoyable , which is obvious ; it would make games more engaging to play , and make their worlds more meaningful and more exciting to explore .
I Smolder With Generic Rage
The line above comes from Penny Arcade , of course .
It was written about the frequently - derided second entry in Ubisoft 's reboot of the Prince of Persia series : Warrior Within .
The game quickly became the butt of jokes not because it was bad ; it became a punchline because it took the appealing characters from Sands of Time and put them through the Hot Topic wringer , turning them into tedious caricatures designed to appeal to unhappy teenagers , accompanied by music from nu-metal band Godsmack , which apparently was added to the same effect .
But I do n't have much interest in discussing Warrior Within .
The Prince of Persia series seems to have outgrown its awkward adolescence -- or at least moved into a new stage of it , anyway .
No , the guy I want to talk about is Kratos , from God of War .
Maybe it 's moot since he 's dead now , but what I 'm struck by is how he 's frequently been held up as not just an appealing character , but as an example of effective characterization .
I 'm struck by this because , frankly , I find him to be one of the biggest ciphers in gaming .
In the original game , it 's revealed that his generic rage smolders for a good reason : he killed his family .
This reveal does n't come until near the end of the game , though , and having finally played it recently , thanks to the PlayStation 3 port , I found him to be a blank ; the calm eye at the center of a vortex of blades .
Nothing happened to Kratos -- just around him .
He has a motivation , of course , and it's well - established in the game 's narrative .
What he does n't have is a personality .
He growls and gnashes his teeth .
It does n't bother me so much because his behavior is provocative ; it bothers me because he 's so boring .
I 've never been so perplexed by the popularity of a character as I have with Kratos .
Sure , sure , it 's subjective , and his badassery is not in question .
But he 's just so ... vacant .
The Blades of Chaos Are The Problem
I 'm hardly the first to point out that one of the biggest obstacles to more meaningful storytelling in games is that this is not what games are designed to do .
But let 's chew on that a bit .
Certainly , God of War does exploration tolerably well , does puzzles okay , and does combat very effectively .
It 's difficult to characterize someone who spends the majority of his time dashing around swinging blades on chains as anything other than violence made flesh .
That 's one of the successes of Heavy Rain which I have n't seen really discussed much .
For all that some people were eager to dismiss the game as " just Dragon 's Lair " , the modular way in which its characters interact with the game world allows for a tremendous range of behavior beyond combat .
And the consistency of its button input system makes all interactions instantly accessible to its audience no matter how late into the game they 're introduced .
The much talked about scene early on in the game in which Ethan Mars has to take care of his son Shaun -- feed him dinner , make him do his homework , tuck him in to bed -- is not just remarkable because it's a deft example of characterization , nor because , counter to expectation , it 's not dull .
It is also because you can do varied things in Heavy Rain , like bake a pizza or tuck in a child , with the interface Quantic Dream developed .
Typically , interactions like this in games , when attempted , are jury - rigged , and you can tell .
No , Heavy Rain can't deliver combat or driving in a way that is satisfying like God of War or Gran Turismo -- though it does do both , in its own way .
Its strength is that it can deliver anything .
It 's more versatile precisely because it 's more limited .
And thus the story can more tightly intertwine with the gameplay , and the characterizations invite nuance .
In contrast , I was struck , at Activision 's E3 2008 presentation , by the demonstration of its first James Bond game , the Treyarch - developed Quantum of Solace .
Though it 's named for the latest Bond film , it takes in the story of Casino Royale as well , because they 're essentially inextricable .
I 've never actually played the game , despite loving the film because I suspect , for me , it 's not additive .
During the presentation , the developers showed off some of the Casino Royale content : a lengthy gunfight in a corridor in the Hotel Splendide that had nothing to do with anything that actually happened in the film .
At the time I simply rolled my eyes at this departure from the movie , but it 's worth pulling apart .
This is not because I want to dwell on what I see as a mismatch with the source material .
No , I just want to point out that it 's instructive : when you make your only interaction with the world violence , you have no choice but to fill your game with violence .
It 's just so much more noticeable in a film adaptation .
Casino Royale is a film about a lot of things .
And yes , Bond does drop some fools in the Hotel Splendide .
But Casino Royale is also a story of his relationship with Vesper Lynd -- a complicated , fascinating , believable one .
It 's a film with a lot of texture , tonal shifts , and different settings -- highs and lows aplenty .
I can't say for sure how much of that Treyarch was able to get into the game , since I have never played it , and I certainly do n't want to disparage the team 's work without doing so .
But when your only meaningful interaction with the world is down the barrel of a gun ...
It 's limiting .
Quantum of Solace puts that in perspective .
A World I Can Believe
A character like Kratos implies a world that makes little sense .
To believe in him , we have to make allowances and accept vague conceptions as truths .
The Ancient Greek setting gives him cover : there were warriors in the past , we know vaguely , and yet they had societies .
But those exceptions , once made , do n't do anything to enrich the believability of the game as anything more than an arena to experience combat in .
To my mind , the concepts of a believable world and believable characters are inextricably intertwined .
This is why skeptics should be paying attention to whether or not their characters are more than empty shells with strong arms and good aim .
Regardless what type of game you 're making -- linear action or open world ; action or RPG -- you 're trying to build a world that players must believe in .
Whether you call it a world , or you call it zones , or you call it levels , this is your goal : because one thing we do well , as a medium , is build worlds .
But we must recognize that this not just down to the talent of the art team and the quality of their research and imagination .
The enduring popularity of Final Fantasy VII owes a great debt to both the character building and world creation that the team engaged in for that 1997 release .
It 's able to endure as a property -- and be spun off into films and more games without up - front plans to do so -- because of the believability of its world .
Recall exploring Midgar .
There was a sense of a way of life there : shit ran downhill from Shinra to the characters in the slums , who mostly had ordinary lives .
Barrett had his daughter Marlene , Tifa ran the bar , Aerith grew flowers in the abandoned church and lived with her mom .
Even Cloud , the amnesiac soldier , joined the Shinra Company for personal reasons .
The 2008 PSP release Crisis Core was able to show the Shinra corporation from the inside -- from the perspective of Zack Fair , that game 's lead -- specifically because it was an organization that made sense .
It slotted into its world well .
And Zack and Aerith and Cloud and even Sephiroth all fit into the world , too : all had logical , if fantastic , back stories .
The game explored these with a deftness and believability that eluded the more carefully planned Final Fantasy XIII , which ironically had been devised as part of a scheme to span multiple games in the first place .
A Recognizable Present ?
As I said before , it 's not so much about setting games in the real world -- you do n't have to make GTA to make a game with believable characters , though it probably helps , if for no other reason than to keep you grounded .
One of my favorite authors , and one I feel is perpetually underrated -- or at least overlooked -- is Diana Wynne Jones .
Jones rarely writes books set in the real - world present , though she has .
Usually , she writes fantasy , building worlds and situations that are n't real .
Many might be fleetingly familiar with her work thanks to the Studio Ghibli film adaptation of her book Howl 's Moving Castle .
While it 's a flawed translation to the screen , if you know it , it 'll give you an idea of the currency she usually works in , in terms of both setting and character .
I 'm pointing this out because one thing that the film retains is the idiosyncratic characters and complicated relationships between them that the book had .
This is what makes her fantasy worlds believable -- why we do n't question that the wizard Howl has a castle that journeys haphazardly across the countryside .
It 's an expression of his personality as a character , and only from there becomes indicative of the kind of world we 're dealing with .
Jones is frequently asked where she gets her characters from , and in this essay , she writes , " They come partly from life ...
Those that I do draw from life , I use sparingly , one per book usually , to ensure that the other people , who come from my head , will behave as real people would . "
She later writes that one of her most meaningfully formative exercises as a young writer was to write about characters and explore their group dynamics -- to tease out the way they 'd really act .
These groups " surprised and fascinated me by developing a group dynamic I had not expected .
The one I expected to make the decisions did not always do so . "
Build realistic characters , you get realistic groups .
Build groups , get a society .
Build societies , and you get a world .
When author R.A. Salvatore was asked to devise the Drow Elf society for Forgotten Realms , he realized that their role as silent antagonists in role - playing scenarios would n't fly .
Said Salvatore in his GDC 2010 talk , " You can't have a society that 's just a bunch of vicious , maniacal killers .
It would n't survive .
So I had to come up with a structure ...
This is the most important thing in world building .
You have to understand that you are asking the player or the reader to suspend disbelief .
You are asking them to take a bunch of things for granted .
The less that you 're asking them to pretend this happens , the more you 're making it make sense , the more immersed they will be in your world . "
" Great games are rarely about graphics "
The interaction of character and believability brings us to an interesting case : Nier .
Recently released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by Square Enix , it was developed by an outfit called Cavia -- one that 's notorious , inasmuch as anybody has actually heard of it , for making mediocre games , to be blunt .
I 've played it for a little over an hour .
Initial impressions are that it's far behind the curve graphically -- I can easily name a PlayStation 2 game ( Valkyrie Profile 2 , for the record ) that does some of what it attempts and looks better doing it .
And if I based my criticism of the game on my initial impressions of the gameplay , I would n't have anything nice to say , either .
So far , it 's bog - standard fetch quests , behind - the - times static storytelling , and a world with limited interaction .
Yet somehow the game has generated a lot of buzz , and it 's not just because of the Square Enix logo on the case .
Most shockingly , the game got a review in the print edition of the New York Times , which is also published on its website , which is where the above quote comes from .
Critic Seth Schiesel spends a great deal of time talking about the game 's story , and the emotional truth of it -- tying it even to the U.S. Supreme Court 's forthcoming decision on how games can be treated under the constitution : whether they 're deserving of the protections afforded to film , literature , and other art .
While that may be a reach -- though I can't say for sure -- it 's clear to me that Nier is able to draw in players , despite its last - generation visuals and a protagonist who , based on looks , could comfortably stand alongside Marcus Fenix or Kratos .
What sets Nier , the eponymous protagonist , apart ?
As Schiesel points out , he 's a father .
There it is : that small , poignant , and profoundly meaningful detail .
It 's a launchpad , Schiesel writes : " From the simple , elemental motivation of helping [ Nier 's daughter ] unfolds a tale that reveals the fate of the world and which throws into question the nature of humanity itself . "
That 's the crucial difference .
That link is what elevates a game which is otherwise undistinguished .
After all , Schiesel himself says the graphics " fall short " , the combat mechanics are " basic " , and its world is " small " .
Somehow , though , he finds it worth writing about , and writing about passionately .
Though he admits its faults , he also writes that " Nier succeeds at fostering an emotional investment in its characters and in its world that gives all of its hacking and slashing and jumping and exploring and puzzle - solving and even its virtual fishing and farming a sense of value and meaning . "
If Nier is behind the times at creating a " believable " game world , at least in the sense the term is usually applied , the relationships it creates serve in place of a budget increase or more talented art and design staff .
Though it may not always work out , this drive towards emotionally resonant characters may be the one place Japanese game development is consistently ahead of the West .
Gamers are getting older .
Their lives are getting more complicated .
One thing you must confront when your life gets complicated is the nature of interpersonal interaction -- whether you want to or not .
If there 's something we need to do -- and Gears of War 2 attempted it , as well , with its treatment of Dom Santiago 's wife -- it is to lend these worlds the emotional heft of meaningful characterization .
How we do that can be approached via cutscenes , via text dialogue , via mise - en - scene , as in Heavy Rain and BioShock .
There are doubtless other narrative tools that I did n't list -- even ones that have n't yet been invented .
The point I am making is that imbuing a game 's cast with meaningful characterization does not relate solely to the quality of a game 's story ; it relates directly to the quality of the game 's world .
In terms of storytelling , Schiesel clearly belives Nier does a fantastic job ; I personally believe that Gears of War 2 missed the mark .
But in either case , these details help make the world more a world and less a string of environments .
Relationships imply context ; relationships imply a world .
Final Fantasy XIII , to take a recent example , jumps on and off of this track schizophrenically .
This is what makes it a particularly frustrating case .
At times the game 's story works beautifully to create and support its world , and at times things make no sense and meaningful context is elusive .
Though all are flawed attempts , each game I 've discussed throughout this editorial proves in its own way that visuals are only a fraction of what it takes to make a world come to life .
A lot of critics and developers think we should be pushing narrative in games because narrative helps bring us closer to a vaguely defined goal -- of making games art .
Schiesel argues that this is , in fact , the outcome with Nier .
But my argument is simpler : pursuing meaningful characterization will simply help bring us closer to the goal of making our worlds -- our games .
And if it happens that we accidentally make art in the process , well , it 's serendipity .
Routh ’s UNofficial website states this is n’t true .
I guess we received some bunk info or they ’re just not announcing yet .
Sources close to Bloody Disgusting tell us exclusively that Brandon Routh ( Superman , Dead of Night ) is tapped for Frank Darabont ’s “ The Walking Dead ” , the new post - apocalyptic zombie TV series being developed for AMC .
The adaptation of Robert Kirkman ’s astounding comic franchise is set among a group of zombie survivors of an apocalypse who are led by a police officer , Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) , in search of a safe place to live .
Jon Bernthal also stars .
AMC has already ordered 6 episodes before the pilot was even presented .
Good start !
Nick Clegg will today accuse the Tories of being " completely in hock to the City " as he says the party has quadrupled its dependence on funding from the sector since David Cameron became leader .
Figures produced by the Liberal Democrats today show the Tories have raised more than £ 15 m from companies and individuals connected to the City since Cameron was elected leader in 2005 .
The party accepted just £ 3.9 m from the City between 2001 and Cameron becoming leader .
Half of the City donors were not recorded donors before then .
Ten percent of the Tory candidates in the coming election are bankers or have worked in the sector , compared with 1.5 % of the country as a whole .
The Lib Dems also claim that more than half of the Conservatives ' outstanding loans from City individuals and businesses were made under David Cameron : £ 5.3 m out of £ 9.5 m .
Between Cameron 's election and 2010 , a total of £ 109 m in donations was received ; donations from the City account for 14 % of this .
In the four years before his leadership , donations from the City made up less than 6 % of the £ 67 m received .
Clegg will claim " the Conservative party will never reform the banks and rebuild our economy because they are completely in hock to the City of London " .
He will say : " They are the party of choice for rich bankers , and no wonder when their major tax policy is to give tax breaks to double millionaires .
They even have plans to cut taxes for the banks and raise them for solid British manufacturing companies .
They will never change Britain for the better because they are only interested in helping people at the top . "
He will argue the Lib Dems have the most progressive tax plans .
" Only our party has a positive plan to put money back in the pockets of ordinary people , close the unfair loopholes for people at the top and take on the banks so they never again hold a gun to our heads and put ordinary people out of work . "
Two sand cat kittens were born at the Al Ain Wildlife Park & Resort in the United Arab Emirates .
The kittens ’ birth was a result of an assistive reproductive technique called in - vitro fertilization and embryo transfer .
This marks the first time the procedure was successful in Sand cats .
The research project is on - going and includes captive sand cat populations in the United States and Europe and is conducted in collaboration with the University of Illinois and the Cincinnati Zoo .
The Al Ain Wildlife Park & Resort ( AWPR ) announced the first - ever birth of 2 Sand cat kittens following an in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer procedure at its facilities in Al Ain .
The success of the program marks an important step forward in its efforts to conserve this threatened cat species and other arid land carnivores such as the Arabian leopard .
In October AWPR initiated Project Sand Cat in partnership with the US - based University of Illinois and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden– both world leaders in endangered species research .
Fresh sperm and eggs collected from male and female Sand cats were fertilized in an incubator to produce 50 embryos .
Twenty - one of those embryos were transferred into 4 host cats , one of which recorded a successful pregnancy .
The remaining 29 embryos were frozen and transported to the Cincinnati Zoo for similar trials .
“ No Sand cat kitten has ever been born as a result of in - vitro fertilization and embryo transfer .
Our Sand cat mother gave birth to 2 kittens .
The kittens and mother are in a very good condition ” said Farshid Merhdadfar , the Animal Collection Manager at AWPR .
According to AWPR ’s Chief Programs Officer , Dr. Mike Maunder , the goal is to develop protocols for embryo transfer that can be used for the Sand cat and other more threatened species such as the Arabian leopard .
“ This technique will allow Sand cats , and other threatened species , held in the UAE to contribute to the breeding work of conservations institutions throughout the world , ” explained Dr. Maunder .
AWPR is home to almost 20 % of the world ’s captive Sand cats .
The 34 Sand Cats at AWPR make up the largest and most genetically significant captive population of Sand cats at any single zoological institution in the world .
These in - vitro fertilization and embryo transfer would not be possible without AWPR ’s large number of Sand cats .
Eggs were harvested from five female donors , fertilized with the sperm from three male Sand cats , while the resulting embryos were implanted into a separate group of four female recipients .
Embryo transfer is an important technology for conservation efforts .
Embryos fertilized at AWPR can be frozen and later implanted into recipient groups across the world .
“ We can exchange genetic material without having to transport the animals themselves .
This is a model in managing threatened wildlife species in the future , ” explain Dr. Swanson .
According to Dr Bill Swanson , Director of Research at the Cincinnati Zoo , “ These cats at AWPR are totally unrelated to other Sand cats held anywhere in captivity .
To introduce their genetic material to other populations helps build a stronger and more viable captive population ” .
If test - tube babies from AWPR ’s Project Sand Cat are born to Sand cats at zoos in the United States , they will carry the genetic material from AWPR ’s Sand cats .
As AWPR ’s foreign born Sand cats mature in collections in the United States , they will be bred with their US - based counterparts .
This process diversifies the gene pool of captive Sand cat populations .
One such trial of the embryos fertilized at AWPR is underway at the Living Desert Zoo in California .
Project Sand Cat is a pilot project within AWPR ’s conservation program .
The conservation work at AWPR focuses on the conservation and restoration of arid land biodiversity and has a special focus on desert carnivores including current work with Arabian leopards , African wild dogs , and lions .
About Sand cat
The Sand cat ( Felis margarita harrisoni ) are thought to be near threatened in the wild with depleting populations .
Sand cats are native to the Middle East and UAE .
Due to their reclusiveness very little ecological information is known about the Sand cat and the factors of their survival are yet to be thoroughly understood .
The smallest member of the cat family found in Arabia , the Sand Cat is well adapted to a desert environment .
Its range extends from North Africa to Arabia and into central Asia .
A short legged animal , it stands up to 26cm at the shoulder and weighs up to 3 kg .
Both sexes have a thick , pale coat ranging from sandy brown to grey , with white belly , chest and lower muzzle .
There are black stripes on the limbs .
The tail is black tipped and ringed with black markings near the end .
Their head is broad with large ears set low on the side , giving them an excellent sense of smell and hearing .
Inhabiting the stony and sandy desert regions , these cats must endure temperature changes of - 5 to 58 degrees Celsius .
The pads of their feet are insulated from the heat by thick fur growing between their toes , and this also allows the animals to move across the sand more easily .
Largely nocturnal hunters , sand cats burrow into the dunes to escape the heat .
At night , they may range up to 5.4 k m in search of food which consists of birds , jerboas , hares , reptiles and insects .
They have been known to take on and eat poisonous snakes such as the horned sand viper .
Solitary animals , sand cats only come together for mating .
Seasonal breeders ,
The average litter born in April , consists of between two to five kittens .
The young are blind , weighing 39 gms and are 13 cm in length .
At approx .
13 days old they open their eyes , can walk at 21 days old , and become fully independent at 6 - 8 months of age .
Sand cat populations throughout their range are believed to be on the decline , due to habitat loss and reduced populations of their prey species .
The Arabian sand cat is rarely seen and accurate numbers of this subspecies has yet to be determined .
Did you know :
Sand cats can be found far from a water source and get all their moisture from their prey ?
Felis margarita is named after the French General Margueritte who explored the Sahara .
There are six described subspecies of sand cat .
• Felis margarita margarita The Sahara , Algeria to Arabia• Felis margarita airensis Niger and the Sudan• Felis margarita meinertzhageni Sahara ( Algeria ) • Felis margarita thinobia Turkestan• Felis margarita scheffeli Pakistan ( threatened ) •
Felis margarita harrisoni Arabia / Jordan
There ’s no doubt that there ’s plenty of people out there actively calling out for certain features for Android to adopt .
While speeding up the browser may not be at the top of everyone ’s list , especially considering the native Android browser is pretty quick in of itself , but we know for a fact that adding applications to your SD card is one of the most highly anticipated features ever .
And , sure enough , Google has pulled the curtain off the feature .
But first , the speedier browser .
Google have introduced the same JavaScript enhancements that they have installed within Google Chrome , which helps to make it so fast , which they believe makes Froyo ’s mobile browser the world ’s faster mobile browser .
Pretty bold statement , right ?
Well , according to Google , and a little proof given by a quick demo at Google I/O , they are seeing 2 to 3 times faster speeds from the Froyo mobile browser , versus the browser found in Eclair .
Now for the really important part : Apps2SD .
You get a whole bunch of new things thrown at you with the inclusion of this feature .
First and foremost , yes , you will be able to store your applications on your SD card .
More over , though , Android will do it intelligently : so if you ’re running out of room , your handset will automatically move a newly installed application to your SD card .
Of course , you can do it yourself , too .
However , probably our favorite part , is the fact that you can launch , run , and utilize applications while they ’re still loaded on the SD card .
So , no restoring them back to the phone when you need them .
You can put them all on the SD card and have your fun .
Additionally , you can now update your applications from the Android Marketplace .
All of them .
At once .
You have more than one application that needs an update ?
Go right ahead and download them all at once , instead of having to activate all of them independently .
Another great , and long - awaited feature .
And , remember that new Android Marketplace for the PC ?
Well , it ’s getting better , too .
You will now be able to “ queue ” an application to download from the PC , and then Over the Air , your phone will initiate the download .
Easy .
And , finally , there ’s a Quick Search Box ( which pops up quite a bit in other announcements , too ) , that will allow you to quickly and easily find your applications on your device .
Basically , just an intuitive extension to Universal Search .
The event is still going on , so stay tuned .
More updates are on the way .
4 Extra Debut .
Physicist Brian Cox tells Matthew Parris why Carl Sagan inspired him to dedicate his life to science .
From May 2010 .
Physicist Brian Cox tells Matthew Parris how Carl Sagan 's Cosmos tv show changed his life .
As a young boy of 13 , Brian Cox stared at his television screen every Wednesday evening , as Carl Sagan took him on a journey across the Cosmos .
The programme was a ground - breaking piece of television by a brilliant young scientist who could be inspiring and infuriating in equal measure .
Sagan was a complex character .
Driven to succeed , he came from a relatively poor background to become a millionaire , and one of the most influential scientists of his era .
His popularity left him open to both criticism and jealousy amongst his colleagues , and whilst he was passionate about the need to educate the populace , he could also be arrogant and dismissive of his fellow scientists .
So just how good a scientist was he , and what is his legacy ?
Producer : John Byrne .
' Some things were better under apartheid '
Millions of South Africans still live in shacks
When apartheid was dismantled in South Africa , many expected the lives of its black population would improve but promises of land distribution and new homes have not been fulfilled , as Hugh Sykes discovered .
In a community of shacks on a hillside near Johannesburg , a man complained to me : " We did n't like apartheid , but some things were better under apartheid than they are now . "
In a community of shacks on a hillside near Durban , a man complained to me : " Life here under apartheid was bad , but now it is more bad . "
I felt slightly unsettled hearing this .
Shack dwellers have to go out to public stand - pipes to fill up containers with drinking water
It seemed like questioning a sacred belief - that apartheid was an unmitigated , 100 % evil system .
But there is less idolatry here now , as it dawns on most people that the new South Africa is still scarred by extreme poverty and high unemployment .
No paradise
Of course , Nelson Mandela continues to be lauded as the hero of the liberation of black South Africans from the oppressions of apartheid .
Building houses for all under one programme proved too costly
But he is also being criticised for changing the direction of the South African economy from active state intervention to neo-liberal , free - market economics .
During his presidency , the government switched from RDP - the interventionist Reconstruction and Development Programme - to Gear , which stands for Growth , Employment And Redistribution .
RDP promised paradise - clean water , mains drainage , land redistribution and a million homes - all in five years .
But paradise did not come .
The economy of South Africa simply could not bear the cost .
So the finance system switched to Gear .
Part of the thinking was that it would help to develop a substantial black middle class , whose taxes would then trickle down to the poor .
The middle class did develop , but the problem with trickle - down is that it is just that - a trickle .
Houses ' an insult ' Millions of South Africans still live in shacks .
The ANC government now is simply an extension of the apartheid government
" Bricks " Mokolo , former ANC activist Rain and dust get in , there is no security against burglars and shack dwellers have to go out to public stand - pipes to fill up containers with drinking water .
And there is no proper lighting which - quite apart from the obvious inconveniences - makes it very hard for children to get their homework done on dark winter evenings .
A former African National Congress activist , " Bricks " Mokolo , told me it is still very hard to criticise the government here .
He says everybody has been , as he put it , " made to love the ANC , made to love Nelson Mandela " and " made to feel small " if they dare to complain .
Mr Mokolo tells me angrily : " I did n't wait for Nelson Mandela .
I too fought for my freedom .
I was tortured in an apartheid jail . "
He was tortured so brutally that prison officers thought he was dead .
After leaving him in a mortuary fridge overnight , they dumped what they thought was his dead body in a field .
Mr Mokolo says that housing , especially , was better under apartheid than it is now .
He calls the new houses that are being built all over the country an insult because they are significantly smaller than the old matchbox homes that the apartheid government built in the townships .
" The ANC government now , " he insists , " is simply an extension of the apartheid government .
There 's still separate development , " he goes on , " there are still townships , 20 years after liberation . "
His conclusion : " There were places for blacks in those days .
Now they are the same places .
They 've just changed the word .
They 've changed black , to poor . "
World Cup threat ?
This is a radical outlook that I have heard much more often than on previous visits .
World Cup organisers have taken precautions after a wave of strikes A wave of strikes over the past few weeks is evidence of mounting frustration , despite the undeniable success of the growing black middle class in their smart homes and fast cars .
" But what about us ? " say the rubbish collectors who were on strike for 10 days in April , or the train and dock workers who were out for more than two weeks this month .
Mineworkers were about to go on strike , too , a few days ago and were only stopped by a court order .
If they had stopped work , there could have been a threat to power supplies during the World Cup .
All the same , stadiums are taking precautions , installing generators and back - up generators .
This reminds me of the last World Cup , when I was in Baghdad - power cuts , blanked - out TV sets during some of the games .
That surely cannot happen here , can it ?

Supercomputer vendor Cray is unveiling its latest high - end system powered by Advanced Micro Devices ' latest Opteron processors and featuring Cray 's newest interconnect technology , dubbed " Gemini . "
The result is the XE6 supercomputer , which Cray officials said can scale to more than 1 million cores and can expand the reach of petascale computing to a wider range of HPC ( high - performance computing ) applications .
Cray officials introduced the XE6 - formerly codenamed " Baker " - May 25 at the 2010 Cray User Group meeting in Edinburgh , Scotland .
The new supercomputer will start shipping early in the third quarter , but already Cray has more than $ 200 million in contracts for the system from such facilities as the Korea Meteorological Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center .
Cray also will provide three XE6 systems to the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory , the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and the U.S Army Engineer Research and Development Center as part of the Department of Defense 's HPC modernization program .
Other customers include the National Nuclear Security Administration , the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and NOAA ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) through a partnership with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
The system is powered by AMD 's Opteron 6100 chips , which offer from eight to 12 cores each .
AMD released the chip family - formerly named " Magny - Cours " - in March .
Cray 's current XT6 supercomputer also runs on the Opteron 6100 processors .
According to Barry Bolding , Cray 's vice president of scalable systems , the combination of the AMD chips with the new Gemini interconnect technology bring vast improvements to the XE6 over previous models .
The Gemini interconnect - which replaces the current SeaStar technology - offers greater performance in multicore environments , including a 100 - fold improvement in messaging rates and a three - fold reduction in latency over current systems .
It also offers hardware support for a global user address space .
" With the new Gemini interconnect , we are putting the final piece of the puzzle in place , " Bolding said in a statement .
" With the Gemini interconnect we will provide the scalable network to meet the demands of a petascale environment .
The Cray XE6 system is the production supercomputer designed for the multicore era . "
Also included in the XE6 is the third generation of the Cray Linux Environment operating system , which was announced in April .
Cray showed off the XE6 a week before the 2010 International Supercomputing show in Hamburg , Germany .

Some of the pseudoscientific “ alternative medicine ” modalities we deal with are easy to summarize : homeopathy is 100 % nonsense – nothing but water ; acupuncture ( if you define it as placing needles in specific acupuncture points ) has no measurable effect beyond placebo , and therapeutic touch and other forms of energy healing are nothing but magical thinking .
But when people ask me , “ What do you think about chiropractic ? ” there is no one - liner .
This is partly because “ chiropractic ” is not a monolithic profession ; it is a many - headed beast .
It is a mixture of legitimate interventions and pure pseudoscience in widely varying proportions .
But also , chiropractors tend not to be self - reflective as a profession , and are shy about outside scrutiny .
But the internet contains a wealth of information and is increasingly useful as a tool to survey practices and claims .
Edzard Ernst has recently published a survey of English - speaking chiropractic websites and found some very informative results .
Ernst is a professor of complementary and alternative medicine and has become the Energizer Bunny of holding CAM up to the light of rigorous science .
The question is this – since many chiropractors mix evidence - based and non evidence - based practices , what can we say about the percentage of chiropractors who are basically evidence - based vs pseudoscientific ?
Are most chiropractors mostly scientific , or are most chiropractors peddling pseudoscience with just a patina of legitimacy ?
The legitimate treatments chiropractors use is manipulation for lower back strain , for which there is some evidence of efficacy .
Although there is no apparent advantage of any technique that is uniquely chiropractic – so physical therapists , sports medicine specialists , and physiatrists also use similar manipulative techniques .
At their best , chiropractors are glorified physical therapists or sports medicine specialists .
I am not aware of anything new or unique that they bring to the table , but some have developed a knowledge and skill base to function in this capacity .
But most chiropractors do not simply sell themselves or limit their interventions to physical medicine .
They also include ( again , to varying degrees ) a variety of magical and pseudoscientific interventions , including the misuse of manipulative therapy .
This includes high cervical manipulation for headaches and other conditions ( an intervention that also carries a stroke risk ) , applied kinesiology , iridology , homeopathy ( chiropractors are the most common prescribers of homeopathy in the US , although naturopaths are on the rise ) , and spinal manipulation for asthma , childhood ailments , and other conditions .
Now , really for the first time as far as I am aware , Ernst has provided at least some information about the percentage of chiropractors who engage in dubious treatments .
He found :
Results :
We found evidence that 190 ( 95 % ) chiropractor websites made unsubstantiated claims regarding at least one of the conditions .
When colic and infant colic data were collapsed into one heading , there was evidence that 76 ( 38 % ) chiropractor websites made unsubstantiated claims about all the conditions not supported by sound evidence .
56 ( 28 % ) websites and 4 of the 9 ( 44 % ) associations made claims about lower back pain , whereas 179 ( 90 % ) websites and all 9 associations made unsubstantiated claims about headache / migraine .
Unsubstantiated claims were made about asthma , ear infection / earache / otitis media , neck pain , whiplash in at least half of all chiropractor websites .
Conclusions :
The majority of chiropractors and their associations in the English - speaking world seem to make therapeutic claims that are not supported by sound evidence , whilst only 28 % of chiropractor websites promote lower back pain , which is supported by some evidence .
We suggest the ubiquity of the unsubstantiated claims constitutes an ethical and public health issue .
As a caveat , when chiropractors advertise themselves they may be focusing on the more dubious claims because they think that will attract clients .
But it is reasonable to presume that what chiropractors advertise reflects what they actually do .
This study suggests that 95 % of chiropractors feature dubious treatments in their practice , and that more than half made unsubstantiated claims about many treatments , suggesting this forms a major part of their practice .
This study strongly contradicts those who claim that chiropractors are mostly evidence - based but a few bad apples dabble in nonsense .
The reverse is true – dubious treatments appear to be the mainstay of their practice , and a very few ( 5 % ) stick to evidence - based treatments .
2010 is the 100th anniversary of the Flexner Report – essentially an expose on poor - scientific regulation of medical practices that led to a scientific revolution in mainstream medicine .
Chiropractic is in major need of its own Flexner Report ( an Ernst Report ? ) .
In my opinion they need to clean house if they want to become respected members of the evidence - based mainstream medical community .
They are trying to achieve this through legislation , lobbying , and advertising rather than genuine quality control , and that is a shame .
As Ernst writes – their failure to do so constitutes an ethical and public health issue .
I recently picked up three new lenses for my Canon 550d .
They are all actually old lenses , but they 're new to me .
All of them are manual focus lenses from the 70's and 80's and they are all from different manufacturers .
This means they require lens - mount adapters so they will fit on my Canon .
The first lens is the only one that I truly sought out .
I wanted a nice normal prime lens for the 1.6 crop factor chip on the 550d .
I settled on a Nikon 28 mm f2.8 Series E lens .
It was quite inexpensive and is very sharp .
Its 35 mm equivalent focal length is ~ 45 mm .
This is my new standard lens .
The second lens I picked up when I was in LA earlier this month .
My sister has possesion of my grandfather 's Olympus OM - 1 and attached to it was an F. Zuiko 50 mm f1.8 OM lens .
I already own the Canon 50 mm f1.8 , but since the Olympus is manual focus it is going to be much nicer for video work .
I will post comparisons of the two lenses eventually .
I am curious to see how they compare .
The third I picked up on a whim at a camera shop here in Zürich .
It was in a bargain bin for CHF 30 and I thought I 'd take a chance .
It is a Minolta MD TELE ROKKOR 135 mm f3.5 .
I was taking a chance on this lens because I was not sure if it was adaptable to Canon or not .
Luckily it was .
Unluckily I picked the wrong adapter .
There are two different adapters for Minolta to Canon -- one has an optical element and the other does n't .
I went for the one without hoping it would be ok .
Unfortunately the lens wo n't focus to infinity .
It still makes a great macro lens though .
May someday I will get the optical adapter .
Does anyone know which minolta lenses focus properly with out an optical adapter ?
Expect to see these lenses used in my video work in the near future .
Thank you to my model Franz Liszt .
When cross-compiling to GNU targets , static libraries are properly created .
Previously , using such libraries resulted in Archive has no index error .
The naming of DLL and import libraries with gcc compiler on Windows , both mingw and cygwin , now matches default conventions of those environments .
Previously , the naming scheme was the same as for other Windows compilers .
Few writers could to pick a theme like the global interplay of democracy and religion and hope to utter the final word on the subject .
In his latest book , Ian Buruma , a journalist and historian with over a dozen seminal books to his credit , does something better .
The three essays in Taming the Gods each work to unsettle assumptions about the divide between religion and the secular , and to set a new kind of conversation in motion .
When we met last month in San Francisco , I began our conversation by commenting on the scope of the book .
Buruma , best known for his expertise on Japan , told me he ’d written partly to contest the idea that religion does n’t matter in the political life of East Asia .
“ It ’s a different kind of religion , ” he explained , “ the idea of spiritual authority still plays a big role . ”
And , while it operates more subtly than the dogmas and conventions of monotheistic religion , this spiritual authority is still a factor in what Buruma calls “ the political excesses of religion . ”
Buruma ’s careful way of making distinctions among things that appear to be similar — or drawing attention to ways in which near cousins are actually worlds apart — seemed to me , after our short meeting , to be a hallmark of his singularly patient mode of intellectual work .
Our conversation ranged among topics from Dutch Calvinism to Texas billboards to the new European culture wars .
________________
The first essay in the Taming the Gods is about America and Europe .
Can you talk a little about that ?
Well , one of the things that became clearer to me as I did my research is that people like to think that there ’s a real divide in Western civilization between the New World and the Old World , the U.S. and Europe , and I felt that , on reflection and reading up on it , that actually the divide is much less wide than people think it is .
If there is a divide it ’s often between Protestant countries and Catholic countries .
Or countries such as the U.S. where the established Protestant churches were swept away a long time ago in favor of new forms of Christianity .
And I think the revolts in Europe ( and again it ’s something Tocqueville really noticed in the 19th century ) were really against the Church as an authoritarian institution — much more than against religion as such .
( That revolt in America had already taken place in the 17th century . )
There are other differences but they run through the entire Western world .
Which is why I compared , for example , the Calvinist politics in 19th century Holland with Christian politics in the U.S .
So I think it ’s easy to exaggerate differences .
That ’s the thing — once a story gets told it calcifies …
What Europeans do n’t quite get about Americans is the nature of Christianity here .
In Europe , people ( whether they ’re believers or not ) still associate the church — whether Calvinist or Catholic , or anything else — with clear authority figures .
Whereas in America it ’s much closer to , well … capitalism .
One thing that struck me , traveling through Texas , was that you look at billboards along the freeways , and the way that the new religions , the evangelicals , promote themselves , is exactly the way that banks do .
They talk about “ extra interest ” from God , and it ’s all individuals becoming religious because they think they can get a personal benefit out of it — and the people offering the benefit are making money out of it .
So it ’s a business .
And that ’s very different from the traditional role of the Calvinists , or the Lutherans , or the Anglicans , or the Catholics .
We know now that so - called prosperity preaching seemed to play a part in the real estate bust .
People went to church and were told to buy things they could n’t afford .
I ’m not surprised .
Underlying that , of course , is a Protestant notion that is also there in Europe , which is that to accumulate wealth shows that you ’re blessed by God .
That does seem to have remained a through - line in American theological culture .
But that was true for [ European ] Calvinists as well .
That ’s one of the reasons Holland in the 17th century became such a successful commercial society .
It was wrong to be ostentatious — you did n’t show it off — but the accumulation showed that you were one of the chosen ones .
Sometimes it seems like we ’re simply “ consumers . ”
Yeah , but citizens as well .
On the level of local politics for example , I think Americans are much more engaged in civic affairs than Europeans are .
Really ?
Part of my time I live in upstate New York , and when there is an issue in the local town people do go to town hall meetings .
I ’ve never really seen that in Europe .
And people vote for everybody : police commissioner , town controller .
There is n’t anything really quite like that in Europe .
You talk about the difference between the French idea of laïcité and secularism .
Can you explain that ?
Secularism can mean two things .
It can be a description of a society where church is clearly separated from state — in that sense we live in a secular society in the U.S. — but it can also be turned into a kind of dogma of its own .
Which is the case of France after the revolution .
Reason was almost treated as a matter of faith .
And then you get a kind of ideology of secularism rather than a description of a de facto separation ; those are two slightly different things .
And I think laïcité tends to be very ideological — and something that wants to extol reason as the highest form of human expression , that wants to ban religious symbols from public places and so on .
It can become quite dogmatic , which secularism does n’t have to be .
What about the idea that secularism , as a narrative of progress , has Protestant roots ?
If you mean the separation of church and state , then yes .
Because I think there was far more resistance from the Catholic Church — after all , the French revolution was fought against the power of the Catholic Church .
And so the Vatican as an institution was the much more established political source of real power and the Protestants were the dissidents .
So and I think it ’s also true to say that both in the U.S. and in many Protestant countries in Europe — such as , for example , the Netherlands — Christians were often the ones who insisted on separation of church and state to protect their faith from the encroachments of the state .
Whereas in France the Revolution was much more fought — and this is the idea of laïcité — to protect the secular state from the power of the Church .
And that was anti-Catholic , did n’t come from Catholics .
Yes , there is a strong Protestant base for the separation of powers .
There ’s an irony somehow in the Christian evangelical incursion into government in America .
The separation of church and state was supposed to be good for religion …
Yes .
Which is why the Protestants , especially the evangelicals , were in favor of it .
And it ’s something that Tocqueville saw when he was here — by taking religion out of the secular sphere of political power it can flourish undisturbed .
Which it has .
Does it seem to you that we ’re more religious than Europeans ?
Well yes , in the sense that a higher percentage of people profess belief in God ; a higher percentage of people regularly go to church ; and religion plays a much bigger part in politics — although I think that ’s relatively recent .
It had been quite quiet for a long time .
But yes , for sure , it ’s quite a contrast .
I wanted to ask about your use of the word liberalism .
It ’s such a slippery term — it ’s changed meaning in time .
In Europe when you talk about liberalism you can still on the whole take it to mean 19th - century laissez faire policies which are associated with conservatism , with the right .
And in America probably since the New Deal it ’s become synonymous with the left of center .
So it ’s almost come to mean the opposite .
Yet it can also mean free - spirited , liberal - minded , and so on .
I mean I think one thing that perhaps both meanings have in common — the laissez faire and the American progressive liberal sense — is that its enemies , people who deeply distrust it , distrust it partly because they think it ’s nihilistic , that liberalism is something for people who do n’t believe in anything .
And in the conservative 19th - century sense , people only believe in money , but do n’t hold any deeper values .
And in America it ’s people who are godless and acceptant , too tolerant of people who do n’t supposedly share our values .
So the enemies of liberalism , in all senses , have that in common .
And secular and liberal go together in that sense …
Yes , in the sense that a liberal does not promote any particular belief .
Which is not to say that a liberal does n’t believe in anything .
Liberals do believe in something , whether it ’s the 19th century variety or the American left - of - center variety .
But it does n’t seek to impose a particular belief on society at large .
And that ’s in some ways held against it by those who want society to be overtly Christian , or kick the Muslims out .
Can you say something about the new culture wars , or kulturkampf , in Europe now — about multiculturalism versus the defenders of “ enlightenment values ” ?
The difference is that the Right here , certainly the Tea Party kind of right , or Dick Armey , people like that , seek to impose religious values .
Whereas on the right in Europe , there are those people who talk nowadays about Judeo - Christianity ( whereas half a century ago they just talked about Christianity ) .
But many of them , even the more zealous populists who have an overtly anti-Islam agenda , do n’t talk about Christianity — they talk about the Enlightenment .
And the Enlightenment used to be associated with the left , with liberals .
But now , suddenly , defenders of the Enlightenment argue that the West stands for Enlightenment values and Muslims — religious Muslims — are challenging it , attacking it , undermining .
But my view is that they ’re using the Enlightenment as a kind of badge of what they see as Western civilization that has to be defended ; whereas exactly the same sort of people half a century ago talked about Christendom .
Because of secularization in Europe , and because the authority of the Church no longer holds much sway , the Enlightenment suddenly has been latched onto as a convenient badge of the West .
And the people who talk about defending Enlightenment values can be , and often are , former leftists .
And they can be cultural conservatives .
They ’ve found a common cause in their opposition to Islam .
And you see something like that here , where neo -conservatives who are secular and often used to be on the left , have found common cause against Islam with cultural conservatives .
The question of Islam is different here : we do n’t have an analogue to the idea of “ Eurabia . ”
Actually there are plenty of websites that promote that : David Horovitz , Daniel Pipes , Campus Watch , Christopher Hitchens , Paul Berman .
Do they share a discourse with European Islamophobes ?
Well someone like Berman is always quoting French intellectuals who are on that side , who see Islam as a great threat and so on — I ’m a great enemy to them .
Of course …
Well you say “ of course ” but it ’s slightly absurd .
The problem with the culture wars is that it ’s become increasingly difficult — and that ’s true here too — to have a real debate in good faith , where two sides hold different views but are both interested in finding the truth .
The kulturkampf leaves no room for that ; it only has room for friends and enemies and collaborators and resisters .
So if you argue , as some people do , that political Islam is such a threat to the West that it ’s really like being , as they like to say , “ 1938 all over again ” ; if we do n’t stand up to this new fascist danger then you ’re an appeaser , a collaborator .
And so , for example , I ’ve written quite a lot about the two most polarizing figures in this whole debate : Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Tariq Ramadan .
And I ’ve tried to find a nuanced position .
I agree with some things they say , disagree with other things they say ; I admire both for some reasons and am critical of both for some reasons .
But it ’s become so heated that saying anything critical about Ayaan immediately makes you into an enemy of enlightened values and anything good you might have to say about Tariq Ramadan makes you an appeaser and an Islamist .
And the people who say these things come from all political directions and they ’re not all cultural conservatives .
Sounds like you ’re finding this frustrating .
Well it is frustrating .
These issues are important and need to be really debated , not just become slanging matches and denunciations .
Is there anybody whose model you admire ?
There are many people .
I admire the French scholar of Islam Olivier Roy very much .
I think he ’s excellent .
There are many : Tony Judt , for example .
It ’s hard to get a nuanced view
Because it ’s become very emotive .
It ’s like discussing Israel .
It ’s very difficult to have a dispassionate reasonable difference of opinion on that because it ’s so loaded with all different kinds of emotions and associations and so on .
Again , the debate is poisoned by denunciation .
And I think that ’s very true of the debate on Islam — and of course the two debates are very linked .
Denunciation in the sense that you become an enemy on a political level ?
Because you supposedly support terrorism ?
Yes , that ’s one side of it .
The other side is that it is of course linked to Israel because a lot of the fervor in Islamist circles is at least nominally blamed on Israel , and the role of the West in Israel , and there ’s also ( though commonly denied ) , a lot of anti-Semitic rhetoric among Muslims .
So those who see themselves as defenders of Western civilization against the Islamic threat also often see themselves as defenders of Israel .
And they see their opponents often as either anti-Semites or people who close their eyes to anti-Semitism , or appease it out of cowardice .
As a journalist you ’ve had conversations with people on the farthest ends of the spectrum .
Yes , I ’ve never actually interviewed members of al Qaeda , as far as I know , but certainly fundamentalists .
But that ’s again , people often confuse that with violent revolutionaries .
You can be a fundamentalist and be perfectly peaceful .
Of course they overlap ; some violent revolutionaries are also fundamentalists — but one does n’t necessarily imply the other .
You talk about a type of Islam not rooted in traditional religion .
Well , that goes for almost all the new purist forms of Islam .
Because it ’s very influenced by Wahabism and it appeals especially to children of immigrants who are alienated from the traditions of their parents but do n’t feel accepted , for one reason or another , by the country of their birth .
So precisely because it is a kind of “ born - again ” form of Islam , very pure and global , it ’s not tied to any particular tradition .
So yes , it is a new form .
Pure and religion do n’t really go together , in practice , do they ?
Except new religions — they can be very purist .
You see that in Christianity too .
If you compare most evangelicals in the U.S. today with traditional priests in the Catholic church the evangelicals will tend to be more purist .
Saying it ’s modern does n’t necessarily make it enlightened .

Criticism of BP is mounting in the US over its handling of the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano urged BP to commit more resources to tackling the catastrophe .
Critics of the British oil giant also include President Barack Obama , who is due to travel to the region on Sunday to assess efforts to contain the spill .
The sprawling oil slick has begun washing up on the Louisiana coast and is threatening three other states .
Up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day are gushing into the sea after the BP - operated Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank last week .
BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward is flying to Louisiana later to personally oversee the emergency mop-up operation .
Two natural gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had halted production because of the slick and one of them had been evacuated as a safety precaution , the command centre co-ordinating the response said .
It said the gas production affected represented less than one - tenth of one per cent of the Gulf of Mexico 's daily total .
Wildlife casualties Analysts say the spill could rival the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst in US history .
BP is ultimately responsible
President Barack Obama
Oil spill : blame game begins BP in choppy waters after spill Voices : Gulf coast braced
In pictures : Spill threatens wildlife Mississippi , Alabama , Louisiana and Florida have all declared a state of emergency .
Animal rescue groups have been receiving their first patients - seabirds coated in oil .
Worsening weather conditions have been hampering efforts to contain the slick , now more than 130 miles ( 200 km ) long .
A BBC correspondent in the area says that at the moment the wind is keeping most of the oil offshore .
But the choppy seas mean that smaller boats that could help clean up the slick are unable to go out .
Forecasters also warned that strong winds over Sunday could push the oil into inlets , ponds and lakes in south - east Louisiana .
The homeland security secretary flew into Louisiana on Friday to deliver a stark message to BP , which had been leasing the rig .
" We continue to urge BP to leverage additional assets to help lead the response in this effort , " said Ms Napolitano .
After several unsuccessful attempts to plug the leak , she said , it was " time for BP to supplement their current mobilisation " .
ANALYSIS By Joe Lynam , BBC business correspondent
BP 's shareholders would probably prefer a few years out of the limelight after a five - year period in which the firm 's reputation has been blown about .
The fire at a Texas City refinery , the leak of an Alaskan gas pipeline and the sudden departure of former boss Lord Browne , have all been PR disasters .
But this Gulf of Mexico leak may surpass all of them .
Apart from the environmental catastrophe , £ 10 bn ( $ 15 bn ) was wiped off the value of Britain 's third - largest company this week .
And now we learn that BP is not even covered by any external insurance and will have to meet compensation claims from its own resources - at a cost of billions of dollars .
And that does not even put a price on the damage to the reputation of a company which describes itself as " Beyond Petroleum " .
Some 1,900 emergency workers and more than 300 ships and aircraft are being sent to the disaster zone , President Barack Obama has announced .
In a White House statement , he said BP was " ultimately responsible ... for paying the costs of response and clean - up operations " .
Correspondents says the White House is desperate to avoid the kind of disaster that Hurricane Katrina brought to the region in 2005 .
The president said he had asked Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to conduct a " thorough review " of the catastrophe and report back in 30 days on ways to prevent a repeat .
As the first strands of the slick reached the coast , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said the oil firm did not seem prepared for the clean - up job .
" I do have concerns that BP 's resources are not adequate , " he said .
The first lawsuits have already been filed on behalf of fisherman , in what could end up as a barrage of litigation .
BP spokeswoman Sheila Williams told AFP news agency the energy firm was prepared to assume costs for the clean - up and for damages .
The BBC 's business correspondent , Joe Lynam , says that BP has no external insurance cover in the traditional sense , instead using a form of " self insurance " to cover major events like this .
The company would therefore have to cover the full cost of any legitimate compensation claims from the oil spill from its own resources , our correspondent says .
The oil giant 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said it had mounted " the largest response effort ever done in the world " .
BP says it has begun using dispersants underwater in an attempt to break up the leaking oil at its source .
The oil giant has also dispatched remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve , so far without success .
The firm is also having a relief - well drilled to slow the leak , though experts say that could take up to three months .
Drilling on hold US Air Force planes have been deployed to spray oil - dispersing chemicals off the coast of Louisiana .

The US Navy and Louisiana National Guard have also been mobilised .
Fishermen - who face losing their livelihood from the spill - have been drafted in to help .
Wetlands off the Louisiana coast sustain hundreds of wildlife species and a major seafood and fishing industry .
The cause of last week 's blast , which left 11 workers missing , presumed dead , remains unclear .
It has emerged that BP last year downplayed the possibility of such a disaster at the offshore rig .
In BP 's 2009 exploration plan for the well , the firm suggested an oil spill was unlikely or virtually impossible , AP news agency reports .
The US government said on Friday it was putting on hold all new offshore drilling until the cause of the spill is investigated .
Last month , President Obama eased a moratorium on new offshore drilling .

If not now , when ?
For the first time the prize is within grasp .
The people have spoken – and none of the above won .
Radical reform to an electoral system that has fallen apart is at last on offer .
The deadly duopoly between two moribund parties has broken .
But will it be cobbled together again as if nothing had happened ?
All depends on the nerve of Nick Clegg .
Has he the spine and the iron resolve to stick to the one condition that offers a chance of a progressive future ?
As he cuts through the thickets of negotiations , his sword has been bent by seats lost , not won .
He is weakened by that grand surge that fell back to earth like a dead flare .
Why did that happen ?
Because he was crushed yet again by the boa constrictor first - past - the - post electoral system .
Yet again his party won a quarter of the votes but only a 10th of the seats .
People minded to vote Lib Dem understood the wicked ways of first past the post , and voted tactically – avoiding a wasted vote where Lib Dems could never win .
What else could they do ?
This is his once - in - a - generation chance to bring in the better politics that is the only point of his party .
Against him will be the nuclear arsenal of a press determined to blast him into submission to get Cameron into Downing Street , trumpeting bogus outrage .
Against him is the bad British tradition left by the warped first - past - the - post system that the " winner " takes all , even though Cameron has hardly more than a third of the vote .
To a country bewildered by the politics of hung parliaments , Cameron looks like the legitimate king .
But as many people refused to vote as voted Conservative .
A Lib / Lab coalition would command 53 % of the vote .
From the strength of Clegg 's resolve in those three debates , he seems to have the mettle to withstand the media blunderbuss .
Clegg is the guardian of the torch kept alight through eons of Lib Dem campaigns for electoral reform , through decades of meetings in dusty halls on wet Thursday nights , through the pamphlets , the petitions , the impassioned explanations on the doorsteps .
I was among those collecting a million signatures for reform after the 1983 election when the SDP - Liberal Alliance got a miserable handful of seats for the vote cast .
He cannot trade this core principle for the miserable mess of pottage offered by Cameron yesterday .
If the man was tempted by the trappings of office , would he be a Lib Dem at all ?
Cameron 's offer of an " all - party committee of inquiry " into political and electoral reform was about as generous as handing down his old clothes to the servants .
All he did was invite Clegg with lofty condescension to sign up to his own manifesto .
Go round the tradesman 's entrance and leave your muddy Europe , immigration and defence policies outside the door .
Clegg will surely not be doffing his cap in that direction .
Inadvertently , Cameron has legitimised the idea of a coalition .
By opening the bidding , he has made this an equal choice for Clegg .
With uncharacteristic elegance and courtesy , Gordon Brown said it is for Cameron and Clegg to see if they could form a government .
If Clegg finds the offer of outdoor work in Cameron 's garden is not for him , then an invitation for tea with best china in Downing Street , warmly greeted as an equal partner , might be more congenial .
There were those around Brown suggesting he should make a clunking assertion of his constitutional rights as primus inter pares and all that sham .
Wiser counsel prevailed .
Wait and see .
Let them talk .
" If Clegg signs up to what Cameron and Osborne plan , he signs his suicide note , " said one cabinet minister .
So Clegg picks his way across the minefield .
Would he rather be torn to shreds by the Cameron cuts or blown up for keeping a most unpopular prime minister in power who has just lost the election ?
There is only one path through that saves him from annihilation – a guarantee that whomever he sustains in power will give him that referendum , so that at the next election a fairer voting system will give him the seats to match his votes .
But how shoddily self - interested that looks – a stitch - up selling himself to the highest bidder almost as bad as the gerrymander that Cameron plans by cutting 10 % of ( other people 's ) seats .
Are the Liberal Democrats as squalid as the rest , only interested in carving out their slice of the Westminster action ?
That 's how it may look .
That 's what worries Clegg 's party .
But he should raise his sights .
Look up and see the chance for a progressive coalition with Labour of a quite unexpected kind .
This curious time has made things possible that were unthinkable a month ago .
Labour is tumbling through an internal revolution of remarkable dimensions .
Has the world turned upside down ?
When Charlie Whelan – ruthless old tribalist , Gordon Brown 's fixer and disreputable arm - twister – astonishingly announced yesterday that he had converted overnight to proportional representation , you knew the earth had moved , with great cracks opening up in the old politics .
The buzz among cabinet ministers and others yesterday was of a coalition of the heart , not of mere opportunism .
Take the best of the Lib Dem and Labour manifestos and they blend well , better than either on it is own .
Compass , the centre - left lobby , sees this as the most radical programme .
There are not many policy sticking points .
The great stumbling block is the same as ever – Gordon Brown .
Can they ally themselves with him ?
Had he bowed out long ago , Labour might not have lost under a new leader .
But there he is , and there is no removing him now .
The legitimacy of a Lib - Lab coalition depends on the Queen calling on him .
It stretches credulity to see the man from the tight cabal opening up , yet the formal workings of a coalition force it on him .
Out there the markets rattle at sterling , FTSE and government bonds , with Greece and New York sending out shockwaves .
The timing could hardly be worse .
An alliance of losers in a huddle , cobbling together some arcane new electoral system , is unlikely to calm the febrile traders .
Besides , all through the election the Conservatives '
City friends have done all they could to spook voters into fearing coalitions , though coalitions offer the most stable economies across Europe .
Imagine the reassuring sight of Alistair Darling and Vince Cable working together to steady the markets , deciding together how to cut the deficit with the least damage and the fairest tax rises .
Those who believe in electoral reform want exactly this kind of open pluralism .
To make it happen , join the electoral reform protest in Trafalgar Square today at 2 pm .

I spent the last week of April in Leogane , Haiti , volunteering with Hands On Disaster Response ( HODR ) .
The trip was definitely out of my comfort zone and definitely changed my perspective , as I explain in these posts .
In the present article I want to focus on the economic lessons from my week in Haiti .
Economic Laws Work in Haiti
I realize this may strike cosmopolitan readers as silly , but as the plane touched down in Port - au - Prince my first thought was , " How about that , the laws of physics are the same in Haiti . "
Of course I was being facetious , but I had been given a most frightful lecture from the international travel clinic nurse when getting my vaccinations .
She had me thinking that Haiti was on a different planet , and that I would n't be able to survive in this strange new place .
That 's why I started to relax when I observed that the plane landed on the runway , and taxied to the gate , just like I had experienced so many times on domestic flights .
You could look out the plane window at the sky and the ground , and things looked pretty much the way they did in the " First World country " back home .
During my visit , I collected examples showing that the laws of economics still worked in Haiti , too .
To repeat , it 's not that I intellectually doubted this beforehand .
After all , basic economic principles are based on the logic of scarcity and human action , and are the same for Americans in 2010 as they are for Haitians or for Romans in 350 for that matter .
Currency Exchange
Even so , it was refreshing to see these laws at work .
For example , the newcomers to the HODR base quickly learned from the others which bars had good exchange rates for US dollars , and which places " ripped you off . "
For the latter places — or if you wanted to buy souvenirs — it was far more sensible to first change your dollars for the local currency .
I had never really thought about it before , but as I waited for my friend to swap $ 40 at the official currency exchange , I realized that this business survived through economies of scale .
That is , this particular guy offered slightly more goud per US dollar than you would get if you tried to pay with US dollars with most merchants in the neighborhood .
Now presumably this guy was n't performing the service out of altruism ; he must have actually been earning a small spread relative to the " official " exchange rate that he himself exploited .
But because his superior rates attracted far more US dollars than the other establishments , he made up for the smaller spread with higher volume .
In contrast , the other merchants — who were in the business of selling fruit or paintings , not in the business of currency exchange — would also accept US dollars as a service to their customers , but they would charge a higher price to make it worth their while .
After all , by accepting a foreign currency they would have the extra hassle of having to periodically go to the currency exchange themselves to convert their receipts back into goud .
In a sense , the currency - exchange guy was like a grocery store selling a package of Twizzlers at a much cheaper price than a movie theater would charge for " the same thing . "
One place where it was deemed acceptable to directly spend your US dollars was the bar right across from our base .
On any given night , the crowd of about 30 people consisted of 5 local Haitian guys , and 25 relief workers — mostly Americans .
( In addition to our group , some doctors and nurses from the nearby field hospital would often stop by . )
Because he was in such a prime spot to attract American customers , the owner ( Joe ) had decided to offer a " fair " exchange rate for people paying in US dollars .
Those of us ( like me ) who were quite timid at first , and did n't want to venture far from the base , could thus feel comfortable buying beers for about $ 1.25 each from Joe without looking like saps in front of our more adventurous peers .
Government vs. Markets
Before my trip , I had dealt with the typical observation that there had been " anarchy " in Haiti after the earthquake , and so obviously Rothbardian anarchists were idiots .
I would like to say that my firsthand experience confirmed for me the problems of foreign military occupation , but in truth I barely saw any soldiers in Leogane ( which is 18 miles west of Port - au - Prince ) .
I saw the occasional UN truck , but for the most part Leogane was quite peaceful and did n't even have many police officers .
I suppose in that respect this supports my view that foreign troops were n't necessary to impose law and order , but to repeat I did n't really observe anything that shed light on this issue .
However , if we set aside the issue of law enforcement and focus on more conventional services , then I definitely did observe the impotence of government and the vitality of the market .
Any service that was nominally supplied by the government — including electricity , water , and garbage removal — was basically nonexistent .
Moreover , it was n't simply a matter of the earthquake ; I got the sense that many , perhaps most , of the locals had n't had electricity beforehand , either .
One of the most amusing moments ( at least in my eyes ) occurred when I was talking with an older engineer from Seattle .
Now this was a very cool guy ; when he asked if I had read the State Department warning about Haiti , after I said yes he shook my hand and said , " Congratulations , you did n't listen to your government . "
Yet despite this laudable outlook on life , this engineer had an unshakeable faith in the ability of good government to help people .
He was the one who explained just how awful the infrastructure ( ostensibly the responsibility of the local government ) was , even before the earthquake .
And then someone asked him , " Hey , how is it possible that that streetlight is on , when we know the power is out ? "
The engineer responded matter - of - factly , " Oh , Joe must have it hooked up to his generator to attract customers to the bar . "
My friend did n't see the contradiction with his expressed views .
Incidentally , it occurred to me that maybe the local government was simply nonexistent , as opposed to being merely ineffective .
I asked a few people if the government collected tax revenues , and one engineer said something like , " Well I do n't know the specific numbers , but they must , because you can see all the unfinished houses . "
Apparently the tax code was based on completed houses , and so the residents of Leogane would make sure their buildings were in a perpetual state of construction , legally speaking .
Building Codes
After the earthquake in Haiti killed hundreds of thousands , while comparable earthquakes in the United States simply knock out utilities , some bloggers concluded that the Haitians lacked proper building codes .
In other words , they needed more intrusive government to protect them from the next earthquake .
The free - market response , of course , is that the disaster in Haiti was the result of their relative poverty .
Simply put , it 's more expensive to construct a building that can withstand an intense earthquake , and so richer countries have the luxury of insisting that their buildings are relatively safe .
Imposing US building codes in Haiti would n't have saved hundreds of thousands of people ; it would simply have made them homeless all these years .
Part of the HODR camp was a group of engineers who went from house to house , telling the Haitians whether they could safely move from the tents ( provided by relief organizations ) back into their homes .
You see , even those Haitians whose homes did n't collapse were afraid to sleep in their residences because of the aftershocks .
The engineers told us that it was very rewarding when they could actually tell a particular family that their house was fine and would n't collapse on them .
Anyway , I tried several times to get the engineers to come down one way or the other on this dispute about building codes .
For sure , they agreed that the Haitian structures were not well designed , according to US standards .
But I would press them , asking , " Sure , but is it poorly designed because they needed to keep it cheap , or are you saying they could make them earthquake - proof for the same amount of money ? "
Unfortunately , I never really got a definitive answer to this question .
The engineers just were n't thinking about the issue the way I was framing it , as an economist .
They would keep repeating that the Haitian builders did it that way " because that 's how it has always been done , " an observation that by itself does n't tell us whether the way it 's always been done is sensible or not , given the financial constraints .
Without putting words in their mouths , I think it is fair to summarize the opinion of the engineers like this :
Yes , the Haitian people are just plain poor , and there 's no way outside advisors can expect them to revamp their architectural standards or their operating rooms up to US standards overnight .
Having said that , there are plenty of quick fixes that government officials and other leaders could implement , in order to make things run more smoothly .
( In fact , that 's one of the main reasons for Western engineers and doctors to go to Haiti in the first place . )
Yet even so , this " low - hanging fruit " exists in part because of the inferior training of the Haitian engineers and medical staff .
So it 's true , there are obvious " inefficiencies " in the way Haiti runs , and if it were suddenly populated by professional Americans — even if they only had the tools that the Haitians currently work with — things would be running much more efficiently within a few months .
But is this really such a surprising observation ?
After all , one of the most important " tools " of a modern economy is the so - called human capital of its population .
In summary , I think the explanation for Haiti 's vulnerability to a major earthquake is that they are very poor , and could n't afford safer buildings .
Cultural Obstacles to Recovery
I hesitated on writing this section , because it can come off as a cynical " blaming the victim . "
But I can't avoid commenting on something that really struck me .
During my short visit , one of the major themes relayed to us from the Haitians who interacted with our base was that the locals viewed us with suspicion .
In particular , when they would see a team of HODR volunteers engaging in literal hard labor , using sledgehammers and wheelbarrows to remove rubble from a collapsed residence , many of the Haitians apparently resented the fact that we were " stealing their jobs . "
In other words , the Haitians — where unemployment is apparently 90 percent — thought they should be getting paid to remove the rubble from their collapsed homes .
When those who were affiliated with HODR would explain to the people that we were all volunteers , some of them were still suspicious .
They speculated that even if we were n't being paid right then , we would probably be paid when we returned back home .
Now here 's what struck me about all this : is n't it incredible that after their neighborhoods got wiped out , and hundreds of thousands of Haitians died , that many Haitians were apparently devoting a lot of mental effort to speculating on how much we were getting paid to cart away their rubble ?
( Ironically , when I got back to Nashville , I heard a lady complaining on a local radio talk show that illegal immigrants were signing up for the paid positions to clean up the flooded Opry Mills mall , thereby " stealing jobs that could have gone to Tennesseans . "
So the Haitians are n't unique in this respect . )
Please note , I 'm not whining about a lack of gratitude ; my purpose in going to Haiti was n't to get a pat on the head from someone who just lost his house and possibly much of his family .
But what I am saying is that it makes sense , in a perverse way , that Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere .
If this is the predominant mindset , how could anyone start a successful business ?
I would imagine the jealousy and gossip of his neighbors would be unbearable .
The Strengths and Weaknesses of Not-for - Profits
I had gone to Haiti expecting to be shaken by the extreme poverty , or perhaps to learn the transience of material objects and gain a newfound appreciation for the truly important things .
I did experience those things , but not in the profound manner I had expected — and perhaps because that 's what I went looking for .
In contrast , what I had n't expected to discover was my tremendous respect for the young people who lived at the HODR base .
Many of them had committed to much longer stays than I had , and what was really impressive was that many had pushed back their departure dates , because once they got to Haiti they did n't want to leave .
( I confess that I did not share their feelings . )
What really struck me was how fearless some of these young people were .
For example , I worked with a young woman who not only had more stamina with a sledgehammer ( in literally 100 + degree heat ) than I did , but she also felt completely safe in Haiti because she had previously been working at a refugee camp in Africa that was in danger of being attacked by armed rebels .
As she nonchalantly relayed this information , I suddenly felt quite embarrassed for worrying about malaria .
I can honestly report that I have never been associated with such a dedicated , hardworking group of people as the volunteers at HODR .
If you are the type of person who wanted to donate money after the earthquake , but were afraid of being a sucker , then let me reassure you that these people are n't using the money to fund vacations for college kids .
However , despite their dedication and enthusiasm , the HODR volunteers were plagued by the problems of nonmarket organizations .
Consider the main allocation problem : given that the base had about 85 people at any given time , what jobs should they perform , to best help the community ?
The trained engineers , obviously , should do something related to their expertise , though even that does n't fully answer the question .
But what of the unskilled workers ( which included me , in this context ) ?
For example , the three main tasks I performed during the week were removing rubble , building emergency shelters ( using PVC pipe and shrink - wrap for boats ) , and cleaning the HODR base .
These were all useful services ; in the abstract , the more homes that were cleared out , the more shelters that were built , and the cleaner the HODR base , the better the world was .
Yet this does n't answer the crucial , quantitative question : how many volunteers should be assigned to each task , each day ?
Taking one person off rubble and switching him to shelter construction would slightly reduce the speed with which we cleared away a homeowner 's land , but the benefit would be more shelters for homeless people .
However , we knew that the shelters would not survive once the hurricane season came .
Also , once we have decided how many volunteers should remove rubble each day , how do we determine which sites to hit first ?
For example , we worked on a very large site and a few of the volunteers wondered aloud whether we should have just cleared away space for a modest - sized home , and then moved on to other families , rather than spending an entire week clearing all the rubble from the large piece of property .
Another problem was that the labor itself was placed on a volunteer basis , even within the day - to - day operations .
In other words , the HODR staff would assign team leaders for each project , and allocate the number of spots each job required .
But then the volunteers would place their magnets on the board under the job that interested them .
There was no system in place to ensure that , say , the two different rubble crews had a good mix of the seasoned hands and green recruits .
In the grand scheme , I do n't know that the HODR system could have improved its operations in light of the above problems .
I had toyed with ideas such as having team leaders keep track of how many wheelbarrows of rubble they removed each day , in order to see which leader 's approach ( which included the decision of where to attack the rubble pile , and how many wheelbarrows etc. to bring to the site ) was the most efficient .
I had also brainstormed for ways of allowing mutually beneficial trades .
For example , a person who loved meat and did n't mind cleaning the toilets could offer to do the standard chores for someone else with opposite preferences .
As it was , this type of thing would be frowned upon .
( When vegetarians would trade away their one piece of chicken , the cook explained that she had only been preparing enough meat for the meat eaters , and so vegetarians had to stop doing this . )
In reality , I think most of my " improvements " would have been more trouble than they were worth .
As with everything else in Haiti , the HODR operation itself was an excellent example of constrained optimization .
As one of the charismatic team leaders would say , whenever we hit a bump and he almost got thrown from the back of the pickup truck , " C'est la vie ; it 's Haiti . "
Conclusion
In my brief time in Haiti , I saw the laws of economics at work .
Entrepreneurs rushed to satisfy customers , as proven by the owners of motorcycles who suddenly became taxi drivers after the roads were filled with rubble .
Government , in contrast , completely failed to deliver promised services to the people .
I was pleasantly surprised to see that the " nongovernmental organizations , " at least the one I worked for , were filled with some of the most interesting people I have ever met .
Although outsiders can definitely provide emergency relief , and even long - term advice , ultimately Haiti will remain mired in poverty so long as the majority retains their current hostility to open competition and commerce .
My lesson in using the word “ b ’y ” generated such a great response , I decided to do another .
This is actually a word I ’ve never heard used before , but my friend Matt assures me it ’s real .
While you may decide not to use it in everyday conversation , it ’s just too lovely to pass up .
Nunny - fudger .
According to the Dictionary of Newfoundland English , a “ nunny - fudger ” means : denoting primarily a man who is thinking more of his dinner than of his work , hence generally a man who , from selfish regard to his own interest or comfort , shirks his duty .
I ca n’t think of a more insulting word to use to describe men like this .
“ Nunny ” suggest someone who is a “ ninny , ” or “ nanny , ” or some other emasculating adjective ; and “ fudger ” immediately brings to mind a “ fudge - packer . ”
What you have here is a Sissy Flamer .
Sorry , it seems in an effort to teach you about nunny - fudgers , I ’ve become one myself .
Here are some sentences you can practice with :
“ Jarge , stop being a nunny - fudger and tend to the chickens . ”
“ He ’s a nunny - fudgin ’ , no - good - for - nothing , son of a bitch . ”
Sounds innocent , but it delivers that Newfie punch .
Bonus points if you combine the last lesson with this one :
“ Stop being such a nunny - fudger b’y , we got things to do . ”
Next up : the pluralization of words that should never be pluralized .

Carbon balls
A new method converts waste plastics such as grocery bags to pure carbon microspheres .
Plastic grocery bags are handy and durable , but after the bread and milk are put away , most of the bags wind up in landfills .
Now Vilas Pol , a materials scientist at Argonne National Laboratory , has found a way to " upcycle " discarded plastics into carbon microspheres , which could play important roles in consumer products , such as toner and paint ( Environ Sci . Technol .
DOI 10.1021/es100243u ) .
Pol 's idea was inspired by a 2007 ban on plastic grocery bags in San Francisco .
To eliminate the need for such bans , he wanted to figure out a way to give bags a second life after they were used , abused , and thrown out .
Recycling is not the solution , Pol says .
For recycling to yield chemically pure products , Pol points out that plastics made of different polymers must be separated — an extra step that is not often taken .
Instead ,
Pol wants to upcycle waste plastics into more - valuable products .
So , he developed a method in which hydrocarbon polymers , even mixtures , produce carbon microspheres .
For the new method , he places waste plastics , such as polyethylene bags and disposable polystyrene cups , into a closed , heatable reactor .
Using mass spectrometry , Pol found that at 700 °C , the chemical bonds between the carbons and hydrogens break down .
The products are solid carbon , as well as hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases .
Pol says that the upcycling process could provide an environmentally friendly alternative to typical methods that produce solid carbon .
He generates the same product but starts with discarded plastics instead of fossil fuels .
Using electron microscopy , Pol found that the carbon product takes the form of microspheres with diameters in the range of 3 to 10 μm .
The microspheres are paramagnetic and conductive , making them suitable , Pol says , for incorporation in tires , toner , paints , and lubricants , as well as in anode materials for rechargeable batteries .
Microspheres made of other materials , such as glass and polymers , already find commercial use in many products .
But Raymond Teller , an environmental scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , warns that commercial applications may be far off .
" There is no well - established market use for carbon microspheres , " he says .
" That is not to say that there are n't excellent potential uses for this material ; however , a viable product line has yet to be identified . "
Pol , however , says that he is working with several companies that are interested in licensing the technology and developing applications .
Ocean acidification has been called " global warming 's evil twin " which apparently admits that if global warming existed as a twin , it would be a good one .
Is ocean acidification a problem ?
Some of the biggest unknowns hide in biology which is not exactly my field but I have spent whole days with it , too .
Concerning the figures that are normally listed and that describe the changing pH of the oceans , I have almost no doubt that they 're pretty much correct .
See
Since 1751 to 1994 , the oceans ' pH went down from 8.180 to 8.105 or so .
The neutral level of pH is 7 .
The pH scale is logarithmic : the actual concentration of H3O + ions is proportional to 10 ^{ - pH} while the concentration of the OH - ions is inversely proportional to the same thing or directly proportional to 10 ^{ +
pH} .
The changing pH can be traced to the changing concentration of CO2 , and the corresponding ions in water , which pretty easily follows the changes in the atmosphere , by Henry 's law and some simple chemistry looking at a few chemical reactions , at least in the short run ( in the long run , the extra CO2 in the oceans is being consumed ) .
It is not hard to estimate that the pH indeed has changed by something like almost 0.1 in the last 200 years .
There are very good reasons why chemistry uses this logarithmic pH scale - simply because in typical situations , the possible concentrations of ions go over many decades - they often change multiplicatively by many orders of magnitude ( i.e. their logarithms change linearly ) - and their products are often required to be constant for chemical equilibrium .
Now , it can be argued that in 100 - 150 years , the oceans ' pH will go to 7.9 or so , under business as usual .
It will certainly stay alkaline .
But I think that all these qualitative changes are extremely likely , almost obvious .
The only question is whether it threatens anyone , or life in the oceans in general .
I think that the obvious answer is No .
As everyone with an aquarium knows , virtually all fish do n't care about the change of pH by 0.5 .
Most fish actually can live anywhere in pH between 5 and 9 .
And e.g. ornate rainbowfish can exist in water as acidic as orange juice , see an article in Australia 's ABC , which is 3.5 or so .
But the Coca - Cola is more acidic , near 2.5 , and the fish could have some trouble to live in it .
Nevertheless , the concentrations of H3O + and OH - ions in orange juice - which is still OK for those fish - differ by 6 orders of magnitude from the concentrations in the current ocean !
The concentrations of ions are tiny , anyway : it 's the water itself that matters most .
You should n't miss the forest behind the tree .
Now , these were fish .
Obviously , no problems await them .
I had to look at other things such as plankton , coral reefs , etc .
You will find some diversity of the preferred values of pH and a shift of pH by 0.2 could affect the composition of the species in the ocean .
However , it 's surely not able to threaten any major family of organisms in the ocean .
In average , I think that the marine life would enjoy a drop of pH from 8.1 to 7.9 .
It should n't be too surprising that I think that the optimum pH for an average marine organism is 7.0 - the pH neutral level - and we have no chance to drop this low by burning fossil fuels because that would essentially need to multiply the CO2 concentrations in the air by a factor of ten .
( It 's actually closer to 100 because there are many other ions aside from the CO2 - related ones in the ocean . )
To summarize , I am 99.99 % certain that there is no problem of " ocean acidification " worth talking about .
Every year , the average pH is changing by 0.002 or so .
No single organism with lifetime comparable to human life or shorter can possibly detect the change .
Only the systems - coral reefs - that live for a longer time need to be watched .
But there are good reasons to be certain that the slight drop of pH has no significant negative impact on them , either .
Exploring the Phantoms ' Entry Draft
May 21 , 2010 - United States Hockey League ( USHL ) - Youngstown
Phantoms News Release
YOUNGSTOWN , Ohio - While the United States Hockey League employs a " pro-style " drafting process , the reality is that in the USHL , the effects of a given Entry Draft can be felt much more quickly and profoundly than in the professional ranks .
Therefore , in the aftermath of what the Youngstown Phantoms ' Hockey Operations staff deemed a good Futures Draft on Tuesday , Wednesday 's Entry Draft results will dramatically shape next season 's roster as the club tries to make the jump to championship level in its second season .
Judging from the positive mood in the Phantoms ' " war room " both during and following the 21 - round Entry Draft , the expectation is that the team 's sophomore effort in the league will be much different from the first go - around .
To help explain the optimism , Phantoms Assistant GM / Director of Player Personnel Jason Koehler described the attributes of the 18 promising players selected in the Entry Draft and why they are candidates to wear the Purple and Orange in the fall :
John Fritsche - Round 1 , No. 2 Overall Position : Forward Height / Weight : 6'0/190 Date of Birth : 9-3-91 Hometown : Parma , Ohio Previous Team : Alpena ( Mich . ) IceDiggers ( North American Hockey League ) Koehler Says : " We 're really excited to have him .
He 's an outstanding piece to our championship puzzle for next season .
He hits , competes , battles , blocks shots and does all the little things .
John will complement our strong group of returning forwards . "
Chris Eisermann - Round 5 , No. 62 Overall Position : Goaltender Height / Weight : 6'2/200 Date of Birth : 7-28-93 Hometown : Newburyport , Massachusetts Previous Team : New Hampshire Monarchs ( Eastern Junior Hockey League ) Koehler Says : " We were looking for a quality young goalie who could step right in and compete for the starting job .
Chris has seen his stock rise dramatically this past year .
Out East , Eisermann is probably the best NHL draft candidate among goalies . "
Jordan Young - Round 6 , No. 77 Overall Position : Defenseman Height / Weight : 5 '10/180 Date of Birth : 5-12 -92 Hometown : Cave Creek , Arizona Previous Team : Wenatchee ( Wash . )
Wild ( NAHL ) Koehler Says : " Jordan comes from a non-traditional market , but played for the very well - respected P.F. Chang 's team .
Last year , he walked in and was part of perhaps the best defensive corps in the NAHL as a high school senior .
He 's a very smart , effective , mobile defenseman who plays bigger than he is .
He 'll continue to develop and become a Division I college defenseman . "
Ricky DeRosa - Round 7 , No. 92 Overall Position : Center Height / Weight : 6'2/175 Date of Birth : 2-9-92 Hometown : Aston , Pennsylvania Previous Team : Philadelphia Jr. Flyers AAA Koehler Says : " He was the best player of his age out of Philadelphia last year .

As a first - year guy , he was one of the highest - scoring defensemen in the league .
We feel he comes right in and can use his size , strength and skill to good effect in this league . "
Michael Zalewski - Round 9 , No. 122 Overall Position : Center Height / Weight : 6'2/195 Date of Birth : 8-18 -92 Hometown : New Hartford , New York Previous Team : Syracuse ( N.Y. )
Stars ( EJHL ) Koehler Says : " Michael was one of the top first - year high school players in the EJHL this season .
He was the No. 1 center for the Stars and is currently ranked by NHL Central Scouting .
He has good bloodlines ; his older brother [ Steven ] was drafted by the NHL's San Jose Sharks . "
Quinn Smith - Round 10 , No. 137 Overall Position : Center Height / Weight : 5'9/170 Date of Birth : 1-11 - 92 Hometown : Fairfield , Connecticut Previous Team : Avon Old Farms School ( Conn . ) Koehler Says : " Quinn was one of the top players in prep hockey this year .
He was the No. 1 center at prestigious Avon Old Farms last year .
We 're talking a very speedy , very slick competitor who brings a lot of energy .
He plays a smart , two - way game .
He 's committed to Boston College for 2011 . "
Mike Ambrosia - Round 11 , No. 152 Overall Position : Right Wing Height / Weight : 5'10/170 Date of Birth : 5-25-92 Hometown : Chatham , New Jersey Previous Team : Delbarton School ( N.J. ) Koehler Says : " Mike was part of a dominant line in New Jersey prep hockey that won a state championship .
He is a very good , effective , two - way winger who plays a bigger game than his size would dictate .
He has goal scoring ability but can also make plays and create offense .
He 's committed to Princeton for 2012 . "
Jeffrey Stenglein - Round 12 , No. 167 Overall Position : Left Wing Height / Weight : 6'0/190 Date of Birth : 7-11 -93 Hometown : Rochester , New York Previous Team : Maksymum Hockey ( Empire Junior Hockey League ) Koehler Says : " Jeffrey 's a good sleeper candidate for us .
He 's a power forward who played center in the Empire League and was one of the league 's leading scorers and penalty minute guys .
He 's simply a competitor and we 're excited about what he can turn into . "
Darcy Greenaway - Round 13 , No. 182 Overall Position : Left Wing Height / Weight : 5 '10/180 Date of Birth : 1-19 - 93 Hometown : Odessa , Ontario , Canada Previous Team : Lake Forest Academy ( Ill . ) Koehler Says : " This guy has consistently produced at an unbelievable level at Lake Forest Academy .
He 's a pure goal scorer who just fires away .
You could almost count on two goals a game from him at the prep school level .
He was better than most of the AAA [ midget ] left wingers out there . "
Alex Temby - Round 14 , No. 197 Overall Position : Defenseman Height / Weight : 6'0/190 Date of Birth : 11-10 - 92 Hometown : Littleton , Colorado Previous Team : Colorado Thunderbirds AAA Koehler Says : " Alex was one of the top AAA midget defenseman out there , playing for the Thunderbirds team that advanced to nationals .
He has the size , physicality and mobility to be a sharp young defenseman in this league .
We were very happy to get him as late as we did . "
Brian Harris - Round 15 , No. 212 Overall Position : Defenseman Height / Weight : 5'9/185 Date of Birth : 7-19 - 92 Hometown : Bridgewater , Massachusetts Previous Team : Boston Advantage AAA Koehler Says : " In my opinion , Brian was one of the best midget AAA defenseman in the country .
He 's feisty , he 's skilled , he 's everything you want in a smaller defenseman .
Coaches Joe Lovell and Joe Bracken from the Boston Advantage team have done a great job with him . "
Chris Bradley - Round 16 , No. 227 Overall Position : Defenseman Height / Weight : 6'2/185 Date of Birth : 1-1-93 Hometown : Buffalo , New York Previous Team : Buffalo Regals AAA Koehler Says : " Chris was one of the top defensemen in our region playing for the well - respected Buffalo Regals program .
He is an outstanding competitor and a character leader .
We could see him wearing a letter on one of our jerseys sometime in the future . "
Ryan Belonger - Round 17 , No. 242 Overall Position : Center / Right Wing Height / Weight : 5 '11/180 Date of Birth : 5 - 5- 92 Hometown : Green Bay , Wisconsin Previous Team : St. Louis Bandits ( NAHL ) Koehler Says : " Ryan was one of the top young forwards in the NAHL and he fit in well with an older talented group in St. Louis .
He is a power forward who generally played on St. Louis ' top two lines despite his young age . "
Teemu Tiitinen - Round 18 , No. 257 Overall Position : Forward Height / Weight : 5 '11/170 Date of Birth : 3-21-92 Hometown : Suwanee , Georgia Previous Team : Dallas Stars AAA Koehler Says : " Teemu was born in Finland but has been in the United States for awhile .
He played for the TPH Thunder initially , which has been doing a really good job developing hockey talent in the South .
He moved over last year to the Dallas Stars program , and I thought he was their top forward .
He has speed and energy and you know what you 're getting from him every period of every game . "
Peter McIntyre - Round 19 , No. 272 Overall Position : Left Wing Height / Weight : 6'4/180 Date of Birth : 11-22-91 Hometown : Norfolk , Massachusetts Previous Team : South Shore Kings ( EJHL ) Koehler Says : " Peter is a pro-style winger who started the season with the Boston Advantage .

He has an NHL - caliber release to his shot .
You get him the puck and it 'll be in the net , and that 's an ability you can't teach .
He 's a high - end talent who looks to develop into a top - line forward for us . "
J.T. Miller - Round 21 , No. 312 Overall Position : Left Wing Height : 6'1/190 Date of Birth : 3-14-93 Hometown : East Palestine , Ohio Previous Team : U.S. National Team Development Program ( Under - 17 ) Koehler Says : " J.T.

Exploring the Phantoms ' Entry Draft - Youngstown Phantoms
The opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it , and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff .
Jon Stewart slammed Arizona Monday for passing a new law that would require citizens to carry proof of residency papers — a measure he likened to slavery - era laws requiring African Americans to show their papers to prove that they were free .
“ It ’s the same thing free black people had to do in 1863 , ” Stewart remarked .
“ Lord knows that did n’t leave any residual anger . ”

He deemed the arid Grand Canyon State the “ meth lab of democracy . ”
Stewart pointed out even former Republican congressman Tom Tancredo , “ the man Mexican parents tell their kids about to get them to eat their vegetables , thought it was going too far .
Arizona , that ’s gotta tell you something .
It would be like Ted Nugent pleading with you to put down the guns and talk this thing out . ”

The move could have implications across Europe
The Irish Republic has begun a piracy crackdown which could see customers cut off from the net for a year .
The country 's biggest net firm Eircom has begun sending letters to those identified as illegal file - sharers .
It is the first nation to implement such a system .
France is also planning to introduce a similar policy .
UK watchdog Ofcom is due to publish its code of conduct for how UK ISPs should deal with net pirates later this week .
Educational campaign
Eircom is the Republic 's largest internet service provider ( ISP ) , accounting for around 40 % of the market .
The Irish Recorded Music Association ( Irma ) has begun supplying Eircom with " thousands of IP addresses " , from which the ISP will initially cross-reference about 50 per week to extract the physical address of identified net pirates .
The European Parliament has been talking about internet access as a basic human right .
It absolutely is not .
Dick Doyle , Director general , Irma
Irma is employing net monitoring firm Dtecnet to trawl file - sharing sites and identify pirates .
It will look specifically for people who are sharing , rather than just downloading , content illegally .
Initially they will be sent a letter and a follow - up phone call from a new unit set up by Eircom to deal with the issue .
They may also get a pop-up warning on their screen .
If they are identified a third time they will have their service withdrawn for a week and , if a fourth infringement occurs , will be cut off for a year .
" There is a strong educational element , it could be that customers have a security issue with their home wi- fi or they might not know what kids are doing online , " said Eircom spokesman Paul Bradley .
The unit will also direct customers to legal alternatives .
" We are launching an online music service later this year , " he added .
Court action
After three months the effect of the campaign will be assessed and , if necessary , tougher measures including permanent disconnection could be introduced .
" We do n't expect many people to get to phase 3 and we are a long way from looking at suspensions , " said Dick Doyle , the director general of Irma .
The pilot scheme is the conclusion of a long - running dispute between Eircom and Irma .
It took the ISP to court in January 2009 , saying it was not doing enough to protect the intellectual property of its members .
These include EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner .
The High Court ruled in Irma 's favour and a challenge , issued by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner , was also over - ruled earlier this year .
Irma plans to take other Irish ISPs to court .
UPC , the country 's second largest ISP will be in court on 17 June and two smaller ISPs will receive summons later this week .
Mr Doyle believes the tough stance taken by Irma will have implications across Europe .
" The European Parliament has been talking about internet access as a basic human right .
It absolutely is not .
Intellectual property protection is a right , " he said .
So what does it all tell us ?

It is tempting , faced with the full - frontal assault of quantum weirdness , to trot out the notorious quote from Nobel prize - winning physicist Richard Feynman : “ Nobody understands quantum mechanics . ”
It does have a ring of truth to it , though .
The explanations attempted here use the most widely accepted framework for thinking about quantum weirdness , called the Copenhagen interpretation after the city in which Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg thrashed out its ground rules in the early 20th century .
With its uncertainty principles and measurement paradoxes , the Copenhagen interpretation amounts to an admission that , as classical beasts , we are ill - equipped to see underlying quantum reality .
Any attempt we make to engage with it reduces it to a shallow classical projection of its full quantum richness .
Lev Vaidman of Tel Aviv University , Israel , like many other physicists , touts an alternative explanation .
“ I do n’t feel that I do n’t understand quantum mechanics , ” he says .
But there is a high price to be paid for that understanding – admitting the existence of parallel universes .
In this picture , wave functions do not “ collapse ” to classical certainty every time you measure them ; reality merely splits into as many parallel worlds as there are measurement possibilities .
One of these carries you and the reality you live in away with it .
“ If you do n’t admit many - worlds , there is no way to have a coherent picture , ” says Vaidman .
Or , in the words of Feynman again , whether it is the Copenhagen interpretation or many - worlds you accept , “ the ‘ paradox ’ is only a conflict between reality and your feeling of what reality ought …
It is now tax time , so consider also this : income from hedge funds is not taxed as ordinary income , but as capital gains , 15 % .
As a teacher at the upper end of the pay scale , my incremental rate is 28 % , or almost twice the rate of the income from surplus funds of the rich placed in hedge funds .
And of course I pay 7.65 % in payroll taxes , making my burden 35.65 % compared to the 15 % on the earnings from investments in hedge funds .
I think we face a crisis in this country .
This year rather than hiring hundreds of thousands of new teachers to teach our young , the future of this nation , schools will be laying off tens of thousands of teachers , increasing class sizes , dropping electives , eliminating support services , perhaps canceling extra-curricular activities .
But in time of major financial crisis for the entire nation , the super rich continue to get rich , without necessarily contributing anything of value to the economy .
And you and I paid for it .
Do n't believe me ?
Let me quote Leopold again :
The $ 1 billion each those 25 hedge fund managers netted ( for themselves ) was impressive -- but doing it in the year 2009 was also slap in the face of struggling Americans .
That 's because hedge funds would have earned little or no money at all in 2009 had the government not bailed out the financial sector with trillions in loans , asset guarantees and other forms of financial assistance .
It was , in effect , a generous gift from we the taxpayers .
Much of that money was " earned " by betting that the government would not let the financial sector collapse .
Smart bet .
I know of one manager who put tons of money into bank stocks when they were at their bottom , gambling that the government would not let them fail .
The money he invested did not contribute to hiring more people at the banks .
In fact , the money he invested did not go to the banks at all .
It was our money , through the government , which recapitalized the banks ( at the same time they still were restricting loans , and slashing lines of credit for companies and individual 's credit cards ) .
Each hedge fund manager was , according to Leopold , worth 26,320 beginning teachers .
I make more than a beginning teacher .
As a public employee , what I am paid by Prince George 's County Public Schools is a matter of public record .
My base pay is 83,000 and I get 7,000 for being National Board Certified .
If I take that 90 K and divide it into the 1 billion averaged by each of the 25 hedge fund managers , I am worth 1/11,111 of a hedge fund manager .
Restated as a decimal , as a highly regarded teacher who each year is responsible for the learning of around 180 young people , I am worth 0.00009 of a hedge fund manager .
Now , I am not asking to be paid billions , or even millions .
But quite frankly , I think I am actually contributing more to the future of this country than is the average hedge fund manager , unless the only value that matters is wealth , in which case , why bother to have skilled , experienced teachers like me at all , since most of students will never enter the rarified air of the very wealthy ?
I can look back a few years at the fascination of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous .
I see our glorification of wealth and of power .
Yes , we will occasionally recognize those who do good works .
We smile and say how nice it is that there are people like that , then as a society we move on - will Tiger win this year 's Masters ?
How much is Bill Gates actually worth ?
Bill Gates .
It is honorable that he is trying to use his wealth to make the world a better place .
But why should his billions give him a more influential voice on education than the skilled professionals who have been trying to make a difference for years ?
Yet it does .
Gates and Eli Broad have been driving the educational agenda using their wealth .
Similarly , the US Department of Education is now using funds through Race to the Top to drive educational policy without those policies being any more vetted and discussed than have been the initiatives funded by Gates and Broad .
I began this diary with a question : Why are 25 Hedge Fund Managers Worth 658,000 Teachers ?
My answer is simple - they are not .
But so long as we measure primarily by money , our values will continue to be distorted , we will devote resources that could be used to improve the lives of millions for the further enrichment of the already wealthy .
Do n't worry .
I 'm not so motivated by money that I will quit teaching and enter the world of hedge fund management .
I would rather see the light go on behind the eyes of a struggling adolescent than be able to add a string of zeroes behind my currently very limited net worth .
The average teacher does more good than does the average hedge fund manager .
Too bad our society does not see things that way .
Peace .
The funeral has been held of a Scotsman credited with inventing the cash machine .
John Shepherd - Barron came up with the idea of a " hole in the wall " in the 1960s .
The idea came to him after he arrived too late at a bank , and was not able to withdraw any money .
He dismissed the idea of PIN numbers with six digits rather than four when his wife said she would n't be able to remember them .
James Cook reports .
Bill to Revoke â€ œTerroristsâ€™â€ Citizenship is Like Those From Darker Periods of U.S. History
Americans accused of being involved with terrorist organizations , even if they have never been convicted of a crime , could have their citizenship revoked under a bipartisan bill that has been introduced in Congress .
The “ Terrorist Expatriation Act ” was introduced this week by Senators Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) and Scott Brown ( R - MA ) , along with Congressmen Jason Altmire ( D - PA ) and Charlie Dent ( R - PA ) .
The bill was introduced in the wake of the Times Square bomber media frenzy .
So far the Obama administration has remained silent , but the bill has some bipartisan support .
This bill would direct the State Department , at its own discretion , to determine if someone is involved with or working with a terrorist organization ( as identified in the State Department ’s list of designated terrorist groups ) .
Those accused would still have the right to contest the designation , but in an administrative hearing .
If they lose , they would be stripped of their citizenship , even if they have not been convicted of any crime .
Once stripped of citizenship , some legal experts have said suspects could be locked in military prisons indefinitely , or face military tribunals where they have fewer legal protections .
Stephen I. Vladeck , a professor of law at American University , told the Boston Globe that this bill harkens back to the darkest periods of U.S. history :
In 1952 , at the height of the McCarthy era , Congress revamped the statute and added new provisions aimed at communists , allowing the removal of citizenship for anyone guilty of treason or advocating the nationâ€™s violent overthrow … â€ œThe bill is so broad that it would allow the government to strip citizenship from someone who never committed a hostile act against the United States , â€™â€™ said Vladeck .
He said providing material support to terrorists could be interpreted as broadly as preparing Hamas or Hezbollah to advocate before the United Nations .
In an oped in the Washington Post , David Cole makes a solid case of why the bill is dead in the water , describing it as a proposal “ so flawed it can be explained only as pure political grandstanding . ”
I hope he is right .
Personally , though , I am beyond the point of relying on logic and no - they - could - never - get - away - with - that assurances .
Politicians are getting away with it , and they are growing more and more bold .
This bill needs to be placed in the context of the simultaneous , sweeping crackdown in the name of fighting “ domestic terrorism . ”
Legislation like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act singles out animal rights activists for harsher penalties if they harm corporate profits .
Activists in California are being charged under the AETA for chalking slogans on sidewalks and wearing masks at protests .
Meanwhile , the government has proposed making the secretive political prisons , called Communications Management Units , permanent .
This expatriation bill is dangerous enough on its own : it places far too much unchecked power in the hands of the government to make inherently subjective , political determinations of what is a terrorist organization and what constitutes support .
When examined in the broader context of the attack on political activists as terrorists , the bill is even more chilling .
Supporters of these efforts all defend their proposals in the same way .
It does n’t matter if it ’s this expatriation bill , the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act , Guantanamo , military tribunals , extraordinary rendition , warrantless wiretapping … they all reassure the American people that “ You have nothing to worry about .
This will just affect the bad guys , the terrorists . ”
It ’s time we stop believing them .
" Fifty percent of kills happen on the corners , " according to SmartSight inventor Matthew Hagerty .
And his creation — a rifle sight camera that wirelessly transmits real - time video back to its soldier — will help ensure that our soldiers win those battles .

The 1.5 pound camera — attached to an M4 or .308 SOCOM carbine — transmits video to a display attached to a soldier 's protective glasses :
Miniaturizing the hardware found in news broadcasting equipment , Hagerty devised a way to beam live , uncompressed high - quality video from the 1.5 - pound camera at a speedy 30 frames per second ; meanwhile , custom software overlays the shooter 's red target dot in the head - up display so that the view appears exactly as it does through the gun 's conventional scope , all with no delay .

In total , the prototype weighs just three pounds .
The benefits for urban warfare — just the type that we 've been entrenched in the last several years — are immediate , but the deliver of the SmartSight is n't , quite .
Hagerty still wants to make it lighter , and Special Ops testing wo n't begin until next year .

More than 80 percent of college faculty are using social media , with more than half using these tools as part of their teaching , according to a first - of - its - kind survey , " Social Media in Higher Education . "
The survey was conducted by the Babson Survey Research Group in collaboration with New Marketing Labs and Pearson , a global leader in education , technology and services .
NEWS FACTS
Nearly 1,000 faculty from across the nation participated in the survey .
Most faculty respondents ( 59 % ) have more than one social network account ; nearly 25 percent have accounts on four or more social networks .
More than 30 percent use social networks to communicate with students ; nearly 1/3 use social networks to communicate with peers .
A majority ( 52 % ) report using video , podcasts , blogs and wikis as part of their classes .
Watching a video or listening to a podcast is the most common activity for both faculty personal use ( 72 % ) and for use within a class ( 46 % ) .
Social media use is higher among faculty in the Humanities and Social Sciences than those in Mathematics , Science , Business and Economics .
Faculty teaching online courses are more likely to have social network accounts and to use them to communicate with fellow educators and with students .
Older faculty ( those teaching more than 20 years ) make substantial use of social networks ; in fact , older faculty 's use of social media is only slightly lower than that of their younger peers .

" College faculty have embraced social media and a majority have integrated some form of these tools into their teaching , " said Jeff Seaman , Ph.D. , co-director of the Babson Survey Research Group .
" While some faculty remain skeptical , the overall opinion is quite positive , with faculty reporting that social media has value for teaching by over a four to one margin . "
" These results are compelling since there is little customer - based research into social media adoption , and there is a lack of formal qualitative research of social media usage broken down by a specific profession , " said Justin Levy , Director of Business Development , Corporate Strategy & Client Services for New Marketing Labs , LLC , a social media marketing firm that consulted on the project .
" Educators have a responsibility to broaden the perspective of their students , regardless of the content matter , " said survey participant Dr. Maria Claver , assistant professor of Gerontology at California State University , Long Beach .
" Without the inclusion of social media in our hybrid course , we would not be able to both expose students to aging issues around the world and provide students with a forum in which they can learn about global aging issues by partnering with gerontology faculty from other countries . "
" Pearson supported this pioneering research in order to better understand the use of social media in higher education , " said Hester Tinti -Kane , Director of Online Marketing and Research at Pearson Learning Solutions , who led the project .

It 's true .
If you bought AAPL July 270 calls at around the
time the iPad was released , you could have tripled your money
in about two weeks .
Another interesting fact :
You could have bought an Apple PowerBook G3 250 for $ 5700 in
1997 .
But if you had invested that money in Apple stock , it
would be worth about $ 330,000 today .

{ May 24 , 2010} Activities in 4.5
huzzah !
I made a screencast showing the activities stuff in 4.5 :)
if the embedded video causes trouble you can also get it straight from blip .
tv
If you ’re not going to watch the video , there ’s one important thing in there : beta 1 has some bugs , so do n’t try to switch activities with anything besides the new activity manager .
Avoid the mouse plugin , the activity bar plasmoid , and the next / previous keyboard shortcuts – I ’ll have them fixed in beta 2 .
And because I know someone will forget and end up googling this : the default global keyboard shortcut for the activity manager is meta-q ( meta is usually referred to as the windows key – I probably should have called it that in the video ) .
That ’s also accessible through plasma ’s shortcuts config dialog , so you do n’t actually have to google it at all . :)
In 2009 , Aidan Hartley , a British journalist investigated black market elephant ivory in Tanzania .
He we extremely disturbed to find that he could find pretty much find as many kilos of elephant tusks as he wanted on the Tanzanian streets .
However , he said that the slaughtering of elephants that occurred in Selous National Park is what really spoke to him of the horrors that poaching wrought .
In the last three years 31,000 elephants have been killed in Tanzania alone while their bullet ridden carcasses are left to rot where they are shot .
Hartley also found that the Tanzanian government did little to nothing to stop the slaughter .

Penalty - takers will not be allowed to stop at the last second Penalty - takers will no longer be allowed to halt at the end of their run-ups to try to fool the goalkeeper .
The International Football Association Board has decided it is " unsporting behaviour " and made it a yellow card offence in time for the World Cup .
" Feinting in the run-up to take a penalty kick to confuse opponents is permitted , " said Fifa 's Jerome Valcke .
" However , feinting to kick the ball once the player has completed his run-up is now considered an infringement . "
If players do feint at the end of their run-up and then score , they will have to take the kick again .
The IFAB has also decided to give more power to the fourth official and to extend worldwide a European experiment with goal - line officials .
We probably do n't have the required numbers to do it domestically and the Premier League and the Football League have never been hugely keen on introducing it
FA on goal - line officials
The fourth official , who normally oversees substitutions , off - pitch behaviour and match management , will now be allowed to rule on on - pitch incidents to " assist the referee to control the match " .
" Today he's as important as the other officials on the field , " said Fifa general secretary Valcke .
The decision to allow assistant referees , as seen in the last two Europa League seasons , is voluntary .
Football associations and federations around the world can implement it if they wish but must run the trial for the whole competition .
However , it is unlikely to be seen in either England or Scotland next season .
Jonathan Hall , the Football Association 's director of football services , said he did not think either the Premier League or Football League would be keen , and that it would not be practical in the FA Cup as the system would have to be used in the early rounds .
" We probably do n't have the required numbers to do it domestically and the Premier League and the Football League have never been hugely keen on introducing it , " he said .
" One reason is simply the number of officials of the relevant ability needed to provide the service and for those reasons we were n't very keen .
" The other is because of concerns over safety - if you are standing behind the goal on a permanent basis you are more stationary and you may get something lobbed at you .
" We had had a little think about whether we might do it in the FA Cup but what was made very clear is that you have to do it all the way through the competition and it's very difficult to see how you would do it for the very early rounds - that would be ridiculous .
" We 'll go back and have an open conversation about it and at league level it looks unlikely unless they have changed their minds on it .
We do n't want to prevent others from doing it if they want to however . "
Scottish FA president George Peat said : " I do n't think we will be doing it in Scotland but we will obviously discuss that . "
The IFAB is made up of world governing body Fifa plus the four home associations who pioneered the sport - England 's Football Association , the Scottish Football Association ( SFA ) , the Football Association of Wales ( FAW ) and Northern Ireland 's Irish Football Association ( IFA ) .

Welcome to Django 1.2 !
Nearly a year in the making , Django 1.2 packs an impressive list of new features and lots of bug fixes .
These release notes cover the new features , as well as important changes you ’ll want to be aware of when upgrading from Django 1.1 or older versions .
Again , these are just the big features that will affect the most users .
Users upgrading from previous versions of Django are heavily encouraged to consult the complete list of backwards - incompatible changes and the list of deprecated features .
The user_passes_test ( ) , login_required ( ) , and permission_required ( ) , decorators from django.contrib.auth only apply to functions and no longer work on methods .
There ’s a simple one - line fix detailed below .
The internals of template tags have changed somewhat ; authors of custom template tags that need to store state ( e.g. custom control flow tags ) should ensure that their code follows the new rules for stateful template tags
Authors of custom Field subclasses should be aware that a number of methods have had a change in prototype , detailed under get_db_prep_ *( ) methods on Field , below .
However , upgrading to the new CSRF protection framework requires a few important backwards - incompatible changes , detailed in CSRF Protection , below .
The new CSRF protection framework is not backwards - compatible with the old system .
Users of the old system will not be affected until the old system is removed in Django 1.4 .
However , a handful of features have changed in ways that , for some users , will be backwards - incompatible .
The big changes are :
Wherever possible these features have been introduced in a backwards - compatible manner per our API stability policy policy .
Django Advent covered the release of Django 1.2 with a series of articles and tutorials that cover some of the new features in depth .
These are just the highlights ; full details and a complete list of features may be found below .
A roadmap for Django ’s overall 2.x Python support , and eventual transition to Python 3.x , is currently being developed , and will be announced prior to the release of Django 1.3 .
This change should affect only a small number of Django users , as most operating - system vendors today are shipping Python 2.4 or newer as their default version .
If you ’re still using Python 2.3 , however , you ’ll need to stick to Django 1.1 until you can upgrade ; per our support policy , Django 1.1 will continue to receive security support until the release of Django 1.3 .
While not a new feature , it ’s important to note that Django 1.2 introduces the first shift in our Python compatibility policy since Django ’s initial public debut .
Previous Django releases were tested and supported on 2.x Python versions from 2.3 up ; Django 1.2 , however , drops official support for Python 2.3 .
As such , the minimum Python version required for Django is now 2.4 , and Django is tested and supported on Python 2.4 , 2.5 and 2.6 , and will be supported on the as - yet - unreleased Python 2.7 .
These are also available in others parts like the date and time template filters , the humanize template tag library and the new format localization framework .
The argument to the now has gained two new format characters : c to specify that a datetime value should be formatted in ISO 8601 format , and u that allows output of the microseconds part of a datetime or time value .
If a user has JavaScript enabled in their browser , the interface for inline objects in the admin now allows inline objects to be dynamically added and removed .
Users without JavaScript - enabled browsers will see no change in the behavior of inline objects .
Finally , GeoDjango ’s documentation is now included with Django ’s and is no longer hosted separately at geodjango.org .
The GDAL interface now allows the user to set a spatial_filter on the features returned when iterating over a Layer .
The GEOS interface was updated to use thread - safe C library functions when available on the platform .
Support for 3D geometry fields was added , and may be enabled by setting the dim keyword to 3 in your Geometry Field .
The Extent3D aggregate and extent3d ( ) GeoQuerySet method were added as a part of this feature .
GeoDjango now supports the rich capabilities added in the PostGIS 1.5 release .
New features include support for the geography type and enabling of distance queries with non-point geometries on geographic coordinate systems .
The most significant new feature for GeoDjango in 1.2 is support for multiple spatial databases .
As a result , the following spatial database backends are now included :
Syndication feeds can now be used directly as views in your URLconf .
This means that you can maintain complete control over the URL structure of your feeds .
Like any other view , feeds views are passed a request object , so you can do anything you would normally do with a view , like user based access control , or making a feed a named URL .
You can now use a DJANGO_COLORS environment variable to modify or disable the colors used by django - admin.py to provide syntax highlighting .
django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields has been added to enable non-editable fields in add / change pages for models and inlines .
Field and calculated values can be displayed alongside editable fields .
Django ’s internationalization framework has been expanded with locale - aware formatting and form processing .
That means , if enabled , dates and numbers on templates will be displayed using the format specified for the current locale .
Django will also use localized formats when parsing data in forms .
See Format localization for more details .
Both the test subcommand of django - admin.py and the runtests .
py script used to run Django ’s own test suite now support a - - failfast option .
When specified , this option causes the test runner to exit after encountering a failure instead of continuing with the test run .
In addition , the handling of Ctrl - C during a test run has been improved to trigger a graceful exit from the test run that reports details of the tests that were run before the interruption .
Fixtures can now refer to remote objects using Natural keys .
This lookup scheme is an alternative to the normal primary - key based object references in a fixture , improving readability and resolving problems referring to objects whose primary key value may not be predictable or known .
If you have developed your own custom template loaders we suggest to consider porting them to a class - based implementation because the code for backwards compatibility with function - based loaders starts its deprecation process in Django 1.2 and will be removed in Django 1.4 .
There is a description of the API these loader classes must implement in the template API reference and you can also examine the source code of the loaders shipped with Django .
All the template loaders shipped with Django have been ported to the new API but they still implement the function - based API and the template core machinery still accepts function - based loaders ( builtin or third party ) so there is no immediate need to modify your TEMPLATE_LOADERS setting in existing projects , things will keep working if you leave it untouched up to and including the Django 1.3 release .
As part of the changes made to introduce Template caching and following a general trend in Django , the template loaders API has been modified to use template loading mechanisms that are encapsulated in Python classes as opposed to functions , the only method available until Django 1.1 .
In previous versions of Django , every time you rendered a template , it would be reloaded from disk .
In Django 1.2 , you can use a cached template loader to load templates once , then cache the result for every subsequent render .
This can lead to a significant performance improvement if your templates are broken into lots of smaller subtemplates ( using the { % extends %} or { % include %} tags ) .
Also , filters may now be used in the if expression .
For example :
The operators supported are == , != , < , > , <= , >= , in and not in , all of which work like the Python operators , in addition to and , or and not , which were already supported .
There ’s really no reason to use { % ifequal %} or { % ifnotequal %} anymore , unless you ’re the nostalgic type .
The if tag has been upgraded to be much more powerful .
First , we ’ve added support for comparison operators .
No longer will you have to type :
This also makes it easier to debug mail sending .
Django ships with backend implementations that allow you to send email to a file , to the console , or to memory .
You can even configure all email to be thrown away .
You can now configure the way that Django sends email .
Instead of using SMTP to send all email , you can now choose a configurable email backend to send messages .
If your hosting provider uses a sandbox or some other non-SMTP technique for sending mail , you can now construct an email backend that will allow Django ’s standard mail sending methods to use those facilities .
If you provide a custom auth backend with supports_anonymous_user set to True , AnonymousUser will check the backend for permissions , just like User already did .
This is useful for centralizing permission handling - apps can always delegate the question of whether something is allowed or not to the authorization / authentication backend .
See the authentication docs for more details .
A foundation for specifying permissions at the per-object level has been added .
Although there is no implementation of this in core , a custom authentication backend can provide this implementation and it will be used by django.contrib.auth.models .
User .
See the authentication docs for more information .
Django now includes a robust and configurable messages framework with built - in support for cookie - and session - based messaging , for both anonymous and authenticated clients .
The messages framework replaces the deprecated user message API and allows you to temporarily store messages in one request and retrieve them for display in a subsequent request ( usually the next one ) .
Django now has much improved protection against Cross - Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) attacks .
This type of attack occurs when a malicious website contains a link , a form button or some JavaScript that is intended to perform some action on your website , using the credentials of a logged - in user who visits the malicious site in their browser .
A related type of attack , “ login CSRF , ” where an attacking site tricks a user ’s browser into logging into a site with someone else ’s credentials , is also covered .
Model instances now have support for validating their own data , and both model and form fields now accept configurable lists of validators specifying reusable , encapsulated validation behavior .
Note , however , that validation must still be performed explicitly .
Simply invoking a model instance ’s save ( ) method will not perform any validation of the instance ’s data .
Django 1.2 adds the ability to use more than one database in your Django project .
Queries can be issued at a specific database with the using ( ) method on QuerySet objects .
Individual objects can be saved to a specific database by providing a using argument when you call save ( ) .
Backwards - incompatible changes in 1.2 ¶
Wherever possible the new features above have been introduced in a backwards - compatible manner per our API stability policy policy .
This means that practically all existing code which worked with Django 1.1 will continue to work with Django 1.2 ; such code will , however , begin issuing warnings ( see below for details ) .
However , a handful of features have changed in ways that , for some users , will be immediately backwards - incompatible .
Those changes are detailed below .
CSRF Protection ¶
We ’ve made large changes to the way CSRF protection works , detailed in the CSRF documentation .
Here are the major changes you should be aware of : CsrfResponseMiddleware and CsrfMiddleware have been deprecated and will be removed completely in Django 1.4 , in favor of a template tag that should be inserted into forms .
All contrib apps use a csrf_protect decorator to protect the view .
This requires the use of the csrf_token template tag in the template .
If you have used custom templates for contrib views , you MUST READ THE UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS to fix those templates .
Documentation removed
The upgrade notes have been removed in current Django docs .
Please refer to the docs for Django 1.3 or older to find these instructions .
CsrfViewMiddleware is included in MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES by default .
This turns on CSRF protection by default , so views that accept POST requests need to be written to work with the middleware .
Instructions on how to do this are found in the CSRF docs .
All of the CSRF has moved from contrib to core ( with backwards compatible imports in the old locations , which are deprecated and will cease to be supported in Django 1.4 ) .
get_db_prep_*( ) methods on Field ¶ Prior to Django 1.2 , a custom Field had the option of defining several functions to support conversion of Python values into database - compatible values .
A custom field might look something like : class CustomModelField ( models .
Field ) : # ... def db_type ( self ) : # ... def get_db_prep_save ( self , value ) : # ... def get_db_prep_value ( self , value ) : # ... def get_db_prep_lookup ( self , lookup_type , value ) : # ...
In 1.2 , these three methods have undergone a change in prototype , and two extra methods have been introduced : class CustomModelField ( models .
Field ) : # ... def db_type ( self , connection ) : # ... def get_prep_value ( self , value ) : # ... def get_prep_lookup ( self , lookup_type , value ) : # ... def get_db_prep_save ( self , value , connection ) : # ... def get_db_prep_value ( self , value , connection , prepared = False ) : # ... def get_db_prep_lookup ( self , lookup_type , value , connection , prepared = False ) : # ...
These changes are required to support multiple databases – db_type and get_db_prep_ * can no longer make any assumptions regarding the database for which it is preparing .
The connection argument now provides the preparation methods with the specific connection for which the value is being prepared .
The two new methods exist to differentiate general data - preparation requirements from requirements that are database - specific .
The prepared argument is used to indicate to the database - preparation methods whether generic value preparation has been performed .
If an unprepared ( i.e. , prepared =False ) value is provided to the get_db_prep_ *( ) calls , they should invoke the corresponding get_prep_ *( ) calls to perform generic data preparation .
We ’ve provided conversion functions that will transparently convert functions adhering to the old prototype into functions compatible with the new prototype .
However , these conversion functions will be removed in Django 1.4 , so you should upgrade your Field definitions to use the new prototype as soon as possible .
If your get_db_prep_ * ( ) methods made no use of the database connection , you should be able to upgrade by renaming get_db_prep_value ( ) to get_prep_value ( ) and get_db_prep_lookup( ) to get_prep_lookup ( ) .
If you require database specific conversions , then you will need to provide an implementation get_db_prep_ * that uses the connection argument to resolve database - specific values .
user_passes_test , login_required and permission_required ¶ django.contrib.auth.decorators provides the decorators login_required , permission_required and user_passes_test .
Previously it was possible to use these decorators both on functions ( where the first argument is ‘ request ’ ) and on methods ( where the first argument is ‘ self ’ , and the second argument is ‘ request ’ ) .
Unfortunately , flaws were discovered in the code supporting this : it only works in limited circumstances , and produces errors that are very difficult to debug when it does not work .
For this reason , the ‘ auto adapt ’ behavior has been removed , and if you are using these decorators on methods , you will need to manually apply django.utils.decorators.method_decorator( ) to convert the decorator to one that works with methods .
For example , you would change code from this : class MyClass ( object ) : @login_required def my_view ( self , request ) : pass to this : from django.utils .decorators import method_decorator class MyClass ( object ) : @method_decorator ( login_required ) def my_view ( self , request ) : pass or : from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator login_required_m = method_decorator ( login_required ) class MyClass ( object ) : @login_required_m def my_view ( self , request ) : pass
For those of you who ’ve been following the development trunk , this change also applies to other decorators introduced since 1.1 , including csrf_protect , cache_control and anything created using decorator_from_middleware .
if tag changes ¶
Due to new features in the if template tag , it no longer accepts ‘ and ’ , ‘ or ’ and ‘ not ’ as valid variable names .
Previously , these strings could be used as variable names .
Now , the keyword status is always enforced , and template code such as { % if not %} or { % if and %} will throw a TemplateSyntaxError .
Also , in is a new keyword and so is not a valid variable name in this tag .
LazyObject ¶ LazyObject is an undocumented - but - often - used utility class used for lazily wrapping other objects of unknown type .
In Django 1.1 and earlier , it handled introspection in a non-standard way , depending on wrapped objects implementing a public method named get_all_members ( ) .
Since this could easily lead to name clashes , it has been changed to use the standard Python introspection method , involving __members__ and __dir__ ( ) .
If you used LazyObject in your own code and implemented the get_all_members ( ) method for wrapped objects , you ’ll need to make a couple of changes :
First , if your class does not have special requirements for introspection ( i.e. , you have not implemented __getattr__ ( ) or other methods that allow for attributes not discoverable by normal mechanisms ) , you can simply remove the get_all_members ( ) method .
The default implementation on LazyObject will do the right thing .
If you have more complex requirements for introspection , first rename the get_all_members ( ) method to __dir__ ( ) .
This is the standard introspection method for Python 2.6 and above .
If you require support for Python versions earlier than 2.6 , add the following code to the class : __members__ = property ( lambda self : self .
__dir__ ( ) )
__dict__ on model instances ¶
Historically , the __dict__ attribute of a model instance has only contained attributes corresponding to the fields on a model .
In order to support multiple database configurations , Django 1.2 has added a _state attribute to object instances .
This attribute will appear in __dict__ for a model instance .
If your code relies on iterating over __dict__ to obtain a list of fields , you must now be prepared to handle or filter out the _state attribute .
Test runner exit status code ¶
The exit status code of the test runners ( tests / runtests.py and python manage .
py test ) no longer represents the number of failed tests , because a failure of 256 or more tests resulted in a wrong exit status code .
The exit status code for the test runner is now 0 for success ( no failing tests ) and 1 for any number of test failures .
If needed , the number of test failures can be found at the end of the test runner ’s output .
Cookie encoding ¶
To fix bugs with cookies in Internet Explorer , Safari , and possibly other browsers , our encoding of cookie values was changed so that the comma and semicolon are treated as non-safe characters , and are therefore encoded as \054 and \073 respectively .
This could produce backwards incompatibilities , especially if you are storing comma or semi-colon in cookies and have JavaScript code that parses and manipulates cookie values client - side .
ModelForm.is_valid( ) and ModelForm.errors ¶
Much of the validation work for ModelForms has been moved down to the model level .
As a result , the first time you call ModelForm.is_valid( ) , access ModelForm.errors or otherwise trigger form validation , your model will be cleaned in - place .
This conversion used to happen when the model was saved .
If you need an unmodified instance of your model , you should pass a copy to the ModelForm constructor .
BooleanField on MySQL ¶
In previous versions of Django , a model ’s Boolean Field under MySQL would return its value as either 1 or 0 , instead of True or False ; for most people this was n’t a problem because bool is a subclass of int in Python .
In Django 1.2 , however , BooleanField on MySQL correctly returns a real bool .
The only time this should ever be an issue is if you were expecting the repr of a Boolean Field to print 1 or 0 .
Changes to the interpretation of max_num in FormSets ¶
As part of enhancements made to the handling of FormSets , the default value and interpretation of the max_num parameter to the django.forms.formsets.formset_factory ( ) and django.forms.models.modelformset_factory ( ) functions has changed slightly .
This change also affects the way the max_num argument is used for inline admin objects .
Previously , the default value for max_num was 0 ( zero ) .
FormSets then used the boolean value of max_num to determine if a limit was to be imposed on the number of generated forms .
The default value of 0 meant that there was no default limit on the number of forms in a FormSet .
Starting with 1.2 , the default value for max_num has been changed to None , and FormSets will differentiate between a value of None and a value of 0 .
A value of None indicates that no limit on the number of forms is to be imposed ; a value of 0 indicates that a maximum of 0 forms should be imposed .
This does n’t necessarily mean that no forms will be displayed – see the ModelFormSet documentation for more details .
If you were manually specifying a value of 0 for max_num , you will need to update your FormSet and / or admin definitions .

The increasing criticism of Flash as a vehicle for online video delivery ( as well as Apple 's dislike of Flash ) appears to be driving the adoption of H.264 video .
A recent study by video search site MeFeedia reveals a 160 percent increase in the proportion of video encoded in the iPad - friendly format since January of this year .
MeFeedia 's indexing data was compiled from over 30,000 sources of online video , including Hulu , CBS , ABC , CNN , MTV , YouTube , and others .
According to its data for the month of May , 26 percent of all video in its index was in H.264 format .
That 's up from just 10 percent in January — the month that Apple announced the iPad .
The report revealed that a lot of older content , including news and TV episodes , had not yet been reencoded from their largely Flash - based formats .
However , most new content is being encoded in H.264 , suggesting that the iPad is helping push adoption of H.264 and HTML5 .
Just before the iPad launch in April , a number of media companies announced plans to transition content from Flash - based players to H.264 video delivered via HTML5 specifically for the device .
A side benefit of this transition is that such video is also compatible with the iPhone and iPod touch , as well as Android - based mobile devices and Safari and Chrome on the desktop .
The increasing trend toward H.264 has been corroborated by data released earlier this month by video encoding service Encoding.com .
Two - thirds of the video encoded by the service in the first quarter of 2010 was in H.264 format , more than double the percentage encoded as H.264 a year ago .
( CNN ) --
The anti-gay rights activist who recently toured Europe with a male escort has resigned from a group that promotes counseling for people who " struggle with unwanted homosexuality , " though the man insists that he is not gay .
George Rekers resigned from the board of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality , the group 's website said Tuesday .
" I am immediately resigning my membership in NARTH to allow myself the time necessary to fight the false media reports that have been made against me , " Rekers said in a statement posted on the group 's website .
" With the assistance of a defamation attorney , I will fight these false reports because I have not engaged in any homosexual behavior whatsoever .
" I am not gay and never have been , " the statement said .
The association accepted the resignation , saying on its website Tuesday that it " would hope that the legal process will sufficiently clarify the questions that have arisen in this unfortunate situation . "
The group has scrubbed Rekers ' writings from its site , with a page that formerly featured his work now bearing the message , " Sorry , you 've reached a page that does n't exist . "
Rekers , a Baptist minister , has been a prominent and effective foe of gay rights legislation across the country .
He is a co-founder of the Family Research Council , one of Washington 's most powerful conservative Christian advocacy groups , and has weighed in on anti-gay rights legislation across the country .
He received about $ 120,000 to appear as an expert witness in a 2008 case challenging Florida 's ban on gays and lesbians adopting .
Rekers has written that gays are a " deviant segment of society . "
Revelations of Rekers ' trip to Europe with a male escort surfaced last week , shortly after he returned to the U.S .
The male escort who traveled with Rekers -- who goes by the name Lucien , though that is not his given name -- said that he advertises his service exclusively on the website rentboy.com , where visitors can choose from hundreds of male escorts in suggestive and revealing poses .
Lucien says Rekers first contacted him through the site .
He was hired to give Rekers daily " sexual massages " on the trip , which took them to London and Madrid , Lucien says .
" He got excited , " Lucien said of the massages , adding that Rekers wanted Lucien to touch him , though Lucien said that he did n't have sex with Rekers and that Rekers did n't ask to have sex .
According to a contract Lucien showed CNN , he was hired to carry Rekers ' bags and to provide at least one hour 's worth of massage every day in their shared room , at a cost of $ 75 a day .
The contract also stipulated that Lucien spend at least eight hours a day with Rekers , including sharing two meals .
Rekers ' website provided a different account of how he met Lucien and of the trip , saying he needed help carrying luggage because of an " ongoing condition following surgery . "
The site said Rekers " found his recent travel assistant by interviewing different people who might be able to help , and did not even find out about his travel assistant 's internet advertisements offering prostitution activity until after the trip was in progress .
There was nothing inappropriate with this relationship . "
Rekers ' site said he " was not involved in any illegal or sexual behavior with his travel assistant . "
Rekers is a distinguished professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine , according to his website .
He earned a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California , Los Angeles , an M.B.A. from Southern Wesleyan University and a Doctor of Theology degree from the University of South Africa , his site says .
Lucien says Rekers told him about other boyfriends before the European trip .
But Lucien says that in their ongoing conversations , Rekers continues to deny that he is gay .
" I actually asked him over the phone , ' Do you think you 're gay ? ' and he said , ' no ' , " Lucien said , adding that Rekers asked him not to share his story with the media .
In a statement on its website Tuesday , the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality said it stood by its work promoting therapy for gays who wish to be straight .
" ( T ) hese personal controversies do not change the scientific data , nor do they detract from the important work of NARTH , " the statement said .
" NARTH continues to support scientific research , and to value client autonomy , client self - determination and client diversity . "

‘ Treme ’ does n’t present us with the real New Orleans .
Thank goodness for that .
In the third episode of “ Treme , ” David Simon ’s new HBO series about New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , a group of Mardi Gras Indians are holding a memorial ceremony for one of their members , whose badly decomposed remains were just discovered in a shed behind his house .
As they sing and chant , a large white bus marked “ Katrina Tour ” rolls into the street and stops in front of them .
The driver rolls down his window ; all we see of the passengers is their flashbulbs .
“ Drive away from here , sir ! ” the Indians shout .
The driver at first is defensive : “ People want to see what happened . ”
Then his tone changes .
“ I ’m sorry , ” he says .
“ You ’re right .
I ’m sorry . ”

The question , implicit in this scene and throughout the first few episodes , will no doubt be fundamental to “ Treme , ” which begins three months after the storm hit and depicts an assortment of the city ’s residents — a slacker DJ , a trombone player , a Mardi Gras Indian chief , an upscale chef , a dive bar owner — as they struggle to rebuild their lives .
( One of the first shots of the gorgeous opening credits is a satellite view of the hurricane ’s swirl . )
Over and over , we see tensions rise between well - meaning people who want to help out — from Midwestern church - group volunteers to the musicians playing a benefit at Lincoln Center — and the locals , grimly scornful of outsiders and their mispronunciations .
( “ This storm — everybody wants a taste , ” a musician ’s agent tells him . )
In one scene , Davis , the DJ , learns that the wealthy new neighbors at whom he has been blasting music out of his windows ( to protest their “ gentrification ” of his neighborhood ) are , like him , born - and - bred New Orleanians .
In another , we see Delmond , a trumpet player who lives in New York , ignore a cell phone call from his father , the Indian chief who has found the corpse of his friend .
Delmond was home for a few days to help his father clean up , but has no interest in carrying on the Indian traditions .
Yet the call interrupts him mid-rehearsal ( for the above - mentioned benefit ) of the song “ Indian Red , ” a traditional hymn that happens to be the same song the Indians are singing at the end of the episode when the tour bus rolls up .
“ Some of the gangs ai n’t gonna like me singing ‘ Indian Red ’ anyway because this is their most sacred song , ” the singer announces in the studio .
“ But we gonna do this with the most love and respect that we can for the tradition . ”
As these scenes demonstrate , Simon is exquisitely sensitive to the signifiers of insiderness and outsiderness that separate the authentic from the fake , the native from the poseur .
This was evident in “ The Wire , ” his previous endeavor , a police - procedural - turned - panorama of urban decay in America .
But for “ The Wire , ” Simon was the native , a veteran of The Baltimore Sun and a longtime city resident ( though as a Baltimore native myself , I have to mention that he grew up in the DC suburbs ) who came by his bona fides naturally .
There was never any question , of course , that “ The Wire ” was a fictional TV show set in a fictional city , though one that bore a strong resemblance to its model and used a generous helping of actual events as plot points , such as the implosion of the housing project towers or the contested campaign that resulted in the surprise election of a white mayor .
But even — or especially — for me as a Baltimorean , the line between the fictional Baltimore and the real Baltimore was hard to draw ; and as the series progressed , the Baltimore of “ The Wire ” became even more real to me than the city where I grew up — a testament to Simon ’s compulsive attention to detail , but also to the fullness of his imagination .
In New Orleans , Simon is the outsider .
Anecdotes of his obsessive desire to get it right have abounded in the news coverage of “ Treme , ” from the blogger who noticed that Simon borrowed a split - second shot of a street sign from an amateur video of the actual first second - line parade after Katrina to the open letter that Simon published in the Times - Picayune the day of the show ’s premiere .
Simon noted that the first episode prominently features a pie from Hubig ’s bakery , which is an anachronism , since the bakery did not reopen until several months after the scene in the show is meant to take place .
“ Any such pastry … should by rights be a pre-Katrina artifact and therefore unsuitable for anyone ’s dessert , ” Simon wrote .
But the pie , he continues , is a “ Magic Hubig ’s , ” which “ somehow survives months of post - Katrina tumult and remains tasty and intact for our small , winking moment of light comedy .
We know this because we , the writers , imbued the pie with its special powers .
We created it . ”
In a few lines , Simon presents a convincing , carefully worked through defense of the value of fictional art set in real times .
“ Why not depict a precise truth , down to the very Hubig ’s ? ” Simon asks .
And he answers : “ By referencing what is real , or historical , a fictional narrative can speak in a powerful , full - throated way to the problems and issues of our time .
And a wholly imagined tale , set amid the intricate and accurate details of a real place and time , can resonate with readers in profound ways . ”
Note that little slip — if it was indeed a slip .
Simon calls his audience “ readers . ”
And what he has created — with “ The Wire ” and now with “ Treme ” — is a kind of novel in TV form .
It became a cliché to describe “ The Wire ” as “ novelistic , ” but in fact the forms have a lot in common , far more so than the novel and film .
The sheer length of the TV series allows it to take place in something like novelistic time , unspooling its plot and building its elaborate structure in relative leisure .
And by creating shows that reward sustained attention and repeated re-viewings , Simon teaches us to watch television in a way that is very similar to close reading .
If the adjective had n’t been so abused during “ The Wire , ” I might even call Simon ’s shows Dickensian — for the scope of their ambition , but also because the TV drama has become our century ’s answer to the serialized novel .
It ’s often been lamented that we no longer anticipate books with the fervor of the legendary crowds at New York Harbor awaiting the fate of Little Nell .
But the communal excitement that greets each new episode of a David Simon series is the closest to it I ’ve ever seen .

[ Editor ’s note :
This is the third of four posts on ( elevated ) fossil - fuel emissions associated with firming otherwise intermittent wind power .
Part I introduced the issues .
Part II showed negated emission savings for the Netherlands at current wind penetration ( about 3 percent ) .
Part III ( below ) and Part IV tommorow examine the higher emissions from wind in Colorado and Texas , respectively , according to a new study by Bentek . ]
The Bentek study is a significant contribution to the wind / fossil - fuel emission literature despite some notable limitations .
The study analyzes the PSCO system , which dominates Colorado ’s needs , and the ERCOT system in Texas , which manages 85 % of that state ’s electricity .
The analysis includes SO 2 , NO x and CO 2 emissions .
Bentek looks at coal cycling events only in both cases , ignoring any gas cycling , while noting PSCO ’s acknowledgement that wind impacts gas as well as coal .
There are reasons why coal cycling is focused upon :
Although gas turbine plants are better suited for cycling to support wind , for both PSCO and ERCOT gas resources are insufficient to balance all the wind energy produced .
There is a small amount of pumped storage available to PSCO , which can run for only four consecutive hours .
Wind is strongest at night when base load coal plants predominate , and there is reduced gas generation , which may not be sufficient to safely cycle gas plants .
As a result , reported gas cycling events at PSCO are less frequent than that for coal .
Both analyses utilize published production information .
As PSCO does not reveal hourly wind production , for emissions analysis purposes , Bentek has to rely on a few coal cycling events in relation to detailed wind production provided in PSCO training manuals .
This limitation is offset by the information available on a notable increase in coal cycling , which has occurred during the period of wind introduction , and which is arguably attributable to wind .
As ERCOT does release wind production at 15 minute intervals , the same analysis approach is used in the Texas system to validate the Colorado results , which it does .
Criticisms that the PSCO analysis is based on two days experience only , are well answered in the Bentek report .
The reality is that PSCO does not make the necessary information available , and Bentek has done well with what they had to work with .
Also , the validation of results based on the ERCOT experience is important .
Finally , Bentek appropriately acknowledges limitations by calling for more comprehensive studies based on detailed information .
Having established that RPS appear to add to the emissions problem , Bentek concludes that , given RPS , it will be necessary to incorporate adequate flexible fuel capacity facilities ( gas plants ) to ensure reduction in emissions , which is true enough .
What is missed in this logic is that incorporating such new facilities without RPS will achieve even lower emissions .
More on this is provided below .
There are not only more emissions with RPS than without them , but also there is duplicate capacity installed ( wind ) at significantly higher costs , which adds notably to the costs of electricity .
PSCO Results
This section looks at the PSCO system in more detail and compares results with the Netherland ’s study in Part II and my CO 2 emissions calculator .
First , there are a number of relevant , notable characteristics of the 2008 Colorado electricity production profile .
The utility portion of the total electricity production is about 80 % of the total .
Wind penetration is 6 % of the total production , including independent suppliers , which is high and in the same range as Germany , where wind curtailment is necessary .
The ratio of gas to wind production ( excluding independent suppliers ) is about 150 % .
It is necessary to have a ratio of 200- 300 % for gas to operate in the wind balancing role .
This , plus the nature of wind production to be highest at night , explains the high degree of cycling required by the coal plants .
Because of cycling events , arguably attributable to the presence of wind plants , the findings are that in 2008 the coal plants produced an additional 152,000 tons of CO 2 emissions over running stably without these events , and in 2009 , an additional 93,000 - 147,000 tons .
How does this compare to what my calculator predicts ?
The following are the input considerations .
Wind Capacity Factor
The referenced NREL metadata file indicates a theoretical capacity factor of about 31 % based on the wind profile .
However other published data from the DOE / EIA shows a wind capacity factor 35 % in 2008 .
Colorado does have a stronger wind regime than Texas with a similar relative wind penetration at about 5 % .
This means that curtailment should be the practice , as is the case in Germany .
Surprisingly , given the capacity factor and penetration , there is not much curtailment of wind production in PSCO during 2008 as reported by the NREL .
Heat Rate Penalty and CO2 Emissions Increase Factor
One of the calculator inputs is heat rate penalty or the loss in efficiency due to the presence of wind for the fossil fuel plants used in the wind balancing role .
The study of the Netherlands system by Le Pair and de Groot developed a way of calculating this ( at ? F=0 ) as follows : [ Here ? was intended to be the Greek letter delta , or “ change in .
Looks like WordPress cannot handle this character in the text ]
? R = ( E w / E ) x R
Where :
? R = the overall efficiency loss due to the presence of wind plants of the power station fleet
E w = the electricity production of the wind plants
E = The total electricity production of the wind plants and the fleet of other power stations
R = The efficiency of the these power stations without wind present
From DOE / EIA published information , for Colorado in 2008 , and an assumed R of 41 % based on the U.S. national average , this is :
? R = ( 3,200/39,400 ) x 41 % = 3.3 %
Bentek shows a 2 % increase in all plants on one day on page 42 .
For the following analysis however , 3.3 % will be used , based generally on the strength of the Colorado wind regime .
Also , on this basis , there is consistency with the ERCOT analysis in the next part of this series .
Based on the Netherlands study ’s Table 3 , and using a ? R of 3.3 % , means a heat rate penalty for plants in the wind mirroring role of ( 45.0-29.2 ) /45.0 = 35 % .
As indicated in Part II , using a different initial R value produces the same percent heat rate penalty .
The calculator factor for fossil fuel and CO2 emissions increase is therefore 56 % ( an extension of the table in the calculator , which stops at 30 % )
Calculator Results for PSCO
The resulting calculator CO 2 emissions increases for coal cycling only are 100,000 tonnes ( 110,000 tons ) per year , which is in the same range as the Bentek results .
A reasonable view is that both coal and gas plants will be involved in cycling at different times , so the calculator was used to show this as well , although there are no comparable Bentek results .
As PSCO - owned coal capacity significantly exceeds that of gas and , because wind is strongest at night , coal is more heavily weighted in the wind balancing mix at 80 % coal and 20 % gas .
The total ERCOT gas mix is heavily weighted to OCGT on a capacity basis , and for wind balancing all the gas is assumed to be OCGT , or CCGT operating as OCGT .
Frequent cycling of CCGT plants damages the HRSGs ( Heat Recovery Steam Generators ) so single stage operation is needed .
In summary , more OCGT production is used than would be required if wind was not present in the system .
The emissions increase over normal coal / CCGT operations becomes 0.44 million tons per year .
Table 1 shows the comparison of the Bentek results with the calculator .
Table 1 – Comparison of Bentek Study and Calculator results for PSCO
The results are remarkably close considering that the calculator provides a general model , which is a working hypothesis of expected fossil fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions with the introduction of wind power into an electricity system .
In the absence of adequate studies using finely time - grained ( less than one hour ) production information and fuel consumption for the applicable generation elements over sufficiently long periods of time and dealing with the fast ramp rates required , it was developed as an interim measure and framework .
If the coal / gas results look odd , it is necessary to look at the absolute numbers , which are provided in Table 2 .
The calculator results are in tonnes , but this has been converted to tons in the last row .
Table 2 – Absolute Levels of CO2 Emissions for Wind Mirroring Fossil Fuel Plants ( Without and With Wind Present )
This shows that by introducing CCGT plants to replace the portion of coal plant production that would be used for wind balancing , but operating normally in wind ’s absence , there is an immediate saving of 0.8 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions ( 7.1 - 6.3 ) , as shown in row ( 1 ) .
As shown in row ( 3 ) , with wind present , the CO2 emissions increase is higher in the coal / gas case largely because of the need to use OCGT ( or CCGT operating as OCGT ) plants .
However , row ( 2 ) shows the absolute level of CO2 emissions is less than using coal solely to balance wind .
One of the key findings of the Bentek study is that adding flexible generation resources , such as that provided by natural gas , facilitates the goals of RPS without increasing emissions .
This is true enough , but this ignores the reality that using gas without wind is a better solution , by 0.4 million tonnes per year ( 6.7 - 6.3 ) , as shown in rows ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
Conclusion
In summary , Table 1 shows that the Bentek study findings for PSCO are consistent with the Netherlands study , given the higher wind penetration , and in the same range as the the calculator results .
Part IV in this series will analyze the Bentek results for ERCOT in a similar manner , which validates these results , and addresses the issue about the limited information available from PSCO .

Part I – Introduction
Part II – The Netherlands Study
The Weight Of The Human Soul By James Donahue
There has been disagreement over the centuries over just what the human soul is , or even if such a thing exists .
The soul , which is not the same thing as the spirit , seems to be that spark of something within us that links us to our creator .
Some say this is God .
We believe it is the Mother Earth , from which we were spawned and to where we will return after our bodies are turned to rot .
That we are creatures with memory , awareness of ourselves and that we exist within our bodies is not debatable .
What is in question is just how unique we are in comparison to the other animals sharing this planet with us .
So how do we prove that we have a soul ?
There was a strange experiment by a doctor in Massachusetts back in 1907 that suggests something , indeed , leaves the body at the moment of death .
And that something weighs about 21 grams .
It seems that Dr. Duncan MacDougall of Haverhill conducted his experiment with the help of six dying patients placed in a specially designed bed .
The bed was built on a scale so that they could be weighed before , during and immediately after death .
Writing in a journal of American Medicine , Dr. MacDougall told of one patient who was dying of tuberculosis .
He wrote : " He lost weight slowly at the rate of one ounce per hour due to evaporation of moisture in respiration and evaporation of sweat .
At the end of the three hours and forty minutes , he expired and suddenly coincident with death the beam end ( of the scale ) dropped with an audible stroke . . . "
He said the loss was about three - fourths of an ounce , or just over 21 grams .
MacDougall conducted similar tests during the deaths of other patients over the years and got similar results .
He noted that the entire bed was weighed so that any loss of fluids from urine or the bowels at the moment of death would still be weighed because the material would remain on the bed .
The doctor even considered loss of left - over air in the lungs .
To test the possible weight of air in the lungs , he said he and another person each got on the bed and strenuously inhaled and exhaled .
Their efforts made no change on the scale .
As a further part of his experiments , Dr. MacDougall wrote that he tried the same experiment with 15 dogs .
He said he had to drug the animals to keep them from struggling , which suggests that he also used drugs to kill them .
He wrote that there was no change in the weight of the bodies of the dogs at the moment of their death .
The experiments suggest then , that the soul has substance and a measurable mass .
It also suggests that humans have something that animals do not , and that it leaves the body at the moment we die .
What continues to remain a mystery is what that something is .
Steve McClaren has done it .
P34 W27 D5 L2 , and top of the league for all but six weeks of the campaign , he has won the Eredivisie title for the first time in the history of FC Twente .
The key to Twente ’s success has been stability .
When McClaren arrived at the club in 2008 , he stuck with the loose 4 - 3 - 3 system Twente had been playing for the previous couple of seasons , and has played it even when faced with injury problems ( with a relatively weak squad ) or a brief loss of form .
Equally as important as stability in shape has been stability in personnel .
In a 34 - game season , nine players have started more than thirty games – Theo Janssen and Dwight Tiendalli being the exceptions .
McClaren managed to completely revamp the side and stamp his authority upon it , whilst retaining the resilience that had seen them finish 4th the season before he arrived .
This truly is his side – seven of the eleven first - choice players are his signings , but he identified a solid spine of existing players that would remain – the Boschker - Douglas - Brama - Nkufo axis was there when McClaren arrived , and he clearly built around it .
Although Twente have been successful because of their discipline and organisation , there is no dedicated holding player in the centre of midfield .
Wout Brama and Theo Janssen are two combative players who dovetail well and sit infront of the back four when Twente are not in possession , whilst the silky , left - footed veteran Kenneth Perez acts as the link between midfield and attack , and has few defensive responsibilities .
The wide players are difficult to categorize as forwards , creative wingers or hard - working wide midfielders – their role is a combination of all three .
When in possession they move high up the pitch against the opposition full - backs , and Twente regularly look to play diagonal balls , but when the opposition have the ball the wide players get through far more work than Perez , dropping deep and closing down .
McClaren ’s system has been widely defined as a 4 - 3 - 3 , but Twente ’s shape is more complex than that , and depends entirely on whether they have the ball or not .
If they do , it ’s a 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 , when they do n’t it is more like a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , or even a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 – the latter would probably be more appropriate , because as mentioned earlier , the two central midfielders are not ‘ holding ’ players in the usual sense .
This has been a problem when Twente have travelled away to big sides – they were thrashed 0 - 3 at Ajax , deservedly lost 0 - 1 to AZ , and found themselves 0 - 3 down after thirty minutes at Werder Bremen in the Europa League , in a match they went onto lose 1 - 4 .
In a sense , it ’s difficult to blame McClaren for this – the mentality needed to beat bottom - half Eredivisie sides is completely different to the one needed to grind out a 0 - 0 against a top - class side , and it ’s difficult to switch your side for those rare matches , especially when you have built your side around the concept of stability .
Nevertheless ,
Twente will have to be slightly less tactically naive if they are to make an impact in next year ’s Champions League – whether McClaren will be around to direct them is another question .
What McClaren ’s success should not give way to is a revisionist attitude to his spell as manager of the England side , as happened last year when Twente finishing second raised eyebrows .
The claims that he was ‘ hounded out of England ’ are slightly difficult to take , when he was merely sacked and disliked for being bad at his job .
He made poor decisions both in terms of tactics and selection , and failed to get to Euro 2008 - unquestionably a sackable offence .
There was no suggestion ( at least from any intelligent source ) when he was removed from his job that he was a useless football manager , merely that he was n’t up to being England boss .
Widely regarded as an excellent coach rather than a skilled tactician or motivator , it ’s relatively little surprise that he has prospered in a club role on the continent , where he is working with intelligent players day in , day out , and is able to do what he does best – coach them .
That should not detract from his achievement .
One of the slightly odd comments repeated over the weekend was that McClaren became ‘ the first English manager to win a major foreign league since Bobby Robson at Porto in 1996 ′ .
A major foreign league ?
No English manager has won the English league title in that time either .
What next for McClaren ?
Offers are apparently flooding in , and with respect to Twente , he would be a fool not to move on now .
It will be difficult for him to advance his current club further ; the only way is down in the Eredivisie , and making a real impact on the Champions League will be very difficult .
Whether his reputation will ever recover in his home country remains doubtful – even this triumph was ‘ celebrated ’ in England by links to an old YouTube video where he puts on a slightly questionable Dutch accent .
If fulfilling his potential as a coach means spending the vast majority of his career abroad , then so be it ; at least he is now known for something positive – aside from appearing on the banner of a football tactics website .

Fake news by Andy BorowitzNORFOLK , Va. — Eleven indicted Somali pirates dropped a bombshell in a U.S. court today , revealing that their entire piracy operation is a subsidiary of banking giant Goldman Sachs .
There was an audible gasp in the courtroom when the leader of the pirates announced , “ We are doing God ’s work .
We work for Lloyd Blankfein . ”
The pirate , who said he earned a bonus of $ 48 million in doubloons last year , elaborated on the nature of the Somalis ’ work for Goldman , explaining that the pirates forcibly attacked ships that Goldman had already shorted .
“ We were functioning as investment bankers , only every day was casual Friday , ” the pirate said .
The pirate acknowledged that they merged their operations with Goldman in late 2008 to take advantage of the more relaxed regulations governing bankers as opposed to pirates , “ plus to get our share of the bailout money . ”
In the aftermath of the shocking revelations , government prosecutors were scrambling to see if they still had a case against the Somali pirates , who would now be treated as bankers in the eyes of the law .
“ There are lots of laws that could bring these guys down if they were , in fact , pirates , ” one government source said .
“ But if they ’re bankers , our hands are tied . ”
Goldman to Employ ‘ Douchebag Defense ’
NEW YORK —
In the event of a criminal case against the banking giant , Goldman Sachs is planning to employ a rarely used legal strategy known as the “ douchebag defense , ” sources confirmed today .
Davis Logsdon , dean of the University of Minnesota School of Law , summarized the unorthodox strategy : “ Basically , they will be arguing that the Goldman executives had no control over their actions because they are ginormous dicks . ”
“ Exhibit A ” if the bank decides to go forward with the douchebag defense will be Goldman banker Fabrice “ Fabulous Fab ” Tourre .
“ I think the government would have a hard time arguing that he was not an egregious douche , ” Logsdon said .
In order to establish Tourre ’s douchebag bona fides , Goldman ’s lawyers would most likely offer up his e-mails , his Facebook profile and several of his ex-girlfriends .
Jury selection could also be key to the success of Goldman ’s douchebag defense strategy .
“ Goldman ’s dream jury would be made up of 12 angry dickwads , ” Logsdon said .
“ In New York , that should n’t be hard to find . ”

Five female news presenters at the pan-Arab Al Jazeera satellite television channel have resigned over conflicts with management over dress code and other issues , a journalist there said on Sunday .
" This collective resignation is not motivated just by the growing pressure on the presenters concerning their dress code , which was evoked by the media , " said the journalist , who asked not to be identified .
" The conflicts run much deeper , " the journalist added .
The news presenters who have reportedly quit are Jumana Namur , Lina Zahreddin , Lona al - Shibel , Julnar Mussa and Nofar Afli .
The Al - Hayat daily reported on Sunday that they had resigned in the past few days after petitioning management in January over repeated criticism from a top company official for allegedly not being conservative enough in their dress .
The above - ground world that we can see is only a small part of what ’s actually there .
In cities around the world , subterranean passageways , hidden histories and underground complexes crisscross beneath the surface .
There is a thriving underground world that the average person never gets to see…unless that person knows where to look .
There are hundreds of these underground cities , some well - known commercial ventures and others little more than urban legends , in nearly every part of the world .
These are but a few of the fascinating subterranean cities and hidden underground spaces that dwell beneath our feet .
Seattle Underground
( images via : Pentaboxes and Wikipedia )
Seattle has a fascinating underground district that ’s more well - known than most others .
Pioneer Square was the birthplace of Seattle ; the district was built on filled - in tidelands in the very early days of the city .
After 25 city blocks were destroyed in the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 , Seattle officials made two important decisions : all new buildings must be made of stone or brick , and the rebuilt area would be one to two stories higher than the original buildings .
Building on top of the old district solved the problem of frequent flooding , but it created a bizarre downtown area where previously - ground - level windows were now basement windows and shoppers had to use ladders to go between levels of the downtown area .
Eventually the rest of the area was built up enough that the subterranean passages lay unused ; they were condemned due to plague fears in 1907 and then were all but forgotten .
That is , until the 1960s when an effort was undertaken to turn Pioneer Square into a protected historic site .
Today , only a small section of the Underground has been restored enough to be safe for public tours .
PATH , Toronto
PATH is not only well - known ; it ’s openly advertised as the largest underground shopping complex in the world .
While Toronto ’s subterranean passageways are n’t exactly hidden or mysterious , they are still quite interesting .
The origins of the network can be traced back to the early 20th century , when stores built simple underground passages to get shoppers from one location to another .
Then , in the 1960s city planners decided to un-clog the crowded downtown sidewalks by moving shopping centers underground .
The massive 17 mile network is almost like an entire city on its own with shopping facilities , restaurants , banks , entertainment and public transport all linked up .
Double Decker City , Montreal , Canada
Montreal boasts its own substantial underground area known as RESO .
It is said to be the largest underground complex in the world at over 4.6 square miles .
Taking shops and public transit link - ups underground helps to keep travelers out of the often - harsh Quebec weather , and the complex is also an important destination for many tourists .
But permanent residents of the city tend to see the subterranean network as just another part of Montral .
SubTropolis , Kansas City , MO
Another record - setting underground space is SubTropolis , a huge former limestone mine resting beneath the ground of Kansas City , Missouri .
Occupying 55 million square feet , the man -made cave is what was left over after a 270 - million - year - old limestone deposit was mined out of the area .
The resulting space is climate - controlled , protected from the elements and stable enough that the USPS rents space there .
With offices , storage and industrial outfits occupying the rental units , SubTropolis ’ owners have trademarked the phrase World ’s Largest Underground Business Complex .
As kooky as underground businesses may sound at first , they ’re onto something .
By moving operations underground , businesses can save a huge amount on utility costs and cut down on their carbon footprints .
This plan also allows cities to become more densely populated because valuable real estate is no longer occupied by business space .
SubTropolis and other underground business complexes might just be the start of a new era of subterranean downtowns .
Coober Pedy , South Australia
( images via : Wikipedia and DuReMi )
It ’s not always economics that drive a city to build underground .
Coober Pedy residents choose to live underground to escape the brutal daytime desert heat of the world above ground .
Most locals choose to live in “ dugouts , ” or underground homes literally dug out of the landscape with picks and shovels .
Digging out an underground home in the town costs about the same as building an above - ground one , though since the town is known as the opal capital of the world there have been plenty of reports of diggers paying for the entire cost of their new home with opals they find during the digging process .
Cappadocia , Turkey
Like the residents of Coober Pedy , the people who settled what is now called Cappadocia , Turkey retreated underground due to the nature of the land .
There was little to build with in the area , so residents simply carved homes out of the stone .
The cave - like homes have existed for thousands of years and passed between many countries ’ hands , but they have remained strong and sturdy .
The area has become a very popular tourist attraction , with a large portion of the economy being based on visitors .

Russian Policeman Kills Himself Scratching Nose with His Gun
The tragedy happened in the court security facility .
At 6 pm the officer ’s supervisor tried to connect with him over the phone to check on him .
The sergeant did not answer his phone and the supervisor had to go see him with other officers .
The police found a locked door they had to break and the body of their colleague behind the door .
The policeman ’s body with a wound in the head was found under the desk .
The investigation ruled out a murder .
There was no note that would indicate suicide .
The victim had been serving in police since 2007 .
He was single and was not registered with the staff psychologist .
He was reported to be in good spirits on the day of the accident .
The sergeant allegedly scratched his nose with his gun and accidentally pulled the trigger .

The Science of Genius : A Q&A With Author David Shenk
Photo : Heidi Schumann
Practice makes genius ?
That ’s the idea behind the research of people like Anders Ericsson .
It ’s also at the center of a new book , The Genius in All of Us , by journalist David Shenk .
Shenk robustly disputes the popular belief that intelligence and talent are genetically predetermined , and methodically explains the thousands of hours of practice behind the “ genius ” of a host of musical and athletic superstars ( and those amazing London cabbies ) .
Can anyone be Michael Jordan ?
Probably not , but Shenk believes that most people are capable of a lot more than they realize .
His book explores ideas similar to those recently covered in books like Malcolm Gladwell ‘s Outliers , Geoff Colvin ‘s Talent Is Overrated , and Daniel Coyle ‘s The Talent Code , but there are plenty of new angles in Shenk ’s Genius .
He has agreed to answer a few questions about the book .
Q .
The idea that genes simplistically dictate both physical attributes and intellectual capabilities ( or lack thereof ) is pretty widespread , perhaps because of those Mendel - inspired eye color charts everyone fills out in high school biology , but the truth is a bit more complicated .
How do genes work ?
Most importantly of all , can two blue - eyed parents really produce a brown - eyed child ?
A .
They really can .
The key thing for people to understand about genes is that , while of course they substantially impact everything about who we are , the actual end results for any trait — eye color , height , athleticism , musicality — is the result of a dynamic interaction between genes and their immediate environment .
Genes do n’t contain instructions for eye color per se ; they contain instructions on how proteins should be assembled .
Exactly how those instructions get transmitted and subsequently become eye color , etc. , is constantly affected by hormones , which in turn can be affected by nutrition , stress , activity , even thoughts .
Genes are not blueprints — they ’re more like switches that get turned on and off .
This may seem jarring to a lot of people who , as you say , learned the more simplistic Mendelian version .
But the gene expression paradigm is widely accepted among geneticists .
Q .
So if intelligence is n’t predetermined by genes , what does determine intelligence ?
A .
Genes influence intelligence , to be sure .
But fundamentally , intelligence is an accumulation of skills — not an innate thing .
We all have genetic differences that are going to impact how we develop and learn .
But that ’s a far cry from saying that some people are just genetically doomed to be lackluster and others are destined to be brilliant .
Intellectual skills and the psychological motivation to develop them begin to develop not long after birth and remain in play until you take your last breath .
Q .
What about pure geniuses like Michael Jordan or Mozart ?
Those kinds of extraordinary people must just be different than the rest of us — more genetically gifted , right ?
A .
That ’s what it looks like from far away .
Jordan flies through the air with such grace and abilities so far apart from mine that it seems he must be some sort of genetically gifted super - being .
The rebuttal to this actually takes an entire book to convey , but it first involves helping people understand that everything about talent is a process .
There ’s the genetic piece , and then there ’s the ability piece .
When you look very closely at Jordan ’s life , you see a rather ordinary teenage athlete with no particularly grand ambition until about mid-way through high school .
( Do n’t take my word for it – read David Halberstam ‘s Playing For Keeps . )
After the deep disappointment of not making the varsity team , Jordan developed an unparalleled ambition that quite simply dwarfed that of his schoolmates in high school and later his teammates at the University of North Carolina .
Jordan ’s abilities developed according to what he demanded of himself .
The same is true of other super - achievers .
From a distance , it looks like they ’ve got something almost super - human about them .
But when you look up close , at the moment - to - moment lives they lead , the sacrifices they make , the extraordinary resources they have around them , their abilities actually do make logical sense .
If it ’s documented closely enough , you can actually see how they went from mediocre to good , from good to great , from great to extraordinary .
This is not to say that anyone can literally became anything , or that we ’re equal in our potential .
But from my vantage point , the true genetic gift is the design of the genome itself — our bodies and our minds are simply designed to respond to environmental demands .
Q .
You give evidence in the book that child prodigies are often not successful as adults .
Why not ?
A .
Several reasons .
First is that the skills are quite different .
Child achievers are masters of a particular technical skill , which is impressive compared to other children ; adult achievers have technical skill too , of course , but also a creative layer which is quite different .
It often does n’t naturally follow that the young technical achievers will also become creative masters .
The second reason is that early super achievers often get stuck in the psychology of their own success .
Children who grow up surrounded by praise for being technically proficient at a specific task often develop a natural aversion to stepping outside their comfort zone .
Instead of falling into a pattern of taking risks and regularly pushing themselves just beyond their limit , they develop a terrible fear of new challenges and of any sort of flaw or failure .
Ironically , this leads them away from the very building blocks of adult success .
Boston College ’s Ellen Winner has written eloquently about this issue .
Q .
The Genius in All of Us is “ not a instruction manual about how YOU TOO can become JUST LIKE WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE ! ” but you do offer some suggestions for how the average person can achieve greatness .
Can you share a few of them with us ?
A .
In the book , the suggestions are made specifically in the context of understanding the science that lies behind them .
Without that scientific underpinning , they ’ll likely come off as motivational pablum .
But here goes …
BE YOUR OWN TOUGHEST CRITIC .
Nietzsche wrote : “ All great artists and thinkers [ are ] great workers , indefatigable not only in inventing , but also in rejecting , sifting , transforming , ordering . ”
His observation was dead - on , and timeless .
Hollywood movies suggest that genius is a series of Eureka !
moments , that true greatness flows effortlessly .
We live under the great myth of the perfect first draft .
While moments of inspiration do exist , great work is , for the most part , painstaking and cannot happen without the most severe ( and constructive ) self - criticism .
DELAY GRATIFICATION AND RESIST CONTENTEDNESS .
In consumer culture , we are constantly conditioned to gratify our impulses immediately : buy , eat , watch , click - now .
High achievers transcend these ?
impulses .
Like the Buddha who waits patiently at the gates of heaven until all others have entered before him , young Kenyans are content to run for many ?
years before they can even dream of competing in a major international contest .
The tiny violinist screeches out earsplitting sounds not because he thinks ?
a dazzling concerto is right around the corner , but because there is something satisfying in the struggle and in the tiny improvements made along the way .
The big prize is envisioned and appreciated as a far - off goal - it is not lusted after .
Small accomplishments along the way provide more than enough ? satisfaction to continue .
Q .
What does this new understanding of genetics and intelligence mean for parenting ?
What can parents do to help their kids achieve greatness ?
A .
In this limited space , let me just stick to one point , which is that parents need to model a life of delayed gratification and persistence if they want their kids to embrace those values themselves .
Show your kids how hard you work , how often you experience disappointments and how you respond to those disappointments .
If you blame others for your failures or simply give up , that ’s what your kids will learn .
If you take on a long - term challenge , show a deep commitment to the process and a refusal to give up in the face of adversity , your kids will pick that up instead .
At the same time , though , people everywhere have some sense of right and wrong .
You wo n’t find a society where people do n’t have some notion of fairness , do n’t put some value on loyalty and kindness , do n’t distinguish between acts of cruelty and innocent mistakes , do n’t categorize people as nasty or nice .
These universals make evolutionary sense .
Since natural selection works , at least in part , at a genetic level , there is a logic to being instinctively kind to our kin , whose survival and well - being promote the spread of our genes .
More than that , it is often beneficial for humans to work together with other humans , which means that it would have been adaptive to evaluate the niceness and nastiness of other individuals .
All this is reason to consider the innateness of at least basic moral concepts .
In addition , scientists know that certain compassionate feelings and impulses emerge early and apparently universally in human development .
These are not moral concepts , exactly , but they seem closely related .
One example is feeling pain at the pain of others .
In his book “ The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , ” Charles Darwin , a keen observer of human nature , tells the story of how his first son , William , was fooled by his nurse into expressing sympathy at a very young age : “ When a few days over 6 months old , his nurse pretended to cry , and I saw that his face instantly assumed a melancholy expression , with the corners of his mouth strongly depressed . ”
There seems to be something evolutionarily ancient to this empathetic response .
If you want to cause a rat distress , you can expose it to the screams of other rats .
Human babies , notably , cry more to the cries of other babies than to tape recordings of their own crying , suggesting that they are responding to their awareness of someone else ’s pain , not merely to a certain pitch of sound .
Babies also seem to want to assuage the pain of others : once they have enough physical competence ( starting at about 1 year old ) , they soothe others in distress by stroking and touching or by handing over a bottle or toy .
There are individual differences , to be sure , in the intensity of response : some babies are great soothers ; others do n’t care as much .
But the basic impulse seems common to all .
( Some other primates behave similarly : the primatologist Frans de Waal reports that chimpanzees “ will approach a victim of attack , put an arm around her and gently pat her back or groom her . ”
Monkeys , on the other hand , tend to shun victims of aggression . )
Some recent studies have explored the existence of behavior in toddlers that is “ altruistic ” in an even stronger sense — like when they give up their time and energy to help a stranger accomplish a difficult task .
The psychologists Felix Warneken and Michael Tomasello have put toddlers in situations in which an adult is struggling to get something done , like opening a cabinet door with his hands full or trying to get to an object out of reach .
The toddlers tend to spontaneously help , even without any prompting , encouragement or reward .
Is any of the above behavior recognizable as moral conduct ?
Not obviously so .
Moral ideas seem to involve much more than mere compassion .
Morality , for instance , is closely related to notions of praise and blame : we want to reward what we see as good and punish what we see as bad .
Morality is also closely connected to the ideal of impartiality — if it ’s immoral for you to do something to me , then , all else being equal , it is immoral for me to do the same thing to you .
In addition , moral principles are different from other types of rules or laws : they cannot , for instance , be overruled solely by virtue of authority .
( Even a 4 - year - old knows not only that unprovoked hitting is wrong but also that it would continue to be wrong even if a teacher said that it was O.K. )
And we tend to associate morality with the possibility of free and rational choice ; people choose to do good or evil .
To hold someone responsible for an act means that we believe that he could have chosen to act otherwise .
Babies and toddlers might not know or exhibit any of these moral subtleties .
Their sympathetic reactions and motivations — including their desire to alleviate the pain of others — may not be much different in kind from purely nonmoral reactions and motivations like growing hungry or wanting to void a full bladder .
Even if that is true , though , it is hard to conceive of a moral system that did n’t have , as a starting point , these empathetic capacities .
As David Hume argued , mere rationality can’t be the foundation of morality , since our most basic desires are neither rational nor irrational .
“ ’ Tis not contrary to reason , ” he wrote , “ to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger . ”
To have a genuinely moral system , in other words , some things first have to matter , and what we see in babies is the development of mattering .

Moral - Baby Experiments
So what do babies really understand about morality ?
Our first experiments exploring this question were done in collaboration with a postdoctoral researcher named Valerie Kuhlmeier ( who is now an associate professor of psychology at Queen ’s University in Ontario ) .
Building on previous work by the psychologists David and Ann Premack , we began by investigating what babies think about two particular kinds of action : helping and hindering .
President Obama spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu before his appearance at a Memorial Day event Monday , telling the Israeli prime minister that it is imperative to learn the details of a commando raid on a flotilla that ended up with nine dead and dozens injured .
Netanyahu canceled plans to visit the White House on Tuesday after Israeli commandos were attacked while trying to board a ship in the flotilla heading toward Hamas - controlled Gaza overnight with aid and arms in violation of an Israeli blockade .
Netanyahu had been expected to arrive in Washington , D.C. , Tuesday after leaving Canada , where he 's been meeting with officials there .
Instead , he headed home .
Obama expressed regret for those injured and killed but said he understood the prime minister 's decision to return immediately to Israel .
The leaders agreed to reschedule their meeting at the " first opportunity . "
The White House is taking a cautious approach before chastising Israel as it awaits more details on the conflict .
The United Nations was preparing an emergency session that would most likely end in condemnation .
White House spokesman Bill Burton said Monday that administration officials are " currently working to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragedy . "
Sen .
John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , also said a " thorough investigation " is needed .
" At this point , it is unclear what happened and there must be a thorough investigation .
This unfortunate incident underscores the necessity of resolving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians , " Kerry , D - Mass . , said in a written statement .
Several Israeli commandos were injured in the conflict after they were dropped by helicopter onto the decks and met by passengers trying to seize their guns , the Israeli Foreign Ministry said .
After speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , Netanyahu said Israel wanted to check the cargo of the ships to ensure they contained no weapons , and received cooperation from five ships , but the sixth resisted .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Monday that he regrets the deaths , but the flotilla contained violent supporters of terror groups that have attacked Israel in support of Hamas , which is listed by the U.S. State Department as an international sponsor of terrorism .
Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi said soldiers were forced to fire on the ship , which contained weapons , after commandos were beaten with clubs and sticks and stabbed with knives .
One participant in the flotilla told Haaretz that the 700 pro-Palestinian activists aboard the ships were prepared for the scenario that unfolded .
" We fully intend to go to Gaza regardless of any intimidation or threats of violence against us , " Huwaida Arraf said .
" They are going to have to forcefully stop us . "
Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon noted that any other country would be considered in the right if it had acted in defense of its territorial integrity in the face of an armed group attempting to break the sovereign authority of a nation .
The Israeli Foreign Ministry added that Gaza is not facing a humanitarian crisis , but if activists want to deliver aid , they can deliver shipments through the Israeli port of Ashdod .
" The flotilla constitutes a politically - motivated media event , initiated by anti-Israel activists and extreme Islamic elements , under the guise of an act the organizers are attempting to depict as a humanitarian operation , " the ministry said .
The United States , among others , has been trying to restart direct peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians , and the meeting between Netanyahu and President Obama was an attempt to reset talks after a disappointing visit earlier this year .
Obama also has scheduled a meeting June 9 with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
In a statement last week , the White House said that Obama and Abbas planned to discuss the ongoing Israeli - Palestinian proximity talks and ways the U.S. can work with both parties to move into direct talks .
They also will discuss U.S. efforts to support the establishment of a Palestinian state .
The above photo was taken in 1940 .
Some people say the hipster - looking fellow with the sunglasses on the right side of the photo is a time traveler because his hair , shades , clothing , and camera did n't exist at the time .
But Forgetomori does a fine job of busting this rumor , complete with photos .
Curses !
The outfit could also be found 70 years ago .
Being used as we are to our contemporary fashion , we look at the man and assume he 's wearing a stamped T - shirt , something that would be indeed out of place ( or time ) .
But if you look carefully , you can see that he 's actually wearing ( or could as well be wearing ) a sweatshirt .
And sweatshirts with bordered emblems were not uncommon in the 1940s – in fact you can find those in other photos from the same exhibit .

That 's where it gets interesting .
You could leave leave it up to regulators to rifle through banks ' portfolios .
But honestly , who trusts bank regulators , these days ?
Not Narayana Kocherlakota ( a bank regulator ) .
So he has another strategy for designing a bank tax .
The government would issue a " rescue bond " that reflected the market 's belief in the level of risk at every financial institution ( a Citi bond , a JPMorgan bond , etc ) .
There would often be no market for many of these bonds , because some banks simply are n't at risk to fail .
But as Citi took on more risk , interest rates would creep on Citi bonds , the government would assess a proportional tax on Citi .
Does this remind you of something ?
The government is issuing its own version of a credit default swap -- an insurance policy that measures that the likelihood that a security will default -- on entire financial institutions to determine which banks deserve a punitive tax for taking on too much risk .
Of course , this makes you wonder why the government would have to get into the game at all .
Why not just monitor the private CDS market and instruct regulators to consider new taxes on banks whose assets look particularly risky ?
You 'd face the same transparency challenges and misleading guessing games in both markets .
This is a wacky idea , indeed .
And Kocherlakota acknowledges that it 's wacky idea .
But it 's kind of fascinating too .
" To me it makes a lot more sense than taxing bigness , " says the Tax Policy Center 's Howard Gleckman , " because bigness is n't necessarily bad .
It 's what you do with your bigness that can hurt you .
It 's a smarter way to look at this issue of risk .
But whether it would work , I have no idea . "
Me neither .

* Some Democrats and liberal commentators , responding to GOP claims that the liquidation fund was a " bailout fund , " went too far by arguing that the Senate bill outlaws bailouts , for ever and ever , amen .
No way .
If too many large , intertwined banks fail at the same time , we 'll almost certainly bail some of them out .
Gold - dispensing ATMs : Coming to a city near you
A GOLD to go ATM debuts in Abu Dhabi's Emirates Palace Hotel
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As economic fears drive gold prices to new highs , the creator of a gold - dispensing ATM is attracting attention around the globe .
Germany - based GOLD to go , which is currently churning out 50 gold machines a month to meet a recent jump in demand , launched its first ATM in Abu Dhabi's Emirates Palace Hotel earlier this month and opened its second in Germany last week .
The golden ATM's next destinations are the Bergamo Airport in Milan , Italy , all major airports in Malaysia , one of Russia 's biggest banks and an undetermined location in Turkey .
By making gold investing as easy as buying a candy bar from a vending machine , GOLD to go hopes to attract average buyers to the gold market .
" We are going to make gold public with these machines , " said Thomas Geissler , CEO of Ex Oriente Lux AG , which owns GOLD to go .
" The prices are so easy to control that we 're going to de-mystify gold and make it easier for anyone to buy it . "
GOLD to go 's ATM looks like a vending machine and dispenses gold coins and bars weighing up to one ounce at prices updated every 10 minutes based on the real - time spot price of gold .
ATM - owners can choose from a variety of other gold items , such as gold Canadian maple leaf coins , South African Krugerrands , and even some custom designs .
For example , the special edition gold medallion it engraved with the Palace Hotel 's logo was created for the United Arab Emirate debut .
Earlier this month , gold prices hit an all time high of nearly $ 1,250 per ounce , and the precious metal has continued to climb as euro zone countries struggle with debt and investors worry that the region 's problems could spread globally .
Until this uncertainty in the market eases , the demand for gold will only grow , said Carlos Sanchez , a precious metals analyst at CPM Group .
" [ The ATM ] is just a reflection of the demand from consumers and investors for exposure to gold , " he said .
" As long as prices continue to trend upward and investors remain concerned over economic and political conditions , I think we 'll keep seeing strong demand for safe - haven assets like gold . "
Next stop , Italy : Patrizio Locatelli , owner of SE 6 , a small company in Italy that pays customers for gold , flew to GOLD to go 's factory in Germany to check out the prototype when it was first unveiled .
Locatelli was having a hard time keeping up with the costs of rent and hiring employees , so when he came across the GOLD to go ATM online , he saw it as a golden ticket to an efficient way to expand his business .
" When you see exchange rates going up and down every day with the euro under so much pressure and stocks decreasing , this gold machine seemed like a very sound idea , " he said .
" In times like these you must think of somewhere else to put your money , and physical gold still has great appeal for everyone . "
Locatelli is now launching a GOLD to go ATM in Milan 's Bergamo Airport , which he says is one of Italy 's fastest growing airports .
" [ Bergamo ] is a great place for it , because serious international business travelers will stop over here a few times a month at least , " he said .
" In general you tend to spend more when you 're traveling and in a good mood , so you can now use a vending machine to get a present for someone or buy some bullions as an investment . "
After a three - month testing period at Bergamo Airport , Locatelli said he hopes to introduce gold ATMs in every airport in Italy as well as major community centers and banks .
Not for serious investors ?
While the ATMs could be a hit with wealthy travelers , the idea is unlikely to catch on with serious investors , said Jeffrey Nichols , managing director at American Precious Metals Advisors .
" It 's an interesting phenomenon , and I can see that wealthy and high - net - worth travelers might make impulse splurges on gold bars or coins , but I can't see a serious investor buying gold through a vending machine , " he said .
Jon Nadler , senior analyst at Kitco Metals , agreed , saying that he would be surprised if investors bought into the new invention , because unlike the spot market , ATMs do n't take your gold back when you want to sell it .
" Gold is a two - way market , so I would like to see that same machine buy back that gold and spit out cash , " said Nadler .
" A gold - dispensing ATM is great , but a real ATM also accepts deposits . "
Nadler also said that GOLD to go's higher prices may be a deterrent , especially to investors who want to purchase large amounts .
GOLD to go says that , like any physical gold vendor , it must apply a margin to its items .
While the spot price for one ounce of gold was about $ 1,214 in midday trading on Thursday , GOLD to go was selling a 1 - ounce gold bar for 1,044.86 euros , or approximately $ 1,284.13 .
But the ATM 's popularity shows how much more available gold is becoming as demand picks up .
" It shows how attitudes toward gold are changing , " said Nichols .
" Gold is available in more forms and through distributors that make it more accessible for average people around the world to buy gold . "
Thorsten Polleit est chef économiste de Barclays Capital en Allemagne .
Il porte un regard très critique sur le gigantesque paquet de sauvetage monté par les Etats de la zone euro .
Comment jugez - vous le plan de secours de 750 milliards d'euros pour la zone euro ?
On ne peut pas résoudre le problème par de l'endettement supplémentaire .
Pour soutenir certains pays pris dans une crise de dette , les gouvernements vont devoir emprunter encore .
Ce n'est pas une solution .
L'urgence aujourd 'hui , pour la zone euro , c'est d'annoncer une stratégie crédible de réduction des déficits .
Si la pression des marchés est devenue si forte , si les investisseurs perdent confiance , c'est précisément parce qu'un tel concept n'existe pas .
Il est temps de le formuler .
Que faut - il faire ?
Les décisions sont du ressort de chaque gouvernement , au niveau national .
Il faut voir comment couper dans les dépenses , réduire les déficits le plus rapidement possible , graver ces objectifs dans le marbre comme nous l'avons fait en Allemagne en inscrivant un mécanisme de " frein à la dette " dans notre Constitution …
On doit se rappeler qu'à l'origine , si le pacte de stabilité avait été respecté à la lettre , on n'en serait pas là .
Grâce à ce plan , n'a - t - on pas néanmoins écarté le risque de contagion de la crise grecque ?
Oui en ce qui concerne les pays menacés dans l'immédiat .
Mais c'est la qualité de crédit des Etats bien notés qui en subira les conséquences .
Les conditions d'emprunt des pays prêteurs vont sans doute se dégrader .
En fait , le problème ne fait que se déplacer et risque , à terme , de s'aggraver .
La décision de la Banque centrale européenne ( BCE ) d'acheter de la dette publique porte - t - elle un coup à sa crédibilité ?
Il est clair que si la BCE agit ainsi , c'est parce que les gouvernements européens le souhaitent .
On a là un instrument de politique monétaire qui semble n'avoir pas été décidé en toute indépendance .
Cette décision est très problématique : dans la durée , un tel programme risque de créer de l'inflation et d'entraîner une perte de confiance des investisseurs .
Qu 'en est-il de la stabilité de l'euro à long terme ?
Si les Etats ne trouvent pas le moyen de réduire leur endettement qui atteint souvent des niveaux insoutenables , l'euro est sérieusement menacé .
La création de la monnaie unique a été une vaste expérimentation dont l'issue est aujourd ' hui très incertaine .
Surtout si les choses continuent ainsi , avec certains pays condamnés à payer encore et encore des sommes toujours plus importantes .
Croyez - vous que l'Allemagne récupérera l'argent des prêts faits à la Grèce ?
Non , je crois au contraire que les sommes ne seront jamais remboursées .
Propos recueillis par Marie de Vergès
​ Illinois residents with chronic health conditions which can be alleviated by marijuana are urging state lawmakers to let their state join 14 others , including Michigan and New Jersey , that have legalized cannabis use for medicinal purposes .
The State Journal - Register .
But advocates say they will continue to push for Senate Bill 1381 , which they say safeguards against abuse of medical marijuana and criminal involvement in growing and distributing the herb .
The Illinois House adjourned Friday before acting on legislation legalizing medical marijuana which has already passed the state Senate , reports Dean Olsen at .
But advocates say they will continue to push for Senate Bill 1381 , which they say safeguards against abuse of medical marijuana and criminal involvement in growing and distributing the herb .
The usual opponents , including , of course , law enforcement organizations , have lined up in opposition to the bill , citing the same , tired old arguments against medical marijuana .
“ There ’s a lot of stuff in marijuana that ’s not good for you , ” claimed Limey Nargelenas , a lobbyist for the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police .
“ It ’s like people taking meth , ” Nargelenas said in one of the most ridiculous statements ever made about medical pot .
“ People feel a lot better after ingesting methamphetamine . ”
“ We believe you ’re putting it in the hands of people interested in being responsible citizens , ” said Brian Mueller , director of Illinois Safe Access , based in Chicago .
Supporters of the bill say studies published in peer - reviewed journals show that cannabis provides medicinal relief to patients with cancer , multiple sclerosis , epilepsy , Crohn ’s disease and other serious conditions .
It ’s clear that medical marijuana has benefits , such as easing nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy , said Dr. Eric Larson at Seattle ’s Group Health Research Institute and co-author of a 1999 Institute of Medicine report on medical marijuana .
But research on cannabis has been hindered by the federal Schedule I classification of marijuana as a “ completely illegal drug , ” Dr. Larson said .
Advocates say the legalization of medical marijuana would pave the way for more scientific research .
State Rep. Lou Lang ( D - Skokie ) said last week that it appeared the Illinois bill is a few shorts of the 60 required for passage in the House .
He said he wo n’t call it for a vote unless he knows that the measure will pass .
Lang said he may call for a vote after the November election and before newly elected lawmakers take office in January — which highlights the perceived political risk of supporting medical marijuana , even though a recent national poll shows that more than 80 percent of American voters back the idea .
“ What I have to overcome is the basic political calculation that many of my colleagues take , ” Lang said .
“ Ultimately , this is a health care bill .
It ’s not a bill about drugs .
I ’m here for people ’s health care and pain .
We should do this controlled piece of legislation … to help people . ”
While working at an automotive job , I decided to transition to an IT career and put the plan in motion by self - studying and taking evening classes .
After I had the necessary training , I started a search for an IT job .
I landed my first IT position as a low - level Tech 1 with a company that sold and maintained case management software for police departments .

The first day I did all the normal HR stuff : filled out forms , met the group manager , and was escorted to an office -- an office !
I was stoked .
The manager opened the office door and I met my new office mate , " Bob . "
The manager introduced us and said I was to get to know the case management software by working on the demo system .
Because I did not yet have a PC to get email on , the manager told Bob to let me log in a few times a day on his computer to get email and work with the online material , but mostly I was to work on the demo machine and follow Bob on help desk calls .
The manager left and closed the door behind him .
Bob looked at me and , barely waiting for the door to shut , said , " If you have another job , go back to it .
You wo n't make it here .
This is a bad company . "
I was saddened and sick to my stomach .
I had left a very stable ( but going nowhere ) job to do what I felt was going to be a new life for me and my family -- but this person who I had just met was telling me the company was unstable and I was n't going to make it .
I asked a few questions about the company , but essentially Bob told me nothing .
I learned this was a trend with him .
For instance , when I was working with the software on the demo machine and had a question , Bob would say things like , " You figure it out like I did , " or my favorite , " You wo n't be here long enough for me to waste the time to train you . "
We went on a few calls together , but we never rode in the same car .
Also , Bob would print out only one copy of the emails , so I never had an actual address .
If I asked for the address before we left , he would say , " Oh , just follow me . "
There were times I felt he was really trying to lose me on the freeways or would choose an exit at the last minute .
When I asked what was up with his driving , he would say , " Oh , you must not have been paying attention " or " That 's how I drive -- keep up or get left , I do n't care . "
This kind of stuff went on for about two weeks .
One day the manager came into our office when both Bob and I were there and asked me to accompany him to his office .
As I left , I noticed that Bob was smirking like a Cheshire cat .
The manager sat me down and there was a moment of silence .
After the last two weeks of Bob 's one - liners , car chases , and gloomy predictions , I felt like a doomed man .
The manager asked me how I liked the company so far and whether I felt like I was getting to know the product .
I said I was trying to learn the product , but there was very little documentation and the few help desk calls I did go out on were really just hardware / networking issues , not real software glitches .
As we talked , I sensed that the mood in the office was n't heavy like I was getting fired ; it was actually kind of nervous happy .
We chatted about families and would I like to start the first draft of help desk documentation for the software .
I realized that I was being given long - term assignments , not what you would expect if you were being let go .
It was turning into more of an after - hire interview .
The manager told me I had impressed a few customers with my etiquette and willingness to help , and he was glad to have me aboard .
Our little interview wound down .
The manager got up and said , " Let 's head back to your office . "
At first I was a little wary and then realized he had called it " your office . "
I was kind of smirking , hoping Bob would ask me about the meeting and that he would be perplexed about why I was back and not packing and being escorted out of the building .
I opened the door to the office and there was a security guard , an HR person , and Bob , who was packing his belongings into a large box .
The HR person was speaking to him about his rights after being terminated , and the security guard was just kind of standing there , hovering over him .
My manager said to the people in the room , " Oh sorry , I did n't realize you were still here , " and shut the door .
The manager looked at me and said , " I know what you were going through the last two weeks , and I wanted to tell you that we were letting Bob go , but I could n't .
Hey , let 's go get some lunch ! "
The only bad thing that happened after that was that I became the only tech for the help desk and was swamped with work .
While not fully trained in the software I was supporting , I did get to work with the developer and his team and they gave me a crash course in the software .
We went on to five solid years of support that won me an Employee of the Year award , two promotions , and a love for the IT help desk .

Update : Stuart Rojstaczer , the co-author of the grade inflation study summarized below , is taking reader questions .
Submit them here .
Over the last 50 years , college grade - point averages have risen about 0.1 points per decade , with private schools fueling the most grade inflation , a recent study finds .
The study , by Stuart Rojstaczer and Christopher Healy , uses historical data from 80 four - year colleges and universities .
It finds that G.P.A. ’s have risen from a national average of 2.52 in the 1950s to about 3.11 by the middle of the last decade .
For the first half of the 20th century , grading at private schools and public schools rose more or less in tandem .
But starting in the 1950s , grading at public and private schools began to diverge .
Students at private schools started receiving significantly higher grades than those received by their equally - qualified peers — based on SAT scores and other measures — at public schools .
In other words , both categories of schools inflated their grades , but private schools inflated their grades more .
The chart below shows average G.P.A. ’s from 1930 to 2006 .
Gray dots represent individual schools ’ average G.P.A’s .
The blue and green lines represent the average G.P.A. for each school type — public or private — over time :
Based on contemporary grading data the authors collected from 160 schools , the average G.P.A. at private colleges and universities today is 3.3 .
At public schools , it is 3.0 .
The authors suggest that these laxer grading standards may help explain why private school students are over - represented in top medical , business and law schools and certain Ph.D. programs : Admissions officers are fooled by private school students ’ especially inflated grades .
Additionally , the study found , science departments today grade on average 0.4 points lower than humanities departments , and 0.2 points lower than social science departments .
Such harsher grading for the sciences appears to have existed for at least 40 years , and perhaps much longer .
Relatively lower grades in the sciences discourage American students from studying such disciplines , the authors argue .
“ Partly because of our current ad hoc grading system , it is not surprising that
the U.S. has to rely heavily upon foreign - born graduate students for technical fields of research and upon foreign - born employees in its technology firms , ” they write .
These overall trends , if not the specific numbers , are no surprise to anyone who has followed debates about grade inflation .
But so long as schools believe that granting higher grades gives alumni an advantage , there will be little or no incentive to impose stricter grading standards unilaterally .
You can find a database of G.P.A. ’s by school over the last few years ( or in some cases , the last few decades ) here .

During the stabilization phase of the kernel development cycle , the -rc releases typically happen about once every week .
2.6.34 - rc4 is a clear exception to that rule , coming nearly two weeks after the preceding - rc3 release .
The holdup in this case was a nasty regression which occupied a number of kernel developers nearly full time for days .
The hunt for this bug is a classic story of what can happen when the code gets too complex .
Sending email to linux - kernel can be an intimidating prospect for a number of reasons , one of which being that one never knows when a massive thread - involving hundreds of messages copied back to the original sender - might result .
Borislav Petkov 's 2.6.34 - rc3 bug report was one such posting .
In this case , though , the ensuing thread was in no way inflammatory ; it represents , instead , some of the most intensive head - scratching which has been seen on the list for a while .
The bug , as reported by Borislav , was a null pointer dereference which would happen reasonably reliably after hibernating ( and restarting ) the system .
It was quickly recognized as being the same as another bug report filed the same day by Steinar H. Gunderson , though this one did not involve hibernation .
The common thread was null pointer dereferences provoked by memory pressure .
The offending patch was identified by Linus almost immediately ; it 's worth taking a look at what that patch did .
Way back in 2004 , LWN covered the addition of the anon_vma code ; this patch was controversial at the time because the upcoming 2.6.7 kernel was still expected to be an old - style " stable , no new features " release .
This patch , a 40 - part series which fundamentally reworked the virtual memory subsystem , was not seen as stable material , despite Linus 's attempt to characterize it as an " implementation detail . "
Still , over time , this code has proved solid and has not been changed significantly since - until now .
The problem solved by anon_vma was that of locating all vm_area_struct ( VMA ) structures which reference a given anonymous ( heap or stack memory ) page .
Anonymous pages are not normally shared between processes , but every call to fork ( ) will cause all such pages to be shared between the parent and the new child ; that sharing will only be broken when one of the processes writes to the page , causing a copy - on - write ( COW ) operation to take place .
Many pages are never written , so the kernel must be able to locate multiple VMAs which reference a given anonymous page .
Otherwise , it would not be able to unmap the page , meaning that the page could not be swapped out .
The reverse mapping solution originally used in 2.6 proved to be far too expensive , necessitating a rewrite .
This rewrite introduced the anon_vma structure , which heads up a linked list of all VMAs which might reference a given page .
So a fork ( ) also causes every VMA in the child process which contains anonymous pages to be added to a the list maintained in the parent 's anon_vma structure .
The mapping pointer in struct page points to the anon_vma structure , allowing the kernel to traverse the list and find all of the relevant VMA structures .
This diagram , from the 2004 article , shows how this data structure looks :
This solution scaled far better than its predecessor , but eventually the world caught up .
So Rik van Riel set out to make things faster , writing this patch , which was merged for 2.6.34 .
Rik describes the problem this way :
In a workload with 1000 child processes and a VMA with 1000 anonymous pages per process that get COWed , this leads to a system with a million anonymous pages in the same anon_vma , each of which is mapped in just one of the 1000 processes .
However , the current rmap code needs to walk them all , leading to O ( N ) scanning complexity for each page .
Essentially , by organizing all anonymous pages which originated in the same parent under the same anon_vma structure , the kernel created a monster data structure which it had to traverse every time it needed to reverse - map a page .
That led to the kernel scanning large numbers of VMAs which could not possibly reference the page , all while holding locks .
The result , says Rik , was " catastrophic failure " when running the AIM benchmark .
Rik 's solution was to create an anon_vma structure for each process and to link those together instead of the VMA structures .
This linking is done with a new structure called anon_vma_chain :
struct anon_vma_chain { struct vm_area_struct * vma ; struct anon_vma * anon_vma ; struct list_head same_vma ; struct list_head same_anon_vma ; } ;
Each anon_vma_chain entry ( AVC ) maintains two lists : all anon_vma structures relevant to a given vma ( same_vma ) , and all VMAs which fall within the area covered by a given anon_vma structure ( same_anon_vma ) .
It gets complicated , so some diagrams might help .
Initially , we have a single process with one anonymous VMA :
Here , " AV " is the anon_vma structure , and " AVC " is the anon_vma_chain structure seen above .
The AVC links to both the anon_vma and VMA structures through direct pointers .
The ( blue ) linked list pointer is the same_anon_vma list , while the ( red ) pointer is the same_vma list .
So far , so simple .
Imagine now that this process forks , causing the VMA to be copied in the child ; initially we have a lonely new VMA like this :
The kernel needs to link this VMA to the parent 's anon_vma structure ; that requires the addition of a new anon_vma_chain :
Note that the new AVC has been added to the blue list of all VMAs referencing a given anon_vma structure .
The new VMA also needs its own anon_vma , though :
Now there 's yet another anon_vma_chain structure linking in the new anon_vma .
The new red list has been expanded to contain all of the AVCs which reference relevant anon_vma structures .
As your editor said , it gets complicated ; the diagram for the 1000 - child scenario which motivated this patch will be left as an exercise for the reader .
When the fork ( ) happens , all of the anonymous pages in the area point back to the parent 's anon_vma structure .
Whenever the child writes to a page and causes a copy - on - write , though , the new page will map back to the child 's anon_vma structure instead .
Now , reverse - mapping that page can be done immediately , with no need to scan through any other processes in the hierarchy .
That makes the lock contention go away , making benchmarkers happy .
The only problem is that embarrassing oops issue .
Linus , Rik , Borislav , and others chased after it , trying no end of changes .
For a while , it seemed that a bug causing excessive reuse of anon_vma structures when VMAs were merged could be the problem , but fixing the bug did not fix this oops .
Sometimes , changing VMA boundaries with mprotect ( ) could cause the wrong anon_vma to be used , but fixing that one did n't help either .
The reordering of chains when they were copied was also noted as a problem ... but it was n't the problem .
Linus was clearly beginning to wonder when it might all end : " Three independent bugs found and fixed , and still no joy ? "
He repeatedly considered just reverting the change outright , but he was reluctant to do so ; the solution seemed so tantalizingly close .
Eventually he developed another hypothesis which seemed plausible .
An anonymous page shared between parent and child would initially point to the parent 's anon_vma :
But , if both processes were to unmap the page ( as could happen during system hibernation , for example ) , then the child referenced it first , it could end up pointing to the child 's anon_vma instead :
If the parent mapped the page later , then the child unmapped it ( by exiting , perhaps ) , the parent would be left with an anonymous page pointing to the child 's anon_vma - which no longer exists :
Needless to say , that is a situation which is unlikely to lead to anything good in the near future .
FLINT , Michigan —
The owner of the All - American Hockey League 's Evansville Icemen is part of a potential ownership group for the Flint Generals , and he was on hand Wednesday night for Game 3 of the Turner Cup Finals at Perani Arena .
Ron Geary , the Icemen 's owner , said his group is indeed exploring the possibility of taking over the financially strapped Generals , who are playing two - time defending champion Fort Wayne in the International Hockey League playoff finals .
Geary 's group includes former Detroit Red Wings coach Dave Lewis , who was also in attendance at Game 3 .
“ We thought we would come up and look at it , ” Geary said during the first intermission of Game 3 .
“ We 've visited all of the teams in the league .
It 's certainly a good arena .
There 's a lot of tradition in Flint .
“ We 're very pleased with how the team has been playing .
We visited Bloomington and Port Huron about a month ago and they played Flint both times . ”
Geary , who lives in Lexington , Ky. , also owns Ellis Park Raceway , a thoroughbred track located across the river from Evansville in Henderson , Ky .
He is also the majority owner of the Icemen , who beat the West Michigan Blizzard to win the AAHL championship last month .
His group also has tentative plans to put an IHL team in Evansville in 2011 - 12 , providing a new arena opens on time in the fall of 2011 .
The Icemen currently play out Swonder Ice Arena , which only seats 1,100 .
But he decided to take a look at Flint when he heard the Generals were looking for new ownership because they 've been plagued by financial problems all season ..
The players had to buy their own equipment at one point , players living in apartments received eviction notices when the team did n't pay their rent , players in houses did n't receive mortgage payments on time and paychecks were late for several staff members .
Those debts have since been cleared up .
Brandon Bordeaux , the Generals ' owner , has said he is interested in retaining a small piece of the Generals next season but has no interest in being the majority owner .
“ We just want to kind of look at it , ” Geary said .
“ We heard there were some potential issues with the current ownership .
We 're just doing our due diligence and learning more about the building .
“ I 've seen all the arenas pretty much and I like the seating ( at Perani Arena ) .
There 's not a bad seat .
The layout is the best I 've seen . ”
An ownership group that includes Lapeer businessman Bob Bryant announced last week that it will put a North American Hockey League junior team in Perani Arena next season .
That team will be known as the Michigan Warriors .
The IHL claims it has first right of refusal on Perani Arena and intends to bring the Generals back for the 41st season in Flint pro hockey history .
Arena manager Jim Cain has said he does n't see how Flint could support two hockey teams but he did n't rule out the possibility of the building housing franchises in different leagues .
The Globeâs Brian Bender and Matt Viser broke the story at 10:30 Tuesday morning on the Boston.com Political Intelligence blog .
They chose to emphasize the âno.â 
Thatâs an artful hedge by the senator , and it presented a challenge for a reporter covering his statement : whether to emphasize the ânoâ or emphasize the âmaybe later.â 
U.S. Sen . Scott Brown announced yesterday he will vote ânoâ on repealing the militaryâs â Donât Ask Donât Tellâ policy if it comes up in the Senate tomorrow but heâs âkeeping an open mindâ  and may vote to repeal at some point in the future .
The Associated Press , at 1 oâ clock Tuesday afternoon , chose to emphasize âmaybe later.â 
Sen .
Scott Brown says he canât at the moment support a repeal of the militaryâs âdonât ask , donât tellâ policy that bans gays from serving openly in the military .
The Wednesday morning Boston Herald led with the âno.â 
In a decision that puts him at odds with much of the Bay State congressional delegation , U.S. Sen .
Scott Brown said heâd oppose the repeal of a policy that forbids gays from serving openly in the military .
The Attleboro Sun-Chronicle reported Wednesday morning Brown is âurging cautionâ on repealing â Donât Ask Donât Tellâ and , in the storyâs second paragraph , put the emphasis on âmaybe later.â 
While congressional Democrats and the Obama administration move toward repealing the ban on gays serving openly in the military , U.S. Sen .
Scott Brown is urging caution .
Brown , R - Mass. , an officer in the National Guard , said the proposal should wait for the results of a study the Defense Department is conducting .
Actually , the proposed amendment â see section ( b ) â would not become law until the Defense Department study is completed and submitted to the president , the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Here is what the statement Brown released yesterday said , as reported in the Political Intelligence blog postâs fifth paragraph :
I am keeping an open mind , but I do not support moving ahead until I am able to finish my review , the Pentagon completes its study , and we can be assured that a new policy can be implemented without jeopardizing the mission of our military .
To me , thatâs a clear âno , â and thatâs what should be emphasized .
The news here is that there may be a Senate vote on repealing â Donât Ask Donât Tellâ tomorrow , and if there is , Brown is against it .
That the senator is keeping an âopen mindâ  and â we are to understand from his statement â may vote in favor of repeal six months from now is certainly part of the news , of course .
But to put the emphasis on Brownâs hedge is to play up his dodge and play down todayâs news .

Internet Archive today launched a new service that will provide more than a million books in a specially designed format that can be read by visually impaired readers .
The new service is part of the the non-profit ’s Open Library project , which has been scanning and digitizing hundreds of thousands of books for the past several years and now has more than a million in its index .
Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle , who funds some of the Archive ’s costs through his charitable foundation , said the new service more than doubles the number of books previously available to visually impaired readers .
“ Every person deserves the opportunity to enhance their lives through access to the books that teach , entertain and inspire , ” Kahle said in a statement .
“ Bringing access to huge libraries of books to the blind and print disabled is truly one of benefits of the digital revolution . ”
The Archive founder — who also founded Alexa.com and later sold it to Amazon ( s amzn ) — said the project is also asking individuals to donate books to add to the digital library , the first 10,000 of which the project will fund the digitization of ( the rest will be financed by donations from foundations , companies and government ) .
The books being offered as part of the project are scanned by Archive volunteers and employees in 20 locations across the U.S. ( and in several other countries ) , including San Francisco , Los Angeles , New York and the Library of Congress .
The books are then digitized using a special format called DAISY , which can be used by the visually impaired or downloaded to devices that read the text aloud .
Some books have come from other digitization projects , while scanned books come from the collections of more than 150 libraries that belong to the Open Content Alliance , which is also affiliated with the Internet Archive .
The Open Library , which was originally launched in 2007 and whose motto is “ A web page for every book , ” just got a new design and features , including improved search .
Google also has a book - scanning and digitization project called Google Books , which the company claims has more than 10 million books in digital format .
Kahle has been building the Internet Archive and the Open Library since the late 1990s , with a vision of providing millions of digital books for free .
A video of his talk at the TED conference in 2007 is embedded below .

The accident in the Gulf of Mexico is a disruptive event .
Here 's an essay that puts it into personal perspective for me .
In the comments I invite others to do the same .
We tend to settle into routines .
But once in a while extraordinary events disrupt normalcy .
We may question assumptions and be open to new information and change .
A grief process is common in these times too .
The Peace of Wild Things by Wendell Berry
When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound
in fear of what my life and my children ’s lives may be ,
I go and lie down where the wood drake
rests in his beauty on the water , and the great heron feeds .
I come into the peace of wild things
who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief .
I come into the presence of still water .
And I feel above me the day - blind stars
waiting with their light .
For a time
I rest in the grace of the world , and am free .
I have some good friends in Louisiana .
They took their children to the beach last weekend over concern that this may be the last time they would find clean sand in their lifetimes .
For the adults , watching shore birds and dolphins was both thrilling and sickening .
Humans can imagine a future that does not yet exist .
This can be a blessing and a curse .
It is a curse when events spin out of your control and you fear the loss of something precious .
It is a blessing when you can plan ahead and change the future by your actions .
Yesterday I walked on our farm and envisioned what it might look like 1 , 3 , 5 and 20 years from now .
It was beautiful .
My imagination is assisted by the stunning places there now , such as the big leaf maple and ash forest on the western edge of the north field near the Marys River .
In early May , this forest has an enchanting understory of purple larkspur and cow parsnip -- one of the best displays many experienced people have ever seen .
Sometimes I think about ( or even witness ) the spores of saprophytic fungi that colonize the farm fields and speed the breakdown of organic matter so plants can grow .
When I see mounds from ground rodents near the forest edge I smile because I know they bring mycorrhizal spores into ag soils , which dramatically increases the water efficiency of plants and the uptake of often limiting nutrients like phosphorus .
Knowing the forest is rich in microhabitats and teaming with critters , I am thrilled by a nearby source of pollinators , ground beetles , spiders , bats and predatory wasps that will make their homes in the shelter of those trees and leaf litter and come onto the fields to do their feeding .
It is functional diversity , and we could estimate some monetary value of pollination , decomposition , or predator - prey regulation services , but part of me wonders if the sense of awe we feel in places like this comes from some genetic understanding .
We have a gut reaction that says , " This is right !
This is good ! "
What do I envision for this farm ?
A lot , but one line of thought is that it more of it will look like this forest .
The banks of the river will be protected so species such as chinook salmon , cut throat trout , spring steelhead , Oregon chub and Pacific lamphrey ( all rare and threatened ) have a better chance to thrive .
In developing more riparian forest it is easy to see how this will protect the fish .
But my mind sees deeper connections that extend back to my friends in Louisiana .
You see , my goal is to have this farm weaned from fossil fuel dependency so that we do n't feel the pressure , as a society , to go after oil in far flung places so we can grow our food .
Here 's how it goes ... The forest harbors larkspurs .
Larkspurs feed hummingbirds .
Hummingbirds also eat crop munching insects .
Thus , in the long run , through many , many synergies like this , the farm will become less and less dependent on oil - based inputs like pesticides .
Now is n't that beautiful .
Here are some discussion topics for Campfire .
I am a biologist who can see many , many ways in which our current ways of doing things are unnecessarily dependent upon oil .
I also see how the energy gluttony of fossil fuels allowed us to forget about so many important relationships because we had available both the awesome power make huge mistakes and to compensate for them .
It would be interesting to hear from others along these lines .
What are some of the ways you see to ' get off the sauce ' so to speak that are often unseen by others ?
As I have learned more and more about energy , economy and society I see connections to oil and fossil fuels everywhere , as in this one on " Oil and Larkspur " that were n't obvious before .
What surprising connections have you made from the profound to the mundane ?
The Wendell Berry poem acknowledges grief and explores a means of coping .

For now Greece is n't the world 's top concern , and if the Euro bailout works , then Portugal and Spain have some breathing room .
The world 's next big worry should be California .
Like Greece , it 's afflicted with a mix of financial and social problems that have sent the state on a downward spiral .
And in terms of the state 's core structural flaw , it 's got one HUGE similarity .
The only big question is : Could Washington come together to bail the state out ?
The former prime minister was visiting Adam Smith college in Kirkcaldy
The former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has confirmed he will not be standing down as an MP in an address to college students in his home constituency .
Mr Brown and wife Sarah were making their first public appearance since leaving Downing Street .
He told the students at Adam Smith College in Kirkcaldy , Fife , that he intended to sit on the backbenches .
Mr Brown resigned as both prime minister and Labour Party leader on Tuesday .
He was speaking in the hall where he was returned to serve as constituency MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath with an increased majority after the general election count on 6 May .
' First love '
After joking that he had considered signing up for courses in communication skills , public relations and media management at the college , where he holds the position of chancellor , Mr Brown revealed he would continue to sit as a backbench MP at Westminster .
The former prime minister said : " I also lost a few titles in the last two or three days , so it 's good to be able to continue with the title you gave me a few years ago as chancellor of the college .
" I wanted to be clear , I want to be doing what is my first love in politics and that is to serve the people of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath and all the communities in this area , and to continue to do that with your support over the next few years .
" In case anybody was in any doubt because of the announcements that were made this week , I am wanting to do everything I can to work for people here , for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath , as your Member of Parliament , and I will do that to the best of my ability for these next few months and years . "
His remarks were greeted with applause by about 200 students and staff who had gathered to listen to him .
Football game Mr Brown added : " I was actually thinking of coming in today and applying for the course on communication skills , then I thought I might do public relations , then maybe media management , drama and performance .
" But I 'm actually here to talk about how this college can expand in the future ... and to thank all of you for the support that you 've given me and Sarah ... not just over the last month but over the last many many years , I 'm very very grateful . "
In his five - minute speech he revealed that he had done his " first major interview " with the local Fife Free Press newspaper , and was now holding surgeries as an MP .
Mr Brown said he wanted to help and encourage young people to get involved in community projects and to keep youngsters off the streets .
He highlighted the example of a midnight football game , organised with the help of his favourite team Raith Rovers .
Mr Brown joked : " They have not asked me to sign up for next season unfortunately . "

Miley Cyrus is hoping to establish herself as a serious actor and no longer a teenie bopper .
So , what better way to do so than to play Tank Girl ? reveals a movie insider .
she said last month .
Now , the Lori Petty film version of Tank Girl was not perfect , but it was enjoyable .
Lori physically fit the part spot on !
And how could you not like Naomi Watts as Jet Girl ?!
But to take someone like Miley Cyrus and have her portray this icon ?
No way !
She can't even stand up straight as it is , so how would she be able to do that with a missle - cupped bra ??
And as far as her " acting " goes ... it's as bent out of shape as her posture is .
Sure this is just gossip and wishing on Cyrus ' part , and who the heck is the " movie insider " !?
But it was so laughable , I just had to share !

LABOR will be clobbered by voters at the Penrith byelection , with secret ALP polling obtained by The Sun - Herald indicating Premier Kristina Keneally will preside over the greatest - ever swing against a NSW government .
In an ominous sign for the scandal - plagued state government before an election in March , internal party polling predicts a massive two - party preferred swing of 27 percentage points against the government in Penrith on June 19 .
The slaughter is set to be worse than the previous greatest swing in NSW , when John Watkins 's former seat of Ryde returned to the Liberals last year with a 23 - point two - party - preferred swing .
On a two - party preferred basis , Labor is on track to claim just 32 per cent of the vote , with 68 per cent for the Liberals representing a stunning turnaround from the 2007 election when disgraced former MP Karyn Paluzzano won for Labor with 59 per cent of the vote .
The results of the polling have left ALP strategists reeling and senior government figures clutching for reasons why things cannot get any worse for the ageing Labor administration 10 months out from an election .
Gunman disguised in burka and sunglasses robs cash courier
Cover -up :
The gunman wore a burka to disguise himself while robbing a courier ( file picture )
A gunman dressed in a head - to - toe black burqa and sunglasses robbed a cash courier in a shopping centre car park .
The courier had just withdrawn a large amount of money from a bank yesterday when he spotted two men following him , Australian police said .
He returned to his vehicle which was parked in the car park when one of the men approached him and told him his tyre was going flat .
The man became suspicious and drove from the scene , changing his tyre in a nearby street before driving to a shopping centre .
Whilst he was parking his vehicle in the car park , he was approached by a man wearing a full burka and dark glasses .
The man pointed a pistol at him and demanded he hand over the money .
The victim handed over a bag containing a large amount of cash , and the man then ran off .
The 35 - year - old victim works as a cash courier for jewellery businesses and was working on a job in Sydney at around 3 pm when he was robbed , New South Wales state police said .
The burka is the most concealing of all Islamic veils .
It covers the entire face and body , leaving just a mesh screen to see through .
In Australia , some Muslims wear head scarves , but burkas are almost never worn .
The burka has become something of a controversial garment over recent years , with some suggesting it poses a security risk , as the wearer can not be identified .
Last month , Belgium became the first European country to impose a full ban on wearing a burka .
Its parliament approved a draft law which states women can be jailed for hiding their faces in public .
The bill - which must be rubber - stamped by the Belgian senate - is set to become law by July .
France is poised to follow Belgium , with President Nicolas Sarkozy leading the charge to ban the burka .
He has described the garment as ' contrary to the dignity of women ' .
Since 1975 , a national anti-terrorism law in Italy has forbidden the wearing of any mask or clothing that makes it impossible to identify the person underneath .
However , the law permits exceptions for ' justified cause ' , which has often been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons .
A woman in Italy became the first person in the country to be fined £ 430 for wearing a burka in a public place - the post office - earlier this week .
Speaking of police brutality , we do n't want to give you the impression that shocking , scary , or shocking and scary police behavior is limited to the NYPD .
Far from it !
How else are cops offending our sensibilities today ?
Many ways !
The ACLU is suing the Pennsylvania state police for a longstanding pattern of issuing citations to people just because they said some cuss words .
Which you are allowed to say , here in the motherfucking USA .
Example :
In Pennsylvania alone , the city of Scranton in 2008 agreed to pay a woman $ 19,000 plus legal costs after she was charged for swearing at her overflowing toilet .
The city of Pittsburgh paid $ 50,000 last year to settle a free - speech lawsuit filed by a man cited for an obscene gesture .
In that case , the ACLU found city police had written 188 disorderly conduct citations over a 32 - month period for swearing , gestures and other disrespectful conduct .
Philly police Sgt. Robert Ralston finally admitted yesterday that when he said a " black man with cornrows " shot him last month , what he really meant was " I purposely shot myself in the shoulder . "
Even more , Philly ?
" A Philadelphia police officer was arrested Wednesday on charges of assaulting , threatening , and stalking a female friend . "
This .
The City of Portland has fired its police chief , after " the city agreed to pay $ 1.6 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of a mentally ill man who died in police custody . "
Also , Chicago 's agreed to pay $ 16.5 million to settle a class - action suit over police mistreating suspects .
Annnnnd , a white Houston cop was acquitted this week for shooting an unarmed black man ( the son of a former Major League baseball player , btw ) .
He thought the black man had a gun , huh .
When you have a bad day , the cops make you pay for it .

Mosquitoes can develop an immunity to DEET and breed offspring that are also impervious to the bug repellent , scientists in England report .
Female mosquitoes use their antenna to zero in on humans in their hunt for blood to fertilize their eggs .
DEET is believed to interfere with their ability to smell .
A DEET - resistant mosquito would still be able to detect the savoury human smell it ’s looking for .
“ There is something in the antenna they use to smell that reacted differently , ” Dr. Nina Stanczyk of Rothhamstead Research , the largest agricultural research centre in the U.K. , told the Star on Tuesday .
Scientists studying mosquitoes in a laboratory realized some “ were n’t detecting the smells of DEET . ”
When researchers bred those mosquitoes , the new generation could smell through the DEET as well .
DEET , developed in 1958 , is little understood but highly effective in repelling mosquitoes .
“ There ’s been an awful lot of research on this subject ” of repellents , said Stanczyk .
“ This could give us a greater understanding of how DEET works and how to develop new repellents . ”
Stanczyk cautions that her research is limited to a laboratory , although she ’s keen to extend it to field work .
Outside of a laboratory , the only ideal breeding ground for DEET - resistant mosquitoes would be somewhere that everyone was wearing the repellent , she said .
Researchers also studied only one species of mosquito , the yellow fever and dengue - carrying Aedes aegypti .
Canada , Bermuda , Chile and Uruguay are the four countries in the Americas not infested with A. aegypti .
“ This research is very interesting but we do n’t think it will lead to a worldwide failure of repellents , ” she said .
“ People should keep protecting themselves so they do n’t catch diseases . ”
The findings are published in the May 3 edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Federal officials will unveil today a potentially important effort to investigate and prosecute financial fraud cases , this time in eastern Virginia instead of the most prominent venue , New York City .
The U.S. Attorney 's Office in Richmond will coordinate the Virginia Financial and Securities Fraud Task Force with representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission , Commodity Futures Trading Commission , FBI , U.S. Postal Service and IRS , as well as state law enforcement agencies .
" It will allow us to share information , connect the dots , and pursue criminal as well as civil tracks , " says Neil MacBride , U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia .
That coordination should lead to " more prosecutions and faster prosecutions , " says Robert Khuzami , director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement .
Securities fraud will be the top priority .
" We 're going to be working with the SEC to start bringing some large , national - impact securities fraud cases , " MacBride says .
Although he can't discuss specific investigations , he adds that " there are a number of things in the pipeline . "
The new effort could boost Virginia 's prominence in legal circles as a center for splashy cases similar to the one that the SEC announced last month against Goldman Sachs .
" Part of what 's going on is a public relations effort , " says Jim Cohen , a professor at the Fordham University School of Law .
For example , when the Justice Department decides which of its offices will handle a case , " it 's a very political process , " and Virginia has " a lot of competition from other districts . "
But unlike most , eastern Virginia has the legal right to handle almost any fraud case , because virtually all official reports from publicly traded companies go to the SEC 's EDGAR computer server in Alexandria , Va. , MacBride says .
Prosecutors like the area near Washington , D.C. , because its juries " are traditionally viewed as pro-government , " says David Barger , a former federal prosecutor who chairs the litigation practice at Virginia law firm Greenberg Traurig .
The venue also has what 's known as a " rocket docket , " Barger says .
" Cases go from indictment to trial in 90 to 150 days .
In other jurisdictions , it may take a year or more . "

Update Nov 2015 : In the years since tracking the deployment of Google Fiber , Google has decided to continue to expand to more and more new cities .
You can see their expansion plans on this page : https://fiber.google.com/newcities/.
Additionally , there may be a chance that Municipal fiber may be on it ’s way to your city .
Update Aug 2011 : So as you may have heard Google selected Kansas City , Kansas for the initial deployment of its fiber gigabit service .
For all the other towns vying for fiber , do n’t give up , they may expand to more cities in the future depending on how the first deployment goes .
In the meantime , if you ’re lucky enough to be in area where Fios ( from Verizon ) is available , http://www.defefx.com/fios-deals/
shows how you can save the most on Verizon ’s fiber service .
The graph below depicts the top 15 cities measured by community support levels .
The community support levels are calculated by taking the single social networking source with the largest following and dividing by the population of the city .
Social networking sources include Facebook Pages ( the fan count ) , Facebook Groups ( the member count ) , and Twitter followers .
This graph will change automatically as new data is accumulated .
Recent Surges
The next graph show which cities have posted the largest increase in supporters over the past week .
The supporter counts are a sum of the three social networking sources : Facebook Page fans +
Facebook Group members +
Twitter followers .
Leaders by Sheer Numbers
While the Overall Leaders graph uses population to make the comparison more fair , it ’s still fun to see which cities have the largest actual number of supporters , which is exactly what the next graph shows .
Social Networking as a Benchmark
In essence , the Google Fiber Optic race can be viewed in many ways .
The way we have chosen to look at the race , at least initially , is by using popular social networking sites as metrics for the actual interest level in Google ’s fiber optic broadband service and data gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau for population statistics .
The reason that social networking sites were used to gather honest information regarding community interest in Google ’s fiber optic campaigns is fairly simple .
One reason has to do with the alternative , which is online voting or polling .
Well , that method can and has been easily manipulated in the past .
There are numerous examples of people writing scripts or manually influencing such metrics .
That is not to say that it is impossible to fool social networking sites , but the process is a little bit more difficult .
Additionally , Google themselves have been monitoring the social networking scene , which tends to make it not only more relevant than a proprietary setup , but it also acts as a sort of data - police .
Google already has advanced social networking / benchmarking algorithms designed to foil attempts to manipulate social networking data .
Even though the users of social network sites may not represent a large demographic of the population , we feel it is exactly the demographic that Google is interested in gauging .
These users represent the first adopters of technologies like fiber - to - the - home .
These are the users that would actually make use of a Google gigabit connection , and will foster the progression of next - generation web applications , which is exactly what Google has set out to do .
Population Data
When it comes to population , the U.S. Census Bureau is the definitive source , and that is where all of our population statistics come from .
While some of the data is a few years old , there really seems to be no fairer metric than this .
Hopefully everyone will be filling out their new U.S. Census Bureau registration cards in the immediate future .
A few acknowledgments are in order , however , before continuing further .
The first is that cities with smaller populations are probably more prone to percentage based fluctuations than cities with larger populations .
This is a given , but it is something that we have not found a great way of solving .
The simple fact is that a town of 1000 could increase or decrease population based on the activity of employers or just particularly amorous couples much more so than a town with 100,000 residents .
The other issue is that some cities have updated their U.S. Census Bureau data more recently than others .
In all cases , we used the most recent data possible .
Why did some cities update more recently than others ?
That is a good question , and one we hope to answer in the future , but ultimately these two problems should not make any large difference to our reporting for a few reasons .
The first reason is that only cities with a certain number of fans / followers / members are being tracked .
This means that incredibly small towns might be left out of the equation , but that is nothing new or noteworthy ; Google is looking to serve a minimum of 50,000 people .
Sorry towns of 1,000 , but Google will not be picking you exclusively , though there is a lot of hope that you will be served by Google picking a larger region and servicing your needs as part of that choice .
For our metrics , we decided to focus more on the idea that Google would be picking larger towns and this naturally means that we had to make a cutoff in terms of population as well as a cutoff in terms of fans / followers / members .
Secondly , getting back to the population vs. growth issue , these larger towns are ( as previously mentioned ) less prone to radical changes in population .
In short , we think the Census Bureau data is reliable for our purposes .
Measure of Intent
Many people might wonder why population information was considered at all .
The reason is fairly simple : desire .
How bad an individual wants something can be figuratively measured by the fibers of their being , and a macro version of this is substantially more literal ; how many people within a community want something bad enough to go through the minimal effort of signing into a social networking service and becoming a fan or member ?
It does not seem difficult , but it certainly shows intent .
This intent divided by the number of people in a community should be a reasonable way to gauge the desire of that community as a whole for Google ’s gigabit fiber optic service .
New Cities with Fiber Offerings
Since we initially started Google Fiber ’s expansion hundreds of small municipal broadband networks have popped up .
While Google has stated that it is slowing down it ’s rollout , the attention Google brought to the need for fastest broadband did n’t go unnoticed .
Today many small cities also have regional for profit providers that have risen up to meet consumer demand .
A good example of these providers is MetroNet which serves parts of Illinois and Indiana .
They offer gigabit speeds for less than $ 100 / mo .
They ’re also regularly listed in the top 100 fastest internet providers in the US .
Are there any regional providers that are making waves in your area ?
If so , leave them in the comments and we ’ll include them in this resource .
In the case of mother versus fetus , picking the mother to live will get you excommunicated in Arizona .
It should be so simple .
A woman pregnant with an 11 week old fetus enters a hospital , where a team of medical experts decide that continuing the pregnancy is likely to kill her .
The medical team performs an abortion , and the woman lives .
For approving that action , a long - time nun has now been excommunicated , according to the Arizona Republic .
A Catholic nun and longtime administrator of St. Joseph ’s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix was reassigned in the wake of a decision to allow a pregnancy to be ended in order to save the life of a critically ill patient .
The decision also drew a sharp rebuke from Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted , head of the Phoenix Diocese , who indicated the woman was “ automatically excommunicated ” because of the action .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

The Bishop sees no issue with the fact that any other option would have killed both mother and child , and stands by his ruling , the Washington Post reports .
Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted , head of the Phoenix Diocese , indicated in a statement that the Roman Catholic involved was “ automatically excommunicated ” because of the action .
The Catholic Church allows the termination of a pregnancy only as a secondary effect of other treatments , such as radiation of a cancerous uterus .
“ I am gravely concerned by the fact that an abortion was performed several months ago in a Catholic hospital in this diocese , ” Olmsted said in a statement sent to The Arizona Republic .
“ I am further concerned by the hospital ’s statement that the termination of a human life was necessary to treat the mother ’s underlying medical condition .
“ An unborn child is not a disease .
While medical professionals should certainly try to save a pregnant mother ’s life , the means by which they do it can never be by directly killing her unborn child .
The end does not justify the means . ”
Olmsted added that if a Catholic “ formally cooperates ” in an abortion , he or she is automatically excommunicated .
Yet not everyone in the church thinks the situation is so cut and dry .
Some church leaders , such as Father Tim , actually see value in NOT killing women .
Although I cannot disagree with the bishop ’s theology and support the Church ’s protection of the sacredness of all life , I suspect he needs “ medical ” treatment himself : a strong injection of reality .
Most important is a simple reality :
If the mother of an 11 - week - old fetus dies , the fetus will also die .
It is too soon in life for the child to survive outside the womb no matter what the hospital might try .
That means two deaths .
Is there really a morally defensible reason for two innocents to die when one can live ?
It ’s a hackneyed phrase , but what would Jesus have done ? …
It is long past the time to reconsider this .
If all life deserves our protection and is sacred to our Creator , then a mother ’s life is just as worthy as her child’s .
How has this become lost in the battle over abortion ?
Some people , in fact , are wondering if it is ever safe to allow a woman to seek medical help in Catholic hospitals , knowing that their own health and well - being will be put behind religious dogma .
From Huffington Post :
[ I ] f my life were at stake , or that of a woman I loved , I would not want to risk the chance that a woman less enlightened or flexible than Sister McBride was the ethicist ruling on my case in a medical emergency .
So let me make this clear :
At the present moment , as a physician , I would not feel comfortable with a woman I cared about seeking obstetric services at a Catholic hospital .
In fact , I would not want a pregnant woman I cared about obtaining any medical treatment at a Catholic hospital .
From this point forward , I will tell my pregnant patients , in all but the most emergent and high - risk circumstances , to instruct any ambulance that picks them up to avoid Catholic hospitals .
That is tragic , because these institutions have a long and noble history of providing care to this nation ’s needy and most desperate .
Alas , thanks to men like Mr. Olmsted , obtaining obstetric care at a Catholic hospital has become a dangerous game of Russian roulette .
Seem like an overreaction ?
Not really , once you read some of the comments on the Fox News version of the story .
And of course , one person claims , “
Not the doctors , not the patient , not the hospital staff .
It ’s the Bishop who obviously knows best and should be trusted .
Mini Roundup : Speaking of “ Bishops know best , ” a Canadian Arch Bishop says women should never be allowed abortions after a rape because “ There is already one victim , must there be another one ? ”
Political leaders tell him to stop trying to roll back 40 years of women ’s rights .

Less than an hour ago , Gizmodo posted a handy guide to forcing anyone on Twitter to follow you .
The method was very simple , and reportedly it worked on high profile accounts like Coco ’s and Oprah’s .
These were the five crucial steps :
1 . Open the Twitter web interface ( I have n’t been able to get it to work in the apps I ’ve tried )
2 . Tweet “ accept username ” , as in “ accept oprah ”
3 . Wait a few seconds .
You may get a server error , but that means it ’s worked .
4 . Check your followers list
5. !!!
Commenters reported that the hack worked , and that their accounts were currently being followed by big name tweeters .
Further confirmation came from Jim Carrey :
To those who r thrilled about being able to make me follow them , congratulations , you get the Golden YAWN award , 4 valuable time wasted .

It was fun for about five minutes , but it seems that this tiny security flaw ( minor compared to Facebook letting everyone eavesdrop on your private chats ) has caused a follower lockdown resulting in no one following anyone .
If you look at your Twitter account right now , no one is following you and you are following no one .
And while you still have a timeline of follower tweets , you ’re still all zeroed out .
We all have zero followers !
Update : Twitter just addressed the issue on their status blog :
We identified and resolved a bug that permitted a user to “ force ” other users to follow them .
We ’re now working to rollback all abuse of the bug that took place .
Follower / following numbers are currently at 0 ; we ’re aware and this too should shortly be resolved .
Update Two :
Some tech blogs are reporting that the bug only affects those who tried to exploit it .
Not true , everyone ’s following / follower count has been zeroed out .
The collection of symptoms that is the metabolic syndrome -- insulin resistance , high cholesterol , fatty liver , and a greater risk for diabetes , heart disease , and stroke -- are all related to obesity , but , according to a review in the March 9th issue of Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism , not in the way you probably think they are .
In fact , says Roger Unger of the University of Texas Southwestern at Dallas , obesity is the body 's way of storing lipids where they belong , in fat tissue , in an effort to protect our other organs from lipids ' toxic effects .
It 's when the surplus of calories coming in gets to be too much for our fat tissue to handle that those lipids wind up in other places they should n't be , and the cascade of symptoms known as metabolic syndrome sets in .
It comes down to simple facts that all of us know on some level or another : Americans since the 1950s eat too much high - calorie food loaded with carbs and fat ( what Unger calls " potent adipogenic nutrient mixtures " ) and , thanks to modern technology , we move far too little .
Until that changes , Unger does n't see any end to the growing epidemic of metabolic syndrome .
Still , our metabolisms are n't broken ; the pathways that squirrel fat away as an energy source for use in lean times are just completely overwhelmed .
" We are pushing our homeostatic capability to the maximum , " says Unger , who coined the term " lipotoxicity " in 1994 .
" Overnutrition used to be rare -- reserved for those in the castle .
Today , it 's just the opposite .
Bad calories are so cheap that anyone can afford to get overweight . "
Unger cites plenty of evidence in support of a protective role for obesity .
Genetic manipulations in mice that increase or decrease fat formation have provided evidence that adipogenesis , meaning the generation of fat cells , delays other metabolic consequences of overeating .
The reverse is also true , he writes .
Obesity - resistant mice have in some cases been found to develop severe diabetes upon eating too much , as a result of lipid accumulation in tissues other than fat .
There is some disagreement in the field about whether insulin resistance is a primary cause of metabolic syndrome or just one of its features , Unger notes .
But on this , too , he has a clear view .
Insulin resistance is not the cause of metabolic syndrome , he says , it is a " passive byproduct " of fat deposition in the liver and muscle once storage in fat cells begins to fail .
It also makes sense in Unger 's estimation that cells that have already taken on too much fat would begin to exclude glucose , causing its levels in blood and urine to rise .
Once in cells , glucose becomes a substrate for the production of more fat .
" The body is doing what we should have done -- keep excess calories out -- and it may be protective , " Unger says .
At the center of the transition from protective obesity to metabolic syndrome is resistance to the fat hormone leptin , well known for its appetite - suppressing effects , Unger says .
The hormone is also responsible for partitioning fat in the body .
The rise of leptin as fat stores grow is therefore an adaptive response , but that can only go so far before resistance sets in .
Based on the genes they carry , some people will be better able to sustain lipid storage in fat and can get away with being overweight , even obese , without the other symptoms .
Eventually , though , the need to cut calories is something all of us will face .
" Once you reach a certain age , almost everybody is leptin resistant , " he says .
" Nature stops protecting you once you pass the reproductive years , " requiring all of us to watch our diets and do exercise .
Unger 's perspective comes from the research he does at UT Southwestern 's Touchstone Center for Diabetes Research and a thorough understanding of the scientific literature , but it also stems from his own memories in childhood when one only saw fat ladies at the circus .
" That 's how unusual it was , " he says .
" The younger you are , the more skewed your perception is of an epidemic that surrounds you . "
Unger concludes his review article this way : " Based on evidence reviewed here , it seems that prevalent forms of metabolic syndrome and T2DM [ type 2 diabetes mellitus ] result from unremitting caloric surplus complicated by failure of adipocytes to maintain protection against lipotoxicity .
If one imagines the USA population to be unwitting volunteers in the largest ( 300 million subjects ) and longest ( 50 years ) clinical research project in history , the specific aim of which was to determine if the deleterious effects of sustained caloric surplus in rodents also can occur in humans , the outcome of the project becomes clear -- after 50 years of exposure to an inexpensive calorie - dense diet high in fat and carbohydrates , 200 million subjects are overweight and > 50 million have metabolic syndrome .
The failure of healthcare providers and pharmaceutical industries to contain the pandemic suggests that elimination of ' bargain basement ' calories will be required to ' price obesity out of the market . '
Unfortunately , this would have profound socioeconomic implications :
How do we tax excessive calories while at the same time guaranteeing sufficient access to high - quality foods for the underprivileged ? "

the quality of this film is not the best but as a piece of industrial history it is still quite valid .
I like many had little idea of the shear amount of heavy manual labour that went into making each link .
watching the men make the anchor is quite something too , how they strike the hot metal without getting in each others way is breathtaking - literally !
Rumors are heavy that Microsoft is in talks to have a channel on Xbox Live .
A real channel .
It would host reruns of beloved sitcoms , shows , and even some original programs .
Rumors even suggest at one point they were lobbying to get Conan to join before he chose to roll out with TBS .
Sounds good ?
Well , to much of a good thing can be slightly bad in this case .
The channel would need to be paid for so it would add a few extra dollars to the already hated Xbox Live subscription .
So here is my question to you .
Would you be willing to add a few bucks onto your subscription for a TV channel ?

Insane camera angle by Tim Humphreys , while boarding at Mammoth Park .
Nona Belomesoff was allegedly lured by the promise of working with animals Thousands of people have paid tribute on Facebook to an Australian teenager allegedly lured to her death by a man she met on the social networking site .
The body of Nona Belomesoff was found two days after she went on a trip with the man , who told her they were going to rescue injured animals , police say .
A 20 - year - old man has been charged with Ms Belomesoff 's murder at a creek south of Sydney .
Detectives say the case reinforces the need for vigilance when using Facebook .
Ms Belomesoff , 18 , is believed to have befriended Christopher James Dannevig , who police say set up a fake Facebook profile in which he claimed to work for an animal welfare group .
Mr Dannevig is said to have offered Ms Belomesoff the prospect of a job with the organisation and lured her on a camping trip purportedly to look for injured animals in bushland around Campbelltown , New South Wales .
" She loved animals and saw this as an opportunity to follow her dream , " her brother Gary said .
" Nona said if she did n't go she would lose her job and this job was her dream , " he said .
" So she just went and that was the last time we saw her . "
When Ms Belomesoff did not return , her family contacted the police .
Officers discovered the teenager 's body on Friday night .
Since then several pages and groups paying tribute to Ms Belomesoff have been set up on Facebook .
Among the thousands of postings , friends have expressed their shock and grief at the killing .
" Sorry you never got to live your dreams bub , you were the most beautiful girl ever and you made your parents so proud , " wrote Sellie Gibbons .
Another , Joline Sam , wrote " RIP Nona , it haunts me to know that someone did this to you and i remember catching the bus with you every afternoon from school . "
Detective Russell Oxford , who is leading the investigation , said the case was a reminder to young people about the dangers of trusting strangers on social networking sites .
" It 's an area where predators and perverts and other people just get onto .
You just do n't know who you could be talking to , " he said .

17 memristors captured by an atomic force microscope
The fundamental building blocks of all computing devices could be about to undergo a dramatic change that would allow faster , more efficient machines .
Researchers at computer firm Hewlett Packard ( HP ) have shown off working devices built using memristors - often described as electronics ' missing link .
These tiny devices were proposed 40 years ago but only fabricated in 2008 .
HP says it has now shown that they can be used to crunch data , meaning they could be used to build advanced chips .
That means they could begin to replace transistors - the tiny switches used to build today 's chips .
And , crucially , the unique properties of memristors would allow future chips to both store and process data in the same device .
Today , these functions are done on separate devices , meaning data must be transferred between the two , slowing down the computation and wasting energy .
" The processor and memory could be exactly the same thing , " Dr Stan Williams of HP told BBC News .
" That allows us to think differently about how computation could be done . "
Professor Leon Chua - the first person to propose memristors - said the work was " conceptually , just the tip of the iceberg " .
He compared the devices to the human brain 's synapses and axons .
" In the near future we can use memristors to make real brain - like computers , he told BBC News .
Researchers at the University of Michigan recently showed that the devices can mimic synaptic activity in the brain .
The HP work is published in the journal Nature .
Tower chips Despite being proposed by Professor Chua in 1971 , it took almost forty years for a working memristor to be built , by Dr Williams and his team .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The tiny devices are the " fourth " basic building block of circuits , after capacitors , resistors and inductors .
" I 'm delighted because I never thought this would happen in my lifetime , " said Professor Chua .
The devices get their name from their ability to " remember " the amount of charge that has flowed through them after the power has been switched off .
This means they are suited for building computer memory and storage ; an application that Dr Williams believes could be on the market within three years .
" Our immediate goal is to make a competitor to flash memory for cameras , iPods and devices like that , " said Dr Williams .
" Our aspiration is for it to have twice as much available memory as an equivalent sized flash memory device . "
The team has also shown that the memristors can be stacked on top of each other to form 3 - D arrays .
" In theory we can connect thousands of layers in a very straightforward fashion , " said Dr Williams .
" It could provide a way of getting a ridiculous amount of memory on a chip . "
Future path Further into the future , Dr Williams said that he hoped that they could be used to build a single device for storage and computation .
" That would allow a huge speed saving and energy saving , " he said .
Getting more from Moore 's Law Electronics ' ' missing link ' found However , he said , that kind of device was more than a decade away .
Memristors could also help with a problem that continues to challenge the chip industry , continuing to pack more and more computational power into smaller and smaller spaces .
Currently , chip makers follow a path defined by Moore 's Law , which states that the number of transistors it is possible to squeeze in to a chip for a fixed cost doubles every two years .
This is currently achieved by producing transistors with ever smaller feature sizes .
Current cutting edge chips have transistors with feature sizes as small as 22 nanometres ( 22 billionths of a metre ) .
But this miniaturisation cannot continue forever , experts say .
Memristors offer an alternative path .
" We can continue to make them smaller even past the point where people think that transistors cannot shrink any further , " said Dr Williams .
Crucially , said Dr Williams , they can be built using " materials commonly available in any fab [ chip fabrication plant ] " .
Professor James
Tour of Rice University in Houston said the memristor 's ability to be compatible with existing transistor based technologies was a " critical parameter to permit rapid implementation into present chip manufacturing processes " .
Dr Williams said he had already made " crude " prototypes with features as small as 3nm .
" The functional equivalent of Moore 's Law could go on for decades after we hit the wall where we can no longer shrink transistors , " he said .

Scientists at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center have identified a key molecular mechanism in breast cancer that enables tumor cells to spread to adjacent or distant parts of the body in a process called metastasis .
This finding opens the way to new lines of research aimed at developing treatments for metastatic breast cancer .
The research , led by Peter Zhou , associate professor of molecular and cellular biochemistry at UK , focused on the process by which tumor cells stop clinging to other cells and become motile , or able to spread throughout the body .
The findings were published in an article in the EMBO Journal , the flagship publication of the European Molecular Biology Organization .
The increased motility of tumor cells at the initial step of metastasis is similar to a process called epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which is required for large - scale cell movement in embryonic development , tissue remodeling and wound healing .
For example , during wound healing , cells at the edge of the wound undergo a EMT process and migrate to the middle for sealing the wound .
In all EMT processes , cells lose the expression of a cell - to - cell adhesion molecule called E - cadherin , which functions as a " molecular glue " that attaches cells to one another .
Breast cancer cells usurp this process for invasion and metastasis .
When this molecular glue is broken down , tumor cells start to migrate and spread throughout the body .
A protein called Snail acts as a master switch in the cell 's nucleus to suppress E - cadherin expression and induce EMT in the cell .
Previous research has shown
Snail to be elevated in many types of cancer , particularly breast cancer .
High levels of Snail have been linked to metastasis , tumor cell survival and tumor recurrence , and thus predict a poor clinical outcome for women with breast cancer .
However , scientists are still not clear how Snail triggers the down - regulation of E - cadherin and induces metastasis in breast cancer .
Using a protein purification approach , Zhou and his colleagues found that Snail interacts and teams up with its " partner in crime , " an enzyme called LSD1 , inside the cell .
LSD1 is known to change the structure of DNA and shut down the expression of many genes .
LSD1 , which stands for lysine - specific demethylase - 1 ( and is chemically unrelated to the hallucinogen LSD ) , regulates the structure of the chromosome by removing a key methylation at histone H3 , a core component that warps the DNA into compact conformation .
This event triggers the " closure " of DNA structure and shuts down gene expression , such as E - cadherin .
Zhou 's team showed that the N - terminal portion of Snail molecular functions as a " molecular hook " for recruiting LSD1 to the E - cadherin gene , which , in turn , shuts down the expression of E - cadherin and induces tumor cell invasion and metastasis .
" This finding has significant clinical ramification , because chemical compounds or agents that can disrupt the interaction of Snail with LSD1 will have a great therapeutic potential of treating metastatic breast cancer , " Zhou said .
" Scientists at the Markey Cancer Center are currently exploring this idea and are keen to develop drugs that can treat metastatic cancer . "
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women .
Approximately 90 percent of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis of tumor cells , and the average survival after documentation of metastasis is approximately two years .
" An understanding of the mechanism underlying the biology of breast cancer metastasis will provide novel therapeutic approaches to combat this life - threatening disease , " Zhou said .

Functional programming emphasizes “ pure ” functions , functions that have no side effects .
When you call a pure function , all you need to know is the return value of the function .
You can be confident that calling a function does n’t leave any state changes that will effect future function calls .
But pure functions are only pure at a certain level of abstraction .
Every function has some side effect : it uses memory , it takes CPU time , etc. Harald Armin Massa makes this point in his PyCon 2010 talk “ The real harm of functional programming . ”
( His talk is about eight minutes into the February 21 , 2010 afternoon lightning talks : video . )
Even pure functions in programming have side effects .
They use memory .
They use CPU .
They take runtime .
And if you look at those evil languages , they are quite fast at doing Fibonacci or something , but in bigger applications you get reports “ Hmm , I have some runtime problems .
I do n’t know how to get it faster or what it going wrong .
Massa argues that the concept of an action without side effects is dangerous because it disassociates us from the real world .
I disagree .
I appreciate his warning that the “ no side effect ” abstraction may leak like any other abstraction .
But pure functions are a useful abstraction .
You ca n’t avoid state , but you can partition the stateful and stateless parts of your code .
100 % functional purity is impossible , but 85 % functional purity may be very productive .

Satellite image of Western Greenland .
Narrow grey band in center is melting ice , between the rocky coast to the left ( west ) and thicker , non-melting , higher altitude ice to the right ( east ) .
Small lakes form in this region during the summer .
Arrow points to darker grey zone of rapidly thinning ice near the outlet of Jacobshavn glacier , which also loses mass due to iceberg calving .
The ice is melting so fast in Greenland that the giant island is rising noticeably as the weight is lifted .
In some spots , the land is rising 1 inch per year .
A vast ice cap covers much of Greenland , in some places up to 1.2 miles ( 2 km ) thick .
The ice , in place for eons , presses down the land , making the elevation at any given point lower than it would be sans ice .
Scientists have documented on Greenland and elsewhere that when longstanding ice melts away , the land rebounds .
Even the European Alps are rising as glaciers melt .
Now , scientists at the University of Miami say Greenland 's ice is melting so quickly that the land underneath is rising at an accelerated pace .
Some coastal areas are going up by nearly 1 inch per year , the scientists announced today .
If current trends continue , that could accelerate to as much as 2 inches per year by 2025 , said Tim Dixon , professor of geophysics at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science ( RSMAS ) and principal investigator of the study .
" It 's been known for several years that climate change is contributing to the melting of Greenland 's ice sheet , " Dixon said in a statement .
" What 's surprising , and a bit worrisome , is that the ice is melting so fast that we can actually see the land uplift in response . "
Dixon added : " Even more surprising , the rise seems to be accelerating , implying that melting is accelerating . "
The results , based on a study of data from global positioning system ( GPS ) receivers stationed on the rocky shores of Greenland , were published online by the journal Nature Geoscience .
The data stretches back to 1995 .
" During ice ages and in times of ice accumulation , the ice suppresses the land , " explained Shimon Wdowinski , research associate professor in the University of Miami RSMAS , and co-author of the study .
" When the ice melts , the land rebounds upwards , " Wdowinski said .
" Our study is consistent with a number of global warming indicators , confirming that ice melt and sea - level rise are real and becoming significant . "
The measurements are restricted to places where rock is exposed , limiting the study to coastal areas .
However , previous data indicate that ice in Greenland 's interior is in approximate balance :
Yearly losses from ice melting and flowing toward the coast are balanced by new snow accumulation , which gradually turns to ice .
Most ice loss occurs at the warmer coast , through melting and iceberg calving and where the GPS data are most sensitive to changes .
In western Greenland , the uplift seems to have started in the late 1990's .
Melting of Greenland 's ice contributes to global sea - level rise .
If the acceleration of uplift and the implied acceleration of melting continue , Greenland could soon become the largest contributor to global sea- level rise , said Yan Jiang of the University of Miami RSMAS and another co-author of the study .
" Greenland 's ice melt is very important because it has a big impact on global sea - level rise , " Jiang said .
" We hope that our work reaches the general public and that this information is considered by policy makers . "

It 's all about speed , as you might 've heard .
It 's hard to accurately gauge that for a couple of reasons — we've been using a pre-release build of Froyo , so things will probably get better before the final , and we did n't install any apps , at the behest of Adobe , since we were testing Flash 10.1 on this unit — but Google promises 2 x - 5 x faster thanks to a just in time compiler .

We 'll update with anything else we notice that 's new too .
The Nike team went into the 10 K at the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational targeting the U.S. record , with Galen Rupp expected to set the new mark in Palo Alto late Saturday night .
But with a powerful finish , Stevens Point native Chris Solinsky scored the record and the victory , becoming the first American athlete to break 27 minutes in the 10 K .
Solinsky finished in 26:59.6 , roughly 14 seconds faster than the previous mark of Meb Keflezighi .
" I can't even put it into words , " the 25 - year - old told " told the San Jose Mercury News .
" It still has n't even sunk in , what I just ran .
We came in hearing about Galen Rupp trying to break the record .
To me , this was just an indication race . "
Solinsky has been one of America 's elite distance runners since his junior year in college at the University of Wisconsin .
He joined the Badgers after a standout career running for Stevens Point Area High School : three state cross-country titles and state records in the 1600 and 3200 .
( Chris Solinsky shown running for a state championship )
He earned All - American honors four times at UW , and graduated in 2007 .
He took fourth in the 2008 Olympic Trials and made his first World Champs team in 2009 .
He , along with fellow former Badgers , Matt Tegenkamp and Simon Bairu , have been training under the tutelage of their UW coach Jerry Schumacher , who moved Portland and the Nike / Kimbia squad in 2008 .
Solinsky has been among the world 's best at 1,500 and 5,000 , but the run at Stanford was his first go in the 10,000 .
As Cal Track & Running News reported : " Solinsky ran negative splits , meaning he ran the first 5 k in 13:34.3 and the second in 13:24.6 !
His last 800 meters was run in 1:56 and his last 400 meters in 55 !
" Most importantly , Chris Solinsky is now the first non-African to break 27 minutes for 10,000 meters !
The race rewrote the American Best performances list .
" Consider that thirteen of the twenty - four finishers set personal bests , and that two national records ( 1st , Solinsky , AR , , 5th , Bairu , Canadian ) , Also note that Galen Rupp did break the former American record , finishing in fourth in 27:10.4 , he was just behind Chris Solinsky ! "
Bairu was fifth .
While remarkable , Solinsky 's effort is still more than 40 seconds off the world record , held by Keninisa Bekele , who set the mark 26:17.53 in August 2005 .

The President explains how Wall Street Reform will not only end bailouts and bring accountability for big banks , but empower consumers , shareholders and community banks .
Sanctions against North Korea by the U.S. government are expected to focus on Kim Jong - il 's personal slush funds .
The aim is to tighten the noose around Kim and the rest of the North Korean leadership rather than to increase pressure on the North Korean people , in a parallel with the 2005 freezing of what was apparently money for Kim 's private use in the Banco Delta Asia in Macau .
U.S. and South Korean intelligence are exchanging information about the bank accounts managed by a department of the North Korean Workers Party 's Central Committee codenamed " Room 39 , " which manages Kim 's personal coffers .
" We discovered long ago that most of the overseas bank accounts that received money from South Korean businesses involved inter-Korean projects were owned by the North Korean military , " said a South Korean government official .
Room 39 is expected to be the main target of the latest financial sanctions .
It has 17 overseas offices , some 100 trading companies , a gold mine and its own bank .
The $ 200 million to $ 300 million earned by subsidiary companies have gone straight into Kim 's overseas bank accounts .
The director of Room 39 , Jon Il - chun , is expected to face financial sanctions as well .
Kim appointed Jon after the former head , Kim Tong-un , was put on a blacklist of North Korean officials by the EU in December .
The U.S. government may also f reeze overseas bank accounts held by North Korea 's Reconnaissance Bureau , which is believed to have orchestrated the attack on the South Korean Navy corvette Cheonan in March .
But some experts say the U.S. may find it more difficult to apply financial pressure on North Korea because the North moved most of its money to accounts in China and Russia .

It 's not quite Firefox for the iPhone , but it 's the next best thing .
In a blog post Wednesday , Mozilla detailed its plans for Firefox Home , an iPhone app based on Firefox Sync that gives users access to browsing history , bookmarks , and tap sets , from their desktop - based Firefox browser .
According to Mozilla , the free app is " encrypted end - to - end . "
Mozilla has yet to actually submit Firefox Home to Apple , so there 's no telling whether the app will fall victim to the company 's infamous vetting processes .
Apple has been particularly stringent about apps that " duplicate existing function , " a complaint it has lodged against a number of browsers in the past , given the existence of the proprietary Safari for iPhone .
( Opera , for the record , did manage to make it into the App Store , breaking some records in the process . )
Firefox
Home feels like a workaround from Mozilla .
It 's not quite a full browser , but it 's a way to keep iPhone owners in the Firefox camp .
The new app will reportedly also work on the iPad , but is n't optimized for that platform .

In this picture you see a cast of the skeleton of the new raptor dinosaur Linheraptor exquisitus .
I discovered the fossil of Linheraptor with Michael Pittman , a graduate student at the University College of London , while we were hunting for fossils in red sandstone rocks in Inner Mongolia , a province in northern China .
I was walking along a cliff when I saw the sharp tip of a claw poking out of the rock .
Michael and I quickly started to dig at the edge of the cliff , and we kept exposing more bones .
We guessed then that we had found something important , but it was n't until the specimen was taken back to Beijing and prepared in the lab that we knew we had found a new species of raptor .
Xu Xing of the Institute for Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing led an international research team ( including Michael and me ) that reported this exciting conclusion .
IN PICTURES : Fearsome dinosaurs
Linheraptor was about six feet long , probably weighed around 50 pounds , and lived approximately 75 million years ago .
Like most other dromaeosaurids ( the scientific name for raptor dinosaurs ) , it has a large claw on the second toe of its foot and a tail stiffened by long bony rods that project from the vertebrae .
Linheraptor is important because it preserves almost every bone in the body .
Scientists can get information from its skeleton that they can't get from the incomplete fossil skeletons of other dromaeosaurids .
This information can be used as evidence for how features like the foot claw evolved , and it can also be used to improve our understanding of how dromaeosaurids were related to birds .
The environment Linheraptor lived in was similar to the conditions in Inner Mongolia today : a dry habitat with occasional sand dunes .
Linheraptor might have preyed on small relatives of Triceratops called Protoceratops , which would have been very common and sometimes nested in the dunes .
Amazingly , there are at least five other species of raptor dinosaur known from this area and time period , meaning that Linheraptor would have faced some serious competition from other dromaeosaurids , including Velociraptor .

Update 2010/05/27 : I ’ve made further updates to photograbber .
Read about them in my post titled , “ Facebook Photograbber Updates “ .
The patch file linked to from this page has been updated to include those changes .
I started using Facebook in October of 2004 , during my freshmen year of college , just a few months after it became available at UCSB ( June 24 ) .
To sign up I was required to have an email ending in @ucsb.edu and once signed up I could easily communicate with people at UCSB , and more specifically people in my courses ; a useful feature they later removed .
Eventually I had the ability to post and tag photos and well as create events to which I could easily invite all my friends .
Life was simple and so was Facebook .
Over time , Facebook expanded to allow anyone with an email address to sign up .
While I initially did n’t like that just anyone could join our exclusive college website , I gained the ability to easily keep in contact with a few more people thus I was happy with that feature .
However , when Facebook released their developer API , I was initially happy , though soon later I was sorely disappointed with the way Facebook provided third - parties with my information .
Primarily I had always wanted a way to make myself appear non-existent to third - party applications , except for those I explicitly allowed .
This is a feature that now appears utterly unobtainable .
These last few weeks Facebook has been hot news with respect to their dishing out of users ’ information to Microsoft , Pandora , and yelp .
Their information whoring has prompted Minnesota ’s Senator , Al Franken , to include instructions on his website detailing how to restrict the information flow .
Wired ’s article , “ Facebook ’s Gone Rogue ; It ’s Time for an Open Alternative ” pretty much covers many of the recent issues .
Thus , like many other Facebook users , the recent changes included the straw that broke the camel ’s back and therefore I am prepared to leave Facebook behind for good .
However , before doing so there are a few tasks that I wanted to accomplish prior to leaving .
These tasks are as follows :
Obtain a copy of all the albums I am tagged in Import my Facebook contacts ’ emails into my Google contacts Import my Facebook contacts ’ profile pictures into my Google contacts Import my Facebook contacts ’ birthdays into my Google contacts
At this point I have accomplished all these tasks , thus while I now can leave Facebook , there are a few precautionary things I ’d like to do before finally clicking that delete button such as removing image tags and posting a link to this blog posting .
Below I will detail the steps to accomplish the tasks I have outlined .
Obtain a copy of all the albums I am tagged in
Quite plainly there are two primary routes , which I think are good .
The first involves a Firefox extension , facePAD , and the second involves a desktop application , photograbber .
FacePAD simply will allow you to right click on an album link and download all of its images to your download directory .
The two drawbacks to this approach are that it ’s not automated , and if you want to group pictures into folders by albums , you ’ll have to first manually create the folders , and second move all the downloaded pictures into that folder .
On the upside , this is a great way to quickly download a few albums , and it ’ll download any picture that is viewable by you .
The other approach is using the opensource desktop application Photograbber .
Photograbber is written in python thus allowing it to run on Windows , OS X , and Linux .
As of today , photograbber is at revision 38 , which only allows you to download the pictures that you are tagged in , or the pictures that a particular friend is in .
These pictures are all downloaded into the same directory and thus to me is somewhat worthless .
Fortunately , because photograbber is open source , and it was written in python I fairly quickly was able to hack together modifications to photograbber that allow it to accomplish precisely what I want .
Which is , downloading albums that I am tagged in where photos in each album are grouped into their own folder .
I have made available my patch to photograbber which you can use to patch the source and run yourself .
Alternatively , I have also repackaged photograbber for Mac so you do n’t have to mess with patching the application ( download ) .
A window ’s repackage will follow shortly .
Running the application is pretty simple , but if you need any assistance please post a comment .
I have now made a zip file available which should work on windows .
Unzip , and run pg.exe .
While photograbber is fully automated once started , it does have a few drawbacks .
The first drawback is that it has a more restricted view of pictures than what you see when you browse Facebook manually .
This is because your both you and your friends can restrict applications from having access to your photo albums , thus to get 100 % coverage of all the albums you are tagged in , you ’ll unfortunately have to manually check to see what albums were downloaded and compare that to all the albums you appear in .
Additionally pictures cannot be organized by date ( I have n’t checked the EXIF data ) , which I think is an important feature .
I ’ll probably add in this feature sometime before I actually delete my account , so check back for updates .
Import my Facebook contacts ’ emails into my Google contacts
I did n’t find a direct way to solve this problem , though I ’ll admit I did n’t look very hard as I stopped with the first result I found for “ export facebook emails to gmail ” .
The method suggested involves using a Yahoo email account .
From Yahoo ’s contact page you can select “ Tools ” followed by “ Import … ” and finally you have the option to import from Facebook .
This uses Facebook Connect , so you will have to authorize Yahoo to access your information .
Following the import you can select “ Export … ” from the “ Tools ” menu and export to a “ Yahoo! CSV ” file , which you download to your computer .
Finally , on the Gmail contact page you can select “ Import ” from the upper right and provide it with the downloaded CSV file .
Import my Facebook contacts ’ profile pictures into my Google contacts
This may not be essential for many people .
I wanted to accomplish this so that all of my contacts on my Android Device have pictures next to them .
For this step I used phaceboogle .
At first I thought this web service was a little sketchy , however it uses both Facebook Connect , and Google ’s OAuth thus I was cool with using it .
Phaceboggle did almost exactly what I wanted , though rather than copying the thumbnail picture , phaceboogle copied the un-cropped profile picture , which in some cases appears with the wrong aspect ratio .
Nevertheless , I was satisfied and thus completing another step .
Import my Facebook contacts ’ birthdays into my Google contacts
In order to accomplish this task as I describe , you will need an Android Device as it utilizes the Android application , ebobirthday .
This app connects to Facebook via the Facebook API and copies over all the birthdates for your contacts .
The next time your phone syncs to your Google account , many of your contacts will have their birthdate field completed .
Now you can add a birthday calendar to your Google Calendar ( See section ‘ More ’ ) .
Task completed !
Well that ’s all .
Feel free to post alternative methods to accomplish these tasks , or other tasks , in the comments .
Bye bye Facebook !

LARGE CRIB WANTED
I need a large ( tall ) crib for my 9 month old .
The crib I have right now is too small - he keeps climbing out !
I need a crib that is too high for my baby to get out of it .
Please respond with pictures .
Contact Julia @ ********@verizon.net
From Me to ********@verizon.net :
Hey Julia ,
I may have the perfect crib for you .
It is a very large crib that has some features to prevent your baby from escaping .
Please let me know if you are interested .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Julia ******** to Me :
How big is it ?
Do you have any pictures of it ?
From Me to Julia ********:
Julia ,
It is very large .
As I said , it has modifications to prevent escape .
The entire top perimeter of the crib has been reinforced with a metal frame that is connected to a car battery .
When someone tries to escape the crib , they will be given a gentile electric shock , which will discourage them from attempting to climb out of the crib again .
The price includes a 12 volt car battery , but a higher - voltage battery can always be purchased , depending on how fat your child is .
Here is a picture of the setup :
I am currently using the crib for one of my friends who happens to be a midget .
He tends to frequently get drunk and violent , so we put him in this crib when he starts getting belligerent .
The battery works great for keeping him in , so I am assuming it will work great for your child .
The only reason I am getting rid of it is because the midget was recently arrested for arson , so he wo n't be around for a while .
I have something else that you may be interested in as well .
Are you tired of waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of your baby crying ?
With this clever device , you wo n't even have to get out of bed to calm your baby .
It is a little mobile that I invented called " The Lullibinator . "
Simply hang it above the crib , and the microphone will detect when the baby is crying .
If the crying reaches a certain decibel level , the box will spray a calming mist of pepper spray into the crib .
It trains your baby not to cry in no time !
It worked great on the midget when he started yelling .
It comes with 2 % CS pepper spray , which is practically harmless .
It can be upgraded to bear mace if your child continues to cry .
I have decorated the Lullibinator with friendly smiley faces to comfort your baby .
I am asking $ 50 for the Lullibinator , and $ 250 for the crib / battery combo .
Let me know if you want to set up a time to stop by and check this stuff out .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Julia ******** to Me :
Oh my god
From Julia ******** to Me :
Please tell me you 're kidding .
You 're kidding , right ?
From Me to Julia ********:
Julia ,
Why would I be kidding ?
I thought $ 250 was more than reasonable .
I got a lot of use out of these things before social services took my kid away .
I still do whenever the midget comes over .
Mike
From Julia ******** to Me :
I ... do n't know what to say to you .
You are a disgusting excuse for a human being .
How dare you ever think that I would use this for my child .
Do n't you ever e-mail me again , you scumbag .
From Me to Julia ********:
Julia ,
I 've been called some harsh things for my haggling tactics , but you seem to have been very offended by the price I have offered .
I am sorry ; I had no intention of offending you .
I will drop the total price to $ 200 for everything , and I 'll even throw this in for free :
Now you wo n't have to get up to give your baby a bottle when he is thirsty .
This handy crib - bottle will allow your baby to quench his thirst any time he wants .
It does n't have to necessarily be filled with tequila ( like I said , this crib was set up for a midget ) .
It can easily be filled with Gatorade , breast milk , or whatever else your baby prefers .
Throw in a can of food and the baby can practically live on his own !
Please let me know when you are going to pick this stuff up .
I am going to Atlantic City for the weekend , so I need you to get it before I leave .
Thanks ,
Mike

Ten - dollar AI
The other day Will Wright , the genius behind Sim City and the Sims , handed me this tennis ball - size orb and said , “ It knows what you are thinking . ”
Most of the time it will guess what you have in mind after asking you twenty yes / no questions .
It is eerily smart , and slightly addictive .
I see it as an educational toy .
Burned into its 8 - bit chip is a neural net that has been learning for 17 years .
Inventor Robin Burgener programmed a simple neural net on a DOS machine 1988 .
He taught it 20 questions about a cat .
He than passed the program around to friends on a floppy and had them challenge the neural net with their yes / no answers to the object they had in mind .
The neural net learns only when it plays a game ; no data is added except for the yes / no answers of visitors .
So the more people who test it , the more they teach it .
In 1995 Burgener put the now robust neural net onto the new web where anyone could play it ( that is , train it ) 24 hours a day .
And they did .
Burgener ’s genius was to turn the hard tedious work of training a neural net into a fun game for humans .
Last year , after 1 million rounds of 20 questions online , the neural net had accumulated 10 million synaptic associations .
It has a 73 % success rate of guessing what you thought .
Burgener then compressed the 20Q code to run on a chip , and had the neural net select 2,000 of the most popular 10,000 objects it then knew about .
He then had the neural net select out the most useful 250,000 synaptic connections related to those 2,000 objects , and hard wired that learning into the chip in the orb .
In other words , this sphere is a handheld version of Burgener ’s Twenty Questions web site .
( Because it knows about fewer objects than the web version , it gets confused less often , so its success rate is ironically higher . )
The toy is remarkable .
Because it is so small , so autonomous , its intelligence is shocking to the unprepared .
Most children can’t stump it , and if you stick to objects it will stump smart adults about 80 % of the time with 20 questions and most of the time with an additional 5 questions .
I love to watch people ’s reactions when they think of a “ hard ” thing , and after a seemingly irrational set of questions you are convinced are dumb , the sly ball tells you what you had in mind .
( For instance , it can correctly guess “ flying squirrel ” without asking “ does it fly ? ” )
People who play chess machines wo n’t be surprised , but just about everyone else is tickled .
It feels like the future .
While the 20Q orb does n’t learn , the web neural net continues to learn and grow .
It has now played 16 million games of 20 questions , and is racking up 2 million additional games every month .
I asked Robin Burgener if it was still getting smarter .
“ It is learning , but it is not increasing its success rate .
What happens is that it is learning to play more kinds of people , people who do n’t speak English easily , or who have never played 20 questions , or who come from different cultures , and to understand more difficult kinds of things . ”
Has he given this intelligence a name ?
“ No , but it sure does have a personality .
Some days it does well , and some days , it ’s just off . ”
Right now , 20Q is being ported over to Apple servers to keep up with the traffic , and it is being trained in new languages : French , Spanish , Chinese , Italian to start with ( it will become separate neural nets for each language ) .
In the future , there may be medical versions of 20 questions to help emergency triage , or other expert uses .
But right now , for ten bucks , you can get an amazing little artificial intelligence , about as smart as an insect — but an insect which specializes in guessing what object you are thinking of .
And in that part of the brain , it ’s smarter than you are .
