WASHINGTON  Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama on Tuesday called for a " new direction " in international relations and laid out five goals that included a shift of emphasis from the war in Iraq to fighting terrorism in Afghanistan .
Obama , whose speech was delayed by President Bush 's news conference , called for a " tough , smart and principled national security strategy " that would begin with " ending the war in Iraq responsibly . "

" By any measure , our single - minded and open - ended focus on Iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping America safe , " Obama said in prepared remarks billed as a major foreign policy address .
" We 've been distracted from our most pressing threats , and we 've pushed the entire burden of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military — while neglected the other elements of American power .
And we"ve alienated ourselves from the world instead of strengthening our alliances . "
His remarks come only days before the Democratic senator leaves on a trip to meet with leaders in Europe and the Middle East .
It is part of a media blitz by the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee who planned appearances on several TV news programs and released an new advertisement on ending the smuggling of " loose nuclear weapons . "
McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , planned a speech on Afghanistan later Friday .
Obama , in his speech , said his administration would focus on five foreign policy goals :
• Ending the war in Iraq responsibly
• Finishing the fight against al - Qaeda and the Taliban
• Securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue nations
• Achieving true energy security
• Rebuilding our alliances to meet the challenges of the 21st century
" I am running for President of the United States to lead this country in a new direction — to seize this moment "s promise , " he said .
" Instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we face , I want to overcome them . "
He also said he wanted to repair relations with foreign countries .
" Instead of alienating ourselves from the world , I want America – once again – to lead , " he said .
Obama criticized the Bush administration , and McCain , for what he said was wrongly putting Iraq first in the war against terrorism .
" In fact – as should have been apparent to President Bush and Senator McCain – the central front in the war on terror is not Iraq , and it never was , " he said .
Instead , Obama said , he would be " taking the fight to al - Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan . "
Obama also took a swipe at what he has said was a Pakistani policy that relied too much on Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf .
He said the United States " must expect more of the Pakistani government , but we must offer more than a blank check to a general who has lost the confidence of his people , " he said .
" It 's time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of the Pakistani people , " Obama said .
He also announced that he would co-sponsor a bipartisan bill to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani people .
" We must move beyond a purely military alliance built on convenience , or face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear - armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical Islam , " he said .
Nobel laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyn , the reclusive icon of the Russian intelligentsia and chronicler of communist repression , died Sunday .
He was 89 .
His son , Stephan Solzhenitsyn , told the Associated Press that his father died of heart failure in Moscow .
The soulful writer and spiritual father of Russia 's nationalist patriotic movement lived to be reunited with his beloved homeland after two decades of exile - only to be as distressed by communism 's damage to the Russian character as he was by his earlier forced estrangement from the land and people he loved .
Mr. Solzhenitsyn returned from his Vermont refuge to a dramatically changed Russia in 1994 but deemed it a moral ruin after a monthslong odyssey to become re-acquainted with the country that had denounced him as a traitor , stripped him of citizenship and expelled him in 1974 .
Hailed as Russia 's greatest living writer , the author of more than two dozen books - in addition to commentaries , poems , plays and film scripts - won back his citizenship and the respect of his fellow Russians after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Although his books were best - sellers in the West , only " One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich " was published first in his homeland .
Other major works include a memoir , " The Oak and the Calf , " and " August 1914 , " the first volume of a monumental history of 20th century Russia .
Attacked Lenin
With his masterwork , " The Gulag Archipelago , " he gave a name to the brutal network of labor camps that spread across the Soviet Union during dictator Josef Stalin 's frenzied industrialization drive .
Tens of millions of men , women and children died in the effort .
Mr. Solzhenitsyn saw the Soviet Union as cruel and suffocating " under the malevolent and unyielding nature of communism . "
He even attacked the revered god of the Soviet Union - its founder , V.I. Lenin .
He denounced the East - West detente of the 1970s as a sham and called the 1975 Helsinki Accord - the charter of the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe - the West 's capitulation to Soviet enslavement of Eastern Europe .
Never hesitant to criticize his adopted country during 20 years in exile , he viewed the United States and the West in general as flaccid , morally weak , cravenly materialistic and suffering from " the spiritual impotence that comes from living a life of ease . "
Alexander Isayevich Solzhenitsyn was born Dec. 11 , 1918 , in Kislovodsk , a fashionable health resort in southern Russia .
A descendant of well - to - do Russian peasants , he was born six months after his father , Isaaki , died in a hunting accident .
Since he was 9 , he had written stories , poems and plays .
He attended secondary school in the industrial city of Rostov , where his mother was a typist .
Mr. Solzhenitsyn graduated from the city 's university with a degree in mathematics and physics in 1941 , the year Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union .
The same year , he married fellow student Natalia Reshtovskaya .
Criticized Stalin
At the outbreak of World War II , Mr. Solzhenitsyn volunteered for the military but was turned down because of a minor congenital ailment .
When the Soviet Union desperately needed manpower to stem German advances , he was drafted .
He was appointed commander of a battery in 1942 and fought on the front lines until virtually the end of the war .
Three months before the end of the war in 1945 , Mr. Solzhenitsyn was arrested for remarks he made in letters to a friend that censors turned over to the secret police .
Mr. Solzhenitsyn had been critical about " the mustachioed one " - Stalin - and spoke , half - seriously , of founding a party that would return the Soviet Union to the true path of Marxism - Leninism from which it had strayed under Stalin .
Sent to Moscow 's notorious Lubyanka prison , Mr. Solzhenitsyn was convicted by a three - member tribunal for anti-Soviet behavior and sentenced to eight years in prison .
He completed his sentence in a Kazakhstan labor camp that was noted for its harsh conditions .
After being stricken with cancer in 1952 , he underwent surgery in the camp hospital and was deemed cured , an experience that led to his novel " Cancer Ward , " published in the West in 1968 .
Upon completing his sentence on Feb. 9 , 1953 , he was condemned to exile " in perpetuity . "
He was sent to the desolate village of Kok Terek in Kazakhstan .
There , he was again stricken with cancer but won permission to be treated 1,000 miles away in Tashkent .
He was released from the hospital in 1954 .
Shortly before Mr. Solzhenitsyn's release from prison , he divorced Reshtovskaya .
In 1956 , Mr. Solzhenitsyn was informed that his sentence had been annulled .
He soon began teaching in Ryazan , southeast of Moscow .
During the early 1960s , the Soviet Union was experiencing a short - lived period of liberalization under Stalin 's successor , Nikita Khrushchev .
Mr. Solzhenitsyn began to reveal his secret life as a writer .
In 1961 , Mr. Solzhenitsyn used a pseudonym upon submitting " A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , " based on his experiences in the labor camps to the literary magazine Novy Mir , which published it the next year .
Mr. Solzhenitsyn had remarried Reshtovskaya in the 1950s , only to divorce her again in 1973 .
By then he had fallen in love with Natalia Svetlova , with whom he had had three sons .
Harassment from authorities
In the meantime , Mr. Solzhenitsyn suffered increased harassment from the regime that blocked his efforts to have his other works published .
Frustrated , he had some of them smuggled to the United States and other parts of the West - " The Gulag Archipelago " was slipped out on microfilm and published in Paris in December 1973 .
In 1970 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature " for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian Literature . "
Fearing he would not be allowed to return to his homeland if he went to Sweden to receive the prize , Mr. Solzhenitsyn did not accept it in Stockholm until 1974 - after his expulsion from the Soviet Union .
Mr. Solzhenitsyn was arrested Feb. 12 , 1974 , for treason and deported " for the systematic execution of actions incompatible with Soviet citizenship and harmful to the U.S.S.R. "
Placed aboard an Aeroflot airliner with seven KGB agents , Mr. Solzhenitsyn arrived in Frankfurt , West Germany .
A month later , as Soviet authorities had promised , Mr. Solzhenitsyn's wife , mother - in - law and three children joined him .
In 1976 , he settled in Vermont - whose scenery he liked for its similarity to the Russian heartland - and bought a house on 50 acres near Cavendish .
" I think - I am sure - that I will return to Russia and still have a chance to live there , " he said in 1980 .
Yet the collapse of communism and his return to Russia brought him little solace .
After Russians gave him a euphoric welcome in 1994 , Mr. Solzhenitsyn embarked on a two - month , nearly 6,000 - mile sojourn across Russia to reacquaint himself with his homeland and assess the depths of communism 's damage to his nation .
" I came with a very sad , dark idea of the country , " he told a town meeting in Yaroslavl as he neared the conclusion of his journey in Moscow , 150 miles away .
" It has been confirmed . "
Despairing of his fellow Russians ' abuse of alcohol and immunity from patriotic feelings , Mr. Solzhenitsyn bought a country estate outside the Russian capital .
He is survived by his wife and three sons .
The beguinages in Bruges and Ghent operate under different setups .
To investigate in person , I hoped to travel by train to both cities and back to Antwerp , and I was pleased to learn from the ticket agent this could be done for the amazingly low price of 11.5 euros , or $ 18.29 at $ 1.59 to the euro .

It took about 45 minutes to get to Bruges , and then 20 minutes more to walk to the front gate of De Wijngaard ( The Vineyard ) , as this beguinage is called .
The walk along the canals and through winding passageways was its own reward , and it was early enough in the season that the streets were not yet choked with tourists .
As with so many other places in this most popular of Belgium ’s medieval destinations , the Bruges beguinage seems to exist to be photographed more than anything else .
Hundreds of visitors take out their cameras for the same shots — of the whitewashed buildings and courtyard of poplars and daffodils — every day .
I know I did .
Since 1937 it has been a monastery for a small group of Benedictine nuns .
About 25 sisters still live there .
( Winston Churchill included them in an affectionate painting he did of the place in 1946 . )
Ordinarily , I would counsel skipping the little museum , with its slipshod displays of lace - making done by the sisters , along with the re-creation of an early - 20th - century kitchen .
But the 2 euro entrance fee is one of the few sources of income asked from the crowds that otherwise troop over the stone bridge and through the 18th - century gateway free .
I paid up and after a cursory tour headed for the exit .
Not to be missed is the nearby Baroque church , an unflamboyant structure that remains the focus of the community .
A painting over the altar of St. Elizabeth , patroness of the beguinage , by the 17th - century Bruges master Jacob van Oost the Elder , may be the art history highlight .
Worthier of study and contemplation are the dozens of tombstones embedded in the floor under the benches and near the entrance of the nave .
The dwindling ranks of the beguines can be charted in the centuries of women who spent their lives here , now mostly forgotten by history .
The last person to be buried under these stone slabs died in 1905 .
The beguinages were experiments in communal living that worked successfully for centuries .
But as the options for many European women multiplied after the 18th century , within the Catholic Church and beyond , the numbers of beguines rapidly declined .
Belgium , which once had 94 beguinages , had only 20 in 1856 ; the members of the sisterhood fell by more than half between 1631 and 1828 .
Today , according to the Tourist Office of Flanders , Belgium , the order has only one surviving member , 88 - year - old Sister Marcella who lives in a Belgian rest home .
Of the three beguinages left in Ghent I had time to visit only two .
The Klein Begijnhof ( Little Beguinage ) in the southwest quadrant of the city had been described to me as perhaps the most atmospheric of its kind in Belgium .
This was true only in that it was the saddest I saw .
Vandals had broken windows in the apartments , and the church door was padlocked .
An air of abandonment prevailed in a once prosperous setting that catered to indigent and lower - middle - class women .
Restorations are supposed to be under way .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Signaling that some businesses have still been spending despite tight credit and a slow economy , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that new orders for U.S. - made durable goods surged in July , rising 1.3 % .
Strong transportation equipment demand boosted the result , Commerce reported .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had been looking for a gain of 0.2 % .
Excluding transportation goods , July 's new orders rose 0.7 % .
Durable goods are big - ticket items designed to last three years or more .
As such , new orders are very sensitive to economic expectations and serve as useful leading indicators of growth .
Orders for core capital - equipment goods -- considered the best monthly gauge of business investment -- rose 2.6 % in July , following a 1.3 % gain in June .
Core capital equipment orders exclude aircraft and non-defense goods .
Meanwhile , shipments of these goods -- which are factored directly into the government 's calculations of gross domestic product -- rose 0.6 % in July , following a 0.4 % gain in the prior month .
Exports , special factors support durables
Economists said exports are likely behind the strong durables report .
" The sectors , which last month posted the biggest increases in orders -- machinery and metal -- are usually very export oriented , " wrote Harm Bandholz , an economist for UniCredit Markets .
Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics , wrote that the domestic economy remains " very weak indeed , " and that companies benefiting from the export boom are likely behind the increase in capital spending .
" The risk must be that in time the combination of slowing global growth and a stronger dollar crimps exports , but for now they are the lifeline , " Shepherdson wrote .
Tony Crescenzi , chief bond market strategist for Miller Tabak & Co. , wrote that there is " weak " basis for further gains in durable goods orders given the weak U.S. economy , and that the fresh data should " be taken with a grain of salt . "
Companies are using capital investments to control costs by increasing productivity , he wrote .
" Companies simply have no basis to expand their productive capacity ; it is why businesses are cutting payrolls , " Crescenzi wrote .
" Only if economic growth moves closer to the economy 's productive capacity will companies feel comfortable boosting their capacity , otherwise they will be stuck with unwanted and costly excess capacity . "
He added that the durables report was also boosted by special factors such as price increases for metals and temporary capital spending incentives from Washington .
Details
New orders for durable goods in June were revised to an increase of 1.3 % from a prior estimate of 0.8 % growth .
Also for July , shipments of durable goods rose 2.5 % , picking up from an increase of 0.9 % in the prior month .
Excluding transportation goods , July shipments rose 2 % .
Both inventories and unfilled orders rose 0.8 % last month , according to the Commerce Department .
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 12 - Laziness
2015-02-26
my @integers = 0 ..* ; for @integers ->
$ i { say $ i ; last if $ i % 17 == 0 ; } my @even := map { 2 * $ _ } , 0 ..* ; my @stuff := gather { for 0 ..
Inf { take 2 ** $ _ ; } }
Perl programmers tend to be lazy .
And so are their lists .
In this case lazy means , that the evaluation is delayed as much as possible .
When you write something like @a := map BLOCK , @b , the block is n't executed at all .
Only when you start to access items from @a the map actually executes the block and fills @a as much as needed .
Note the use of binding instead of assignment : Assigning to an array might force eager evaluation ( unless the compiler knows the list is going to be infinite ; the exact details of figuring this out are still subject to change ) , binding never does .
Laziness allows you to deal with infinite lists : as long as you do n't do anything to all of its arguments , they take up only as much space as the items need that have already been evaluated .
There are pitfalls , though : determining the length of a list or sorting it kills laziness - if the list is infinite , it will likely loop infinitely , or fail early if the infiniteness can be detected .
In general conversions to a scalar ( like List.join ) are eager , i.e. non-lazy .
Laziness prevents unnecessary computations , and can therefore boost performance while keeping code simple .
Keep in mind that there is some overhead to switching between the producing and consuming code paths .
When you read a file line by line in Perl 5 , you do n't use for ( < HANDLE > ) because it reads all the file into memory , and only then starts iterating .
With laziness that 's not an issue :
my $ file = open ' / etc / passwd ' ; for $ file.lines -> $ line { say $ line ; }
Since $ file.lines is a lazy list , the lines are only physically read from disk as needed ( besides buffering , of course ) .
A very useful construct for creating lazy lists is gather { take } .
It is used like this :
my @list := gather { while True { # some computations ; take $ result ; } }
gather BLOCK returns a lazy list .
When items from @list are needed , the BLOCK is run until take is executed .
take is just like return , and all take n items are used to construct @list .
When more items from @list are needed , the execution of the block is resumed after take .
gather / take is dynamically scoped , so it is possible to call take outside of the lexical scope of the gather block :
my @list = gather { for 1..10 { do_some_computation ( $_ ) ; } } sub do_some_computation ( $x ) { take $x * ( $x + 1 ) ; }
Note that gather can act on a single statement instead of a block too :
my @list = gather for 1..10 { do_some_computation ($_ ) ; }
Laziness has its problems ( and when you try to learn Haskell you 'll notice how weird their IO system is because Haskell is both lazy and free of side effects ) , and sometimes you do n't want stuff to be lazy .
In this case you can just prefix it with eager .
my @list = eager map { $ block_with_side_effects } , @list ;
On the other hand only lists are lazy by default .
In computer science most problems can be described with a tree of possible combinations , in which a solution is being searched for .
The key to efficient algorithms is not only to find an efficient way to search , but also to construct only the interesting parts of the tree .
With lazy lists you can recursively define this tree and search in it , and it automatically constructs only these parts of the tree that you 're actually using .
In general laziness makes programming easier because you do n't have to know if the result of a computation will be used at all - you just make it lazy , and if it 's not used the computation is n't executed at all .
If it 's used , you lost nothing .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - “ Dead zones ” in coastal waters -- regions of ocean floor so deprived of oxygen that most marine life cannot survive -- are spreading worldwide at an alarming pace , scientists said on Thursday .

Driving the trend are nitrogen and phosphorous from chemical agricultural fertilizers that reach coastal waters after flowing off farm fields and into streams and rivers , according to the study published in the journal Science .
Nitrogen compounds from burning fossils fuels , particularly from power plants and cars , also are settling back to the ground and eventually wash into coastal waters , they said .
This decade alone , the number of coastal dead zones has risen by about a third to 405 worldwide , with clusters on the coasts of the United States and Europe .
Combined , they take up an area of at least 95,000 square miles .
The biggest one measures about 30,000 square miles in the Baltic Sea , the researchers said .
This is followed in size by one in the Gulf of Mexico starting at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the United States and one at the mouth of China ’s Yangtze River in the East China Sea .
“ It ’s not sort of a local or regional problem , which is how it was thought of in the past , ” Robert Diaz of the College of William and Mary ’s Virginia Institute of Marine Science said in a telephone interview .
“ It is actually a global problem . ”
“ Most of it is agricultural - based , but there is a lot of industrial nitrogen in there , too , if you consider electric generation industrial , ” added Diaz , who tracked the proliferation of the dead zones along with Rutger Rosenberg of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden .
The number of dead zones started to approximately double every 10 years starting in the 1960s , the researchers said .
There were 301 such dead zones at the end of the 1990s , 132 at the end of the 1980s , 63 at the end of the 1970s and 39 at the end of the 1960s , Diaz said .
The researchers said dead zones must be considered an important source of stress on marine ecosystems , ranking alongside over - fishing , habitat loss from human development and harmful algal blooms as global environmental problems .
Dead zones are formed when excess nutrients , mostly nitrogen and phosphorus , enter coastal waters and help fertilize blooms of algae .
When these tiny plants die and sink to the sea bottom , they provide a food source for bacteria , which consume dissolved oxygen from surrounding waters .
As a result , there are large areas of sea floor with insufficient oxygen to support most marine life .
“ Fish are the best at avoiding dead zones .
When the oxygen starts to decline , they ’re smart -- they leave , they do n’t hang around .
Crabs and shrimp are pretty good at getting away , too , as are lobsters , ” Diaz said .
But slower - moving creatures on the sea floor often die , including worms , clams and small crustaceans .
“ These are the animals that are the fundamental food base for the commercial crabs , shrimp and fish that feed on the bottom , ” Diaz said .

Rebase Project
Introduction
When contributing to a project , sometimes there is the need to keep some patches private , while keeping the whole repository up - to - date .
In those cases it can be useful to " detach " the local changes , synchronize the repository with the mainstream and then append the private changes on top of the new remote changes .
This operation is called rebase .
In general , this extension allows to move revisions from a point to another , some common scenarios are shown in the section " Scenarios " .
This feature has been implemented as part of SummerOfCode / 2008 .
Current implementation
This project is distributed along with Mercurial release 1.1 as RebaseExtension .
The original project code can be found here .
Current version 's features :
While the conspiracy theorists at Fox " News " ramp up their " special investigation " into the exceedingly rare crime of voter fraud , misleading their viewers before the upcoming election with breathless reports of " illegal immigrants " and " people who are not even citizens voting for whomever they want " in order to " sway an election , " I thought it might be useful to publish the complete cover- story , detailing Ann Coulter 's no-uncertain - terms felony voter fraud , as it was published in the recent exposé I wrote for Hustler magazine .
Up until now , the story --- along with complete documentation , such as the voter registration form on which she purposely lied and the evidence proving she knowingly voted in the wrong location --- has been told piece - meal in smaller stories as the scandal unfolded over the last two years ( all indexed in full here . )
But , with Fox " News " requesting tips via their special VoterFraud@foxnews.com address , I thought it might be nice to help them out by publishing , for the first time online , the entire story of Coulter 's purposeful voter fraud :
What she did , how she publicly used Fox and other media to lie about it , and how she 's gotten away with her several felonies and at least one misdemeanor ... so far .
Hopefully the crime fighters at Fox will help enforce the rule of law , and bring this documented fugitive to justice once and for all !
Especially since , as you 'll see in the following story , she used the network 's own airwaves to lie to Alan Colmes and others .
Please do your civic duty and let them know !

IS ANN COULTER A FELON ?
Despite Solid Evidence , Still No Arrest !
BY BRAD FRIEDMAN
( as published in Hustler 's , April 2008 edition , PDF version here )
beyond a shadow of a doubt , that neocon loudmouth Ann Coulter committed felonious voter fraud in Florida .
Perhaps two felonies plus a misdemeanor , according to a report from the Town of Palm Beach Police Department .
Despite a friendly friend of hers in the FBI --- who inappropriately interceded into the matter on her behalf --- Coulter is guilty .
I 've got the documents to prove it .
On June 15 , 2005 , just a few months after Coulter purchased $ 1.8 - million digs near Rush Limbaugh 's tony mansion ( in part , to escape her many stalkers , according to her publicist ) , she filled out a voter registration application to become a Florida voter .
After filling out her name and address --- but not specifying her gender ---
Coulter signed the document at the bottom next to an " oath " solemnly swearing that : " All information on this form is true .
I understand that if it is not true , I can be convicted of a felony of the third degree and fined up to $ 5,000 and / or imprisoned for up to five years . "
But all the information Coulter included on the form was n't true .
Coulter lied about the address of her new crib at 242 Seabreeze Avenue in Palm Beach .
Instead , she declared her " legal residence " to be 999 Indian Avenue --- that of her realtor , Suzanne Frisbie .
To compound that initial third - degree felony , Coulter then proceeded to knowingly vote at the wrong precinct in a local election in February 2006 .
Upon showing up at the correct precinct for 242 Seabreeze Avenue , Coulter was told that voters who lived at 999 Indian Avenue were supposed to vote elsewhere .
According to the incident report filed by the Palm Beach Town Clerk , when Coulter came in to vote at the Bethesda by the Sea Episcopal church , the address discrepancy was discovered and reported by a precinct 1198 poll worker .
Noticing that the GOP pundit was registered at a different address than her actual residence , precinct adviser James Whited --- a Republican --- informed Coulter that she'd have to fill out a change - of - address form in order to vote in the precinct .
" Where would I vote with the address that I have ? " Coulter asked Whited .
He explained that Indian Avenue residents were to vote at St. Edward 's Church , located in another precinct .
Coulter then " hurriedly went out the door , " according to Whited 's report .
Although the poll worker tried to catch up with her , it was " to no avail . "
A few minutes later , Coulter illegally cast a vote at St. Edward's .
According to the Palm Beach Police Department 's report , doing so was a first - degree misdemeanor .
The PBPD also found that Coulter again used her realtor 's address , instead of her own , to obtain a Florida driver 's license .
That crime is " a felony of the third degree , " according to a report by Michael S. Reiter , the Town of Palm Beach 's Chief of Police .
" She never lived here , " realtor Frisbie admitted to the Palm Beach Post when the story first emerged .
But that did n't keep Coulter from lying about it .
Neither did the fact that I had already confirmed her real address and posted the evidence on my Web site , BradBlog.com .
Her true address had been publicly available online via the database of the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser 's official Web site .
After the news had initially appeared as a small item in the Palm Beach paper and was then subsequently reported on both my Web site and the Huffington Post , a student asked Coulter about the matter during one of her frequent campus lectures .
Coulter reportedly replied : " No , I do n't live in Palm Beach .
Maybe you should n't read retarded news ! "
Coulter was equally clever the next time she was publicly asked about the issue , on Fox News ' Hannity & Colmes .
The New York Times best - selling author would n't even admit that she lived in Florida .
" I think the syphilis has gone to their brains , " Coulter yelped when Alan Colmes asked her about the allegations made by the Palm Beach County elections supervisor .
" Did you knowingly vote in the wrong district ? "
Colmes followed up .
" No , I live in New York , " Coulter lied .
" ... This is all false , I 'm telling you . "
While saying one thing publicly , Coulter was saying nothing at all to Palm Beach authorities .
County Supervisor of Elections Arthur Anderson sent Coulter a registered letter in May 2006 --- to the Indian Avenue address --- warning : " Failure to respond within thirty ( 30 ) days of this notice may result in a determination of ineligibility and in removal of the registered voter 's name from the statewide voter registration system . "
If the incident was n't properly explained , Anderson 's office said , the matter would be referred to the state attorney 's office for possible prosecution .
By June , Coulter had yet to answer the letter .
Of course , it had been sent to an address where she did n't live .
Nevertheless , Coulter was forced to lawyer up with a powerful Bush - connected law firm , which assigned an ex-Justice Department attorney to her case .
His first action was to condemn the Palm Beach County elections office for not sending him a copy of the letter .
The lawyer also refused to provide Coulter 's correct address .
Later he would admit in a letter to the elections office that Coulter had lied about her home address .
She did live in Palm Beach on Seabreeze Avenue , but was forced to lie about it in public due to the New York stalkers she 'd tried to move away from .
Coulter 's " stalker excuse " would come in handy later , when her FBI friend would try to save her .
For someone who claims to be so paranoid about stalkers , it seems odd that she would post the private , unlisted family phone number and e-mail addresses of one of BradBlog.
com 's guest bloggers on the front page of her own Web site for weeks .
Lydia Cornell --- who 'd played Ted Knight 's daughter in the 1980s sitcom Too Close for Comfort and currently co-hosts a Las Vegas morning drive - time progressive talk radio show --- wrote an article on my Web site criticizing Coulter .
Coulter retaliated by posting Cornell 's phone number --- which Cornell had sent to Coulter when requesting comment via private e-mail before publishing the article --- on her own site .
Cornell received multiple death threat phone calls and e-mails from rabid Coulterites .
A stranger went to Cornell 's home , and her trash cans were lit on fire .
Just prior to the November 2006 election , Coulter flatly refused to cooperate with the elections office 's investigation in any way .
Elections Supervisor Anderson told the Palm Beach Post that Coulter had made " efforts to distract and divert focus on the process regarding this complaint , " forcing him to bring the case to the state 's attorney , as he had threatened to do months earlier .
Coulter 's voting rights , however , were not rescinded before the November general election , as the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections gave her every benefit of the doubt .
In December 2006 , Anderson was forced to take the case to the PBPD for appraisal after the state attorney already shell - shocked after being out - gunned in his attempt to bring narcotics charges against " Hillbilly Heroine " addict Rush Limbaugh in the same county --- declined to take it up , telling Anderson that police action was needed before he could bring formal charges .
Despite their official assessment of an apparent two felonies and a misdemeanor , the police department in the chic Republican town of Palm Beach told Anderson that the crimes in question took place outside of their jurisdiction , so it would be unable to do anything about it .
The next stop for Anderson was the Palm Beach Sheriff 's Office , where the story would take its most twisted turn :
The FBI interceded on Coulter 's behalf to get her off the hook from her clear and well - documented voter fraud felonies .
Not long after Anderson brought the case to its attention , the Palm Beach Sheriff 's Office ( PBSO ) , began its own investigation into the Coulter fraud matter .
First - year Detective Kristine Villa , who'd been assigned the case , was contacted by a G - man from the FBI Academy 's Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico , Virginia .
He had a tip for her .
Supervisory Special Agent Jim Fitzgerald wanted to let Villa know that Coulter had a perfectly good reason for lying on her Florida voter registration application : Stalkers were out to get her .
Without bothering to interview Coulter , or the real estate agent who lived at the address Coulter gave on her form without informing her ( would n't that have put Suzanne Frisbie in grave danger ? ) , the PBSO promptly dismissed the case after the call from Fitzgerald .
The unusual interference --- and naming of the supposed stalker --- by a federal agent was wholly inappropriate , especially if there was an ongoing FBI stalking investigation .
The " stalker , " according to Fitzgerald , was yet another Brad Blog contributor !
His name : Dan Borchers , founder of Citizens for Principled Conservatism .
This Christian conservative had long been collecting and reporting on information about Coulter .
Borchers believes Coulter has betrayed both the Christian and conservative movements through her hypocrisy , hate speech and other behavior unbecoming of someone claiming the very virtues that Coulter espouses when necessary for political expedience , but otherwise completely ignores .
" Sounds like a load of bull to me , " legal expert Gregg Miller , a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law , said .
" If [ Coulter ] were trying to avoid a stalker , she would not have purchased her house in her own name , " but would have used a trust or an LLC ( limited liability company ) to protect herself .
Elections Supervisor Anderson shares Miller 's dubiousness .
" The whole claim of stalkers was very strange , " he told me during an interview not long after the PBSO had dismissed the case .
" I found it to be rather ironic that no action was ever taken to conceal her home address , etc. , until now that this issue has come up . "
Meanwhile , Borchers told me , " As far as I know , there is no investigation against me [ for stalking ] .
Even if there were an ongoing investigation , the FBI is not supposed to release names of those being investigated .
I 'm an innocent person here , and yet [ Fitzgerald ] leaked my name with this charge .
It 's unbelievable . "
While Borchers expressed astonishment at being publicly named as " a stalker " by an FBI agent who offered no evidence for the claim , he did offer one reason why a federal G - man would intercede in a case of local voter fraud in a municipal election in Florida : " Fitzgerald was Ann Coulter 's boyfriend , " Borchers alleges .
Media critic Howard Kurtz interviewed Coulter for a Washington Post profile in October 1998 , in conjunction with the release of her book High Crimes and Misdemeanors : The Case Against Bill Clinton .
Kurtz reported at the time that " Coulter seems to flit from one relationship to the next , " describing her recent breakup with Bob Guccione Jr. , the son of Penthouse 's former publisher .
" Now she 's involved with an FBI agent , " Kurtz added .
" Fitzgerald was Ann Coulter 's boyfriend in 1998 and 1999 , " Coulter expert Borchers claims .
" Since then , she has used him as her personal FBI resource for her own purposes . "
Borchers recounted a 1999 incident in which he claims he was called by Fitzgerald , who requested a meeting at D.C. 's Lafayette Park , across the street from the White House .
There Fitzgerald tried to convince him to let go of a story he'd been working on concerning Coulter 's involvement in the Linda Tripp / Monica Lewinsky tapes , which eventually led to Clinton 's impeachment .
According to Borchers , Fitzgerald admitted he and Coulter were an item .
" He told me that he and Coulter were deeply in love , " says Borchers , who alleges Fitzgerald then offered him the opportunity to question Coulter by e-mail in exchange for backing off on the Coulter / Tripp story for a period of time .
" He asked for two months , " Borchers claims , in order to allow for the completion of two important publishing deals Coulter had been near to closing .
While Fitzgerald now refuses to answer questions on the matter --- and an FBI spokesperson says an internal investigation has been launched to look into the unusual actions taken by Fitzgerald --- hard evidence of his being her former boyfriend is still elusive for the moment .
Anonymous sources have contacted me to corroborate the fact , but they are unwilling to go on record .
Since reporting the matter at BradBlog.com , however , neither Coulter , Fitzgerald nor anybody else has denied the charges .
While Anderson ponders whether or not to bring the case up to Florida 's Department of Law Enforcement , he was surprised to hear of the boyfriend allegations .
" But , " he surmised , " if they 'd reveal the name of a CIA agent [ Valerie Plame ] , I guess this should n't be any surprise either . "
Neither is the supervisor of elections ' disgust .
" I 'm not inclined to spend much more time on Ms. Coulter , " Anderson added , clearly exhausted from the runaround he 's received in trying to find someone , anyone , in Florida with bigger balls than Coulter to take her on .
There are two other apparent and related Coulter high crimes and / or misdemeanors that demand further investigation by authorities .
Since Coulter 's official public position had been that she does n't live in Florida at all , it would appear that the outspoken right - winger has also committed tax fraud for claiming a $ 25,000 Homestead Tax Exemption on her Palm Beach pad .
This exemption would only be available to Coulter if the Seabreeze Avenue home were her official primary residence , according to state tax law .
Furthermore , it appears that when Coulter voted at the wrong precinct illegally in Palm Beach , she was still a registered voter in the state of Connecticut , according to voter registration records in that state .
Being registered to vote in two different states is also a crime .
Why Connecticut and not New York , where she had previously lived and told Fox News that she still did ?
The answer lies only inside Ann Coulter 's twisted mind .
Law professor Gregg Miller adds that Coulter , an attorney herself , should know better than to lie on official public legal documents .
" I teach legal ethics , and believe that Ms. Coulter disgraces the legal profession with nearly everything she says , " Miller declares .
Now that proof exists
Ann Coulter committed the felonious act of voter fraud , it 's time for the law to hold her accountable .
But why is it so difficult to find a cop in Palm Beach when you need one ?
Editor 's Note :
At press time , the Florida Elections Commission announced that it was declining to press charges against Coulter due to the expiration of a two - year statute of limitations .
Critics called the decision " arbitrary " and said it showed the commission 's unwillingness to enforce the law .
California to be wiped off Russia ’s map
Deputies of Russia ’s Nizhni Novgorod region intend to liquidate several settlements in the region , including the village of California .
California to be wiped off Russia ’s map
Vladimir Gryzhin , an official of the Sechenovsky district , where the village is situated , said that the village of California was a deserted settlement , which had absolutely no perspectives for development since there was not even a power line in California .
Another official of the district , Vladimir Osokin , advised Gryzhin should ask the US Senate for help to recreate California .
California ’s last residents moved to the village of Lipovka in the beginning of the 1990s .
Nevertheless , the village of California was left on the map and still has its zip code , Lenta .ru reports .
There are several variants to explain the existence of the settlement with such an unusual name in Russia .
One of them says that a local landowner visited the USA in the second half of the 19th century and subsequently renamed one of his villages to California .
A little later , the vans would leave Skid Row bound for one of the three hospitals .
Some of the homeless people would receive medical treatments , court papers said , whether they needed them or not .
Investigators said recruits often received no medical care at all , or in some cases received faulty health care , as in the case of one person , identified as Recruit X , who court papers said was “ given a nitroglycerin patch for her non-existent cardiopulmonary condition . ”
The treatment caused a dangerous drop in blood pressure that made her ill , investigators said .
She was recruited repeatedly , court papers said , and for her cooperation was paid money that she used to buy crack cocaine .
After the trips to the hospitals , vans dropped off their recruits at the same Skid Row street corners , court papers said .
Those accused of being involved in the alleged scam billed Medicaid and Medi-Cal for thousands of fake treatments , according to lawsuits filed by the Los Angeles city attorney , Rocky Delgadillo , and Thomas P. O’Brien , the United States attorney for the Central District of California .
According to the lawsuits , Los Angeles Metropolitan , City of Angels and Tustin hospitals paid Mr. Mitts $ 1,600 to $ 20,000 a month and paid salaries to patient recruiters he managed .
Mr. O’Brien said the private hospitals were trying to keep beds occupied at the expense of taxpayers .
Although Medicare scams are relatively common , Mr. O’Brien said they usually implicated small clinics or doctors ’ offices .
The scale and duration of this enterprise is unusual , investigators said .

The horrific moment Olympic weightlifter turns his elbow back to front
This is the moment Hungarian weightlifter Janos Baranyai 's first Olympics ended in agony when he dislocated his right elbow in the ugliest moment yet of the Olympic weightlifting competition .
Baranyai was trying to snatch 148kg in his third lift in the men's 77kg division , when his elbow popped out of its socket .
No longer able to support the weight of the barbell , his right forearm bent backward .
The 24 - year - old Hungarian fell to the floor in shock , shaking and crying out in pain .
Hungary 's coaching staff and competition officials rushed to Baranyai 's aid as he lay trembling on the floor , his arm limp and twisted out of position .
Going wrong : Baranyai loses control of the barbell twisting his left arm
Impact : Baranyai 's legs buckle as his arm bends around the barbell
Agony : Baranyai screams in pain
Pain : Baranyai crumbles to the ground
Baranyai was carried off the platform on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment , said Benny Johansson , a technical controller at the event .
It was not immediately clear how serious the injury was .
' It looked really awful , ' Johansson said .
' If the ligaments are damaged then it could take several months to heal . "
He said elbow and knee injuries are the most common injuries in the sport , ' but the number of injuries are quite small in comparison with the number of athletes .
You can not even compare it with football for example . '
Stricken : Baranyai grimaces on the platform after dislocating his right elbow
Horror injury : Baranyai 's elbow clearly faces the wrong way as he lies on the ground
Help : the Hungarian is treated by doctors
A former judo wrestler from Oroszlany , Hungary , Baranyai was competing with the so - called B - group of lifters in the 77kg division .
Hungary 's lone lifter in the Olympics , he was ninth in both the snatch and clean and jerk in the European Championship earlier this year and placed 33rd in last year 's world championship .
He cleared his first snatch attempts at 140kg and 145 kg before loading up the bar at 148 kg - a relatively modest weight in top - level competition .
The world record in the snatch is 173kg .
In the snatch , the bar is pulled overhead in one continuous motion as the lifter settles into a squat , then rises with arms extended .
Baranyai was in the squat position when his elbow popped .
In honor of RubyFringe and my love of Ruby , Rails and Open Source , i’m going to release a small Rails project I coded up on the boring airplane ride back from Las Vegas .

I was in the studios of al - Jazeera – the Qatar satellite channel so democratic in the eyes of Colin Powell that Bush later wanted to bomb it – while Barack Obama was performing his theatricals in the Middle East .
" Theatre " is what I called it on air while the anchor desperately tried to suck some Arab hope out of the whole ridiculous fandango .
No such luck , I told him .
It is n't going to make the slightest difference to the Arabs whether Obama or McCain wins .
Westerners believe that Obama appeals to the Arabs because of his middle name or because he 's black .
Untrue .
They like him – or liked him – because he grew up poor .
Like them , he understood – or rather , they thought he understood – what oppression was about .
But they quickly found out where they stood in the food chain .
Forty - five minutes in Ramallah vs 24 hours in Israel was the Obama equation .
Yes , I know the old saw .
Every US presidential candidate has to make the pilgrimage to the Wailing Wall , to Yad Vashem , to some Israeli town or village that has taken casualties ( albeit minuscule in comparison to those visited upon the Palestinians ) , to talk about Israel 's security , etc .
That does n't mean , we are always told , that Israel is going to have it easy once the US president is elected .
Wrong .
Israel is going to have it easy .
Because no sooner is he elected than he will be enmeshed in the Middle East tragedy and be forced to take sides – Israel 's , of course – and then it will be time for the next election , so the president 's hands will be tied again and he 'll be talking about Israel 's security ( rather than Palestinian security ) and we 'll be back on the same old itinerary .
It 's like the Lebanese , who keep believing that a Labour government is better than a Kadima or a Likud government in Israel ; a clever idea , but – whoever runs Israel – the bombs keep falling on Lebanon .
It 's not that US presidents should n't understand the immensity of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust – it's a pity the Arabs still wo n't acknowledge it – but the Second World War is over and , right now , Israel continues to build colonies for Jews and Jews only on Arab land .
Of course , Obama made the usual references to Jewish settlements not being helpful to peace , just as Gordon Brown did a few days earlier .
And the Israelis showed what they thought of both men by announcing further colony - building within 24 hours of Obama 's departure .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But has n't anyone realised that Obama has chosen for his advisers two of the most lamentable failures of US Middle East policy - making ?
There , yet again , is Dennis Ross , a former prominent staff member of Aipac , the most powerful Israeli lobby in America – yup , the very same Aipac to which Obama grovelled last month – and the man who failed to make the Oslo agreement work .
And there is Madeleine Albright who , as US ambassador to the UN , said that the price of half a million dead children under sanctions in Iraq was " worth it " , and who later announced that Israel was " under siege " .
This must be the only time – ever – that a US politician thought Palestinian tanks were on the streets of Tel Aviv .
But this dreary old stage play does n't end there .
No one follows the narrative any more because it is so repetitive .
Take Nouri al - Maliki , the PMIGZ – Prime Minister of the Iraqi Green Zone – who 's suddenly gone from being the Democrats ' favourite target to being their election buddy - buddy , as Max Boot sagely noted in The Washington Post .
Maliki suggested to Obama that Iraq will be ready to assume responsibility for its own security by 2010 .
Bingo .
This chimes in perfectly with Obama 's promises .
But wait a minute .
In May , 2006 , Maliki announced that " our forces are capable of taking over the security in all Iraqi provinces within a year and a half " .
Five months later , the PMIGZ said that it would be " only a matter of months " before Iraqi security forces " take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some ( sic ) multinational forces only in a supporting role " .
Then in January , 2007 , Maliki boasted that " within three to six months our need for the American troops will dramatically go down " .
Four months later , he was at it again , claiming that Iraqi forces would control all security " in every province " within eight months .
Quite apart from the idea that there is a security " portfolio " in Iraq , his own military chums do n't agree with any of this bumph .
The PMIGZ 's own defence minister claims his forces can't assume responsibility until 2012 , while the Iraqi commander in Basra wants US troops to stay until 2020 !
Even if we ignore all this drivel , what does Obama want to do with his soldiers once he withdraws them from Iraq ?
He 's going to send the poor devils back to Afghanistan , that graveyard of foreign armies where the Taliban were so utterly defeated in 2001 that they are now stronger than ever .
I would recommend that Obama glance through Appendix XXIV of the official British account of the 1878 - 80 Second Afghan War where he will find the British announcing victory over a massed Afghan force which included a fierce group of fighters known as " talibs " .
These men would choose a particular soldier in the British ranks and make a suicidal attack to seize him and cut his throat in front of his comrades .
And I am " minded " ( as Jack Straw used to say when he was showing off his English ) of the bleak conversation I had with an adviser to the Taliban " elders " of Kandahar , a certain Mullah Abdullah , in the last days of the dark militia 's rule in 2001 .
" If our people return and take back this lost land , it 's a success , " he told me .
" If we are killed trying to do so , we have received martyrdom and this will be a great success for us too ...
If we are thrown out of Kandahar , we will go to the mountains and start the guerrilla war as we did with the Russians . "
The Taliban would fight on , he said .
They would ambush the Americans in ever greater numbers .
And so today Obama is also going to reinforce his soldiers to fight on in another Muslim country .
If he wins .
Dear Sony ,
How are you ?
Things seem to be looking a little better now that Metal Gear Solid 4 is out .
Sorry to hear about your firmware problems , I ’m sure you ’ll get it sorted out soon .
Is Microsoft still bullying you about the NPD numbers ?
I know I have n’t written you in a while , but I have a request and I feel it ’s important .
Can you give me tools to filter who I play with ?
Not like Microsoft ’s Gamer Zones , but more direct and community - driven .
Playing in the Family Zone might be a good way to dodge the racists , and playing in the Pro Zone might keep you away from teamkillers , but in that scheme , I can only choose one or the other ; either I ’m getting knifed in the back for " stealing " someone ’s vehicle or I get to hear a lot about members of the Jewish faith .
Now do n’t get me wrong ; Xbox Live handles this hairy problem much better than the Playstation Network does .
In fact , I have n’t seen any way in which you handle the problem , Sony .
Sure , there ’s a block list , but all that does is prevent them from hate spamming you ; they could very well be in your next Bad Company match , putting gnifes in ur bak .
Do developers have a way of accessing a player ’s PSN block list ?
I know they can access friends lists and send messages , so I can only assume that there ’s a complete API developers can use .
Have any developers taken advantage of this , either in matchmaking or audio settings ?
For some people on my block list , I have no problems playing with them , but I do n’t wanna have to worry about racial slurs popping out of my speakers at the beginning of a match while a young child listens on .
For others , I ’d rather not see them at all .
Why not create a social bookmarking system of sorts ?
Sites like Digg and Reddit operate almost entirely on user input , giving them the power to up - and downvote news items based on whatever criteria they have .
Sure , the user experience on such sites is largely dependent on popular opinion , but could n’t that also be a boon for the PSN ?
Consider my most recent additions to my block list : a pair of teamkillers who were angry that I grabbed a helicopter in Bad Company before they did .
Now that you ’ve made the XMB active during gameplay ( thank you , by the way ! ) , would n’t it be great if I could go to my PSN tab , browse through the list of player I recently played with , and add them to my block list with tags like " Teamkillers ? "
Developers could then filter matchmaking to lower my chances of playing in another match with them , and if no other games could be found without a " Teamkiller " tag , warn me that I would be entering a game with someone I need to watch my back around .
What if I played a match in Warhawk with a really good player , one that worked well with me , but refused to stop singing like an American Idol reject ?
Well , you could add another tag that developers can use to automatically mute while the level loads , but does n’t prevent you from playing with them .
Better yet , let people vote on their fellow players .
If they vote positively for someone , give them a list of possible tags ( " Funny , " " Leet , " " Nice " ) , and give them the same options when they vote negatively ( " Teamkiller , " " Annoying , " " Noob " ) .
Let players filter based on these tags ( I do n’t mind playing with noobs if they ’re at least funny ) .
Promote good play by offering awards ( maybe Trophies ? ) to those who consistently get voted as " Nice . "
I know what you ’re thinking .
" Gamer are smart people , " you say , " that can find creative ways of bending the system to their will .
They could vote - bomb members of opposing clans , or get their friends to vote them as ‘ Nice . ’ "
If that ’s what you ’re thinking , you ’re probably right .
But hey , you ’re a major worldwide corporation , with a multitude of smart people at your disposal and the freedom to experiment on a large scale ( 10 million PSN subscribers , right ? ) .
All it really takes is a stumbling step in the right direction , just like the way Microsoft ’s Gamer Zones and Nintendo ’s use of Friend Codes are imperfect but positive changes to the online play space .
Your friend ,

The notion that there is ever a good time to stop looking for cancer is hard to grasp .
But that ’s the message delivered last week by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , which recommended that men ages 75 and older no longer be screened for prostate cancer .
As I explain in my Well column this week , the task force ’s recommendations highlight the fact that there is always a downside to early detection .
It ’s not the simple blood test that puts men at risk , but the fact that many men have such slow - growing cancers that finding them and treating them likely does more harm than good .
I think Dr. Peter B. Bach , a pulmonologist and epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York City , explained it best .
“ It ’s just a needle stick , but the cascade of events that follows are fairly serious , ” Dr. Bach said .
“ I think the burden is on medicine to try and generate some evidence that the net benefits are there before drawing that tube of blood . ”
To read more , check out the full Well column here .
And to learn more about the issues men with prostate cancer face , look around the Well blog for other posts on prostate cancer .
In Sex After Prostate Surgery , readers talked about how statistics can mislead men trying understand how their sex lives may be changed by prostate surgery .
Another post , No Answers for Men With Prostate Cancer , explained why experts can’t recommend any one treatment over another one , and often ca n’t say whether treatment is appropriate at all .
And Cancer Funding : Does It Add Up ? shows that funding for research into prostate cancer lags that of other illnesses .
Freedom's Watch runs robocalls against Dems
Freedom ’s
Watch , the conservative advocacy group that has vowed to spend millions against Democratic congressional candidates this fall , will be running robocalls this week in 16 congressional districts where Democratic incumbents seem vulnerable or where an open seat has given rise to a competitive election .
The robocalls will focus on the issue of high gas prices .
Ed Patru , vice president for communications at Freedom ’s Watch , said the group sees this as an especially hot issue for voters :
“ We believe that energy , and specifically the high price of gas , is the number one issue in the country right now . ”
There are two scripts for the robocalls : one that runs against congressional incumbents , and another that runs against challenger who hold state elective office .
A sample call against Dina Titus , the Democratic candidate in Nevada ’s Third District , asks listeners , “ Did you know Nevada gas taxes add more than 32 cents to every gallon of gas ? ”
Accusing Titus of not working to alleviate the high price of fuel , the call concludes by telling listeners to call the state legislator , adding : “ If we ca n’t depend on Dina Titus to stand up for us today , when can we count on her ? ”
Patru said Freedom ’s
Watch does not generally disclose its campaign expenditures , including the cost of these calls .
The list of targets , however , is extensive , and it includes vulnerable freshman House members like Don Cazayoux ( D - La. ) , Nick Lampson ( D - Texas ) , and Steve Kagen ( D - Wis. ) , as well as nine promising candidates in districts from Oregon to New Jersey .
The full list of targets is after the jump .
Targets :
CT -05 Chris Murphy ( incumbent )
LA -06 Don Cazayoux ( incumbent )
ME -01 Tom Allen ( incumbent , running for Senate )
MS - 01 Travis Childers ( incumbent )
TX - 22 Nick Lampson ( incumbent )
TX - 23 Ciro Rodriguez ( incumbent )
WI - 08 Steve Kagen ( incumbent )
AL - 05 Parker Griffith
KY - 02 David Boswell
IL - 11 Debbie Halverson

NEW YORK -- Disgraced ex-NBA official Tim Donaghy admitted that he'd brought shame on his profession Tuesday as a federal judge sentenced him to 15 months behind bars for his participation in a gambling scandal that still has the league on the defensive .
U.S. District Judge Carol Amon sentenced Donaghy to prison time , plus three years of supervised release , saying he'd let the sport down by taking thousands of dollars from a professional gambler in exchange for inside tips on games -- including ones he refereed .
" The NBA , the players and the fans relied on him to perform his job in an honest manner , " Amon said .
Donaghy listened with his arms folded but showed no emotion .
He told the judge that " I 've brought shame on myself , my family and the profession . "
Defense attorney John Lauro asked Amon to give his 41 - year - old client probation , saying the ex-official was a gambling addict who destroyed " the career he loved " and needed treatment , not incarceration .
" Every news account begins with the words ' disgraced referee , ' " Lauro said .
" He will live with that the rest of his life . "
Donaghy also had sought to make amends by revealing " the good , the bad and the ugly " about the league 's officiating , the attorney added .
During the NBA Finals , Donaghy said in a court filing that the league routinely encouraged refs to ring up bogus fouls to manipulate results , while discouraging them from calling technical fouls on star players .
In the end , Amon refused Donaghy 's plea to stay out of prison , though she imposed a penalty that was not as tough as the 33 months he could have received .
Donaghy actually received two 15 - month prison sentences , one for each count he pleaded guilty to in August , but Amon ruled they will be served concurrently .
Donaghy must surrender on Sept. 23 .
Tim Donaghy apologized in court , saying he " brought shame on myself and my family . "
Andrea Shepard
Amon said she would honor Donaghy 's request and recommend that he serve his sentence at a federal prison camp in Pensacola , Fla. , to be closer to his four daughters in Bradenton .
However , the bureau of prisons has the final say on where he will go .
Case closed for him .
For the NBA , the damage lingers .
Commissioner David Stern has made several moves to quell doubts about the integrity of the NBA 's officiating , with more developments to come .
Former Army Gen. Ron Johnson has been hired as senior vice president of referee operations , Bernie Fryer and Joe Borgia were promoted to new management positions and the league reassigned Ronnie Nunn , who had been the director of officials for five years .
Still pending is a league - commissioned review of officiating by former federal prosecutor Lawrence Pedowitz .
" I am conducting additional interviews and hope to obtain additional information from the government .
My review is well - advanced but not complete , " Pedowitz said Tuesday in a statement .
No date has been set for the report 's release .
This tutorial is going to take a look at how to use Yahoo's BOSS Mashup Framework 's optional Python library to ( what else ? )
Build your Own Search Service .
We 'll start out by installing the library and getting a BOSS developer 's account , and then play with BOSS at the Python command line , putting together a handful of useful recipes for searching the web , news , images and more .
This tutorial is n't going to attempt to build an entire application , just show examples of using the BOSS library itself .
If you 're interested in an article that uses BOSS in a web framework , I recently wrote an article using BOSS in Django , which should be helpful .
As you work through these examples you may want to refer to the official Yahoo BOSS API documentation ( whose link is kind of hard to find on the BOSS page ) .
Setting Up the BOSS Library
Before we get started , note that the BOSS Framework library is dependent upon Python2.5 , and cannot be used as - is with previous versions .
Sign up for a BOSS App ID .
You 'll have to chose to use in - browser authentication , including supplying two urls : one for your app , and one for redirecting to after successful authentication .
However , those urls are not used by the library ( neither is any kind of authentication for end - users using your service , although you will have to supply your BOSS APP ID for the library to work ) , however they are used for validating your account , so you will need to chose a valid domain where you can insert a static file for them to verify domain ownership .
Download the Python library for controlling BOSS .
Unzip it , and delete the zip .
unzip boss_mashup_framework_0.1.zip rm boss_mashup_framework_0.1.zip
Open up the boss_mashup_framework_0.1/config.json file and fill in your values for the first three items .
appid is the id you got when you registered for BOSS in step # 1 . email is your email .
org is the name of your organization ( likely your name ) .
Install Simple JSON if you do n't have it installed .
You can check if you have it installed by entering a Python2.5 prompt and typing import simplejson
If that did n't work , download Simple JSON , unzip it , enter the folder , and then install it .
tar - xzvf simplejson - 1.9.2.tar.gz cd simplejson -1.9.2 python2.5 setup.py build python2.5 setup.py install cd ../ rm - rf simplejson - 1.9.2 * Create the folder boss_mashup_framework_0.1/deps/ . cd boss_mashup_framework_0.1 mkdir deps Download dict2xml and xml2dict , and extract them into the deps folder , remove the .tgz files , and return to the boss_mashup_framework _0.1 directory .
cd deps cp ~/Desktop/dict2xml.tgz ./ cp ~/Desktop/xml2dict.tgz ./ tar - xzvf dict2xml.tgz tar - xzvf xml2dict.tgz rm *.tgz cd ..
Now we can build the library .
python2.5 setup.py build python2.5 setup.py install Finally , lets test that everything worked .
python2.5 examples /ex3.py

No such file or directory : ' config.json ' then you probably started Python in a directory without a config .

I consider this a pretty ugly flaw in the library in its present form : you must run Python from a directory with a config .

Hopefully this situation can be improved upon ,
At this point , we are all setup and ready to move onward .
If things did n't quite work out for you , take a look at the boss_mashup_framework_0.1/ README file .
If that does n't help , leave a comment and I 'll try to help out .
Now , lets begin writing our recipes .
Searching the Web
First lets look at using the BOSS Mashup Framework to search the web .
>>> from yos .boss import ysearch >>> from yos.yql import db >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " Django " , count = 10 ) >>> table = db . create ( data = data ) >>> table .
rows [ { u'dispurl ' : u'www.<b>djangoproject.com </b>' , u'title ' : u' < b> Django </b> |
The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines ' , u'url ' : u'http://www.djangoproject.com/', u'abstract ' : u' < b> Django < /b> is a high - level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean , pragmatic design .

From there we can play with the data quite easily :
>>> for row in table .
rows : ... print " ( %s ) %s : %s " % ( row [ ' date ' ] , row [ ' title ' ] , row [ 'url ' ]
( 2008/06/19 ) < b> Django </b> |
The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines : http://www.djangoproject.com/
( 2006/03/15 ) < b> Django</b> Reinhardt : http://www.redhotjazz.com/django.html
( 2008/07/09 ) < b> Django</b> Reinhardt - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt ...
One thing to point out is the difference between url and clickurl .
In the above code they are the same :
{ u'url ' : u'http://www.djangoproject.com/' , u'clickurl ' : u'http://www.djangoproject.com/' , ... }
However , Yahoo is makes an important distinction between the two in their documentation .
Namely , that you should use clickurl for the actual link used to access that site .
For example , if you were writing a Django template the link might look like one these examples :
< a href= " {{ row .
clickurl }} " > {{ row.url }} </a > < a href= " {{ row .
clickurl }} " > {{ row.
title }} </a>
but should not look like these :
< a href= " {{ row.url }} " > {{ row.url }} </a > < a href= " {{ row.url }} " > {{ row.
title }} </a>
Although I have n't run into any situations where url and clickurl actually differ , it seems safer to follow Yahoo 's instructions , as there is likely a very reasonable explanation , even though its not explained well in their documentation .
Limiting Search to one Site
Limiting your search to a site is fairly simple .
If you wanted to search for HttpRequest on djangoproject.com you would simply do this :
>>> query = u " %s site : %s " % ( " HttpRequest " , " djangoproject.com " ) >>> query u' HttpRequest site: djangoproject.com ' >>> data = ysearch .
search ( query )
Here is a full example :
>>> from yos .boss import ysearch >>> from yos.yql import db >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " Django site:lethain.com " ) >>> results = db . create ( data = data ) >>> results .
rows [ { u'dispurl ' : u'www.<b>lethain.com</b>/tags/<b>django</b>' , u'title ' : u' < b> django</b>' , u'url ' : u'http://www.lethain.com/tags/django/', u'abstract ' : u" Will Larson 's blog about programming and other things .
< b>...</b> Tags : Google App Engine < b> django</b> < b>...</b> and disadvantages of using < b > Django < / b> with the Google App Engine . < b>...</b> " , u'clickurl ' : u'http://www.lethain.com/tags/django/', u'date ' : u'2008/07/03 ' , u'size ' : u'29012'} , u" 9 more results truncated for brevity " , ]
Searching in Different Regions and Languages
BOSS lets you search in different languages and regions as well , it lists the supported regions here .
These are accessed using the lang and region parameters to ysearch .
search .
For example if you want to search for the Argentina region ( ar ) in Spanish ( es ) it would look like this :
>>> data = ysearch ( " BOSS Framework " , lang = " es " , region = " ar " )
Here is a full example of searching using the Japanese region and language .
>>> from yos .boss import ysearch >>> from yos.yql import db >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " Django " , lang = ' jp ' , region = ' jp ' ) >>> results = db . create ( data = data ) >>> results .
rows [ { u'dispurl ' : u' < b>django</b>.nqsblog.jp ' , u'title ' : u' < b> Django</b> Kumamoto ' , u'url ' : u'http://django.nqsblog.jp/', u'abstract ' : u'< b> Django </b> Kumamoto .

Searching Yahoo News
Searching data from Yahoo
News is pretty much the same story , except we add the parameter vertical = " news " to the ysearch .
search function .
>>> from yos .boss import ysearch >>> from yos.yql import db >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " Python " , vertical = " news " , count = 10 ) >>> news = db . create ( data = data ) >>> news .
rows [ {u ' sourceurl ' : u'http://www.geek.com/', u'language ' : u'en english ' , u'title ' : u'Sun to add Python support to NetBeans IDE ' , u'url ' : u'http://www.geek.com/sun-to-add-python-support-to-netbeans-ide-20080710/', u'abstract ' : u'Sun\u2019s open source IDE NetBeans is expanding fast .
After announcing support for PHP back in May , Sun has used the EuroPython 2008 event to announce support for Python and Jython in upcoming releases .
NetBeans is an all - in - one development environment in the same vein as Microsoft\u2019s Visual Studio .
The one key difference being Sun\u2019s version is open [... ] ' , u'clickurl ' : u'http://www.geek.com/sun-to-add-python-support-to-netbeans-ide-20080710/', u'source ' : u'Geek.com ' , u'time ' : u'14:50:27 ' , u'date ' : u'2008/07/10'} , " 9 results truncated for brevity " ]
Lets say we wanted to generate a list of html links from those results , it would look something like this :
>>> def make_link ( row ) : ... return u' < a href= " %s " > %s </a >' % ( row [ ' clickurl ' ] , row [ ' title ' ] ) ... >>> links = [ make_link ( row ) for row in news .
rows ] >>> links [ u ' < a href= "

>Sun to add Python support to NetBeans IDE < /a >' , u' <a href= "
http://www.akron.com/akron-ohio-community-news.asp?aID=2875 ">Peninsula celebrates Python Day with special events </a >' , u '8 results truncated for brevity ' ]
Searching for Images
BOSS lets you search for images by adding the parameter vertical =" images " to the ysearch .
search function .
>>> from yos .boss import ysearch >>> from yos.yql import db >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " cherry blossom " , vertical = " images " , count = 10 ) >>> images = db . create ( data = data ) >>> images .
rows [ { u'mimetype ' : u'image / jpeg ' , u'refererurl ' : u'http://whatdigitalcamera.com/gallery/view_photo_properties.php?set_albumName=wdc_gallery&index=127&gallery_popup=true', u'format ' : u'jpeg ' , u'url ' : u'http://whatdigitalcamera.com/albums/wdc_gallery/Cherry_Blossom.thumb.jpg', u'abstract ' : u' Photo Properties Cherry Blossom ' , u'clickurl ' : u'http://whatdigitalcamera.com/albums/wdc_gallery/Cherry_Blossom.thumb.jpg', u'thumbnail_width ' : u'125 ' , u'height ' : u'100 ' , u'width ' : u'150 ' , u'refererclickurl ' : u'http://whatdigitalcamera.com/gallery/view_photo_properties.php?set_albumName=wdc_gallery&index=127&gallery_popup=true', u'date ' : u'2006/07/26 ' , u'title ' : u'Cherry_Blossom.thumb.jpg ' , u'thumbnail_height ' : u'83 ' , u'filename ' : u'Cherry_Blossom.thumb.jpg ' , u'thumbnail_url ' : u'http://sp1.yt-thm-a01.yimg.com/image/25/m3/2578341441', u'size ' : u'5500 ' } , u"9 more results truncated for brevity " , ]
Searching for Spelling
You can use BOSS to check spelling as well .
To do this add the parameter vertical =" spelling " to the ysearch .
search function .
>>> from yos .boss import ysearch >>> from yos.yql import db >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " exubberance " , vertical = " spelling " ) >>> spellings = db . create ( data = data ) >>> spellings .
rows [ {u ' suggestion ' : u'exuberance '} ] >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " horrifiy " , vertical = " spelling " ) >>> spellings = db . create ( data = data ) >>> spellings .
rows [ {u ' suggestion ' : u'horrific'} ]
Paginating Search Results
Often you 'll want the ability to page through results , and show the first ten results , then the next ten , and so on .
Fortunately this is easy as well .
Simply use the start named paramter for the ysearch .
search function , slowly incrementing its value :
>>> pos = 0 >>> first_five = ysearch .
search ( " Django " , start = pos , count = 5 ) >>> pos = pos + 5 >>> second_five = ysearch .
search ( " Django " , start = pos , count = 5 ) >>> pos = pos + 5 >>> third_five = ysearch .
search ( " Django " , start = pos , count = 5 )
And here is a full example of paginating the search results :
>>> from yos .boss import ysearch >>> from yos.yql import db >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " Python " , start = 0 , count = 5 ) >>> results = db . create ( data = data ) >>> titles = [ row [ ' title ' ] for row in results .
rows ] >>> titles [ u '< b> Python</b> Programming Language ' , u' < b> Python </b> ( programming language ) - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia ' , u' < b> Python </b> ( programming language ) - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia ' , u'Download < b> Python</b> Software ' , u' < b> Python</b> - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia ' ] >>> data = ysearch .
search ( " Python " , start = 5 , count = 5 ) >>> results = db . create ( data = data ) >>> titles = [ row [ ' title ' ] for row in results .
rows ] >>> titles [ u '< b> Python </b> ( programming language ) - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia ' , u' < b> Python </b> for S60 ' , u' PythOnline ' , u" < b> Python </b> | O' Reilly Media " , u' < b> Python </b> for S60 ' ]
Going on from here
The recipes here are only looking at the functionality in ysearch .
search , but are not taking advantage of the functionality existing in the rest of the BOSS Mashup library .
I 'll be putting together some recipes using the yos.yql functionality in a bit , until then the best way to learn about how things work is to read the examples in the examples directory and to simply read the source code .
There is also the official documentation , but it does n't deal with the Python library specifically , so it may not be of great help .
Let me know if there are any questions .
EMI / Virgin Records Sues Platinum Selling Band For $ 30 Million ... Despite Not Paying Them A Dime In Royalties
from the the - music - business - at - work dept
If you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable , well , so do we .
And the fact that EMI informed us that not only are n't they going to pay us AT ALL but that we are still 1.4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier .
That the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on .
Should n't a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records ?
Or , at the very least , break even ?
We think so .

It 's always fun to remember stories like the following one the next time you hear some RIAA exec claim that it represents musicians .
The RIAA represents the record labels and record labels are continually at odds with musicians -- sometimes to extreme levels .
Wired reported that EMI / Virgin Records had sued the band 30 Seconds To Mars for $ 30 million recently .
The band is apparently fronted by movie star Jared Leto , and is considered something of a success .
Its last album went platinum and won some awards .
So why the lawsuit ?
Well , EMI implied that the band failed to deliver its latest record on time , but members of the band have now responded with a very different story .
Wired now points us to the response from 30 Seconds To Mars , where the band notes that the lawsuit appears to have a lot more to do with the band opting out of its contract .
The band points out that , under California law , a contract of more than seven years is not valid -- and the contract EMI held with the band was for nine years .
So why opt out ?
Perhaps this has something to do with it :
This is , of course , rather par for the course in the recording industry .
As Courtney Love explained years ago , it 's quite rare for a recording artist to ever see a dime of royalties from selling music .
The label gives the band an " advance " which really is n't that much , and then uses some funky accounting tricks to claim all of the band 's royalties as paying off that advance as well as covering other fees involved in the marketing and distribution of the album .
In this case , apparently , despite selling 2 million records , EMI is still claiming that the band has $ 1.4 million to pay back .
Not so long ago , we noted that Lyle Lovett was in the same boat : 4.6 million albums sold , no royalties paid .
So , at what point will the press and politicians stop buying the RIAA 's claims that it 's looking out for the musicians and trying to get them paid ?
The RIAA has always been in the business ofpaying musicians .

The Stalled Server Room - The Daily WTF
今から数ヶ月前のこと，ジェンさん（仮名）の勤める会社は，賃貸契約の都合上，ビルの２階から１階へ引っ越さなければならなくなった。まあ，それ自体は悪くない話だったので引っ越す方向で事を進めていたのだけれど，その新しい契約を済ませたあとに，ちょっとまずいことが発覚してしまった。
その会社は，専用の空調や電源を備えたサーバールームを所有していた。ところが，このサーバールームの設備を１階へ動かすことは，スペースやコストの問題から現実的でないことが分かってしまった。これはどうしようもないということで，サーバールームだけは２階に残す方向で，契約内容を修正することになった。
これで一件落着か……と思いきや，まだ問題は残されていた。サーバールームに繋げられる廊下が無いのだ。図にすると下のような感じになっていて，サーバールームへ行くには，２階に越してくる他社のオフィスを通らなくてはならなくなってしまう。
これは，「他社」にとってみればよろしくないことだよね……。そこで，ビルの管理者は一計を案じた。「女子トイレにドア作っちゃえばいいじゃん！」
それで，本当にやっちゃった……。
ビルの管理者にしてみれば「これは名案！」とでも思ったんだろうけど……ダメでしょこれは！
実行する前に気付いてほしかった……これはありえないということに……。
■ 無責任なキャリア様に群が るIDクレクレ乞食 ―― 退化してゆく日本 のWeb開発者
契約者固 有IDによる 「 簡単ログイン」の危うさ
一年ほど前、 「 携帯電話 の 「 簡単ログイン」は個体識別番号を使ってこんなふうに作れます | WEBクリエイターの木」といった、この手の話題が盛んにホッテントリ入りしていた。このエントリにもおびただしい数の無言ブックマークが付けられている。
中には 「 なりすましとか問題ないんだろうか？ 」 「あれってHTTPヘッダだから簡単に偽装できたんじゃ？」「重要な個人情報まで通過できるような構造にしちゃ絶対ダメ」といった声も見られるが、ほとんどはそのまま鵜呑みにしている様子だった。
ID だけで「認証」したつもりになってはいけないことは、昨年2月23日の日記「携帯電話向けWebアプリの脆弱性事情はどうなっているのか」でも書いた。
そもそも 、
「 ID/パスワードを毎回入力するのでは携帯の場合では特に面倒です」などといって、端末IDをパスワード代わりにしてはいけない。端末IDは他のサイトにも同じものが送信されるのだから、パスワード代わりになどならない。 携帯電話向けWebアプリの脆弱性事情はどうなっているのか , 2007年2月23日の日記
これに対し、「y - kawazの日記:珍しく間違った批判をしている高木先生」というトラックバックを頂き、
キャリア毎にIPアドレス制限をする限りにおいては端末IDやユーザIDは偽装不可能*3なので、むしろ他人でも入力可能なパスワード認証よりも強力な認証かもしれません。逆にいえばその認証方法があるからこそ携帯業界ではクッキー無しでのセッション管理が可能になっていると言えます。なので高木氏の以下の批判は的外れと言えるでしょう。
携帯業界の認証事情 , y- kawazの日記 , 2007 年2月24 日
と言われたが、そんなことはわかっていて言っているのであって、脚注1で「IPアドレスを確認すればそれで本当になりすまし不可能にできるのかは知らない。それは携帯電話事業者が公式に示すべきことだ。」と言っている。このことについて、「おさかなラボ - 携帯電話のIPアドレス制限神話」も次の通り批判している。
それから1年が経過し、「iモードID」の全サイト送信も始まり、その後もますます、「IPアドレス制限 + 契約者固有ID」による「認証モドキ」のサイト構築手法が広まりつつある。「簡単ログイン」で検索してみるとその様子が見えてくる。
「 IPアドレス帯域」をどうやって安全に更新するのか
先日のWASForum Conference 2008 でも、「 携帯電話向 けWebのセキュリティ」と題して、GREEの藤本真樹氏に、ケータイWebにありがちな脆弱性についてご講演頂いたが、その際に、この「IPアドレス制限」のやっかいな点が議論となった。このときの様子は「水無月ばけらのえび日記」にレポートされている。
質問 携帯キャリア のIP アドレス範囲のチェックはどうしているか ?
→ アンテナでキャリアのサイトをチェックしたりして頑張っている 逆引きするのはどうか ?
→ それは良いかもしれない 感想 質疑応答 の 「 逆引きで見る」という話は瞬間的に「ヤバイかも」と思いましたが、高木さんが「そのDNSが安全かどうかという問題がありますが」とナイスフォロー。逆引きで判断する場合、PTRの値はそもそも信用できないのでパラノイド検査が必須になりますが、それでも大丈夫かどうかは怪しい感じがしますね。
「 WASForum Conference 2008 : 携帯電話向 けWebのセキュリティ 」 , 水無月ばけらのえび日記 , 2008 年7月5 日
携帯電話会社（キャリア）は、上の「おさかなラボ」のエントリが参照しているように、「IPアドレス帯域」と称して、キャリアのゲートウェイのIPアドレスの範囲を公表している。
これが、（予告なく）しばしば変更される（通常は追加が行われる）ため、すぐに対応しないと、アクセスできないユーザが出てしまうため、ケータイWebの運営者らは、このページが更新されていないか、アンテナ等を使って常時監視しているというわけだ。私の記憶では、WASForumでは、「メールマガジンで更新情報を得ている」という発言もあったように思う。
このとき心底ヤバいと私は思った。WASForumでは時間が迫っていたので言い出す機会がなかったが、「メールで更新情報を得ている」となると、その担当者に偽の更新通知メールが送られたら、どうなるだろうか。
つまり、攻撃者のIPアドレスが混入された、偽のキャリアIPアドレス帯域表がメールで送られてきたとき、それを信じてWebサイトに設定してしまったらどうなるか。攻撃者はインターネットからそのサイトにアクセスできてしまう。攻撃者は、事前に入手しておいた有効な契約者固有IDを、ひとつひとつヘッダにセットして繰り返しアクセスすることで、大量のユーザに連続して成り済ましログインできてしまう。
サイトの機能によっては、クレジットカードを不正使用されたり、登録されている住所氏名等の個人情報を抜き出されるといった被害が出るだろう。しかも、それは、短時間に大量に抜き出されてしまう。
Webサイト運営者に対し、 「 メールの内容は信用するな」という忠告はできるだろう。更新の通知だけ受け取って、新しいIPアドレス帯域表はキャリアの公式サイトから入手するというのが正しい。
しかし、キャリアの公式サイトからどうやって安全にIPアドレス帯域表を得るのか？
キャリア各社は、IPアドレス帯域の一覧表を以下のURLで提供しているが、なんと、いずれのページも
https:// で閲覧しようとしても、できないようになっているのである。
馬鹿じゃないのか。このようなセキュリティに関わる情報公開ページは
https:// で提供する（閲覧者が望めば
https:// でも閲覧できるようにする）のが当然なのに、携帯電話会社ともあろうものが、そろいもそろってこんな認識なのだ。
（ 8月2日追記 : ソフトバンクモバイルについては「7月27日の日記に追記」参照のこと。）
それをまた、ケータ イWeb関係者の誰ひとり、疑問の声をあげていないことがまた、信じ難い。何の疑問も抱かずにこれをそのまま設定しているのだろう。
こんな状態では、ケータ イWebの運営者は、DNSポイゾニング等で偽ページを閲覧させられても、気付かずに、偽アドレス入りの帯域表を信じてしまうだろう。
つまり、たとえば、example.jp というケータイサイトを運営している会社が example.co.jp であるときに、攻撃者は、example.co.jp
のDNSサーバに毒入れ攻撃を続けることでそれに成功すれば、www.nttdocomo.co.jp や www.au.kddi.com、developers.softbankmobile.co.jp、developer.emnet.ne.jp
のアドレスを偽サイトのIPアドレスに書き換えることができてしまう。その頃合いを見計らって、攻撃者が、サイトの管理者宛に、キャリアからのメールを装って更新通知メールを送れば、サイト管理者は、「キャリアのIPアドレス帯域が更新されて、新しいアドレスが追加された」と認識してしまうだろう。社内のアンテナでチェックしているなら、メールがなくても自動的に騙されてしまう。
ちょうど今、DNSポイゾニングの現実的危機が話題になっているが、元々DNSはそういうもので、今回話題の対策をしても、確率的にいくらか毒を入れられる危険性は残るのだから、このレベルのセキュリティに関わる用途で、DNSを信用してはいけない。
DNSキャッシュポイズニング脆弱性、JPCERT/CCが“ 緊急” で再注意喚起 , Enterprise Watch , 2008 年7月25 日
もっと危険なことに、キャリアのIPアドレス帯域表を自動的にダウンロードして、自動設定までやっていると思われる人たちがいるようだ。

データを取りにいってい るURL は http:// なので、DNSがやられたらイチコロだ。
携帯電話会社は 、 「 IPアドレス帯域 」と称するものを早急に https:// ページでも見られるようにするべきである。
そういうことは、ケータ イWebで生計を立てている者達が、キャリアに要求するべきことだ。
だが、どうもケータ イWebのサイト運営者たちは、どういう遠慮があるのか知らないが、キャリア様には何ひとつ要求できないらしい。「IPアドレス帯域」の表はHTMLで提供されているわけで、これがXMLでデータ化されるなり、Web APIで提供されるようになれば、業界は皆ハッピーに違いないが、それが実現されていない。WASForumでも愚痴が漏れていたが、小さな声で愚痴をこぼす程度で、誰もキャリア様を批判したりはしない。
こんな状況で事故が起きたら、キャリアに損害賠償請求したらいいと思う。https:// で提供するのが当然なのに、それを怠っていたのが原因と主張することはできるだろう。
キャリアは無責任を通せるか
とはいえ、上の方でも参照したように、各キャリアはいずれも、「本情報はあくまでも目安としてご参照ください。iモードセンタ以外から本IPアドレスでのアクセスがない事を保証するものではありません。」などと、以前からずっと無保証を宣言してきた。
キャリアのこの宣言は、 「 契約者固有IDは、顧客の行動分析や、悪質ユーザの排斥などに使うもので、セキュリティに関わる目的では使用しないでください。」という意味にとれる。なぜなら、契約者固有IDが偽装されないか否かは、IPアドレス制限が確実に行えることが必須の前提であるのに対し、顧客行動分析や悪質ユーザ排斥においては、それほどではないからだ。
ところが、その状況は今年の3月末に一変している。NTTドコモは、契約者固有IDが「簡単ログイン」のために使うものであることを公式に認めたのだ。

ここまで明確に、契約者固有ID を「認証」目的に使えと言っておきながら、その必須の前提であるIPアドレス制限のための「IPアドレス帯域」情報について、「本情報はあくまでも目安としてご参照ください」などという無責任が許されるのか
。そのうち、法廷ではっきりされたらいいと思う。
検索クローラー のIPアドレス帯域に注意
最近さらに情勢は危うくなっている。
モバイルSEOのポイント実践編--端末識別、IPアドレスに最適化する , CNET Japan , Marketing CHANNEL , 2008年6月27 日 5.IP ア ドレスによるアクセス制限 オープンな一般のウェブと異なり、モバイルサイトでは、各キャリアのネットワークからのみアクセス可能にしているサイトが多い。 ここで問題になるのは、モバイルサイト用クローラーの多くがキャリアの保有するネットワークと異なる帯域で動作している点である。Googleモバイル、Yahoo!モバイルのクローラーのIPアドレス帯域は下記の通り。 （略） 検索結果に表示されるためにはキャリアのネットワークに加えて上記の帯域からもアクセス可能な状態にしておく必要がある。
キャリアのゲートウェイアドレスだけでなく、検索クローラのIPアドレスまで、アクセス許可に設定するケータイサイトが増えてきているようだ。
Googleのクローラなら信用できる（契約者固有IDでなりすましアクセスするなんてことは犯罪だからやらないだろう）と思って、これらのIPアドレスからのアクセスを普通に許してしまうサイトは多そうだ。
「 Googleモバイル」につい て 「 IPアドレス帯域」が公開されているようだが、その公開方法がまた杜撰で酷い。よりによって、blogspot.com
上のブログで公開しているのだ。

Googleというと、世界最高峰のIT技術者が集結していて、セキュリティにもプライバシーにも配慮した素晴らしいサービスを提供してくれるという印象があるが、日本のグーグルだとこんなもんだ。
「 IPアドレス帯域」情報の提供方法にしても、キャリアのものも含めて安全に情報共有できるようなフレームワークを構築したりするのが、本国Googleの人たちのやり方だが、日本のグーグルはそういうことをやっていない。しょぼい。
そして、このしょぼいやり方に、誰一人文句を言わず、おびただしい数の無言ブックマークを付けている。
日本のWeb開発者たちはどんどん退化してゆく。
さらに言えば 、
「 今のうちから、許可IPに加えておくと良いかもしれません」などと言っているが、5月の時点でもし、そのIPアドレスが他人のものだったら（Googleのものでなかったら）どうするんだ？
もっとも、既に確保しているから予告している可能性は高いわけだけども、では逆に、このアドレスがいつまでGoogleに所有され続けるかということについて考えたことはあるだろうか。IPv4アドレスが枯渇しつつある今、アドレス割当が整理されて、このアドレスがGoogleから回収され、中国に割り当てられるかもしれないわけだが、ケータイWebの運営者達は、そういう可能性をちゃんと想定しているのか。
キャリアだけでなく、検索クローラにまでアクセスを許すとなると、検索クローラは無数にあるわけで、どのクローラは信用できるかといったことを評価しなくてはならないだろうし、廃止されたIPアドレス帯域をきちんと外していかないといけない。
あるいは、そういう心配がいらないように、キャリアからのアクセスでは契約者固有IDを解釈するが、検索クローラからのアクセスでは契約者固有IDを解釈しないように、Webアプリケーションを設計する必要があるだろう。
というか、そもそもIPアドレスで何かを制御しようとするのが誤りなんだが、ここまで常態化してしまった。
「 IPアドレス帯域」で検索してみると、OKWaveや人力検索はてなで「IPアドレス帯域を教えてください」みたいな質問をしている人が散見される。この人たちは、見ず知らずの人が教えてくれた情報を鵜呑みにして、自分のケータイサイトに設定しているのだろうか。そんな輩が契約者固有IDを含む個人情報取り扱いサイトを運営しているかと思うとゾッとする。
i Phoneに契約者固有ID送信機能が搭載される日
10 日の 「日本のインターネットが終了する日」と22日の「あとがき」では、こうして退化してゆくケータイWebが、日本のスタンダードとなってしまい、いつの日か、PC向けの普通のインターネットまで、単一IDの全サイト送信が必須になってしまうのではないかと危惧した。
これに対し、「 iPhoneがきっとそれを止めてくれる」と希望的観測を示す人が続出した。
i Phoneと携帯契約者固有IDと複アカと青少年ネット規制によるケータイ闇ナベ狂想曲 ,
Web屋のネタ帳 , 2008年7月21 日 2008年7月。ここへきてiPhoneが豪快に殴りこみ。もちろん空気読む気なぞさらさら無し。携帯契約固有ID？端末シリアル番号？はぁ？日本の事情なんか知るか。っていうかお元気ですかそこのガラパゴス諸島のみなさん。俺様はアップルだ、いいからそこに行列しろと。
むしろ 「 ケータイ」を変えようよ , 崎山伸夫 のBlog , 2008年7月23 日 iPhoneはyomoyomoさんがFSFの批判を紹介しているように決して自由な端末ではないが、日本のケータイ文化の文脈とは縛るところが明らかに異なる端末であって、そうした多様性が日本のケータイ文化を市場を通して揺るがし、コンテンツプロバイダーとキャリアの態度を変えさせることに私は期待している。
なぜ、iPhoneだとそうだと思えてしまうのだろうか。先日の「あとがき」で「 Windows MobileのIEでどうやって契約者固有IDを送信しているか」を書いたように、EMnetでは、Windows Mobileの普通 のInternet Explorerが契約者固有IDの全サイト送信をやっているわけで、これは単にイー・モバイルが提供しているプロキシサーバを通すように設定されているからであって、同様のことはiPhoneでだって容易にできる。
ソフトバンクモバイル が「 Yahoo!ケータイがiPhoneでもご利用可能になりました!」として、プロキシサーバの設定を案内するという事態が考えられる。
その必要があるのかというと、NAVITIMEの動向が気になるところだ。iPhoneにもNAVITIMEがApp
Storeで提供されている。私はiPhoneは持っていないのでiPhoneでは確かめていないが、iPod touchでNAVITIMEを動かしてみたところ、下の図のようになった。
i Phoneには似つかわしくないケータイふうの画面で「会員登録/解除 」
というメニュー項目を選択し、「会員登録する」を選択すると、
■お知らせ 誠に申し訳ございませんが、iPhone版NAVITIMEの会員向けサービスは現在準備中です。サービス開始まで、いましばらくお待ちください。

Hard Calls
Mr. McCain spent the afternoon of Sept. 11 in a young aide ’s studio apartment near the Capitol .
There was no cable television , nothing but water in the kitchen , and the hallway reminded him of an old boxing gym .
Evacuated from his office but stranded by traffic , he could not resist imagining himself at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue .
“ There are not enough Secret Service agents in the world to keep me away from Washington and New York at a time like this , ” Mr. McCain told an adviser .
Over the next days and weeks , however , Mr. McCain became almost as visible as he would have been as president .
Broadcasters rushed to him as a patriotic icon and reassuring voice , and for weeks he was ubiquitous on the morning news programs , Sunday talk shows , cable news networks , and even late - night comedy shows .
In the spotlight , he pushed rogue state rollback one step further , arguing that the United States should go on the offensive as a warning to any other country that might condone such an attack .
“ These networks are well - embedded in some of these countries , ” Mr. McCain said on Sept. 12 , listing Iraq , Iran and Syria as potential targets of United States pressure .
“ We ’re going to have to prove to them that we are very serious , and the price that they will pay will not only be for punishment but also deterrence . ”
Although he had campaigned for President Bush during the 2000 general election , he was still largely frozen out of the White House because of animosities left over from the Republican primary .
But after Mr. Bush declared he would hold responsible any country condoning terrorism , Mr. McCain called his leadership “ magnificent ” and his national security team the strongest “ that has ever been assembled . ”
A few weeks later , Larry King of CNN asked whether he would have named Mr. Rumsfeld and Colin L. Powell to a McCain cabinet .
“ Oh , yes , and Cheney , ” Mr. McCain answered , saying he , too , would have offered Mr. Cheney the vice presidency .
Even during the heat of the war in Afghanistan , Mr. McCain kept an eye on Iraq .
To Jay Leno in mid-September , Mr. McCain said he believed “ some other countries ” had assisted Osama bin Laden , going on to suggest Iraq , Syria and Iran as potential suspects .
In October 2001 , when an Op - Ed page column in The New York Times speculated that Iraq , Russia or some other country might bear responsibility for that month ’s anthrax mailings , Mr. McCain interrupted a question about Afghanistan from David Letterman on that night ’s “ Late Show . ”
“ The second phase is Iraq , ” Mr. McCain said , adding , “ Some of this anthrax may  and I emphasize may  have come from Iraq . ”
( The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it came from a federal government laboratory in Maryland . )
By October , United States and foreign intelligence agencies had said publicly that they doubted any cooperation between Mr. Hussein and Al Qaeda , noting Al Qaeda ’s opposition to such secular nationalists .
American intelligence officials soon declared that Mr. Hussein had not supported international terrorism for nearly a decade .
But when the Czech government said that before the attacks , one of the 9/11 hijackers had met in Prague with an Iraqi intelligence official , Mr. McCain seized the report as something close to a smoking gun .
“ The evidence is very clear , ” he said three days later , in an Oct. 29 television interview .
( Intelligence agencies quickly cast doubt on the meeting . )
Updated - but still NSFW
In an attempt to upstage their former employer , a trio of ex-Googlers have launched a search engine of their own .
They insist on calling it " Cuil " - pronounced " cool , " apparently - and they say it " goes beyond today ’s search techniques . "
This includes flashing random pornography when you search for information about a Grenoble - based quantum computing researcher .
" Cuil gives users a richer display of results [ such as ] images to identify topics , " reads the company 's press release .
And as loyal Reg reader Jonathan Grattage points out , he and his quantum research are identified with " little pictures of a US serviceman and a guy masturbating over some other poor sap " :
Three men who are n't Jonathan Grattage
Cuil achieves this " richer display of results " by indexing a whopping 120 billion web pages .
According to the company , that 's three times more than any other search engine .
Yes , Google is disputing this claim .
" We maintain the largest collection of documents searchable on the web , " said a spokeswoman for the Mountain View search giant , which quit releasing index numbers about three years ago .
" Over the past year , we have increased our index size by billions of documents . "
But there 's no doubt Cuil is capable of things that Google is not .
If you google Jonathan Grattage , there 's no masturbation in sight .
You see , unlike Google , Cuil is designed to analyze the context of each web page and the concepts behind each query .
As CEO Tom Costello puts it , " Cuil presents searchers with content - based results , not just popular ones , providing different and more insightful answers that illustrate the vastness and the variety of the Web . "
Jonathan Grattage points out that those little pictures are n't on his web site and have nothing to do with him .
But he does n't know search like Cuil knows search .
Costello researched search engines at Stanford University and IBM .
His wife worked for Google .
And so did two other Cuil founders .
We asked them to explain their unique insight into the world of search .
But we 've yet to hear back . ®
Update
Cuil has explained its quantum porn .
The company says it 's attempting to tag each search result with an image " that will help people visually check whether the result is something they want to click on . "
But the mid-masturbation pic was a mistake .
" We want people to be able to determine clicks by looking at a picture rather than reading through 200 some words , " says Cuil vp of communications Vince Sollitto .
" But that 's a significant challenge , something that 's not offered on the web today ...
We 've made some progress on it , but there 's still a lot to do . "
Sollitto also indicated that random pornography may have turned up beside certain results because Cuil received far more hits than anticipated after yesterday 's launch .
That 's right , Cuil - still pronounced " cool " - is blaming the mid-masturbation pic on heavy traffic .
" There was overload on servers , and when that happens - and you lose a machine for even a minute or so - the images that machine is going to provide can't be used , and so you then have to choose from the remaining results you have , " Sollitto says .
" And if that machine had key images , then the quality of your results are severely affected . "
Just to be sure , we asked him to repeat this argument .
" If the machine that had the image we intended to provide was down , then we may have defaulted to a less than ideal image , " he replied .
We would call that a design flaw .
Then Sollitto pointed out that " with inappropriate images or content that is of a questionable nature [ that would be porn - Ed ] , there 's no doubt the purveyors of that content do anything they can to describe it in ways that make it seem like something else . "
In any event , if you now search Cuil for " Jonathan Grattage , " you no longer see gay porn .
But that US serviceman is right where he always was .
Coding Horror - Quantity Always Trumps Quality
Art & Fear という芸術家向けの本の中に，こんなエピソードがある ― ある陶芸クラスでのこと，最初の授業において，教師は生徒をふたつのグループに分けた。一方のグループは作品の「量」によって評価を行うとし，もう一方のグループは作品の「質」によって評価を行うとした。
これはどういうことかというと，「量」グループの生徒たちは，提出した作品の量のみによって評価が下される。作品の総重量が５０ポンドに達していたらＡ評価，４０ポンド台ならＢ評価，というように。それに対して「質」グループの生徒たちは，たったひとつの最高の作品を提出すればいい。その作品の出来に対して評価が下される。
すべての授業が終わり，さて評価は，となったとき，少し奇妙な事実が判明した。提出された作品のうち，最も高い質を持つものは，すべて「量」グループから提出されたものだったのだ。
質を求められていたのは「質」グループのはずだったのに，なぜ質を求められていなかった「量」グループの生徒たちが，質で上回る結果になったんだろう？
理由は恐らく簡単なことで，「量」グループの生徒たちは，多くの作品を作り出す過程において失敗を繰り返し，その失敗から多くのことを学ぶことができた。それに対して「質」グループの生徒たちは，最高の作品を作り出すための理屈立てにばかり時間を費やしてしまい，結果的に質の高い作品を生み出すための技能を身に付けることができなかった。
まあ，当たり前のことと言えば当たり前なんだけどね。多くのことを学ばなくてはならない段階にある人が，まずやるべきことは，とにかく手を動かすことに違いない。でもそんな当たり前のことも，難しい理屈にまみれるうちに見失ってしまうことがある。そんなときには，陶芸クラスのエピソードでも思い出してみるといいよ。質で上回ることができたのは，何をどうした人たちだったんだっけ……ってね。
I can give so many examples , ranging from Joey Harrington to Rex Grossman .
But for me , Reggie Bush is the one who gets the biggest pass .
While guys like Harrington and Grossman had great college years , none of them had near the hype that was built up for Reggie Bush 's career .
The media and all the experts expected Reggie Bush to be one of the greatest of all time .
The media can't face the fact that they were wrong and are always making excuses for him and making him seem like he is doing better than he is .
The reason I feel the need to talk about him is because Reggie Bush is n't just a guy who is n't living up to the hype , he is a guy who just simply is n't a good running back .
Reggie Bush , the supposed explosive back , had only two runs over 20 yards last season , with his longest being 22 yards .
Now it 's not as if Bush is a power back .
Bush is supposed to be the guy breaking long runs like he did in college .
Not only does Bush not have big runs , he does n’t have big games .
There were two running backs on the Saints that had 100 yard rushing games last season and neither of them were Reggie Bush .
Pierre Thomas had 105 yards in week 17 in his only start of the season .
Aaron Stecker had 100 yards in week 14 in his first of his three starts last season .
Both Stecker and Thomas were undrafted .
Two undrafted players had 100 yard rushing games while Reggie Bush , the No. 2 pick , did n’t have one .
Bush averaged 3.7 yards per carry , while three other running backs on his team had higher averages than him .
If you compare Bush ’s stats to Stecker 's , you can see that Stecker was a more productive player when he played .
Bush had six touchdowns ( two receiving ) on 157 rushing attempts and 73 receptions , while Stecker had five touchdowns on 115 carries and 36 receptions .
Stecker had one fewer touchdown on 79 fewer touches , not to mention Stecker was n't given many goal line attempts until Bush got injured late in the season .
My point is that Bush not only fails to explode for big runs and big games , but he also has trouble getting in the end zone .
What good running back has trouble getting in the end zone ?
Even though Bush ’s stats are n’t very good , the one thing that bothers me the most about Bush is that he led the league with eight fumbles in only 12 games .
He not only is n't performing well , but he is also hurting his team by constantly fumbling .
If you ’re not going to play very well , you should at least hold on to the ball .
Now if you ’re one of those people who wants to claim that even though he might not be running very well , he is a valuable receiver , just realize that a running back on his own team has very similar receiving stats .
Aaron Stecker had 36 receptions for 211 yards , while bush had 73 receptions for 417 yards .
Stecker ended up with a higher average with 5.9 yards per reception to Bush 's 5.7 .
Stecker , who was n't even drafted , is doing just as well at catching balls out of the backfield as Bush , if not better .
Yes , Bush is a good receiver , but there are many third down running backs in the NFL that are good receivers .
Stecker not only has better receiving and rushing averages , he had only one fumble on the season to Bush 's eight .
But this year who is the one getting all the hype and playing time ?
It 's Reggie Bush , because he was the No. 2 pick and Stecker was n't even drafted .
There are many cases in the NFL where the best player does n't always play because the player in front of him makes more money and was a higher draft pick .
Now this article is n't saying Stecker should be the starting running back because quite frankly , when Deuce McAllister is healthy he is a top - five running back in the league .
Some of you might be thinking that I 'm being too hard on Bush .
I mean , the man had has only played two seasons and I should probably give him some slack .
But should I ? Look at a guy like Adrian Peterson .
Running backs do n't need time to develop as much as other positions do .
Since 1967 , when the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year first started , 31 out of the 40 players chosen have been running backs .
Now if you 're one of those people that was misled by the media the year the Saints went to the NFC championship game and want to claim that Bush had a good rookie year , look at the stats .
In his rookie year Bush 's longest run was 18 yards .
He had one 100 yard game with his next best being 67 yards .
He averaged 3.6 yard per carry , while McAllister averaged 4.3 and had five runs of over 20 yards , with three of them being over 30 .
Yes , Bush had eight touchdowns in the regular season , but he had four in one game , and all were near the goal line .
So he only scored a touchdown in four games that season .
Yet during the Saints ' run to the NFC championship game , he got all of the headlines .
He was n't even the best running back or the best rookie on his team .
Deuce McAllister and Marques Colston had those titles .
Now I 'm not trying to say that Bush does n't work hard or play hard .
The guy wants to be great .
However , sometimes you 've just got to call it what it is .
Most of the media and experts were wrong .
Bush is n't a great back .
What makes me sad is that he 's not even a good back .
He dances in the backfield and does n't run through the tackles hard , and without all those huge holes that his great USC line opened up for him , he just can't get the job done .
Now if Bush has a great season next year , I ’ll be the first to admit that I was wrong about him .
But as of right now , he is simply just a great college player .
I will always respect him for that , but he 's just not a very good NFL player .
COSTA MESA , California ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Saturday criticized Russia ’s military operations against Georgia , arguing the conflict poses a grave threat to world energy supplies .

In his weekly radio address , the Arizona senator said a disruption of energy supplies abroad could raise prices , “ inflicting great harm on our economy and on America workers . ”
For the next U.S. president , said McCain who faces Democrat Barack Obama for the job , “ skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far - reaching disaster . ”
Both McCain and Obama have both warned Russia of severe , long - term consequences from its conflict with Georgia , and President George W. Bush has denounced Russia ’s actions and insisted Georgia ’s sovereignty be respected .
The crisis over the rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia exploded when Georgia tried to retake the Russian - backed province , provoking a massive counter - attack by Moscow .
“ Russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old Soviet empire , ” McCain said in his address .
“ Russia also holds vast petroleum wealth .
And this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that Russia is clearly prepared to use . ”
European energy supplies could be disrupted if a key pipeline through Georgia were destroyed or controlled by Russia , he said .
The conflict underscores America ’s need to become more energy independent and to accelerate domestic energy production , McCain said .
“ All of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy , including America ’s enormous oil reserves that lie offshore , ” he said .
“ On energy policy , my opponent and his allies in Congress offer only half measures or no measures at all -- as in their shared opposition to offshore drilling , ” McCain said .

BBC News , Darfur
The BBC tracked down Chinese - built military trucks inside Darfur The BBC has found the first evidence that China is currently helping Sudan 's government militarily in Darfur .
The Panorama TV programme tracked down Chinese army lorries in the Sudanese province that came from a batch exported from China to Sudan in 2005 .
The BBC was also told that China was training fighter pilots who fly Chinese A5 Fantan fighter jets in Darfur .
China 's government has declined to comment on the BBC 's findings , which contravene a UN arms embargo on Darfur .
The embargo requires foreign nations to take measures to ensure they do not militarily assist anyone in the conflict in Darfur , in which the UN estimates that about 300,000 people have died .
More than two million people are also believed to have fled their villages in Darfur , destroyed by pro-government Arab Janjaweed militia .
Plates on the first truck show it was imported after the embargo Panorama traced the first lorry by travelling deep into the remote deserts of West Darfur .
They found a Chinese Dong Feng army lorry in the hands of one of Darfur 's rebel groups .
The BBC established through independent eyewitness testimony that the rebels had captured it from Sudanese government forces in December .
The rebels filmed a second lorry with the BBC 's camera .
Both vehicles had been carrying anti-aircraft guns , one a Chinese gun .
Markings showed that they were from a batch of 212 Dong Feng army lorries that the UN had traced as having arrived in Sudan after the arms embargo was put in place .
The lorries came straight from the factory in China to Sudan and were consigned to Sudan 's defence ministry .
The guns were mounted after the lorries were imported from China .
When it is shooting or firing there is nowhere for you to move and the sound is just like the sound of the rain
Hamaad Abakar Adballa describing attack by anti-aircraft gun
The UN started looking for these lorries in Darfur three years ago , suspecting they had been sent there , but never found them .
" We had no specific access to Sudanese government army stores , we were not allowed to take down factory codes or model numbers or registrations etc to verify these kinds of things , " said EJ Hogendoorn , a member of the UN panel of experts that was involved in trying to locate the lorries .
Culpability China has chosen not to respond to the BBC 's findings .
Its public position is that it abides by all UN arms embargoes .
China has said in the past that it told Sudan 's government not to use Chinese military equipment in Darfur .
Sudan 's government , however , has told the UN that it will send military equipment wherever it likes within its sovereign territory .
An international lawyer , Clare da Silva , says China 's point that it has taken measures in line with the arms embargo 's requirements to stop its weapons from going to Darfur is meaningless .
" It is an empty measure to take the assurances from a partner who clearly has no intention of abiding by the resolution , " she said .
Ms da Silva said the BBC 's evidence put China in violation of the arms embargo .
The UN panel of experts on Darfur has said it wants to examine the BBC 's evidence .
Homes scorched
The BBC found witnesses who said they saw the first Dong Feng which the BBC tracked down being used with its anti-aircraft gun in an attack in a town called Sirba , in West Darfur , in December .
" When it is shooting or firing there is nowhere for you to move and the sound is just like the sound of the rain .
Then ' Bang !
Bang !
Bang ! Bang !' " said Hamaad Abakar Adballa , a witness in the Chadian refugee town of Birak .
The Chinese are accused of training pilots to use Fantan fighter jets
The lorry 's powerful anti-aircraft gun fired straight into civilian houses .
The gun carries high calibre shells that explode on impact , spreading hot shards of metal and causing terrible wounds Witnesses saw one hut take a direct hit from the gun : " An intense wave of heat instantly sent all the huts around up in flames , " one witness , Risique Bahar , said .
" There was a lot of screaming . "
In the attack on Sirba one woman was burnt to death , another horribly injured .
Genocide accusation Sudan 's government has been accused by the United States of genocide against Darfur 's black Africans .
The terms of the embargo cover not only just the supply of weapons , military vehicles , paramilitary equipment .
It also covers training any technical assistance , so the training of pilots obviously falls within the scope of the embargo
International lawyer , Clare da Silva Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) say war crimes by Sudan 's Arab - dominated government have included summary executions , rape and torture .
Recently the conflict has deteriorated into more confused fighting , with rebel and militia groups also fighting each other .
Two hundred thousand people have been displaced already this year .
Malnutrition rates are set to soar in South Darfur later this year due to insecurity and drought .
Darfur 's landscape is spotted with blackened circles representing the hundreds of the villages that were burnt down by government forces and their Janjaweed allies .
Air attacks
In these attacks Darfur 's civilians have been hunted not just from the ground , but from the sky .
Most civilians who tell stories of aerial attacks talk about Russian made Antanovs and helicopter gunships .
Many also talk about fighter jets being used , but no - one has ever answered the question of which type of fighter jets these are .
President Bashir says facts have been distorted and exaggerated Kaltam Abakar Mohammed , a mother of seven , watched three of her children being blown to pieces as they were attacked by a fighter jet on 19 February in the town of Beybey in Darfur .
The BBC has established that Chinese Fantan fighter jets were flying on missions out of Nyala airport in south Darfur in February .
Panorama acquired satellite photographs of the two fighters at the airport on 18 June 2008 , and its investigations indicate these are the only fighter jets that have been based in Darfur this year .
When Kaltam heard the sound of fighting early that morning , she took her children and ran .
" We start running near the well , " she said .
" We hid behind a big rock .
Something that looks like an eagle started coming from over there .
It looked like an eagle but it made a funny noise . "
Jem rebels used a BBC camera to film a truck fitted with an anti-aircraft gun
When the plane unleashed two bombs Kaltam 's five - year - old daughter , Nura , was dismembered from the chest up .
Her eight - year - old son , Adam , was killed instantly , as was her 20 - year - old daughter , Amna .
Kaltam 's 19 - month - old grandson still has shrapnel in his head from the fighter jet bombing .
He cries a lot and often calls out for his mother , but she was killed in the attack .
Kaltam 's 13 - year - old girl , Hawa , cannot grasp what she saw happen that day to her brother and two sisters .
She rarely speaks now .
Pilot training
The Chinese Fantan jets are believed to have been delivered to Sudan in 2003 before the current UN arms embargo was imposed on Darfur .
But the BBC has been told by two confidential sources that China is training Fantan fighter pilots .
Sudan imported a number of fighter trainers called K8s two years ago - they are designed to train pilots of fighters like Fantans .
" Clearly this is what they used to train for operations with the Fantans , " said Chris Dietrich , a former member of the UN panel on Darfur .
This second truck also had plates identifying it as being from China International lawyer Ms da Silva says if China is training Fantan pilots , this represents another Chinese violation of the UN arms embargo .
" The terms of the embargo cover not only just the supply of weapons , military vehicles , paramilitary equipment .
It also covers training any technical assistance , so the training of pilots obviously falls within the scope of the embargo . "
There are strong economic ties between the China and Sudan .
China buys most of Sudan 's oil and believes that what Sudan needs is good business partners , help with development and a solid peace process in Darfur , instead of confrontation and sanctions from the West .
So when China 's President Hu Jintao visited Sudan in 2007 he wrote off millions of dollars worth of debt and donated a multi-million pound interest free loan for a new presidential palace to Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir .
In April last year , China 's military leaders pledged to strengthen co-operation with Sudan .

What are these ?
At a secret location , security officials will meet daily -- large video screens in front of them -- sharing surveillance data to be gathered during the Republican National Convention . ¶
Out in the streets , St. Paul police will field 3,500 - plus officers -- a third of whom will make up mobile field force units dedicated to crowd control .
A mobile nuclear detection unit is at the ready , officials say , and the U.S. Coast Guard is set to deploy helicopters that can carry " ready assault forces " trained to drop from the sky to take on hostile threats , said Coast Guard spokesman Thomas Blue .
" They can move in quick and take care of business , " he said .
As security operations go , Minnesota has n't seen anything like it before .
The Secret Service , charged with designing and implementing the convention security plan , must be " prepared for the worst , " spokesman Darrin Blackford said this week .
Critics , including the Coalition to March on the RNC and Stop the War , have accused authorities of exaggerating the possible threats .
In Denver , host of this week 's Democratic National Convention , protesters also decried a " police state " after seeing officers in riot gear and atop rooftops .
Asked about the upcoming scene in St. Paul , police spokesman Tom Walsh said : " We 're not going to discuss what it looks like .
People are going to take away from it what they want to take away from it . "
But to suggest a police state , he said , " I think that 's overstating the case . "
The department , awarded a $ 50 million security grant from the federal government , will have at its disposal $ 330,000 in helmets , $ 1 million in chemical masks and $ 1.9 million in chemical irritants , according to plans approved by the City Council this month .
Will cops be in riot gear ?
" They have it available , " Walsh said .
" That 's all I 'm going to say . "
Rowers were found to have larger - than - average hearts A study of top rowers has found how a naturally - produced hormone can actually make their hearts bigger and more powerful .
Italian scientists measured the hormone IGF - 1 in 38 people , half of them rowers .
The journal Clinical Endocrinology reports rowers had higher hormone levels and larger hearts , both in terms of size and ability to pump blood .
A UK researcher said IGF - 1 might be abused by future athletes .
People do have different levels of IGF - 1 naturally , although elite athletes do tend to have higher levels
Professor Peter Sonksen
St Thomas ' Hospital London Increases in the level of IGF - 1 , which stands for " insulin - like growth factor " can follow increases in the level of human growth hormone , a chemical which has figured in past doping scandals .
The hormone has been linked with the body 's ability to trigger muscle strengthening , but this study looks specifically at how it might affect the heart .
The researchers from the Universities of Milan and Naples , used a battery of tests and measurements to look precisely at the structure and function of the rowers ' hearts .
Compared with the " control " volunteers , they had larger chambers , and thicker muscle walls .
These measurements increased in line with increases in the amount of IGF - 1 in their blood sample .
The rowers also had a far lower resting heart rate compared with the others .
Dr Giovanni Vitale , who led the study , said : " Our results show both the left and right sides of the rowers ' hearts are larger , and function at an enhanced capacity compared with those of controls .
" The causes of this are not completely clear - it could be due to the production of growth factors , such as IGF - 1 , during training . "
Test hope Professor Peter Sonksen , a professor in endocrinology from St Thomas ' Hospital in London , has been asked by the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate the possibility of a test for IGF - 1 abuse in athletes .
He said that it would be difficult to detect artificially - heightened levels of the hormone .
He said : " People do have different levels of IGF - 1 naturally , although elite athletes do tend to have higher levels .
" You can be born with higher levels , and then training can increase those further . "

What are these ?
Remember a little more than a year ago when George Steinbrenner , inflated with patriotic fervor , imposed a laughable rule that instructed security officials to ban anyone from " excessive movement " during the 7th inning rendition of " God Bless America . "
Granted , most New Yorkers seemingly abide by it , but sometimes the system must be tested by one man 's agnosticism and patriotic indifference .
Oh , and he had to piss .
Meet Bradford Campeau - Laurion , a 29 - year - old man from Astoria , Queens , and a director of web production for a " major website " who made the unfortunate decision to blatantly disregard " God Bless America " and hit the head .
He was dealt with swiftly and aggressively by Steinbrenner 's Red , White , And Blue Muscle .
I left a message with Yankees media relations for their comments on this , but it 's probably safe to assume that they 'll only react to this if Brad here makes a colossal stink over it .
Brad 's detailed , irate , email is after the jump .
Deadspin Editors , I attempted to get up to use the restroom , rather urgently , during the 7th inning stretch as God Bless America was beginning .
As I attempted to walk down the aisle and exit my section into the tunnel , I was stopped by a police officer .
He informed me that I had to wait until the song was over .
I responded that I had to use the restroom and that I did not care about God Bless America .
As soon as the latter came out of my mouth , my right arm was twisted violenty behind my back and I was informed that I was being escorted out of the stadium .
A second officer then joined in and twisted my left arm , also in an excessively forceful manner , behind my back .
I informed them they were violating my First Amendment rights and that I had done nothing wrong , with no response from them .
I was sitting in the Tier Level , and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and I was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium .
About halfway down , I informed them that they were hurting me , repeated that I had done nothing wrong , and that I was not resisting nor talking back to them .
One of them said something to the effect that if I continued to speak , he would find a way to hurt me more .
When we reached the exit of the stadium , they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles , saying " Get the hell out of my country if you do n't like it . "
Nowhere on the Yankee Stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game .
Nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible .
Furthermore , when the two officers returned to their section , Steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say " We got to watch ourselves .
One day we 're really gonna get in trouble . "
They were also spreading rumors with a fan with whom they were friendly that I had said " This country sucks . "
I do not believe in God , nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism .
The fact that I wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through God Bless America should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game .
I spoke with Brad on the phone and he seems like a reasonable enough man , albeit one with a little bit of an anarchist bent ( and , yes , he 's a Red Sox fan ) but he did n't sound like the type of guy to either embellish the incident in his favor or make it up .
We had a quick e-mail q-and - a just to clarify a few things :
DS : Did you feel like you had gave security more reason than normal to act aggressively toward you ?
No , I did not .
Regardless of what I said , I did not act in a threatening manner , nor step toward the officer in a threatening manner .
I just made my statement and attempted to continue to walk into the tunnel toward the restroom .
I was given no opportunity to explain myself further , nor any explanation from the officer before my arm was being pinned behind my back .
DS : Were you aware of the " no movement " policy before you attempted to go to the bathroom ?
I was not aware .
People did not seem to be moving at the time , but I thought it was more a function of the fact that a lot of people at the stadium are rabid patriots rather than an actual policy .
DS : How many Yankees games have you attended and have you ever gotten up to go to the bathroom before ?
I have probably attended an average of 8 - 10 Yankee games per year over the last 8 years .
I have used the restroom countless times , though I do not recall ever trying to do so at the exact moment I did last night .
DS : Are you planning on suing Yankee stadium or do you just want them to eliminate the stupid policy ?
I have contacted Normal Siegel ( public advocate - http://normansiegel.com/) and the New York chapter of the ACLU .
I have not discussed my options with them and I do n't know my long term plans at this time .
I want people to be aware of the forced patriotism that is happening here , a clear violation of First Amendment rights and something that should be kept wholly separate from attending a baseball game .
To my knowledge , Yankee Stadium is the only stadium in the major leagues with this policy , let alone still playing God Bless America in the 7th inning stretch .
UPDATE : So , where did you end up going to the bathroom ?
Ended up just getting on the train and holding it until I got to my girlfriend 's place on 90th and Lex .
Probably about another 45 minutes .

Dr Michael DeBakey , the pioneering heart surgeon who gained fame for his procedures developing bypass surgery , has died at the age of 99 .
The surgeon died on Friday night from natural causes at Houston 's Methodist Hospital , officials said .
When he underwent surgery two years ago for a damaged aorta , his treatment used a procedure he had developed .
Dr DeBakey 's patient list included a number of world leaders and international celebrities .
" Dr DeBakey 's reputation brought many people into this institution , and he treated them all : heads of state , entertainers , businessmen and presidents , as well as people with no titles and no means , " said Ron Girotto , president of the Methodist Hospital System .
" He has improved the human condition and touched the lives of generations to come . "
A pioneer in the development of artificial hearts and heart pumps to assist patients waiting for transplants , Dr DeBakey helped to design dozens of surgical instruments , including the roller pump , part of the heart - lung machine that made open - heart surgery possible .
He was also credited with turning Baylor College of Medicine in Houston into a nationally renowned medical centre .
M y invitation to a preview screening next week of Death Race reads like a fire sale for a bankrupt electronics shop .
It lists everything that must go from the theatre : " No cameras , camera phones , laptops or other recording devices permitted . "
I can't recall ever seeing such detailed instructions about what we can't bring with us to the multiplex .
Did you ever think you 'd have to be told not to use a computer while watching a movie ?
Or not to take a picture of the screen with your phone ?
It 's like being told you should n't attempt to cook while driving .
But I must admit , I have actually seen people typing away on laptops during screenings .
Most recently at the Cannes Film Festival in May , during the world premiere of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .
The geek hordes are so eager to " live blog " their reactions to entertainment events , they do n't care who they disturb .
Not that long ago , before the widespread availability of the cellphone , it would have been unthinkable for people to have a conversation with someone who was n't in the theatre with them .
And yet all of us have sat next to idiots who jabbered away with some unseen third party , which somehow is even more annoying than if they were talking to the person next to them .
I 've also been in American theatres where it is sadly deemed necessary to post signs forbidding weapons .
We live in an age when personal entitlement trumps public civility , and where common sense is scarcer than honest politicians .
The barbarians are not only at the gates ; they 've marched past the candy counter and breached the auditorium .
This leads me to believe that the rules of engagement for movie - going need to be restated for the 21st century .
Here is my list of other " don'ts " for moviegoers , followed with one major " do . "
Do n't ever use your phone in a movie theatre , unless the projection has n't yet begun or you 're a heart surgeon in the middle of a major operation – in which case , why are n't you at the hospital ?
Do n't write the Great Canadian Novel on your BlackBerry during movies , unless you 're in the very back row where the glowing screen wo n't bother anybody .
But that could infuriate romantic couples .
Do n't take critters to movie theatres , even if they are leashed or huge fans of Adam Sandler .
This goes double for farm animals .
Horses have a lot of trouble with subtitles , pigs forage noisily with their popcorn and cows have a tendency to moo a lot during chase scenes .
Do n't take photocopiers , paper shredders or other office equipment with you to the theatre .
This is not the time to be catching up on work , even if you have managed to snag an entire row for your company 's board of directors .
Do n't take a wood chipper to a screening of Fargo , even if you can do a really good impersonation of Marge Gunderson .
It will likely terrify the person next to you and besides , the moron who took a real chain saw to a showing of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has already beaten you to this bad idea .
Do n't serve 12 - course meals during screenings , even if you have an obliging butler willing to offer French service .
You might spill the soup course on the person in front of you , and it 's very hard in the dark to know which is the proper fork to use .
And finally , do n't take a sense of entitlement with you to the theatre .
Do take pleasure in respectfully sharing with others one of the best experiences you can have in the dark .

Denver –
They ’re outside city offices , in parks , on the capitol steps and near the US Mint .
But the one place most protesters here are avoiding is the official demonstration zone , a fenced - in parking lot near the Democratic National Convention that activists here mockingly call “ the freedom cage . ”
The 47,000 - square - foot zone is hemmed by rows of metal barricades and concrete barriers and watched over by uniformed Secret Service agents .
Views of the Pepsi Center convention site , some 700 feet away , are blocked by a giant tent housing news media .
On Monday afternoon , a couple hours after the convention kicked off , the zone was an asphalt desert .
A microphone stood on a lonely stand .
A Canadian documentary crew waited for protesters who never came .
An official sign - up sheet near a low - rise platform was a study in sarcasm .
Requesting the 7 a.m. slot was one “ G. Washington , ” who listed his cause as “ You ca n’t cage freedom . ”
At 11:30 p.m. , “ B. Obama . ” Topic : “ Hope for Cages . ”
“ It ’s so far away , it ’s surrounded by cops , it ’s just ridiculous , ” said William Aanstoos , a college dropout from Asheville , N.C. , with a yellow bandana around his neck who came to see the site after taking part in antiwar rallies elsewhere in the city .
“ I do n’t think anyone is taking it seriously . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union and several protest groups sued Denver and the Secret Service over the zone earlier this summer and lost .
A federal judge ruled that the zone did n’t infringe on free speech because convention delegates would pass within 200 feet on their walk into the Pepsi Center , and no trees or other objects would block sight lines to that walkway .
Unlike the “ free speech zone ” at the Democratic convention in Boston in 2004 , where protesters were corraled behind concrete barriers away from the convention site , delegates inside the secure convention perimeter here can walk within eight feet of the protest zone .
The Secret Service says the barricades and large police presence are critical precautions against tossed explosives , car bombs , and other threats to security at the convention , home this week to the stars of the Democratic Party , including two former presidents .
“ The legal requirement is that those expressing their freedom of speech are within reach of the delegates , ” Malcolm Wiley , a Secret Service spokesman at the Denver Joint Information Center , said in a phone interview .
“ The requirement is n’t that you see the building . ”
Even so , most protesters are taking their message elsewhere , many to a constellation of 13 parks within a mile of the Pepsi Center .
One of the most active groups is Recreate 68 , an alliance of anticorporate and antiwar protesters that has demonstration permits every day of the convention .
But rallies and parades have also being staged by groups pitching everything from immigrant rights , women ’s equality , and Ralph Nader to lower fuel costs , legal marijuana , and a united Jerusalem .
Police have so far been underwhelmed .
A parade permitted for 25,000 Sunday drew just 1,000 , according to the city .
A march on Monday was so small that police reopened closed streets .
As of Tuesday night , the city had reported 135 convention - related arrests .
Most occurred Monday night , when police say a crowd of 300 disrupting traffic near Civic Center Park refused requests to disperse and then rushed a police line .
Suspects were charged with disobeying orders , obstructing a public street , and interference , violations of city ordinances .
But most events have been peaceful , officials say .
On Monday afternoon , Bob Kunst , a Miami man who is president of Shalom International , a pro-Israel group , stood outside an entrance to the convention site with a sign that read “ Obama BAD for America and Israel . ”
His group had planned a demonstration that evening in the official protest zone , but after seeing it he had second thoughts .
The site is several blocks from roads accessible to cars , and he worried about whether some of his group ’s elderly supporters would survive the walk .
“ It ’s not fair to hold everyone hostage to a few crazies , ” he griped .
“ They ’re treating everyone like a criminal .
Who are we catering to with this type of paranoia ? ”

For many of us , the internet is a primary source of recreation and a critical part of everyday work .
No matter how you use it , it ’s expected to be there – at all times .
When the connection goes down , sadness quickly fills the room .
It ’s funny just how addicted people are to the internet .
We ’re so hooked that the loss of connectivity seems life altering .
I admit , when I lose connection , my frustration level skyrockets and I feel utterly helpless .
However , it ’s important to remember that it is n’t data running through our veins , it ’s blood .
We do n’t live and die online and there are loads of things we can do to keep busy while the ISP fixes the issue .
So let ’s not whine about it , let ’s put the extra time to good use .
Here are some ideas :
Read ebooks
You surf online , come across a nice ebook , download it and save it in your ebooks folder to come back to it later .
That ‘ later ’ is now .
This is the time to open those PDF files and read them .
If you have liked an ebook in the past , read it again .
I ’m sure you can get some valuable information in this process .
Do n’t have any ebooks ?
Check out Project Gutenberg where you can access thousands of books for free .
Catch up with friends
There ’s no MySpace or Facebook , Google Talk or Yahoo to communicate or chat with your friends .
So what do you do ?
Simple – pick up the phone and call your friend next door with whom you have always found easier to chat on Facebook .
This could be a nice time to meet your friends who stay in the same city .
Read magazines or newspaper thoroughly
Pick up and read that magazine or newspaper that you dismissively flipped through yesterday .
I know it ’s a shock – who has time to read the newspaper when you can get news in a click , right ?
But the conventional way of reading news has its own charm and its own importance too .
And yes , it ’s always offline too 🙂
Clean your computer
The perfect time to unplug those cords from behind the computer tower , open the tower and start cleaning the heaps of dust that have accumulated over the past few weeks .
Also you can clean and organize your entire desk and give it a new look .
Defragment your PC
Right time for windows users or in fact any computer user to do some offline maintenance work .
One of them could be a disk cleanup and defragment .
This process could take time , sometimes hours to get completed .
But it ’s one of the essential ways to maintain your computer .
You could also try out other steps like going through the list of installed programs and getting rid of the unwanted ones .
Go for a run
You do n’t need to sit with your eyes fixed on your computer when you are running the defrag or disk cleanup .
Unless it ’s bad weather outside , get your shoes on and go for a run .
Kill two birds with one stone 🙂
Play a game … not a computer game
Good time to complete that unfinished chess game with your younger brother .
You could also go out and join those teens for some basketball , tennis or a badminton knock .
Good time to complete that unfinished chess game with your younger brother .
You could also go out and join those teens for some basketball , tennis or a badminton knock .
Write ( or draw ) something
This time with pen and on paper .
Write an article , write your thoughts , write a dream , write anything .
It ’ll feel different and nice to use the mighty pen , again .
It gives a different feeling , a feeling which your keyboard could never give .
And if you are good at art , this is a great time to sit and draw something really nice .
Get involved in creative pursuits
Get back to your once upon a time favorite but now neglected and dejected hobbies .
If you like painting , do it now .
If you love cooking , great time to cook your favorite recipe .
So get involved in your creative pursuits or simply , what you ‘ liked ‘ to do before this internet thing overtook and overpowered you . 🙂
Complete pending chores
You could please your Mom or your wife by telling her that you are available to get the groceries or do some other household chores .
You might hate doing it but it could have good returns for you later in the day , in the form of delicious food … or something else . 😉
On another note , this is also a good time to complete pending work like getting your car serviced or doing some repair work .
Meditate
Finally , if you are too frustrated and just ca n’t seem to do anything else , sit back , relax , take deep breaths and meditate .
You may not find enlightenment like Buddha but you ’ll feel better for sure 🙂
Cheers ,
Abhijeet

( CNN ) --
Seven members of a joint United Nations - African Union peacekeeping patrol have been killed by a heavily armed militia group in Sudan 's Darfur region , the U.N. said .
Peacekeepers drive into a Sudanese refugee camp near Farchana , east of Chad .
Five of those killed were Rwandan , a U.N. peacekeeping official said , and the other two were a Ugandan and a Ghanaian .
Twenty - two others were wounded in the attack , which was immediately condemned by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
" The attackers used heavy weapons and engaged the UNAMID convoy in an exchange of fire for more than two hours , " according to the statement released by Ban 's spokesman .
UNAMID is the acronym for the U.N. - AU mission in Darfur .
The peacekeepers are allowed to used force when fired upon directly .
" The secretary - general condemns in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable act of extreme violence against AU - U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur and calls on the government of Sudan to do its utmost to ensure that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice , " the statement said .
" The secretary - general expresses his deepest condolences to the families of the peacekeepers who lost their lives , and reiterates his appreciation for their service , valor and commitment to the search for peace in Darfur . "
The ambush happened around 2:45 p.m. ( 1145 GMT ) in northern Darfur .
The rescue mission did not take place until after dark , she said .
The peacekeepers who were attacked operated out of Shangil Tobayi -- a base to the west of El Fasher .
In five years of war the U.N. says more than four million people have been affected : Two - and - a - half million people forced from their homes and more than 300,000 killed .
Sudanese officials dispute those numbers claiming only 10,000 have died -- a number they say is normal for five years of war .
U.S. President George W. Bush calls the killings genocide and has put sanctions on Sudan .
The U.N. says Sudan 's government is guilty of crimes against humanity and of violating international human rights laws every bit as heinous and serious they say as genocide .
In February 2008 , a fresh wave of killing forced 58,000 people to flee their homes as government troops and Janjaweed militiamen retaliated against rebels .
A U.N. report said Sudan broke international law as 115 innocent civilians were killed using tactics similar to those employed in 2003 , 2004 , the worst years of the war .
Peacekeepers are frequently targeted by militias in Darfur , where they are trying to protect civilians from " janjaweed " militias -- nomadic Arab militias , supported by Sudan 's government , which target pastoral black Africans .
Ten African Union peacekeepers were killed in October in an ambush on their peacekeeping base -- the deadliest single attack on AU peacekeepers since they began their mission in late 2004 .

Rape is a way of life for Darfur 's women
Rape is a way of life for Darfur 's women Sudan cuts ties with Chad after attack
A U.N. commission concluded in 2005 that the Sudanese government and militias " conducted indiscriminate attacks , including killing of civilians , torture , enforced disappearances , destruction of villages , rape and other forms of sexual violence , pillaging and forced displacement " in Darfur .
In 2006 , the U.N. Security Council authorized the creation of the joint AU / U.N. hybrid force of peacekeepers to protect civilians in Darfur .
That hybrid force formally took over peacekeeping duties late last year from the force composed solely of members of the African Union .
Yet the force is under - manned as a result of the Sudanese government 's opposition to a U.N. presence , with just over 9,500 troops of an authorized strength of 26,000 .

New Hampshire State Government Ranked Last in the Nation
I have been bitching about the state of New Hampshire politics here for just over a year now , and it seems as though the country is now beginning to see how far New Hampshire has fallen .
New Hampshire is ranked last in the nation when it comes to the way state government is run .
New Hampshire ’s government is considered the least efficient .
Needless to say liberal , irresponsible , tax and spend Governor John Lynch ( Democrat ) takes offense to this study .
“ We ’re the most livable state .
We ’re the most business friendly state , and I think we ’re the envy of other states .
We are for a reason , and part of that is the way state government operates , ” said Democratic Gov. John Lynch .
“ I ’m offended that some out - of - state group would criticize our system of government , ” he said .
Well Governor Lynch , I am offended at the way you have spent us into bankruptcy and the way you have passed nanny state regulations that treat adults like children .
I am offended by the way you have stripped away the rights of the parents to raise their children .
Now not only are residents of the state noticing , but so is the rest of the country .
You have turned New Hampshire into a laughingstock , I hope you are happy .
the Granite State earned a C - minus for how it handles money , D for managing and retaining qualified employees , and D - plus for both its long - range planning and infrastructure improvement , and for program accountability .
A C-minus for how we handle money seems very generous considering John Lynch turned a budget surplus into a projected $ 150 million deficit in two years .
As far as accountability goes , since when does a liberal believe that anybody should be held accountable for anything ?
Governor John Lynch and his liberal cronies need to be removed before it is too late .
I have always been proud of my state , and I hate to lose the New Hampshire way of life and that is why it is so important for Republicans to find a strong opponent in November .
This study is embarrassingly true in my opinion .
I have written before that I think it is alright for me to attack the way New Hampshire is being run because I live here , but that I would defend my state from out - of - staters who decide to bash New Hampshire , and I was going to use some of this post to do just that .
But I can’t .
I am disgusted by the turn New Hampshire has taken and I am glad that it is being recognised by national groups .
If this does n’t start to wake up New Hampshire residents than nothing will .
Tonight I hang my head in shame at the embarrassment that New Hampshire has become , but I still hope that come November New Hampshire voters will shake up the political landscape and rid ourselves of this “ Blue Plague ” that has reeked so much havoc on the state in so short of a period of time .
Ausländische Medienberichte wecken in China große Aufmerksamkeit bis zu übertriebenen Reaktionen .
Während der Eröffnungsveranstaltung der Olympischen Spiele in Peking , strömten über 20.000 internationale Medienfachleute aus der ganzen Welt ins Stadion .
Dies ist das erste Mal in der Geschichte Chinas , dass sich das Regime einem solchen Ausmaß an Journalisten und Interviewwünschen gegenüber sieht .
Die japanische Sankei Shimbun ( eine überregionale Tageszeitung ) sieht „ äußerst abnorme und übertriebene Reaktionen “ beim Umgang der Kommunistischen Partei Chinas ( KPCh ) mit den internationalen Medien .
In ihrem Bericht stand , was ein hochqualifizierter Journalist einer rennomierten englischen Nachrichtenagentur überrascht zum Ausdruck brachte : „ Ich bemerkte nur , dass die Restaurants im Pressezentrum der Olympischen Spiele zu teuer sind .
Am nächsten Tag wurden die Preise bereits herunter gesetzt . “
Wachdienst vor den Toiletten
Eine Journalistin aus den USA sagte : „ Die KPCh hat sich sehr viel Mühe gegeben , was die Lebensumgebung der Journalisten betrifft .
Aber die Zentralbehörde propagiert unaufhörlich , dass wir lobende Berichte über ihr Land schreiben sollten .
Das nervt !
Ich bin eine Sportjournalistin und habe kein Interesse an den Ergebnissen über die Reform der KPCh . “
Ein französischer Journalist sagte : „ Was mich am meisten überraschte , ist , dass es so viele freiwillige Mitarbeiter im Pressezentrum gibt .
Sogar vor den Toiletten standen Wachmänner .
Egal wo man sich befindet , es gibt einem den Eindruck , dass man stets überwacht und beobachtet wird . “

Gesicht wahren
Wann immer europäische oder amerikanische Medien über die Bauern und Arbeiter , über die Menschenrechte oder die Luftverschmutzung berichten , schreiben Medien der KPCh lange detaillierte Berichte , um jeden einzelnen Vorwurf zu bestreiten .
Um nichts dem Zufall zu überlassen , haben Chinas Regierung und das IOC einen eigenen PR - Film produziert und alle TV - Anstalten , die Olympia - Rechte gekauft haben , verpflichtet , ihn auszustrahlen .
Die ARD hat den Film in gekürzter und bearbeiteter Fassung im Digitalprogramm Eins Festival ausgestrahlt – mit dem Hinweis : „ Die nachfolgende Produktion des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees strahlt die ARD neben einer Vielzahl von eigenproduzierten Dokumentationen im Rahmen ihrer Berichterstattung von den Olympischen Sommerspielen 2008 in China aus . “
Kein Wort von Menschenrechten , sozialen oder Umwelt - Problemen trübt diesen Beitrag .

Tatsache ist jedoch , dass Peking vorgestern in einem nebligen Dunst lag .
Man konnte nicht weiter als ein bis zwei Kilometer sehen .
Der australische Vorsitzende des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees ( IOC ) , Phil Coles , kritisierte am Smog über Peking , dass er der Umwelt dauerhaften Schaden zufüge .
Außerdem wirft er KPCh vor , dass man sich betreffend Umweltverschmutzung zu wenig bemüht habe .
Zum Thema Smog , der seit Tagen über der Stadt liegt , wurde das IOC gezwungen , eine Pressekonferenz einzuberufen , um eine Erklärung diesbezüglich abzugeben .
Der Leiter der Wetterstation in Peking , Hu Guo , äußerte : „ Schlechte Sicht bedeutet nicht zugleich eine schlechte Qualität der Luft .
Aus der Sicht der Meteorologie , befindet sich Peking in diesen Tagen im Dunstschleier . “ ( cy/rl )
WISE , Va. | Doug Sproles , a resident of this far southwest corner of Virginia , describes basic heath care as going to a doctor , running up a bill he struggles to pay , then living with bad credit .
His story was similar to those of the thousands who came this weekend to the Wise County fairgrounds seeking free medical , dental or vision care from the Remote Area Medical Volunteer Corps ( RAM ) .
Mr. Wise , 32 , who is unemployed , arrived at the fairground ’s grassy parking lot Thursday afternoon with a tent , cooler and toothache .
He did n’t want to miss getting a free root canal when the gates opened at 6 a.m. Friday .
Many residents in this region , compared with Virginia as a whole , have a higher incidence of death from cancer , diabetes , heart disease , pulmonary disease and suicide , according to state Health Department statistics .
Only 1,500 patients a day are admitted on the county fairgrounds , a number reached about an hour after the gates opened Friday morning .
Hundreds were turned away ; volunteers advised them to return Saturday morning .
“ We heard it was going to be crowded , and this is the worst number I ’ve got in the past three years , ” Mr. Sproles , of Abingdon , Va. , said while smoking a cigarette and holding a ticket marking him as patient No. 128 .
“ I ’ll just make the best of it . ”
More than 8,400 procedures were performed last year , and organizers predicted more this year .
The 2 1/2 - day clinic is the largest in the county by Knoxville , Tenn . - based RAM , said volunteer coordinator Jean Brady Jolly .
The organization stages one or two clinics a month , but most serve 500 to 800 people and focus on dental and vision services .
Services offered this weekend included treatments for high blood pressure , heart disease and mental health .
In addition , there were colon- , cervical - and breast - cancer screenings .
About two hours after the gates opened Friday , 845 volunteers were busy doing everything from drilling teeth and listening to hearts to passing out coffee and doughnuts .
The number of pre-registered volunteers was 1,645 - about 350 more than last year .
More were expected before the event closes at noon Sunday .
The volunteers - including doctors , dentists , nurses and pharmacists - came from such organizations as the Health Wagon , the Lions Club of Virginia , the University of Appalachia College of Pharmacy , Virginia Commonwealth University , the Virginia Dental Association and the University of Virginia Health System .
Procedures were done in tents and barns , where sheets were drawn across former horse stalls to create examination rooms .
Most of the patients came for dental and vision care , including Joyce Waddell , 64 , from Hiltons , Tenn , who needed five teeth extracted .
“ I ’m in a lot of pain , and I ca n’t chew my food because my teeth hurt so bad , ” she said .
“ Swallowing food whole is causing me all types of stomach problems , and I ’ve been vomiting violently and fainting . ”
Mrs. Waddell said she mostly lives out of her Ford van and sees a dentist only when she can afford it .
She ’s hoping her situation improves when she turns 65 and becomes eligible for Medicare .
The majority of attendees were adults who either are not covered by Medicaid or do not receive dental care through Medicaid .
Because of funding , Medicaid does not cover non-health - related dental care such as cleanings and fillings , said Patrick W. Finnerty , state director of Medicaid .
Mr. Finnerty manned the dental station over the weekend , directing eager patients to triage chairs , where dentists examined mouths and performed free cleanings , extractions or restoration work .
“ It ’s hard to come to one of these [ events ] and not be changed , ” he said .
“ It ’s by far the most challenging and rewarding job . ”
Organizers said Virginia Commonwealth
University dental students can use for course work just 10 percent to 20 percent of the teeth extracted because the remainder have too many cavities .
Dr. Roger Wood , a pediatric dentist in Richmond who helped bring the event to Wise Countymade his ninth trip this weekend to the remote coal county .
“ It ’s the feedback that keeps me coming back , ” he said .
“ At your office , you do n’t usually get hugs and personal satisfaction that you get here . ”
While most patients came because of their physical pain , others took full advantage of the services , including the free mammograms and colon screenings .
“ I just found out that I could get women ’s health tests for free in my area , ” said Dianna Hines , while she waited for new glasses .
“ I let these things go neglected because I ca n’t afford them , but they ’re things that could hurt me . ”
Mrs. Hines , 50 , said she could barely keep up with high gas and food prices , much less insurance or doctor visits .
One in seven Virginians are without health care , a problem the state legislature takes up every year .
Beyond providing immediate medical care , the RAM events also have prompted state lawmakers to allocate more money to the Health Wagon ’s budget , to free clinics in Southwest Virginia and to health - education programs .
RAM was organized to serve Guyana , but now 60 percent of its clinics are domestic .
Most are in Tennessee because many states have laws that restrict access to out - of - state doctors .
Most of the cars packing the fairground lot had Virginia or Tennessee tags , with a few from Kentucky and North Carolina .
“ It gets me in a greater sense of urgency , every time I come here , of the things I want to push when I look at the budget in September , ” said Gov. Tim Kaine , a Democrat .

June is Bustin’ Oil All Over !
Michael Foxemail : TheCulturedEconomist@yahoo.com June 18 , 2008
According to Rep Peter DeFazio ( D - Or ) , the entity that owns the most oil in the United States right now is not ExxonMobil or Chevron or Valero : it ’s Morgan Stanley .
So what ’s Morgan Stanley doing with all that oil ?
Speculating on the petrofraud bonanza .
The problems with the short - sightedness of this utterly stupid investment pattern are many :
1 . The faster they ratchet up the cost of oil , and , in turn , the gasoline that comes from it , the faster the public will change its patterns of consumption , the demand will go down , and the bottom will fall out of the market .
That is the most logical supply - and - demand scenario , which ends in Morgan Stanley left holding billions of dollars of lost equity on the oil futures contracts .
Note that Ford , GM . and Toyota – so far – have shuttered factories building large SUVs and trucks ( the behemoth Toyota Tundra got axed today ) , thus , even the opportunity to continue buying these gas guzzlers has begun to be eliminated .
GM has already hybridized the most ostentatious gas sucker of them all – the Cadillac Escalade – thus more than doubling the city mileage of that vehicle .
2 . There is no reason for oil prices to be what they are , because there is no shortage .
If there were a shortage , there would be rationing and / or gas lines .
We have been through genuine shortages , most recently in 1979 .
In 1979 , the price of gasoline increased from 69¢ / gallon to 99¢ / gallon , while an OPEC embargo was keeping the flow to a trickle .
That was an increase of 43 % .
With no embargo , why has gasoline gone up over 100 % in the past year ( it is roughly $ 5 / gallon in Los Angeles today , and was less than $ 2.50 / gallon a year ago ) ?
3 . The curves of a bubble are predictable , and this one , as was discussed here last month in Blowing Bubbles , is following in the pattern of several previous bubbles .
Only this bubble , according to the economists at Bloomberg happens to be exceeding the curve of the dot.com bubble , which , when it burst , caused a loss of SIX TRILLION DOLLARS .
Let me repeat .
This bubble exceeds that one .
4. The “ Enron Exemption ” , part of a commodities trading legislation written by former Senator Phil Gramm ( now John McCain ’s economics advisor ) , has enabled the kind of under - regulated commodities trading that is still happening in energy markets .
Enron was a private company engaging in capitalism without ethics ( remember those ? ) ; the devastation was limited to the energy consumers in California ( 38 million people ) who had to empty their wallets to cool their homes during a blistering hot summer , and , ultimately , investors , employees and the auditing firm that oversaw the criminality .
The present oil bubble is dearly costing every driver in North America , Europe and Asia , and will , upon bursting take down Morgan Stanley and several other large investment companies that are deeply invested in oil futures , and with them , millions of investors .
5 . The Oil Ministers of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and even the President of Iran have all said that there is no reason for the present trading price of oil .
Well , they do n’t get paid that price for most of the oil that is pumped from their soil ( they are paid a fractional royalty ) , but they are , of course , making vulgar amounts of money from this bubble .
They clearly , however , can see that the end result will be the reduction of demand , and after the inevitable price decline , they will suffer long - term .
6 . As certain as I am about the forthcoming collapse of this bubble , is how certain I am that the price of gasoline will plummet after Labor Day ( Sept. 1 ) .
The powers - that - be will want you to have forgotten the “ pain at the pump ” by Election Day .
But you wo n’t forget .
How could you ?
If you have any retirement savings or oil stocks , you will be broke .
If you have a gas guzzling car it will have no resale value .
And while the Fed may bail out still more investment houses ( thus further devaluating the dollar ) they will not bail you out .
You wo n’t get a dime back .

The phenomenon of total solar eclipse will occur on August 1st , 2008 at 6:09 pm China time on the territory close to the windswept high grasslands located northeast of a small village called Yiwu .
The total solar eclipse is going to be captured by a team of Exploratorium and heliophysics experts from NASA , who will broadcast the event from a specially chosen international location .
Anyone will be able to watch the total eclipse : whether from a planetarium , museum of simply from a computer .
On the territory of Russian Federation , the eclipse will take place in Siberia and will have a width of nearly 250 km .
It will cross the territory of Western Siberia from north to south .
Afterwards the total eclipse will pass through Altai Mountains .
It would be interesting to note that the next total solar eclipse will take place in 2017 over the territory of North America .
In 2026 Europe will be the " host " of a total eclipse and four year later Russia will be the territory where a total solar eclipse could be viewed .

The recent medical controversy over whether vaccinations cause autism reveals a habit of human cognition — thinking anecdotally comes naturally , whereas thinking scientifically does not .
On the one side are scientists who have been unable to find any causal link between the symptoms of autism and the vaccine preservative thimerosal , which in the body breaks down into ethylmercury , the culprit du jour for autism ’s cause .
On the other side are parents who noticed that shortly after having their children vaccinated autistic symptoms began to appear .
These anecdotal associations are so powerful that they cause people to ignore contrary evidence : ethylmercury is expelled from the body quickly ( unlike its chemical cousin methylmercury ) and therefore cannot accumulate in the brain long enough to cause damage .
And in any case , autism continues to be diagnosed in children born after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines in 1999 ; today trace amounts exist in only a few .
The reason for this cognitive disconnect is that we have evolved brains that pay attention to anecdotes because false positives ( believing there is a connection between A and B when there is not ) are usually harmless , whereas false negatives ( believing there is no connection between A and B when there is ) may take you out of the gene pool .
Our brains are belief engines that employ association learning to seek and find patterns .
Superstition and belief in magic are millions of years old , whereas science , with its methods of controlling for intervening variables to circumvent false positives , is only a few hundred years old .
So it is that any medical huckster promising that A will cure B has only to advertise a handful of successful anecdotes in the form of testimonials .
Take wheatgrass juice ... if you can stomach it .
The claims for its curative powers are bottomless .
According to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database ( the “ bible ” of natural medicines : www.naturaldatabase.com), wheatgrass is “ used therapeutically for increasing hemoglobin production , improving blood sugar disorders such as diabetes , preventing tooth decay , improving wound healing , and preventing bacterial infections . ”
And that ’s not all .
“ It is also used orally for common cold , cough and bronchitis , fever and colds , inflammation of mouth and pharynx , tendency to infection , gout , liver disorders , ulcerative colitis , cancer , rheumatic pain , and chronic skin problems . ”
The alleged salubrious effects of wheatgrass were promoted in the 1940s by a Lithuanian immigrant to Boston named Ann Wigmore , a holistic health practitioner who was inspired by the biblical story of King Nebuchadnezzar , recounted in Daniel 4:33 , in which “ he was driven from men , and did eat grass as oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , till his hairs were grown like eagles ’ feathers , and his nails like birds ’ claws . ”
Wigmore also noted that dogs and cats eat grass when they are ill and feel better after regurgitation , which gave her the idea of the wheatgrass detox .
Because we have fewer stomachs than cows do , she hatched the idea of blending freshly cut wheatgrass into juice form for easier digestion — through either orifice — a practice still employed today .
She believed that the enzymes and chlorophyll in wheatgrass constitute its healing powers .
According to William T. Jarvis , a retired professor of public health at the Loma Linda University School of Medicine and founder of the National Council against Health Fraud ( www.ncahf.org), this is all baloney : “ Enzymes are complex protein molecules produced by living organisms exclusively for their own use in promoting chemical reactions .
Orally ingested enzymes are digested in the stomach and have no enzymatic activity in the eater . ”
Jarvis adds ,
“ The fact that grass - eating animals are not spared from cancer , despite their large intake of fresh chlorophyll , seems to have been lost on Wigmore .
In fact , chlorophyll cannot ‘ detoxify the body ’ because it is not absorbed . ”
I tried wheatgrass juice at the Oh Happy Days natural food store in Altadena , Calif. , as part of an investigation for the pilot episode of Skeptologists , a series we hope to sell to a television network ( where another biblical phrase is apropos : “ Many are called , but few are chosen ” ) .
My co-stars — Kirsten Sanford , who has a Ph.D. in physiology and is now a science journalist , and Steven Novella , director of general neurology at the Yale School of Medicine — also imbibed .
If a picture is worth a thousand words , I will double this essay ’s length by sharing the above snapshot .

NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Rhino numbers in Africa have reached record levels but one sub -species confined to a remote and lawless corner of Congo is on the brink of extinction , a leading conservation group warned on Tuesday .
A white rhino is shown in this file image from the Uganda Wildlife Education Centre , October 16 , 2002 .
REUTERS / Patrick Olum
While populations thrive elsewhere , the northern white rhino -- found only in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo ’s ( DRC ) Garamba National Park -- has been hounded by poachers .
The Swiss - based International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) said there were just 30 of them left in April 2003 , and only four confirmed animals as of August 2006 .
“ Worryingly , recent fieldwork has so far failed to find any presence of these four remaining rhinos , ” Martin Brooks , head of its African Rhino Specialist Group , said in a report .
“ Unless animals are found during the intensive surveys that are planned under the direction of the African Parks Foundation , the sub - species may be doomed to extinction . ”
White rhinos are targeted by poachers for their horns , which fetch high prices in Yemen , where they are made into dagger handles , and in the Far East , where they are coveted for their supposed medicinal qualities .
But wildlife protection is almost impossible in the eastern DRC due to militia violence that still haunts the region five years after a war that killed some 4 million people , mostly from hunger and disease .
Authorities there arrested a senior game ranger in March suspected in the slaughter last year of several rare mountain gorillas in Congo ’s oldest national park , Virunga .
And last month , a conservation group said soldiers , rebels and local villagers in Virunga had recently killed 14 elephants in as many days to meet surging Chinese demand for ivory .
In the thick forests of Garamba , further north , the shadowy bands of hunters include heavily - armed guerrillas from northern Uganda ’s Lord ’s Resistance Army .
Elsewhere on the world ’s poorest continent , the news for rhinos was much better , said the IUCN , which produces estimates of wild animal populations that are considered highly authoritative .
Conservation efforts including translocation and the stemming of poaching had boosted overall numbers of white rhinos to 17,480 last year from 14,540 in 2005 , it said .
Numbers of the smaller , more aggressive African black rhino rose to 4,180 from 3,730 , although it is still listed as critically endangered by the IUCN .

Over 25 % of Women will be Raped in their Lives
Not True
Note :
You might not be particularly interested in the true figures for rape , but this section should open your eyes to the sheer scale of the dishonesty of public officials , academics and women 's groups when it comes to this issue and , hence , probably to other issues as well .
The figures from these groups are typically inflated by a factor of around 50 .
Thus , for example , if you are told that they have evidence that indicates 1,000 rapes , the chances are that , in fact , they have evidence for some 20 rapes .
This level of chicanery should open your eyes to just how corrupt are so many of the people who work in these ' respected ' groups .

Advertisement Transatlantic budget carrier Zoom Airlines has suspended all flights and is applying to go into administration .
Thousands of passengers due to fly with Zoom have been told to rebook with other carriers , and to contact credit or debit card issuers about refunds .
Earlier , two of the airline 's jets were held at Glasgow and Cardiff airports .
UK - Canadian Zoom blamed its problems on the " horrendous " price of jet fuel - which had added $ 50 m ( £ 27.3 m ) to annual fuel bills - and the economic slowdown .
' Desperately sorry ' Zoom , which has flown since 2001 , employs 450 staff in Canada and 260 staff in the UK .
It operated flights from London Gatwick , Glasgow , Manchester , Cardiff and Belfast , as well as Paris and Rome .
It is a tragic day for our passengers and staff
Zoom Airlines Analysis : More turbulence ahead ?
And it flew to eight destinations in Canada , New York , San Diego , Fort Lauderdale and Bermuda .
Zoom 's co-founder Hugh Boyle told BBC
News he " did not hold much hope " of finding new investors to salvage the company .
" We are very , very sad and disappointed that we thought we could pull through this very difficult situation , " he said .
" We had some financing in place , but sadly it did n't come quick enough to avert some of the creditors who came in today to seize one of the planes , which resulted in a domino effect of the situation that we 're faced with " .
In a statement , Mr Boyle and his brother John said they " deeply regretted " having to suspend all Zoom operations .
One of the grounded planes had been due to leave Glasgow on Thursday " It is a tragic day for our passengers and staff , " they said .
" We are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights .
" We have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re-financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying . "
We were looking forward to this holiday for ages .
I can't feel any worse than I feel now
Would - be passenger Remo Pacitti
Stranded passengers speak out
They added that hopes of securing a new investment package to ensure future operations had failed , meaning administration procedures had to begin .
Zoom said BA and Virgin Atlantic were offering " special " fares for passengers whose flights had been cancelled .
Trip jeopardy
The announcement came after one of its planes was detained at Glasgow Airport for non-payment of air traffic control charges .
WHAT SHOULD ZOOM AIRLINES ' PASSENGERS DO ?
Any Zoom flight you have booked will not be departing .
If you still wish to travel , Zoom recommends contacting other carriers and lists several on its website
If your flight is part of a package holiday originating from the UK , you may be able to make a claim under the CAA 's Air Travel Organiser 's Licence ( Atol ) scheme .
If you have paid for a Zoom flight , contact your credit card or debit card issuer to see if they can refund your money Source : Zoom Airlines Meanwhile passengers on a flight from Cardiff were told to get off their Zoom plane , which was then impounded .
One of the passengers due to fly from Glasgow to Vancouver said he had been told on Thursday morning that there was a " technical difficulty " with the aircraft , and that the plane would not leave until 11 pm .
" Then at 7 o'clock the British airport authorities started telling us that Zoom Airlines had entered into administration and basically that we could go home , " William Moonie told BBC News .
" This was supposed to be a holiday of a lifetime for my wife and I .
I 've just retired from the fire service after 30 odd years and my wife is 50 this year .
" We were going to have a celebration holiday .
We were supposed to go on a cruise to Alaska and supposed to go to the Rocky Mountains by train . "
He added he was hopeful that , because his flight was part of a package holiday , he may be covered by the CAA 's Air Travel Organiser 's Licence ( Atol ) scheme .
Cutting back A number of other budget long - haul carriers have gone into administration in recent months , including Hong Kong - to - London carrier Oasis and business class transatlantic firms Eos , Maxjet and Silverjet .
They had based their business model on oil prices of about $ 70 or $ 80 .
When it topped $ 140 , Zoom simply could not cope
Simon Calder
Travel editor , The Independent
The rising cost of oil - which topped $ 147 a barrel in July - has led to aviation fuel bills soaring .
" They had based their business model on oil prices of about $ 70 or $ 80 , " said Simon Calder , travel editor of The Independent .
" Once it topped $ 140 they simply could not cope . "
He added that " tens of thousands " of passengers were likely to suffer .
Airline analysts say that with consumers being more cost - conscious , many were cutting back on luxury spending such as travel .

What are these ?
Passengers left stranded by the collapse of the long - haul budget airline Zoom have described how they were forced to pay thousands of pounds for alternative flights .
Thousands of passengers were stranded in Britain and Canada by the collapse of the airline , which grounded all flights on Thursday night .
At least another 40,000 customers with bookings were also affected .
Not all of them will be able to claim compensation .
Zoom , which operated from five UK airports , blamed its financial difficulties on the economic downturn and the rise in oil prices .
Its UK managing director , Jonathan Hinkles , said the firm 's fuel bill had increased by £ 15 m , a rise of about £ 80 - £ 90 on the cost of a return ticket to Canada .
People were stranded at Cardiff , Glasgow and Belfast .
Zoom also flew from Gatwick and Manchester to eight destinations in Canada and a number of locations in the US .
Zoom 's cash crisis became apparent on Wednesday after a flight from Paris was grounded at Calgary airport in Canada .
On Thursday , the Civil Aviation Authority instructed Glasgow airport to detain a flight bound for Halifax , Nova Scotia , over the non-payment of charges .
Hinkles said the collapse was brought about by one of the leasing companies , which owned a Zoom aircraft , taking action to seize the plane .
He told the BBC this " set a chain of events in motion from which it was impossible for us to recover " .
" We have been working on a financing deal for the company for two months and we have been making very good progress with that , " he said .
" We fully expected we would be able to continue flying but the problems that we encountered during the day [ on Thursday ] , however , with a number of aircraft being seized by airports authorities , such as the one in Glasgow , made it very difficult .
Clearly you can't run an airline without aircraft . "
Hinkles said 20,000 people in the UK had bookings with Zoom until the end of 2009 , and a similar number in Canada .
The CAA said the figure was 60,000 and the number of British passengers stranded overseas by Zoom 's collapse was 4,500 .
Passengers were told of the company 's collapse as they waited into the evening .
Aaron Steele , 30 , from Ottawa , was returning from his honeymoon in Scotland .
" We 're travelling from Edinburgh to Ottawa via New York .
It was around £ 1,000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel , " he said .
" We tried to get a flight until 11 pm last night [ Thursday ] then realised we'd have to come back this morning [ Friday ] . "
Xander Forsyth , from Edinburgh , was stuck at Halifax airport , Canada , with more than 200 Zoom passengers .
Their flight to London had been delayed overnight .
They boarded on Thursday , waiting several more hours before being told to get off .
Police were waiting as they filed into the lounge .
No one was allowed to leave and tempers began to flare , with children crying and the heavy security presence causing growing unease .
Forsyth , a graphic designer , said he Googled the word Zoom on his iPhone and found out about the airline 's crisis .
" With a slight fear of being tackled by police , I hopped on the highest counter I could see and shouted out the news , " he said .
Steve Ward , who had been visiting his mother in Halifax , booked business - class tickets back to London on Iceland Air .
They initially wanted to charge extra for each of his three young children , he said , but ultimately let the group travel for C$ 7,000 ( £ 3,650 ) , half the usual one - way rate .
The Mogambo Guru
The Daily Reckoning
August 27 , 2008
It was when “ official government - approved ” inflation figures were released that I really lost it last week , as that particular rate of inflation is now a staggering 5.6 % .
This is – as you can probably tell by the look of panic and terror on my face – Terrible , Terrible News ( TTN ) .
And when you look at what John Williams at shadowstats.com calculates as inflation , according to the time - honored method of actually looking at real prices instead of the “ qualified estimates ” that are used today , you will see that annual inflation in consumer prices is actually running at over 13 % !
Some of the worst in American history !
We ’re freaking doomed !
Anthony Cherniawski of The Practical Investor is not interested in my dour assessment of the situation , and took a look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ( CPI - U ) , which increased a whopping 0.5 % ( non-seasonally adjusted ) in July , which is plenty bad enough for one month , but one ’s tongue tries to hide by jumping down one ’s throat when one learns that it was not a fluke , and that prices are 5.6 % higher than in July 2007 !
5.6 % annual inflation is the best they can wring from admittedly - doctored statistics ?
Yikes !
I ’m screaming my guts out here !
Mr. Cherniawski coolly says that I do n’t know the literal half of it , as “ The alarming part of this report is the acceleration of inflation in the past 3 months .
While the unadjusted rate for the past 12 months was 6.2 % , the 3 - month annualized rate of increase was 11.9 % . ”
Yikes !
We ’re freaking doomed !
The report itself noted , without any hint of alarm , that “ On a seasonally adjusted basis , the CPI - U advanced 0.8 percent in July , following a 1.1 percent increase in June . ”
Yow !
Some of the terrifying specifics were that the energy index rose 4 % , which accounted for “ about half of the overall increase in the all items index . ”
The worse news for people who eat food is that “ the food index rose 0.9 percent in July after rising 0.8 percent in June .
Indexes for five of the six major grocery store food groups rose at least 1.0 percent . ”
In one freaking month !
This is outrageous inflation !
This inflation in food may be why Heraldtribune.com interviewed Vicki Escarra , president and CEO of an outfit called America ’s Second Harvest , which is “ the nation ’s largest food bank network ” , and which is a name that they are soon changing to “ Feeding America ” , which seems oddly apropos , considering that in January , they surveyed their 200 food banks and found that “ demand was up 20 percent over last year . ”
Wow !
What an increase !
“ We ’re seeing more and more people visiting food banks for the first time because they ’ve lost their jobs or they ’re not getting raises ” , she says .
Yikes !
People are reduced to begging for food because they are not getting raises !
Equally alarming is the news from John Williams at shadowstats.com , who says that real inflation in prices , as measured in a subset of the BLS Consumer Price Indexes , the CPI - W , “ jumped to 6.2 % ” .
What makes the CPI - W inflation subset so interesting is that , as Mr. Williams explains , “ The CPI - W is used for making the annual cost - of - living adjustments to Social Security payments ” which would indicate that the federal budget line - item for Social Security , already one of the largest categories in the whole bloated federal budget that is already over $ 3 trillion a year , will be increasing by a theoretical 6.2 % , just by virtue of mandated higher payments !
Then , to make it all worse , the Labor Department reported the latest survey of producer prices for July , the Producer Price Index , which went up by a stunning 1.2 % for the month , where the only saving grace is that it is less than the 1.8 % increase in June !
As Mark Gongloff so pithily explained in his Ahead Of The Tape column of the Wall Street Journal , “ While consumers suffer inflation a the bottom of the pricing pipeline , producers feel it at the top ” , and that producers will be very keen about passing higher costs along to the consumer as quickly as possible , because “ to the extent inflation gets stuck with them , their profits suffer . ”
And since everybody knows the ugliness of profits suffering , I will not go into it , as it usually means that I am going to be fired soon , and I do n’t want to think about that right now , other than to say that “ profits that suffer ” is ugly in the best of times , and it will be Much , Much Uglier ( MMU ) this time , thanks to seemingly - impossible leveraged investment use of every freaking dime , real or imagined , here or in the future .
Okay , I will say one other thing ; if you are not buying gold , silver and oil in a fit of terrified self - preservation , to the exclusion of everything else including back - to - school clothes for your stupid kids that make them look like mental defectives and cost a fortune , then you are almost certainly making the biggest mistake of your life .
Well , maybe the second biggest mistake after deciding to have the damned kids .
Or maybe the third biggest mistake after deciding to get married in the first damned place and then having the damned kids in the second place , but you get the point .

Researchers at Yale School of Medicine have found signs of an apparent connection between bullying , being bullied and suicide in children , according to a new review of studies from 13 countries .
" While there is no definitive evidence that bullying makes kids more likely to kill themselves , now that we see there 's a likely association , we can act on it and try to prevent it , " said review lead author Young - Shin Kim , M.D. , assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine 's Child Study Center .
In the review , Kim and colleague Bennett Leventhal , M.D. , analyzed 37 studies that examined bullying and suicide among children and adolescents .
The studies took place in the United States , Canada , several European countries ( including the United Kingdom and Germany ) , South Korea , Japan and South Africa .
Almost all of the studies found connections between being bullied and suicidal thoughts among children .
Five reported that bullying victims were two to nine times more likely to report suicidal thoughts than other children were .
Not just the victims were in danger : " The perpetrators who are the bullies also have an increased risk for suicidal behaviors , " Kim said .
However , the way the studies were designed made it impossible for researchers to determine conclusively whether bullying leads to suicide , Kim said .
In addition , the authors report that most of the studies failed to take into account the influence of factors like gender , psychiatric problems and a history of suicide attempts .
Kim said her interest in bullying grew several years ago when she visited South Korea and heard several new slang terms referring to bullies and their victims .
The words reflected " an elaborated system of bullying , " she said .
According to international studies , bullying is common and affects anywhere from 9 percent to 54 percent of children .
In the United States , many have blamed bullying for spurring acts of violence , including the Columbine High School massacre .
In the United States , many adults scoff at bullying and say , " Oh , that 's what happens when kids are growing up , " according to Kim , who argues that bullying is serious and causes major problems for children .
Kim is currently studying whether being bullied actually leads to suicide , although she acknowledges it will be difficult for researchers to get a firm grasp on a cause - and - effect relationship .
She said that to confirm a definitive link , researchers would have to rule out the possibility that some unknown factor makes certain children more susceptible to both bullying and suicide .
For now , Kim said , the existing research should encourage adults to pay more attention to bullying and signs of suicidal behavior in children .
" When we see kids who are targets of bullying , we should ask them if they 're thinking about hurting themselves , " she said .
" We should evaluate and prevent these things from happening . "

Newly released files detail early US spy network Associated Press
Published : Thursday August 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Before Julia Child became known to the world as a leading chef , she admitted at least one failing when applying for a job as a spy : impulsiveness .
At 28 as an advertising manager at W&J Sloane furniture store in Beverly Hills , Calif. , Child clashed with new store managers and left her job abruptly .
" I made a tactical error and was out , " she explained in a handwritten note attached to her application to join the Office of Strategic Services , a World War II - era spy agency .
" However , I learned a lot about advertising and wish I had been older and more experienced so that I could have handled the situation , as it was a most interesting position . "
Child was not yet married and was applying for the job under her maiden name , McWilliams , according to previously top - secret records released by the National Archives on Thursday .
She was hired in the summer of 1942 for clerical work with the intelligence agency and later worked directly for OSS Director William Donovan , the personnel records show .
Details about Child 's background and nearly 24,000 other OSS employees are revealed in the newly released documents , withheld from public view as classified records for decades by the CIA .
The 750,000 documents identify the vast spy network managed by the OSS , which later became the CIA .
President Franklin Roosevelt created the OSS , the country 's first centralized intelligence operation .
The OSS files offer details about other agents , including Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg , major league catcher Moe Berg , historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and film actor Sterling Hayden .
Other notables identified in the files include John Hemingway , son of author Ernest Hemingway ; Kermit Roosevelt , son of President Theodore Roosevelt ; and Miles Copeland , father of Stewart Copeland , drummer for the band The Police .
Some of those like Child on the list have been identified previously as having worked for the OSS , but their personnel records never have been available before .
Those records would show why they were hired , jobs they were assigned to and perhaps even missions they pursued while working for the agency .
The release of the OSS personnel files unmasks one of the last secrets from the short - lived wartime intelligence agency , which for the most part was later folded into the CIA after President Truman disbanded it in 1945 .
" I think it 's terrific , " said Elizabeth McIntosh , 93 , a former OSS agent now living in Woodbridge , Va .
" They 've finally , after all these years , they 've gotten the names out .
All of these people had been told never to mention they were with the OSS . "
The CIA long resisted releasing the records .
But a former CIA director , William Casey , himself an OSS veteran , cleared the way for transfer of millions of OSS documents to the National Archives when he took over the spy agency in 1981 .
The personnel files are the latest documents to be made public .
Information about OSS involvement was so guarded that relatives often could not confirm a family member 's work with the group .
Walter Mess , who handled covert OSS operations in Poland and North Africa , said he kept quiet for more than 50 years , only recently telling his wife of 62 years about his OSS activity .
" I was told to keep my mouth shut , " said Mess , now 93 and living in Falls Church , Va .
The files provide new information even for those most familiar with the agency .
Charles Pinck , president of the OSS Society created by former OSS agents and their relatives , said the nearly 24,000 employees included in the archives far exceed previous estimates of 13,000 .
The newly released documents will clarify these and other issues , said William Cunliffe , an archivist who has worked extensively with the OSS records at the National Archives .
" We 're saying the OSS was a lot bigger than they were saying , " he said .

The new del.icio.us plugin is really annoying .
It put icons all over and a new menu I do n't actually want .
I removed what I could and then I emailed them complaining about the lack of an ability to turn stuff off .
Hopefully we get some sort of update to let us get rid of the junk .
Glad to see GreaseMonkey is ready to go and I understand the latest development version of TabMix Plus is pretty solid .
Hopefully the FF3 launch will be pretty seamless .
This is a model of Shanghai as projected for 2020 by Chinese authorities .
At 1,000 square feet , it 's perhaps the biggest model of a city in the world , and - for sure - the best place ever for two grown men to wear their Gamera and Godzilla latex costumes and fight to death .
The gigantic dimensions and the detail shown in the photographs are just mind - blowing .

I lived in Berkeley for 16 years before getting around to stashing my 5 gallons of water and 20 cans of fruit cocktail .
I 'm as ready as can be for the big earthquake we 're all waiting for .
But what I 'm not prepared for - what virtually no Californian is prepared for - is the other Big One : peak oil .
That 's the day when we hit the tipping point , when demand for oil exceeds the supply .
Like it or not , oil fuels the engines of industrialized economies .
In California , we burn through nearly 20 billion gallons of the stuff each year just driving around .
Then there 's the oil we use to grow and transport food and pump water , the oil that fuels planes , trains and cargo ships , and the oil that is embedded in every computer , every inch of asphalt and every bit of plastic .
So imagine my surprise when I learned that oil supplies are running out - and that the federal government is doing nothing to prepare for it .
Speculation regarding the human impact of oil shortages runs the gamut from a deep recession to a second Great Depression to widespread famine and social disintegration .
As an urban dweller with two kids , a 40 - square - foot yard and little ability to keep houseplants alive , much less grow my own food , words like " famine " and Web sites likewww.dieoff.orgtend to hit my panic button .
As the third - largest refiner of crude oil in the United States and home to 206 oil fields , California has more petrol than most states .
But we 're also the third largest consumer of transportation fuels in the world , just behind the United States itself and China , and we import 45 percent of it from abroad .
Energy forecasting is a tricky business .
On one side are those who say that we will never produce more oil than we do right now and should expect supplies to start dwindling rapidly by 2015 at the latest , at which point we 're in deep trouble .
Shell
Oil recently joined their ranks :
In January , its CEO called on the government to initiate a man- on - the - moon intensity project to prepare for the supply - demand gap .
On the other hand , skeptics do n't see peak oil occurring before 2030 , though they agree that the sooner we make the switch to alternative fuels , the better .
Whatever the case , we already feel the effects of a tight oil and natural gas market when we fill up our tanks and pay our PG&E bills .
But it 's hard to predict when exactly the supply crunch will really start mangling the economy - and changing the way we live .
The biggest oil and gas guzzler in the Golden State may surprise you - it 's the food we eat .
California 's 11 million acres of cropland produce more food than any other state :
Half of the nation 's fruits , vegetables and nuts originate here , as do 1 out of every 5 glasses of milk .
But the $ 32 billion - a- year agricultural industry is heavily dependent on fossil fuels , a fact that is just beginning to weigh on the minds of thrifty farmers alarmed by recent spikes in the price of petroleum - based pesticides , fertilizers and diesel fuel .
With a little luck and a big commitment to energy self - sufficiency , California could , theoretically , grow enough food to feed itself - if it stopped exporting its products all over the map , transitioned entirely to organics ( currently a mere 5 percent of our harvest ) , converted its cow manure into bio -gas , and stopped allowing subdivisions to be built on prime farmland .
Those are big ifs , and they 're not even the biggest problem : how to get the food from the Central Valley to the distant population centers .
Despite the threat to our food supply , the issue of peak oil and gas is not on the radar screen of most agricultural policy analysts in Sacramento .
My inquiries to the Department of Food and Agriculture , the Senate Agriculture Committee , the Assembly Agriculture Committee , and the Future of Farming Select Committee yielded variations on the standard response of " huh ? "
The exception was Steve Schaffer , director of the Office of Agriculture and Environmental Stewardship of the Department of Food and Agriculture .
He agrees that peak oil is a critical issue and points to an old ( but still valid ) study showing that the agricultural sector gobbles 5 percent of all oil , natural gas and electricity .
And that 's just the energy needed to grow the food and ship it to first - line processors ; it does n't count the many miles that food will still travel to packagers , distributors , supermarkets and , finally , homes , a journey that averages 1,500 miles .
When you add up all those detours , you 're looking at an industry that Cornell University Professor David Pimentel estimates requires 400 gallons of gas to feed just one of us for a year .
I did a little calculation using Pimental 's 400 - gallon figure :
How much would we Californians , who drive our 20 - mile - per - gallon vehicles an average 11,000 miles a year , have to reduce our driving to free up enough oil to keep us fed ?
Answer : Three - quarters .
Got a bike ?
California 's passage of the Global Warming Solutions
Act of 2006 puts us in the forefront of conservation programs and technological initiatives to find less carbon - producing alternatives to fossil fuels .
But will it all be too little , too late ?
We are measuring the time frames for reducing our carbon footprint in decades , not years , yet oil and gas shortages may be just around the corner .
Part of the reason California is moving slowly to wean itself from fossil fuels is that policymakers , to the extent they are even aware of the peak oil and gas dilemma , seem to think we have far more time than we actually do .
The California Transportation Plan 2025 puts peak oil at midcentury and sets forth a gradual transition toward oil independence .
State planners rely on energy forecasts provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration , forecasts that have proved overly optimistic time and again .
The one very important fuel conservation measure California has tried to implement - raising fuel efficiency standards above federal standards - is still being blocked by the EPA .
If the state 's lawsuit against the EPA is successful , we will save almost 4 billion gallons a year by 2020 .
That sounds like a big number , but in fact it 's only a fifth of our current annual petrol use .
And if we 're going to stay ahead of the peak oil curve , we 'll need to wean ourselves long before 2020 .
Astonishingly , oil conservation no - brainers like lowering the speed limit are nonstarters politically .
One California Senate energy committee staffer actually laughed aloud when I asked him whether restoring the 55 mph speed limit was on the table .
Fortunately , some cities in California have awakened to the reality of peak oil and are not waiting around for the state and federal governments to act .
The Oakland Oil Independence by 2020 Task Force is pushing for the city to electrify its transit system , and is recommending a " back to the future " approach to urban redesign - essentially , a network of densely populated , streetcar - interconnected neighborhoods in which people live , work and shop .
The San Francisco peak oil task force is entertaining similar notions - how to keep the economy afloat , the lights on and the food coming in once we 're on the downside of the peak oil curve .
Even the notoriously car - centric southern half of the state seems to be stirring from its slumber .
" They get it , " says Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook , who has spread the gospel of peak oil to elected officials and urban planners across the nation .
Cook is troubled by the disconnect between what planners know we need to do and what is feasible politically .
" It 's such an incredible challenge , yet it 's so under the radar screen , " Cook says .
" How could the government not be screaming from the mountaintops ? "
SAN FRANCISCO - Internet security researchers have warned that hackers have caught on to a " critical ' ' flaw that lets them control traffic on the internet .
An elite squad of computer industry engineers that laboured in secret to solve the problem released a software " patch ' ' two weeks ago and sought to keep details of the vulnerability hidden for at least a month to give people time to protect computers from attacks .
" We are in a lot of trouble , '' said IOActive security specialist Dan Kaminsky , who stumbled upon the Domain Name System ( DNS ) vulnerability about six months ago and reached out to industry giants to collaborate on a solution .
LONDON  Prime Minister Gordon Brown proposed an overhaul of Britain 's security strategy Wednesday , ranking climate change and disease alongside terrorism as national threats .
The British government had billed the changes as the biggest shift in protocol since the end of the Cold War .
The announcement included no major new policies but seemed designed to refocus Britons ' attentions on security issues nearly three years after bombings on the London transit system that killed 52 passengers .
Terrorism leads the list of threats , Brown said , as Britain still faces upward of 30 possible terrorist plots involving roughly 2,000 people in about 200 terror networks .
" For most of the last half - century the main threat was unmistakable : a Cold War adversary , " Brown said in a speech at the House of Commons .
" Now it comes from loosely affiliated global networks that threaten us and other nations across continents . "
Among his new anti-terrorism proposals : • Making a registry of risks public so Britons are aware of dangers and more easily enlisted in the fight against them .
• Establishing four regional intelligence units to help local police in anti-terrorism activities .
• Inviting academics , military and outside security experts to sit on a national security forum to advise government intelligence committees .
• Creating a 1,000 - member civilian response team that could be dispatched rapidly to failing nations to help bring economic and political stability in areas that could be breeding grounds for terrorists .
The announcement comes amid public opposition to continued British involvement in Iraq and concern over having troops stretched between Iraq and Afghanistan .
A new poll published Monday in The Guardian newspaper indicated that public confidence in Brown 's ruling Labor Party was at a 24 - year low .
Opposition politicians and terrorism analysts praised Brown for recognizing that Britain faced new dangers .
But they complained it was overdue , short on details or simply a rehash of what already was underway .
" It 's a step in the right direction , " said Patrick Mercer , a former army officer and Conservative opposition member of Parliament .
" But we do n't seem to have anything of a strategy here .
We just have a list of threats and a list of what 's already in place . "
Simon Barrett , director of the International Media Intelligence Analysis think tank in London , said Brown 's strategy was short on new actions against the source of the terrorism threat .
" You have got to crack down on Islamic extremism , stop the promotion of hate and keep young British Muslims from becoming radical , " he said .

Brown said he plans to establish regional intelligence units to help local police in anti-terrorism activities .

Like most Republicans these days , MSNBC's Joe Scarborough does n't mind taking pot shots at George Bush .
Hell , it 's easy to do with the worst president in modern history , but jumping into the anti-Bush column certainly is n't an act of bravery or a sign that he 's moved to the left .
It means he knows which way the political winds are blowing and he needs good ratings .
I truly believe Joe is unhappy with the direction the GOP has gone in recent years and angry with W for leading his party to its demise , but at the end of the day , he is Republican to his marrow .
According to New York Magazine , Joe 's brave leap onto the 75 % bandwagon makes him the darling of the left :
Where else could a red- meat , right - wing congressman like Joe Scarborough reinvent himself as the liberal 's favorite talk - show host ?
Scarborough admits that he is courting a new constituency .
“ Once we started Morning Joe , Phil Griffin said to me , ‘ You can cut out this regular - Joe crap .
Our audience is from Boston to Washington , D.C. ’ ”
In fact , he seems to be right at home on the Upper West Side .
“ The thing I hear all the time , ” he says , “ when people come up to me on the street , is ‘ I love your show , ’ and then there ’s a hesitancy , and I ’ll finish their sentence : ‘ And I ’m a liberal ? ’ ”
Scarborough beams , pleased with his own apostasy , before adding , “ Republicans are n’t as gracious . ”
Wait ... wait , here 's the money shot :
“ I was totally skeptical , and now I ’m totally won over , ” says Time editor - at - large Mark Halperin , a political analyst at ABC News .
“ I was a huge fan of Imus , but Joe has taken that real estate and turned it into something — and I say this without hyperbole — revolutionary .
There ’s no other show that does what they do .
They ’ve really found a new form . ”
Read on ...
Because we all know that Mark Halperin , who said John Edwards thought Barack Obama was a p**sy and recommended John McCain use racist attacks against Obama , represents the views of Democrats and liberals everywhere .
Either this fluff piece was bought and paid for , or the people at NY Magazine have never heard of people like Keith Olbermann , Rachel Maddow or Amy Goodman .
Ok , libs , let 's give them suggestions .
Which talk show hosts do you really like ?
Pelosi & The People of the Lie by ntuit
Friday Aug 15th , 2008 7:01 AM
The dead , wounded and tortured of America ’s illegal wars attend Nancy Pelosi ’s “ Know Your Power : A Message to America 's Daughters " book signing at San Francisco ’s Cowell Theatre
Facing the dead is never pleasant and especially so when they were victims of a violent death or torture .
Their spirits are angry and they ask why .
They were there last night at Cowell Theatre in San Francisco ’s Fort Mason .
Nancy Pelosi was there for a book signing and a chat with KQED public radio host Michael Krasny .
The theatre was almost full and an imbedded force of protestors spoke forcefully for the dead , wounded and tortured – the victims of our president ’s corrupt policies and of those who enabled him to do so .
Nancy Pelosi helped enable Bush to do whatever he wanted .
She and her cohorts gave him almost everything and more that he needed to conduct a war based on his lies and deception .
Many in the crowd were traditionalists there to hear Nancy speak about her catholic upbringing and how she has risen to the top in a world where Men have all the power .
These are nice people .
They have families .
They go to church .
They believe in the flag and our country right or wrong .
Most of them consider themselves progressive or liberals – democrats .
They are clean , they dress nice , their kids play sports and go to college .
They are very much like the “ good germans ” because they want to hear the pablum ; they want to revel in their “ girl ” being the speaker of the House of Representatives .
They do n’t want anyone asking their “ girl ” any really tough questions – like what did she know about Bush ’s torture agenda or why has she allowed Bush to have unlimited funding for his war games ?
Among the crowd of traditionalists there was a large force of imbedded protestors who did an excellent job of representing the dead and the tortured - the victims of America ’s rage .
And maybe they also represented the future victims .
Those who will die or be imprisoned or tortured here in the US once the apparent establishment agenda of destroying the constitution and all the attendant freedoms gains full power .
Nancy must have felt unpleasant being back home and having to face people who stood up .
It was n’t like Washington where the movers and shakers fawn over power and the local population lives in an almost third world state of existence .
Pelosi kept saying – if you want change , vote for Obama .
Someone in the crowd yelled out , “ that ’s what we elected you to do – make change . ”
The democratically controlled Congress has been limited in passing anything progressive because of the almost unanimous number of republicans and a strong group of conservative democrats who have stopped those type of bills .
But when it came to funding the wars , funding the torture and funding the death – many of us believe there were enough Democrats to stop funding bills from passing .
But this never happened .
Pelosi and “ her ” democrats went along with all and more of Bush ’s deluded requests for money .
The death and torture went on .
People continued to die .
Michael Krasny never asks those type of questions of the celebrities who he seems so enamored with .
And why is impeachment off the table ?
It ’s not about what is right and honest – it ’s about whatever Pelosi says it is and she somehow decided that it was her personal prerogative to take impeachment off the agenda .
If Richard Nixon has only had her as Speaker – he might have survived .
The democrats have become a tawdry group lacking the will or desire to stand up for what is right , what is decent .
They continue to wave a flag that is dirty , tattered and crumbling .
Pelosi needs to give answers and be held accountable .
The people should n’t accept a heart warming biography in place of the answers as to why torture and death have been allowed to continue .
The big question now :
Will the people of San Francisco stand up to the highest powers , to one of their own and demand an accounting ?
Will they demand to know why their almost full support of impeachment has been ignored ?
Will they demand to know why Pelosi has not fought tooth and toenail the funding for Bush ’s illegal and delusional wars ?
Will they hold Pelosi accountable ?
( CNN ) --
The leader of a religious group that authorities believe preys on children was released from a Pennsylvania prison Friday but wo n't be required to register as a sex offender , triggering outrage in the community where he plans to live .
George Feigley , who was released from prison Friday , is the subject of community protests .
George Feigley , now 68 , was convicted in 1975 on charges including statutory rape , indecent assault and corrupting the morals of minors .
Because Feigley 's 1975 conviction predated the passage of Megan 's Law , he will not be required to register as a sex offender .
And , having served his maximum sentence , he was not put on parole upon his release .
Feigley 's Neo American Church , which authorities have called a sex cult , operated a school in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , that police said was a front for sexual activity .
The church 's manifesto says , " We hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity , " according to community activist Scott Portzline , who has researched Feigley 's history and that of the group .
" Sexual activity is the greatest act a human can do . "
Court documents filed in connection with Feigley 's criminal case alleged a less lofty goal .
" The defendants ' design was to operate a ' church oriented ' school , which is free of any governmental regulation , for the ostensible purpose of education when their real goal was to gratify their own deviant sexual desires , " the documents stated .
One of Feigley 's victims , identified only as " J , " told the Harrisburg Patriot - News she was part of the organization from the ages of 5 through 12 , when her mother left the Neo American Church .
Children were beaten for letting anyone but fellow cult members see them , she said , and their genitals were pierced with a lock to be controlled by Feigley , who called himself " The Light of the World . "
Children also were photographed in graphic sexual poses , she said .
Feigley is " not a man who should be out with society , " J said .
" He preys on -- at least he did -- the people who believed in him . "
And , community members say , there will be no protections in place to stop him from continuing to do so .
Watch why the case inflames emotions »
Feigley was convicted of additional conspiracy charges in 1995 .
Authorities said he was attempting to direct sexual activity involving children by telephone from prison .
However , conspiracy charges do not require listing on a sex offender registry .
Feigley " never admitted what he did was wrong , " said John Goshert of the Dauphin County district attorney 's office , who interviewed him last week as part of a pre-release program .
Protests took place Friday in front of Feigley 's Harrisburg home and the church headquarters .
His wife , Sandra , still lives in the home .
She was convicted in 1975 on one count of corrupting the morals of minors .
She served a brief prison sentence , according to the Patriot - News .
Sandra Feigley now operates a Web site ostensibly aimed at benefiting state , local and federal prison inmates .
The site has a lengthy section with articles discussing sex in prison and elsewhere .
Some of them are written by George Feigley , using his own name and some of his aliases .
" Thanks to the Christian crazies who were and are so influential in this country , America has criminalized more sexual conduct than any other Western nation , " says an article on the site , which does not name an author .
" It 's a neurosis .
As a result , there are a lot of ' sexual offenses . ' "
Another article bearing George Feigley 's alias of G.G. Stoctay , Ph.D. , and included in Portzline 's research says , " There is nothing injurious to sexuality .
It 's good and pleasant , not an evil .
Children exposed to it are simply not injured . "
Angel Fox , who will be Feigley 's next - door neighbor , helped organize Friday 's protest and is circulating a petition to prevent his return to the neighborhood , according to the Patriot - News .
" I mean , what happens when I 'm not at home ? " she asked .
" Do I have to worry about what 's happening with my kids ?
I have to try to do something . "
The community is " outraged , " said Annette Antoun , publisher of a weekly newspaper .
She said authorities are looking into whether Feigley would be required to register under a federal statute .
And , she said , if there is a loophole in the law , legislators are starting to work on ways to close it .
She said she has spoken to Feigley 's victims , and " they have scars they say will never go away .
...
They 're frightened . "
In 1976 , Feigley escaped from a Pennsylvania prison .
He was captured two years later in West Virginia but escaped again from a local jail and was recaptured by the FBI .
In 1983 , two members of the Neo American Church drowned in what authorities believe was an attempt to break Feigley out of prison .
Laura Seligman and James Gilbert drowned in the sewer line outside the prison where Feigley was being held .
The two had crawled a mile and a half through the line , according to Portzline .
A rainstorm caused an overflow gate to open , flooding the line .

Dirty tricks - how to get 4 roundrip airline tickets for free
Library cards do n’t cost $ 4 a gallon .
Southwest Floridians struggling to make ends meet are driving to area libraries .
They ’re filling their intellectual tanks and keeping their children entertained on the cheap .
As Tara Andalman , 38 , stepped out of her mini-van on Monday afternoon outside the branch library in Bonita Springs , cars were doing circles around her .
More than a dozen library patrons were coming or going every 15 minutes as Andalman unloaded four children , all in elementary school .
Two of the kids were hers , the others friends .
Clearly , it was time for distractions .
After cutting movie rentals from the family budget earlier this year , Andalman said she has had no problem finding free alternatives .
“ The library has pretty much all the movies , books and audio tapes we need , ” Andalman said , adding that camps have also been cut from the budget .
“ Next it could be cable . ”
The situation in Bonita is n’t much different than in Collier County , spokeswoman Camden Smith said .
At libraries across the county , the majority of the items checked out are DVDs .
“ Several of our library branches have reported customers checking out DVDs have stated that they just ca n’t afford to rent , ” Smith said , adding that she herself spent $ 15 over the weekend on rentals .
“ That ’s an astronomical cost for them on a monthly basis ... the libraries are saving them money . ”
In Lee County , library officials are estimating about 600,000 more items will be checked out this year than last , a 17.5 percent increase .
“ That ’s huge , ” Executive Director Sheldon Kaye said .
“ Well , last year we were up about 13 percent .
The year before ?
About 10 .
Normally , if a library were up about 5 or 6 percent , that would be very good .
So these figures are fairly unprecedented . ”
The increase in circulation has come at a time when difficulties in the real estate and construction industries have forced many area families to pack up and leave the state for work elsewhere .
The Lee County School District lost about 2,100 students during the course of the last school year , which it attributed to the economy - fueled exodus .
But it ’s not just those struggling to survive who are trying to save money .
“ No matter how much money you ’re making right now , everyone ’s concerned with the economy , ” Smith said .
Andalman ’s husband is in construction , but he works on commercial structures , an area of the industry that has kept moving despite the recession .
She said her job as a pre-school teacher is secure , but said increases in bills , insurance and taxes have all made things more difficult .
Sixteen - year Bonita resident Barbara Couch , 49 , is looking for work .
“ I guess economically we ’re all trying to save money , ” Couch said .
As she approached the Bonita branch , Couch had a half - dozen movies in her hand — “ Oceans 13 ” and “ Indian ” were among the titles .
“ It ’s never been that packed off - season , ” Couch said of the library ’s business .
“ The library ’s one of those free things in life . ”
Despite the increase in library traffic , Kaye said the libraries are keeping up with demand .
Lee County ’s libraries recently had self - checkout machines installed .
“ One of the other things that coincided with this increase in use , we have quite a number of positions open , ” Kaye said .
So our staff is stretched pretty thinly .
Even though we are experiencing an increase in use , those machines are helping us keep up . ”
Bonita resident Fred Hand , 80 , also noted an increase in activity .
Being retired did n’t keep him from hauling out a shopping - bag full of books from the Bonita branch , just like he always has .
Even for Hand , though , the economy has had an effect .
The books may be free , he said , but the problem is getting there .
“ You do n’t want to drive with the gas prices , ” Hand said .
“ So you read more . ”

Australia ( TGW ) – Scientists in Australia have revolutionized the design of fuel cells which could make hybrids more reliable and cheaper to build .
In the new design , the fuel cell does not need expensive platinum coating .
The team of Monash University scientists have designed and tested an air - electrode , where a fine layer - just 0.4 of a micron thick , or about 100 times thinner than a human hair – of highly conductive plastic is deposited on the breathable fabric .
The conductive plastic acts as both the fuel cell electrode and catalyst .
Testing has shown no sign of material degradation or deterioration of performance .
" The important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical , more easily sourced , outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective , ” Professor Doug McFarlane said .

home » articles » " Homosexuals and Fundamentalists " Homosexuals and Fundamentalists
The Dilemma Christian Fundamentalists take the Bible literally when it says that homosexuality is a sin and worthy of death - either physical death as described in the Old Testament , or eternal torture ( damnation ) as described in the New Testament ( see supporting verses below ) .
What 's more , they view this extreme condemnation of homosexuality as God 's ' perfect justice ' .
Yet these same Fundamentalists also believe that God created each of us , including homosexuals , just as we are .
In order to believe that homosexuality is worthy of death and eternal torture , and that God created each of us as we are , they have to believe that homosexuality is a free choice .
This conviction is apparent in the voracity with which Fundamentalists reject out of hand the growing body of scientific evidence that homosexuality is a genetic predisposition .
If they did not believe that homosexuality is a free choice , then they would have to concede that their God is a cruel God .
In other words , they would have to concede that God purposefully created homosexuals in a way that they would be genetically predisposed to commit a sinful act that would condemn them to death and eternal torment .
The Evidence Unlike Fundamentalists who spend their energy defending their a priori position , that homosexuality is a free choice , the scientific community bases its conclusions on the best available evidence .
As new evidence continues to surface , science takes it into account .
Science is concerned with learning and discovering ; Fundamentalism is concerned with preserving a priori beliefs , despite conflicting evidence .
In August of 1991 , neuroscientist Simon LeVay published in the magazine , Science , findings from autopsies of men and women of known sexual preference .
He found that the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus ( a part of the brain ) was substantially smaller in nineteen gay men who died from AIDS than among sixteen heterosexual men .
The observation that the male brain could take two different forms , depending on one 's sexual preference , was a stunning discovery .
Shang - Ding Zhang and Ward F. Odenwald found that homosexual behavior in Drosophila ( fruit flies ) could be induced by techniques that abnormally activated a gene called " w " ( short for " white " because of its effect on eye color ) .
They speculate that the activation produces a shortage of serotonin in the brain .
Cats , rabbits , and rats all show some elements of homosexual behavior when their brain serotonin concentrations fall .
Deam Hamer 's
Oct 2003 study showed that the Xq28 region of the X chromosome can cause a propensity towards homosexuality .
Researchers at the University of Texas found structural differences in the inner ears between lesbians and heterosexual women .
Researchers of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden , used PET scans to show that homosexual males ' reactions to male and female sex hormones was closer to the reaction of straight females than the reaction of straight males .
The list goes on .
The Choices Did a cruel God predestined certain people to execution ( in the Old Testament ) or eternal torture ( in the New Testament ) by creating them with a predisposition toward homosexuality , or is the Fundamentalist , literal interpretation of the Bible undermined by the evidence ?
Supporting Verses Lev 20:13 -
If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
Rom 1:26 - For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature : Rom 1:27 - And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
1Co 6:9 - Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ?
Be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind , 1Co 6:10 - Nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners , shall inherit the kingdom of God .
1Ti 1:9 - Knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers , 1Ti 1:10 - For whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
[ my comment : homosexuals are no better than murderers ? ]
Jud 1:7 - Even as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .

Watching Olympian Kerri
Walsh compete in beach volleyball last week , many viewers were wondering the same thing : what is that black thing on her shoulder ?
A tattoo ?
A bizarre fashion statement ?
No. Ms. Walsh was sporting a new type of athletic tape called Kinesio , touted by physical therapists as a better way to relieve pain and promote healing of injured muscles .
The appearance of Kinesio on the well - toned Ms. Walsh — she even wore it while meeting President Bush — has spurred international interest in the little - known brand .
In black , pink , blue and beige , the tape has been spotted on a number of other Olympians , including the shoulder of U.S. water polo player Lauren Wenger and the elbows of Canadian Greco Roman wrestler Ari Taub .
Members of Spain ’s basketball team and Jamaica ’s track team are wearing it .
Ms. Walsh and the other athletes do n’t have endorsement deals with Kinesio USA ; the company simply donated 50,000 rolls of the tape to 58 countries for use at the Olympic Games .
But whether its appearance on the international athletic scene is a sign of its therapeutic benefit or just smart marketing remains to be seen .
Traditionally , white athletic tapes are wrapped around gauze to form a stiff bandage that immobilizes a joint or muscle .
By comparison , the 100 - percent cotton Kinesio tape is said to be modeled on the thickness and elasticity of real skin .
The flexible tape is applied to the skin in specific patterns , depending on the injury , a technique designed to create support and guide injured muscles and joints without limiting the athlete ’s range of motion .
“ This tape moves with the body , so the biomechanics are still there , ” said John Jarvis , director of Kinesio USA .
Both the tape and the new wrapping technique have spread mostly by word - of - mouth among athletes and trainers who swear by it .
Cycling great Lance Armstrong reportedly dedicates a page to the tape in his latest book .
Recently soccer superstar David Beckham traded jerseys after a game and was spotted with pink Kinesio tape on his back .
Some limited data suggest it may be effective .
In July , the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy published a study of 42 people with shoulder injuries .
Half of them were treated with Kinesio tape applied in a pattern designed to support the injured muscle .
The other half were given a “ sham ” treatment in which two strips of tape were simply pressed across the arm .
The study was conducted by physical therapists at Winn Army Community Hospital in Fort Stewart , Ga. , who did n’t receive funding from the tape company .
Notably , the study participants who received the real therapeutic tape treatment reported an immediate improvement in pain .
Last year , Research in Sports Medicine published a study from San Jose State University showing that in 30 healthy test subjects , use of the tape along the lower trunk area appeared to increase the range of motion .
Kinesio claims that in addition to supporting injured muscles and joints , the new taping method helps relieve pain by lifting the skin , allowing blood to flow more freely to the injured area .
The tape is also widely used in pediatric physical therapy for muscle disorders like cerebral palsy .
Given Kinesio’s high profile at the Olympics , it seems likely that we will be seeing more and more of it .
Mr. Jarvis said the tape already is used by many professional basketball , baseball and football teams .
Before the Olympics , the company Web site received about 600 views a day .
Since Ms. Walsh appeared with the spider - like Kinesio pattern on her shoulder , Web traffic has jumped to 345,000 views daily .
Southern California grocery stores reversed themselves Tuesday and started pulling jalapeno peppers from their shelves .
The move comes a day after they left the peppers on the shelves even after the Food and Drug Administration said Monday that the produce could be linked to a national Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak .
The moves also highlighted the conflicting messages that the nation ’s mostly voluntary food safety network sends out at times like this .
Albertsons reviewed the original advisory from the FDA on Monday and concluded that since the source of the allegedly tainted peppers was a produce distributor in Texas that the grocery chain did n’t use , there was no cause for concern .
But later in the day , the chain saw that the FDA had updated its website and was now advising consumers to avoid raw jalapeno and serrano peppers and foods that contain them , such as fresh salsa and pico de gallo .

At that point Albertsons decided it would be prudent to remove all raw jalapeno peppers from sale Tuesday , spokeswoman Stephanie Martin said .
Ralphs Grocery Co. also stopped selling raw jalapenos Tuesday , a day after the FDA announcement .
Vons started removing the peppers from its produce departments late Monday evening .
The slowness in getting peppers out of stores highlights the limited authority of regulators to ensure food safety in the U.S. , said Caroline Smith DeWaal , director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
The FDA does n’t have the mandatory recall authority that would have forced the grocery stores to immediately stop selling peppers , she said .
And it should be clearer with its advisories and warnings , she added .
Advertisement
Nonetheless , it is still “ up to individual retailers to decide what they are going to do , ” DeWaal said .
The nationwide outbreak of the rare Salmonella Saintpaul strain has sickened thousands of people and killed two since April .
Regulators have been unable to pinpoint the source of the contamination .
At the start of the outbreak , the FDA warned against eating tomatoes , which it originally suspected but has now cleared for consumption .
Given the length of the outbreak and the number of people affected , it ’s likely that the source of the contamination is at the farm level or in the transportation system and not limited to a single distributor , DeWaal said .
She also said it was frustrating that the nation did n’t have a workable system in place that could quickly trace the source of contaminated food .

Important provisions that could have helped find the source of the outbreak were adopted by Congress in 2002 but were later watered down after objections by the food industry , DeWaal said .
Those provisions included requirements for distributors to record lot or code numbers , and requirements for record availability in four to eight hours that “ might have been helpful nailing down this salmonella outbreak much earlier , ” she said .
DeWaal said Congress needed to give the FDA the power to create better tools to trace food from the farm to the dinner table and also the authority to issue mandatory recalls .
The only product the FDA is empowered to recall is infant formula .
Such changes would move the FDA closer to how the U.S. Department of Agriculture monitors the slaughter and sale of meat .
“ Congress should not wait for more evidence that the agency does n’t have the tools it needs , ” DeWaal said .
A total of 1,251 salmonella cases have been reported in 43 states , the District of Columbia and Canada since April .
There have been 229 people hospitalized , and two have died .
The latest case was reported July 4 .

The distribution plant where the tainted jalapeno was found belongs to Agricola Zaragoza Inc. and is located in McAllen , Texas , in the Rio Grande Valley .
The company said the produce in question was imported from Mexico and shipped to Texas and Georgia , but it was n’t clear whether any of the reported illnesses were related to its peppers .
Distribution of Agricola ’s peppers has been suspended while the FDA , the Texas Department of State Health Services and the company investigate the problem .
Inspectors are also in Mexico searching for evidence of contamination .

The FBI is reviewing a raid by a SWAT team on the suburban Maryland home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo .
Mr. Calvo's two dogs were shot and killed during the raid .
The Washington Post reported on August 8 , 2008 ( " FBI to review raid that killed mayor 's dogs " ) that " The Prince George 's Sheriff 's Office SWAT team and county narcotics officers raided the home after Calvo brought in a 32 - pound marijuana - filled package addressed to his wife .
They tied up Tomsic 's mother and Calvo , and they interrogated the mayor for hours .
On Wednesday , police announced they had arrested a package deliveryman and another man in connection with a scheme to smuggle marijuana by intercepting packages addressed to unsuspecting recipients .
Police Chief Melvin C. High said that Calvo and his wife were probably innocent victims of the conspiracy but that the case remained under investigation .
He and Sheriff Michael Jackson defended the actions of deputies and officers who carried out the raid . "
According to the Post , the FBI " has begun ' reviewing the events that occurred at Mr. Calvo 's residence , ' said Richard J. Wolf , spokesman for the FBI in Baltimore , which has jurisdiction over federal civil rights investigations in Maryland .
The FBI announcement came in response to a call yesterday by Calvo and his wife , Trinity Tomsic , for such a probe .
Calvo and Tomsic suggested a systemic problem might exist in county law enforcement .
' We have witnessed a frightening law enforcement culture in which the law is disregarded , the rights of innocent occupants are ignored and the rights of innocent animals mean nothing , ' Calvo said , surrounded by county elected leaders and friends on the front lawn of his house .
' A shadow was cast over our good names .
We were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us . '
June White Dillard , president of the NAACP 's local chapter , also called for a thorough investigation and said Calvo experienced police action familiar to many young black men in the county . "
The Post noted that " An attorney came forward yesterday to allege a possible pattern of animal abuse by the sheriff 's department .
Michael Winkleman said he is representing another family whose dog was shot by sheriff 's deputies in November , along with a woman who is suing the department for searching her home without a warrant and threatening to shoot her dog .
In the first case , Winkleman said , sheriff 's deputies arrived at the Accokeek home of Frank and Pamela Myers with a warrant for another house on their street .
After the couple informed the deputies of their error , they continued to question the couple and looked around their home .
As they spoke , the couple 's 5 - year - old German boxer began barking in a yard , out of sight .
Soon after , according to Winkleman , the couple heard gunshots , and they found the dog shot to death .
He said the family is preparing to file suit .
In another case , Upper Marlboro resident Amber James has filed a $ 4 million lawsuit accusing sheriff 's deputies of searching her home without a warrant in May 2007 while looking for her sister , who lived in Capitol Heights .
According to the suit , deputies falsely claimed to have a warrant and searched every room of the home .
When they did not find the sister , the suit alleges , they threatened to return the next day and search again , saying that if they did , James 's dog would be dead .
Some lawyers and leading law enforcement groups said deputies should have known to do everything possible to avoid killing Calvo 's dogs .
Courts across the country in recent years have ruled that it is almost always unacceptable for police to kill pets in the course of searching a home .
Cases in three federal circuits have found that killing pets amounts to unreasonable seizure . "
Since roughly February , a solid minority of commentarors , including this blogger , have questioned the thesis that the rapid increase in oil prices was solely the function of supply and demand .
It was disconcerting to see what reactions this stance elicited .
There was often an unwillingness to read what was written , and instead turn the post into an exercise in projection .
Use of the word “ speculator ” is taken to mean the author 1 . thinks speculation is bad ( no , depends on circumstances ) , 2 . is economically illiterate and 3 . is a Peak Oil denier ( a lot of vitriol here ) .
When oil sprinted to its $ 147 a barrel summit , there was plenty of commentary supporting the price as a function of fundamentals ( despite quite a few oil company presidents and industry greybeards begging to differ ) , save some short - covering when the price rose above $ 140 .
But when I came back from Alaska and prices were continuing to fall , the explanations had at least as much to do with , um , speculative factors , like investors dumping oil and commodities for the dollar , as demand destruction .
It seems ironic that now that prices are falling , the CFTC has reclassified its data to show that some traders on exchanges that were previously designated as commercial are now classified as “ non-commericial ” .
The role of weight of non-traditional money in the market now lends support to the notion that demand from new players looking for an inflation hedge or simply participation in a different asset class played a role in the sudden price move .
From the Wall Street Journal :
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki told a German magazine he supported prospective U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ’s proposal that U.S. troops should leave Iraq within 16 months .
In an interview with Der Spiegel released on Saturday , Maliki said he wanted U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraq as soon as possible .
“ U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months .
That , we think , would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes . ”
It is the first time he has backed the withdrawal timetable put forward by Obama , who is visiting Afghanistan and us set to go to Iraq as part of a tour of Europe and the Middle East .
Obama has called for a shift away from a “ single - minded ” focus on Iraq and wants to pull out troops within 16 months , instead adding U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan .
Asked if he supported Obama ’s ideas more than those of John McCain , Republican presidential hopeful , Maliki said he did not want to recommend who people should vote for .
“ Whoever is thinking about the shorter term is closer to reality .
Artificially extending the stay of U.S. troops would cause problems . ”
Maliki , who is due to visit Germany this week , has suggested a timetable should be set for a U.S. withdrawal but U.S. officials have been more cautious , despite an improving security situation .
The White House said on Friday President George W. Bush and Maliki had agreed that a security deal under negotiation should set a “ time horizon ” for meeting “ aspirational goals ” for reducing U.S. forces in Iraq .
“ The Americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them .
But it is n’t , ” Maliki told Der Spiegel .
Some five years after the U.S. - led invasion , there are still some 146,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
One of the biggest problems facing meteorologists and climate scientists is the fact that we simply do n’t have long term climate data .
Sure , we ’ve seen our planet get hotter and nastier in the last few decades , but , did it happen the same time a hundred years ago ?
What we ’ve needed are data from the past , so that we can see just what is happening .
And thanks to Captain Cook and Lord Nelson and the East India Trading Company , a wealth of information has been uncovered by experts from the British Meteorological Office .
Spend any time watching or reading Hornblower , or any fiction pertaining to the British Navy in the 1600 ’s and 1700 ’s , and you will know what many historians know ; the British Navy paid a lot of attention to the weather and climate around them .
In fact , you would imagine anyone out at sea would do so , no matter what century they lived in .
But the British Navy was meticulous in their data gathering , and British experts from the Met Office and additional academics have discovered records dating back to the early 1600’s .
More than 6,000 logs were found , and have now provided what will turn out to be one of the greatest sources of long - term meteorological data .
“ British archives contain more than 100,000 Royal Navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone , ” said Dennis Wheeler , a geographer based at Sunderland University .
“ They are a stunning resource .
Global warming is a reality , but our data shows climate science is complex .
It is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions .
These records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening . ”
What they have found calls in to question modern - day thought .
Wheeler has found accounts of an increasing number of storms over Britain in the late 17th century , occurring doing the Little Ice Age that hit Europe from approximately 1600 to 1850 .
Records also point to a warming in the 1730 ’s that must have been caused naturally .
So as we ’ve said from the beginning , Earth ’s climate is nothing short of baffling .

From left to right : the original photo , a photo selected for swapping certain features , and the resulting hybrid .
Due to privacy concerns , Google has been blurring the faces of people caught on Google Street View cameras .
But rather than blurring people 's faces and diminishing the reality of the scene , researchers have demonstrated a new way to automatically depersonalize the faces - by creating hybrids .
The new face - swapping technology , developed by Neeraj Kumar and colleagues at Columbia University in New York , finds faces in a photograph and swaps their features with those from a library of faces , such as picture - sharing sites like Flickr.com .
Their software then automatically chooses one or more suitable faces for swapping the eyes , nose , and mouth out of the original image , resulting in a facial composite .
As a final step , to weed out inferior replacements , the system ranks the resulting images according to how well the hybrid face fits the surrounding region in the original photograph , and chooses the highest ranked replacement for insertion .
Unlike other programs , the new technique is fully automatic , and generates plausible results across a variety of lighting conditions , viewpoints , and skin tones .
The researchers performed a case study in which they asked participants to identify real and fake faces from a set .
They found that people are almost equally likely to classify real facial images and the hybrid facial images as being real .
Of 12 people tested , 58 % of the hybrid face images were misidentified as real , and 75 % of real images were correctly marked real .
Besides de-identifying faces , the same technology could be used by photographers for creating an optimal group photograph from several similar shots .
As the researchers explain , the " burst " mode found on most cameras can take several images at once .
Then , an automatic face replacement technique could be applied to swap blinking or frowning faces with better faces taken from the other images .
The result would be a single composite image with all the best faces .

WASHINGTON –
The office of the official responsible for protecting federal workers from political interference was raided by General Services Administration , after Mr. Bloch ’s office determined that she had improperly mixed politics with government business .
Mr. Bloch was nominated for his post by President Bush on June 26 , 2003 .
He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on Dec. 9 , 2003 , and sworn in to a five - year term on Jan. 5 , 2004 .
His agency ’s Web site states that he has more than 17 years ’ experience litigating “ employment , lawyer ethics , and complex cases before state courts , federal courts and administrative tribunals . ” 
The agency ’s Web site praises conscientious rank - and - file federal employees , “ the great heroes , ordinary heroes who have the courage to blow the whistle , who are helping to bring our government to greater accountability . ” 
Researchers have combined the efforts of two kinds of bacteria to produce hydrogen in a bioreactor , with the product from one providing food for the other .
According to an article in the August issue of Microbiology Today , this technology has an added bonus : leftover enzymes can be used to scavenge precious metals from spent automotive catalysts to help make fuel cells that convert hydrogen into energy .
Hydrogen has three times more potential energy by weight than petrol , making it the highest energy - content fuel available .
Research into using bacteria to produce hydrogen has been revived thanks to the rising profile of energy issues .
We throw away a third of our food in the UK , wasting 7 million tonnes a year .
The majority of this is currently sent to landfill where it produces gases like methane , which is a greenhouse gas 25 more potent than carbon dioxide .
Following some major advances in the technology used to make " biohydrogen " , this waste can now be turned into valuable energy .
" There are special and yet prevalent circumstances under which micro-organisms have no better way of gaining energy than to release hydrogen into their environment , " said Dr Mark Redwood from the University of Birmingham .
" Microbes such as heterotrophs , cyanobacteria , microalgae and purple bacteria all produce biohydrogen in different ways . "
When there is no oxygen , fermentative bacteria use carbohydrates like sugar to produce hydrogen and acids .
Others , like purple bacteria , use light to produce energy ( photosynthesis ) and make hydrogen to help them break down molecules such as acids .
These two reactions fit together as the purple bacteria can use the acids produced by the fermentation bacteria .
Professor Lynne Macaskie 's Unit of Functional Bionanomaterials at the University of Birmingham has created two bioreactors that provide the ideal conditions for these two types of bacteria to produce hydrogen .
" By working together the two types of bacteria can produce much more hydrogen than either could alone , " said Dr Mark Redwood .
" A significant challenge for the development of this process to a productive scale is to design a kind of photobioreactor that is cheap to construct and able to harvest light from a large area .
A second issue is connecting the process with a reliable supply of sugary feedstock . "
With a more advanced pre-treatment , biohydrogen can even be produced from the waste from food - crop cultivation , such as corn stalks and husks .
Tens of millions of tonnes of this waste is produced every year in the UK .
Diverting it from landfill into biohydrogen production addresses both climate change and energy security .
The University of Birmingham has teamed up with Modern Waste Ltd and EKB Technology Ltd to form Biowaste2energy Ltd , which will develop and commercialise this waste to energy technology .
" In a final twist , the hydrogenase enzymes in the leftover bacteria can be used to scavenge precious metals from spent automotive catalysts to help make fuel cell that converts hydrogen into electricity , " said Professor Lynne Macaskie .
" So nothing is wasted and an important new application can be found for today 's waste mountain in tomorrow 's non-fossil fuel transport and energy . "

What do leaders need to know about intellectual property strategy ?
1 – intellectual property can be used as a strategic asset – hopefully this is now pretty universally understood ;
2 – if you ’re not thinking about IP strategically , you will at the very least pay a large opportunity cost , and at worst , sink the company ;
3 – using IP strategically is so much more than managing the organisation ’s own IP ‘ strategically ’ ( whatever that means ) .

The wheelchair racer Joshua George will be competing in the 2012 Paralympic Games in London and writing for the 2012 London blog .
LONDON — Just before the start of each race the crowd goes silent .
Eighty thousand people stop cheering and begin waiting , anticipating the race to come .
The sound of the gun not only causes the competitors to explode off the line , but the crowd to erupt in sound as well .
This is how it happens for every race , and this is how it happened for my 800 - meter final , my third event and second chance at the podium in the Paralympic Games .
As I exploded around the first bend I ’m sure the volume of the crowd noise began to increase , though it was nothing more than white noise in the periphery of my thoughts .
“ Get out , get out ! ” I screamed to myself , hearing nothing more than the sound of my gloved hands on the push rims of my racing chair .
I flew out of the first turn and lengthened my stroke as I hit the backstretch , my hands shooting off the bottoms of the push rims , stretching high above my back and pouncing back toward the rim .
The track was empty ahead of me and I knew my competitors were scrambling behind me to fall in my draft .
I told myself before the race that whatever happened was going to happen from the front .
In wheelchair racing , much like cycling , the lead man in a pack is at a disadvantage .
While they are cutting through the wind the athletes in the back take advantage of the slipstream created by the lead and are able to maintain the same speeds with much less effort .
This technique is called drafting .
In a perfect wheelchair race you want to sit in second or third place , taking full advantage of the draft from the lead racer while insuring that you do n’t get boxed in on the outside .
At some point in the final 400 meters you begin your kick , using all the energy you saved in the draft to sling yourself around the chairs ahead of you and embark in an all - out sprint to the finish .
In the perfect race you are the first person to cross the finish line .
My racing to this point had been anything but perfect .
I quickly got my head back after my 400 - meter debacle , but despite hitting some good speeds in my 1,500 - meter semifinal , I allowed myself to be ushered to the back just before the final kick and failed to make the final , as all four racers ahead of me accelerated at the same pace and hit the same top speeds in the final lap .
I ran fast , but just as fast as all four ahead of me .
We finished in the same arrangement that we entered the final lap .

New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has been evacuated from a remote mountain hut after the death of her close friend and mountain guide Gottlieb Braun - Elwert .
Area commander of Mid South Canterbury police Inspector Dave Gaskin says atrocious weather conditions prevented initial attempts to reach the party in the remote Lake Tekapo region yesterday .
The 59 - year - old father - of - two Braun - Elwert suffered a heart attack while on a climbing trip with Clark , her husband Peter Davis and others , including cabinet ministers David Parker and Damien O'Connor .
This is the third of a multipart series on the state of the economy and how we got here .
Wall Street is dangerously similar to German New Wave movies .
Movies by Werner Herzog , Rainer Werner Fassbinder , Margarethe von Trotta , Volker Schlöndorff , Wim Wenders - - you know the genre .
Their movies are difficult and dense .
Mostly , they are horrid .
I hate these movies , but have never forgotten one .
I make the comparison because Wall Street , like German New Wave cinema , has always featured heroes with impossible dreams or people with unique talents in obscure fields .
And like German New Wave , the obsessiveness of Wall Street 's main characters has also always taken the place of plot .
The plan of Wall Street 's hot shots has always been that there is no plan .
People are on their own .
God is absent .
Truth is elastic .
The important thing is to keep on pushing .
In the lives of these characters , whether from German New Wave or Wall Street , a lot is improvised .
For both groups , life is lived in the theater of the ridiculous .
In the Wall Street version , that materializes in statements such as " I am ridiculously rich " or " I am ridiculously lucky . "
It 's generally the opposite for characters in German New Wave .
In German New Wave movies , chickens often stand in for people .
It 's too painful to watch a German New Wave movie without a little existential comic relief every now and then , and the directors know it .
There are long shots of chickens on the beach , buried up to their necks in sand , as the tide comes in .
Shots of dancing chickens .
Hypnotized chickens .
Cannibalistic chickens .
Dwarves throwing chickens .
Chickens talking to themselves .
Chickens jumping off of cliffs .
Lately , the chickens have come home to roost on Wall Street .
And like German New Wave cinema , the stories coming out of Wall Street this year are touched by the ridiculous , but more fundamentally Wagnerian in scope , influenced by operatic themes .
Themes like character , ambition , greed , scandal , disgrace , bankruptcy , ignominy , shame and even justice .
Yes , justice .
Bear Stearns Bust
On Thursday , June 19 , the FBI made its first big bust since last summer 's subprime mess , the first big bust since the housing and credit crises that followed the subprime mess pushed our country into a recession .
Hooray for the FBI .
They busted hundreds of housing developers , mortgage lenders and brokers , lawyers , real estate agents and appraisers across the country , while two hedge fund managers on Wall Street were arrested in a separate but related case .
( Incidentally , those two guys were referred to , but not named , in our May 28 article , " Secrets and Lies , " about Bear Stearns . )
FBI director Robert Mueller was quick to congratulate himself .
" This dragnet operation is an example of our unified commitment to address a significant crime problem , " he told reporters .
" The FBI will continue to direct its investigative and analytic resources toward the mortgage fraud and corporate securities fraud that threaten our nation 's economy . "
Nice start , Bob .
The fact that the investigation is ongoing underscores that the problems on Wall Street are not isolated to even a few hundred bad apples .
" These arrests make it clear that the causes of our credit problems are very broad - based and can't be put at the feet of any one player , " Mark Zandi of Moody 's said at the same press conference .
" It makes it clear that everyone was involved to one degree or another - - from lender to investment banker to hedge fund manager -- all the way from the bottom to the top . "
You forgot to mention someone , Mr. Zandi .
You too , director Mueller .
Prime brokers .
The new masters of the universe .
Among all their colleagues on Wall Street , it is the prime brokers who dream the most impossible dreams and who have the most unique talents in the most obscure fields .
If Werner Herzog were to make a movie about Wall Street today , he would be looking into the face of the prime broker .
I 'm reading from a possible movie review : " The face of the prime broker has the quality of a dream - - at once vivid , but vague ; easy to touch , but beyond reach ; at once scary like science fiction and ethereally lovely like a fantasy .
It is a beautiful face , reflected in the eerie blue of a computer screen , but in the end , it is the last face you will see before the market crashes . "
So who are they , these prime brokers ?
These guys who print the new money in the shadow banking system ?
These guys who live for all that is unregulated and opaque ?
First of all , they are not regular people .
" They are professional madmen , " said Warren Buffet in his famous 2005 speech to shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway .
Except for Warren Buffet , nobody spoke up .
Since Buffet 's speech , billions and billions of dollars , perhaps a trillion , were stashed in offshore accounts , as Wall Street managed its own fortune .
( It 's a myth that Wall Street manages the fortunes of its clients .
It does not .
It serves itself the cake .
We 're lucky if a few crumbs fall off the plate . )
Let 's now break this silence , and with it the omerta of prime brokerage .
' Unspoken Terror '
It all started innocently enough , generically enough .
In the beginning , through the 1980s and '90s , prime brokers were the guys at big investment banks like UBS , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs , Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , etc. , who supported the nascent hedge fund industry with basic services .
A hedge fund start - up -- and there were thousands of them back in the ' 80s and '90s , as many as 8,000 at one time -- usually bought a basic package from a prime broker .
The core services in the package included global custody ( clearing , custody and asset servicing ; no problem , all plain vanilla ) ; securities lending ( especially for what 's called " naked short sales , " which is illegal ) ; financing ( facilitating the crazy extreme leverage at hedge funds , sometimes as high as 40 - to - 1 ) ; customized technology ( providing hedge funds with reporting necessary to value positions and risk ; this is where things started to get funky ) ; and operational support ( prime brokers became the hedge fund 's primary operations contact with all other members of the broker - dealer community , and oh , did this invite abuse ) .
It is easy to see how young hedge funds became so dependent on prime brokers .
Prime brokers served as incubators for hedge fund hatchlings that were proliferating like so many baby chicks at a Tyson chicken farm .
In addition to all the above services , prime brokers also provided what is quaintly called " value - added " services in the hedge fund industry , including capital introduction ( introductions to the prime broker 's institutional clients and other possible investors , a blatant conflict of interest but nobody in Congress cared ) ; office space leasing and services ( read : free or discounted office space , replete with staff and support - - a bribe for business ?
you bet ) ; risk management advisory services ( prime brokers advising hedge funds on the very same junk bonds they secretly wanted to dump on them ) ; and something ambiguously called " consulting services " ( often focused on how hedge funds could circumvent established regulatory requirements , usually by domiciling operations beyond the jurisdiction of U.S. law ) .
It got worse after 2000 .
Introduce swaps and derivatives into the mix .
Yeah , baby .
Things suddenly got really interesting .
Preserving the integrity of the balance sheet at hedge funds got thrown out the window as swaps and derivatives grew , including the exponential growth of something called " synthetic positions . "
" Synthetic " means fake , bogus , fixed , fraudulent .
It 's that simple .
Add to synthetic positions the liquidity of the first years of our decade as Alan Greenspan brought interest rates down to almost nothing , and you get the picture .
In one year alone , from 2005 to 2006 , the market for credit default swaps , just one product , grew from $ 12.4 trillion to $ 26 trillion .
Most markets are a zero- sum game , meaning there are an equal number of winners and losers .
For every dollar someone makes , someone else loses a dollar .
Prime brokers changed all that .
Because prime brokers never lost .
Prime brokers acting as the hedge fund industry 's only interface with the world ( see " operational support , " above ) were able to create a shadow banking system where the counterparties to any hedge fund 's trades were unknown , even to the hedge fund .
Add to that opaqueness a lack of infrastructure where a lot of trades are unconfirmed or delayed , and there are the makings for greatest bank heist in history .
While the Federal Reserve Bank has since 1996 published reports on these obvious problems , it was n't until September 2005 that the Fed addressed what was termed the " unspoken terror " of settlement issues among prime brokers .
Funny that it took two more years before Congress noticed .
All it took to get their attention were last summer 's subprime mess , the blow - up at Bear Stearns and a country plunged into a recession .
Shadow Masters
Dreamers and those with unique talents in obscure fields are the folks who built the shadow banking system .
They are the prime brokers .
Like actors in a Werner Herzog movie , they inhabit a strange new world , one as big as the traditional banking system or bigger , but where there are no federally insured deposits and where shadow banks neither have nor want -- or even need -- access to short - term borrowing from the Fed or any other central bank during times of crisis .
It 's a world where no risk is too great , where collateral is n't necessary , where there are no capital requirements and where counterparties are never identified .
Shadow banks are beyond the reach of law , are almost always found offshore and redefine the term " international crime organization . "
Indeed , because shadow banks always make money , they would even profit from the collapse of the global financial system .
They might even cause it to happen .
Prime brokers have been the new masters , no question about it .
But their primacy may finally be threatened .
" This bright new financial system - - for all its talented participants , for all its rich rewards -- has failed the test of the market place , " said Paul Volker , former president of the Federal Reserve , during a speech I attended in April .
" It adds up to a clarion call for reform . "
Two months later , at a press conference where I was also present , Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , answered that call .
" The structure of the financial system changed radically during the boom , with dramatic growth outside the traditional banking system , " Geithner warned in his speech , adding that unregulated growth in opaque assets made the last crisis difficult to manage and could make a future crisis impossible to manage .
And two weeks before the FBI busted those two guys at Bear Stearns , U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the Federal Reserve should " be allowed to collect information from large complex financial institutions . "
He said , " Regulators should have a clear path toward figuring out how to intervene in a crisis and how to close a failed brokerage firm . "
Sounds like Paulson is expecting more trouble .
If this were a New Wave German film instead of the banal horror of real life , someone would figure out that it must be time to pull out the chickens .
An attempt to re-energise mathematics teaching in Europe is being made in a new project examining a range of factors thought to influence achievement .
Mathematics teaching is as vital as ever both in support of key fields such as life sciences , alternative energy development , or information technology , and also through its unique ability to develop widely applicable problem solving skills .
It should be highly relevant not just for the elite few but for all people in education .
The new project was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) , which brought together experts in different areas of mathematics education .
" It was agreed that we would begin the process of developing a comparative project , involving between fifteen and twenty European countries , to examine the interrelatedness of the mathematics - related beliefs of teachers and students , teacher practices and student cognition , " said Paul Andrews , the workshop 's convenor and Senior Lecturer in Education at the Faculty of Education of Cambridge University in the UK .
Andrews pointed out that the solution to the mathematics teaching conundrum was complex and multi-dimensional , just like many of the great problems in the field itself .
On the one hand , enthusiasm needed to be balanced with rigour in order to motivate students while also teaching skills and knowledge worth acquiring .
" To assume that the development of enthusiasm is sufficient to guarantee achievement would be naïve as there are countries in which students have little enthusiasm for mathematics but achieve relatively highly and , of course , vice versa , " pointed out Andrews .
There has also been a tension between immediate vocational objectives in response to the needs of employers , and the higher ideal of teaching logical thinking and deeper mathematical problem solving .
European countries have to date resolved this tension in different ways , with the UK being at the vocational end of the spectrum , while Hungary has taken the purest approach with its traditions for mathematical rigour .
" One of the problems of English education is that students experience a fragmented and procedural conception of mathematics , due to underlying notions of vocationalism , and so rarely come to see the subject as a coherent body of concepts and relationships which can be worth studying for the intrinsic satisfaction it can yield , " said Andrews .
" The situation in countries like Hungary is almost the complete opposite - all students experience an integrated and intellectually worthwhile mathematics taught by teachers with little explicit interest in the applications of the subject but an enthusiasm for logical thinking and the problem - solving opportunities that mathematics can provide . "
But the issue of mathematics teaching is not just about content , but also attitude , on the part both of pupils and teachers .
One significant finding to emerge from the workshop was that the common practice of dividing pupils into sets defined by ability , which , in the UK context , is applied more for mathematics teaching than any other subject , can be counterproductive , even for the most able pupils .
" Where teachers do not necessarily expect to teach students in ability groups but expect to work with the full ability range , achievement is generally higher across the board , " said Andrews .
Another finding that perhaps contradicted common wisdom was that students often progressed best when taught to approach problem solving collectively instead of in isolation .
This runs counter to the perception , manifested regularly in UK schools , that mathematics is a lonely endeavour pursued by individuals in competition rather than cooperation .
It remains to be seen whether the ESF project will lead to a radical shake up in mathematics teaching comparable to the introduction of the so called " new maths " in the 1980s in the place of the previous more arithmetically based approach .
More likely it will lead to rebalancing of teaching , bringing greater consistency and rigour to deliver a more wholesome curriculum .
The workshop " The Relevance of Mathematics Education " was held in Cambridge , UK in January 2008 .
Each year , ESF supports approximately 50 Exploratory Workshops across all scientific domains .
These small , interactive group sessions are aimed at opening up new directions in research to explore new fields with a potential impact on developments in science .

Redefining abortion : Federal officials considering a rule allowing health care workers to refuse to provide contraceptives
The Bush administration has consistently opposed providing funding for international birth control programs , but until now has not tried to limit the use of contraceptives inside the United States .
That could change in the president 's final months in office .
Health and Human Services officials are considering a draft regulation that would classify most birth control pills , the Plan B emergency contraceptive and intrauterine devices as forms of abortion because they prevent the development of fertilized eggs into fetuses .
The rule , which does not require congressional approval , would allow health care workers who object to abortion on moral or religious grounds to refuse to counsel women on their birth control options or supply contraceptives .
It would forbid more than half a million health agencies nationwide that receive federal funds from requiring employees to provide such services .
Pharmacists could use the rule as a justification for refusing to fill birth control prescriptions , and insurance companies could cite it as a basis for declining to cover the costs .
An existing regulation allows health care providers with objections to abortion to abstain from providing it to patients .
By extending the definition of abortion to cover contraceptives , federal officials are attempting to create by administrative fiat what would fail by a wide margin in Congress .
In fact , the draft rule could void laws in 27 states that require insurance companies to provide birth control coverage for women requesting it .
The rule also could counter laws in 14 states requiring that rape victims receive counseling and access to emergency , day - after contraceptives .
It would also require federal agencies and states to provide funds for sham family planning clinics that provide women only abstinence counseling .
The enactment of such rules would have an immediate impact in Southeast Texas , where state health officials estimate more than half a million women are in need of affordable family planning services .
Rochelle Tafolla , a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas Inc. , warns that enactment of the regulation would endanger women 's health .
According to Tafolla , " In a time when more and more families are uninsured and feeling the financial strain of a bad economy , it 's pretty incredible that the Bush administration is actually trying to put up roadblocks for women trying to access basic health care . "
Planned Parenthood strongly opposes the proposed rule " and will be fighting to preserve women 's access to health care information . "
Planned Parenthood is not alone in its opposition .
The American Medical Association , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a bipartisan group of 112 members of Congress have weighed in against the draft regulation .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has signed a letter of protest written by a group of U.S. senators .
( Republican candidate John McCain has not taken a position . )
Health and Human Services officials issued a statement claiming the regulation would not alter existing rules and is simply designed to protect health care workers from discrimination based on their views of certain medical procedures .
That ignores the fact that defining some forms of contraception as abortion is a radical departure from the status quo .
As with a spate of administrative regulations undermining environmental enforcement that the administration has pushed as its time in office grows short , this one is a payoff to social conservatives who oppose abortion and contraception .
Since polls show that an overwhelming percentage of the American people support birth control , such backdoor tactics are the only way such restrictions could be considered , let alone enacted .
Justifying these draft rules as an anti-discrimination measure would be laughable , if it were n't so undemocratic and dangerous to American women .
If HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt is irresponsible enough to approve the regulation , Congress and the next president should make sure it is short - lived .
The dark clouds gathering this summer between Moscow and the West have some experts concerned that the world is on the brink of a new cold war .
They point to two flash points .
One , the ex-Soviet state of Georgia , is largely driven by Moscow 's fear of NATO expanding into its traditional sphere of influence .
The other is a proposed US missile - defense shield in Eastern Europe .
Russia has promised to retaliate – possibly by basing nuclear - capable bombers in Cuba , according to an unofficial news report quoting unnamed top security officials last week .
" It 's no longer just rhetoric , it could start to get quite serious , " says Dmitri Trenin , an analyst with the Carnegie Center in Moscow .
" The message being put out by Moscow is that the West needs to realize that it 's approaching a line , beyond which there could be a real showdown . "
But Russian President Dmitri Medvedev , has a plan to arrest the slide by creating an alternative to NATO .
Though it has yet to gain traction in the West , Mr. Medvedev 's plan , announced in Berlin last month , has been much discussed in the Russian media .
In short , it would redesign Europe 's security system from the bottom up – but this time , Russian would participate as an equal partner and founder of the new bloc .
Russian experts are dubbing the concept " EATO " – Euro - Atlantic Treaty Organization – a big - tent security grouping that would replace NATO – the North Atlantic Treaty Organization – and say it is likely to become the signature foreign policy theme of Medvedev 's presidency .
It would also , say supporters , remove the main irritant in Russia 's relations with the West today .
Unlike the former cold war , Russian officials argue , today 's growing rift between Moscow and the West is not based on irreconcilable ideological or geopolitical hostility .
The main problem , they say , stems from the West 's failure to work with Russia to re-imagine global security architecture following the USSR 's collapse .
Confidantes of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev say that US leaders reneged on pledges to build a " new world order " after Soviet troops withdrew from Eastern Europe and the Communist military alliance – the Warsaw Pact – was disbanded .
" Gorbachev made deep concessions to the West in order to break out of the vicious cycle of the arms race .
But later , when Russia was going through a painful economic transition and we needed support , the West turned away , " says Andrei Grachev , who was a Kremlin adviser and Gorbachev 's presidential spokesman at the time .
" Despite promises that had been given to us , the West decided to use [ Russia 's weakness and economic turmoil ] in order to expand NATO to the east .
I believe that the anti-Western moods present in Russian society today can be explained by the fact that the West treated Russia as a vanquished enemy , " rather than a potential partner , he says .
The sorest point is the inexorable advance of NATO into the USSR 's former sphere which could soon see inclusion of the ex-Soviet states of Georgia and Ukraine .
Little has come from past attempts to develop a NATO - Russian partnership , and Moscow views the Western alliance as a cold war artifact that unites European countries against Russia .
" Russia 's view is that NATO creates new divisions in Europe , " says Tatiana Parkhalina , director of the official Center for European Security Studies in Moscow .
Unlike the previous cycle of NATO expansion , which took in Eastern European states of lesser strategic concern to Russia , the new candidates are part of the core of the former USSR .
" Ukraine is felt by Russians as part of traditional Russian lands .
To many Russians it 's just unthinkable for it to become part of an outside military alliance , " she says .
Mr. Trenin argues that if Ukraine is admitted to NATO 's membership action program , which could happen as early as December , " that would start a political warfare campaign in Ukraine , " he says .
" I see Russia ceasing to value the sovereignty of Ukraine now that it 's dropping into the US lap .
I see a harshening of the tone in Moscow .
The whole foreign policy of Russia will change . "
Another looming flashpoint is US determination to install antimissile installations in Eastern Europe to counter what it sees as a nuclear missile threat from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea .
At the Group of Eight summit in Japan earlier this month , Medvedev promised to " retaliate " if the scheme to build radars in the Czech Republic and deploy interceptor rockets in Poland is finalized .
In what experts say were a series of calculated leaks to Moscow newspapers last week , the Kremlin let the world know what such retaliation might look like .
It could come in the shape of medium - range nuclear missiles based in the Russian Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad and targeted on European capitals .
Or , according to a detailed report in the daily Izvestia that cited top military sources , Russia might revive an old Soviet - era airfield in Cuba as a base for its Tu-95 and Tu-160 long - range nuclear bombers .
Russian officials denied the stories , but experts say there 's little doubt they were Kremlin - approved .
" I do n't think Russian bombers in Cuba is something to be seriously discussed at the moment , but the leak was clearly designed for psychological impact , " says Fyodor Lukyanov , editor of Russia in Global Affairs , a leading foreign - policy journal .
" These stories say to the West : ' You 'd better start thinking about this , because we are very , very serious . ' "
The Russian alternative , outlined by Medvedev in various statements , is a vague project that would be kicked off by a pan-European meeting of government leaders and security experts to develop a new concept that would include all the post - Soviet states , including Russia .
One of the main aims of his presidency , he said , will be to establish a strategic partnership with the European Union that could be the mainstay of a " big Europe without dividing lines . "
" The issue of rejoining Europe will be the central theme for Medvedev , whether his proposal is accepted or not , " says Gleb Pavlovsky , a longtime Kremlin adviser .
" The existing architecture is in crisis , and it is n't working .
We need a new design , with an emphasis on security for all countries in Europe . "

Apple has acknowledged the huge iPhone security flaw we tested and reported on two days ago , promising an update for September that will fix the hole that can expose all your private emails , text messages and contacts .
But instead of calling a spade a spade and acting as soon as possible , they have decided to minimize the problem :
The minor iPhone security issue , which surfaced this week , is fixed in a software update which will be released in September .

That jewel comes from an Apple spokeswoman , deciding to ignore what ourselves , Wired or the San Francisco Chronicle have classified as a massive security problem .
Ms. PR rep : could you please send us your me.com and apple.com passwords so we can demonstrate how easily accessing your mail by clicking a button is not , and will never be , a " minor security issue " ?
In the meantime , she points out to the user - driven fix , as if that would help the millions who have iPhones and do n't read Gizmodo , Wired , SFC , Reuters , or any of the outlets around the web that echoed the news .
Not good enough , I 'm afraid .

AINSWORTH , Neb .
Driving south out of the agricultural town of Ainsworth , you ca n’t miss its newest crop : wind turbines , three dozen of them , with steel stalks 230 feet high and petal - like blades 131 feet long , sprouting improbably from the sand hills of north - central Nebraska , beside ruminating cattle .
Though painted gray , the turbines stand out against the evening backdrop of battleship - colored thunderclouds and bear an almost celestial whiteness when day ’s light is right .
Airplane pilots can spot them from far away , and rarely does a bird make their unfortunate acquaintance .
The sound of 8.5 - ton blades , three to a turbine , turning and turning , only enhances their almost supernatural presence .
Standing at the base of a turbine ’s stalk , you hear a whistling whoosh — whuh ... whuh ... whuh — as steady summer winds come like the breath of gods to toy with pinwheel amusements .
Six renewable energy technicians share in tending this strange garden , including Jered Saar and Devin Painter , neither of whom could be described as chatty .
Mr. Painter , 25 , is the son of ranchers ; when he ’s working at the top of a turbine , he can see his family ’s spread miles away .
Mr. Saar , 34 , comes from the nearby town of Bassett ; he spent last year in Iraq with the Nebraska Army National Guard , and yes , he would rather be here than there .

I think there are a number of arguments " for " the bombing of the two Japanese cities during World War II , so I 'll take the unpopular role and play Devil 's advocate .
First off , if you look at the title of this argument , it is " Was the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki justifiable or not ? " .
Not just " Hiroshima " , but Hiroshima [ August 6th ] AND Nagasaki [ August 9th ] .
Even after the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima , the Japanese war machine would not surrender .
This really shows how hard the citizens of Japan and the politicians of Japan were fighting in this total war .
Secondly , the usage of Nuclear Weapons for the first time by the United States was relatively fortunate .
If it were a country at war with America who 'd dropped the first bomb , you could easily argue that due to the tension of this time period the US would 've deployed more of them in retaliation .
During the Cold War , for example , arms races between the US and Russia led to both sides having hundreds / thousands of nuclear missiles .
Since the US was the first to drop the bomb , it set a historical precedent and was used as a deterrant .
Despite the low yield of the " Little Boy " and " Fat Man " bombs [ modern stockpiles have warheads thousands of times more powerful ] , the sheer destruction caused gave Nuclear Weapons an area of seriousness and the reality of their destruction that has prevented their usage under the doctrine of " Mutually Assured Destruction " .
If Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fought under Operation Downfall , the invasion of Japan by American forces using conventional warfare tactics [ think : Omaha Beach , Operation Market Garden , etc ] , would the more powerful Nuclear weapons have been used during later wars ?
How would the Cold War have progressed differently ?
If Fat Man or Little Boy were dropped during testing in the Bikini Atoll , would more powerful , modern nuclear bombs have been used in any of the wars since the Second World War ?
The Korean War , The Cold War , Vietnam War , Persian Gulf Wars , Iraq , even Iran in the future .
What would the American Military 's stance on the usage of Nuclear bombing be if it did n't have the negative press from the bombing of Japan ?
It would certainly lack it 's biggest deterrent .
Perhaps this could be seen as a constructive or progressive " lesser of two evils " .
America would not have backed down from Japan , as Japan was starting to lose the battle .
Regardless of whether the fight was waged using conventional tactics or nuclear bombs , a similar Japanese death toll would have occurred .
These days , the largest argument people see these days against the usage of Nuclear weapons is the debate of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Perhaps the two bombings actually prevented further loss of life from Nuclear weapons .
There has n't been a nuclear bombing since on this magnitude [ with the exception of the common usage of Tactical Nuclear devices on much smaller magnitudes ] .
Did the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki save lives , by having the bombing during " favorable conditions " ?
1 ) Low - yield nuclear bombs , by conventional standards .
2 ) The circumstances were that America was the only one with Nukes .
3 ) No fear of retaliation , no world - wide destruction followed .
4 ) Japan clearly had no plan to back down .
How many more lives were lost versus a full - on invasion ?
5 ) No American or " Allied " lives were lost .
6 ) Field - test of a nuclear device , set the precedent for the level of necessity required to drop " The Bomb " .

Ok .
While you hold that Japan was not going to give up , I found that more than 60 of Japan 's cities had been destroyed by conventional bombing , the home islands were being blockaded by the American Navy , and the Soviet Union entered the war by attacking Japanese troops in Manchuria .
Now , when you say that they would not give up , America refused to modify its " unconditional surrender " demand to allow the Japanese to keep their emperor which needlessly prolonged Japan 's resistance .
This is something I 've thought on my own , but have n't heard elsewhere : " ... the U.S. did not give enough time for word to filter out of Hiroshima 's devastation before bombing Nagasaki " .
Mind you , this was three days after , the first bombing was August 6th ' 45 , the second was August 9th ' 45 .
We are talking 1945 in the Empire of Japan ...
They were in a war under a dictator who proclaimed " Total war " , do you think everyone went home at night to the radio's that they could n't afford to hear someone high say " Oh , well the American 's just exploded an entire city in like , maybe 30 seconds ....
BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK , KEEP FIGHTING !!!
BECAUSE WE ARE BLOOD THIRSTY !!!! " ?
No , it probably did n't happen anything like that .
I mean , it 's a whole city , gone .
Do you think you would know if a whole city went missing ?
You would hear that someone who claims to be a survivor , saw Hiroshima explode and it does n't exist anymore ... and then you send some people out to check it out , and then they think " Ah , shit ... what are we going to tell everyone ?
America just handed us our ass ... " , then Day three comes along and we drop our ~ 20 Kiloton nuke .
Furthermore : " The two cities were of limited military value .
Civilians outnumbered troops in Hiroshima five or six to one " .
Something else I 've heard before .
Why would n't we use these devices strictly on military installations ?
I mean , if Japan is in the Pacific and is doing it 's whole " island hopping " thing , why not just hit one island after another with these bomb until we had no other choice but to attack their cities ?
Some people seem to think that a demonstration explosion over Tokyo harbor would have convinced Japan 's leaders to quit without killing many people .
______
Yes , these were " Low yield " bombs compared to what we have now , but they were the highest yield at the time .
They were the only nuclear bombs on the planet at the time , but we were planning on more , and since the bombing , we have been producing more , and more , and more .
The soviets in the cold war were n't afraid of what happened in world war 2 , they all tested their weapons and had a fair idea of what it would do to a city ... something that the rest of the world would n't forgive them for .
The cold war was nothing more than a cold war .
We were also racing to the moon during the cold war , so what ?
Operation Market Garden and Operation Overlord were conducted ( basically ) in the epicenter of World War II .
This is when every nation in Europe was involved with the war and this was n't just a huge island , it was a content that they had to fight their way onto .
I am skeptical of the American casualty estimations at the time because if they would have released some actual true estimations , we would n't have been able to test these weapons that cost the US nearly 2 million dollars to develop , but I do think that it would have turned into a pre-vietnam , vietnam - like situation .
It would have been a very , very long war unless we got down to the point .
If we were just to invade japan and hold it captive , of coarse it would be difficult ... but in that situation , whoever died would have been fighting .
In Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the people in the cities were n't asked to surrender " or else your whole city will explode " .
You know what I mean ?
If you were to hear that you would probably surrender .
But no , it was a silent bomb that fell from the sky ... the only warning was noticing a single B17 bomber without an escort ... that was it .
Is that fair ?
How seriously can you justify taking 199,000 ( ONE HUNDRED AND NINTY NINE THOUSAND ) lives without asking them directly to surrender ?
I know that if China were to ask me now if I would like to be nuked with my city or work in a sweat shot I would much rather work in a sweat shop for the rest of my life ...
You know what I mean ?
I am an American , but I would not want to be a number on a chart represented by a digit to be an american .
Maybe I 'm insane , but that would be horrible .
If calling myself an american means that my whole life is just for a 1 on a sheet of paper entitled " Casualties and Fatalities " ... no thanks .
Lesser of two evils ?
That 's a joke .
What do you consider evil ?
If you 're talking about America 's reputation over America 's casualties ?
What does it matter ?
199,000 people still died , and that does n't include fallout and radiation poisoning that is still to blame for many many miscarriages .
Also , you cannot say that a similar death toll was racked up , because we were bombing their cities ... on their land .
Just because they happened to land on japanese soil when they were born does n't mean that the empirical ideology was born into each child .
Think about it , out of the 199,000 people , how many of them were too young to give a shit ?
They were n't all just 20 year old angry japanese people ready to kamikaze .
There were babies , children , wives , women , and , amongst all of that , in those two cities , there were 13 Allied POW 's ( 2 of which were British , 7 Dutch and 2 died post - bombing from fallout ) .
How can you justify bombing two complete cities ???

In response to your second part .
Are you saying that if you got into a bar fight with someone who just attacked you for no reason , and that person is strong enough to cause some damage , and you had the means to stop the fight quickly but it would be considered " unfair , " that you would not take the opportunity to end it quickly and just take the beating ?
At what point does self preservation kicks in at the expense of all else ?
At what point do you accept collateral damage in order to preserve your family and home ?
If we had not used the bomb and Japan somehow managed to win the war , what would this world be like today under imperialist Japan ?
Is it ever prudent to sacrifice civilians ?
If someone was going around using a baby as a human shield and killing people , how many lives do you allow him to take ( while you attempt to stop him without killing the baby ) before you say , " Screw it , take the baby out , kill him and stop this madness . "
Is the baby 's life more important than all the other people dying ?

To your first question : Actually , that 's quite inaccurate .
- On June 9th , 1945 , the Emperor 's confidant , Marquis Koichi Kido , wrote a " Draft Plan for Controlling the Crisis Situation " , warning that by the end of the year , Japan 's ability to wage modern war would be extinguished and the government would be unable to contain civil unrest .
" ... we can not be sure we will not share the fate of Germany and be reduced to adverse circumstances under which we will not attain even our supreme object of safeguarding the Imperial Household and preserving the national polity " .
- On June 22 , the Emperor summoned the Big Six to a meeting .
Unusually , he spoke first .
" I desire that concrete plans to end the war , unhampered by existing policy , be speedily studied and that efforts made to implement them . "
It was agreed to solicit Soviet aid in ending the war .
Other neutral nations , like Switzerland , Sweden , and the Vatican City were known to be willing to play a role in making peace , but they were so small they could not have done more than deliver the Allies ' terms of surrender and Japan 's acceptance or rejection .
The Japanese hoped that the Soviet Union could be persuaded to act as an agent for Japan in negotiations with the Western Allies .
There was no agreement on what peace terms Japan might accept , or when to approach the Allies .
The leaders of the Army were confident of their ability to deal the Americans a crippling blow when they attempted to invade Kyushu in late 1945 .
Then , Kido proposed that the Emperor himself take action , offering to end the war .
Kido proposed that Japan give up occupied European colonies , provided they were granted independence , and that the nation disarm and for a time be " content with minimum defense " .
With the Emperor 's authorization , Kido approached several members of the Supreme Council , the " Big Six " .
Togo was very supportive .
Suzuki and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai , the Navy minister , were both cautiously supportive ; both wondered what the other thought .
General Korechika Anami , the Army minister , was ambivalent , insisting that diplomacy must wait until " after the United States has sustained heavy losses in Ketsu - Go " .
The Emperor lost confidence in the chances of achieving a military victory .
The battle of Okinawa was lost , and he learned of the weakness of the Japanese army in China , of the navy , and of the army defending the Home Islands .
... according to Prince Higashikuni 's report it was not just the coast defense ; the divisions reserved to engage in the decisive battle also did not have sufficient numbers of weapons .
I was told that the iron from bomb fragments dropped by the enemy was being used to make shovels .
This confirmed my opinion that we were no longer in a position to continue the war .
- On July 26th , 1945 , Britain , the U.S. , and China released the Postdam Declaration , which was not unlike the Treaty of Verailles .
- On July 27 , the Japanese government considered how to respond to the Declaration .
The four military members of the Big Six wanted to reject it , but Togo persuaded the cabinet not to do so until he could get a reaction from the Soviets .
- On July 30 , Ambassador Sato wrote that Stalin was probably talking to the Western Allies about his dealings with Japan .
" There is no alternative but immediate unconditional surrender if we are to prevent Russia 's participation in the war .
...
Your way of looking at things and the actual condition in the Soviet Union may be seen as being completely contradictory . "
- Soon thereafter , Russia joined the allies by renewing it 's 41 - 46 Neutrality Pact .
- On August 2 , Togo wrote to Sato , " ...
However , it should not be difficult for you to realize that ... our time to proceed with arrangements of ending the war before the enemy lands on the Japanese mainland is limited , on the other hand it is difficult to decide on concrete peace conditions here at home all at once . "
- On the morning of August 6th , 1945 , confused reports reached Tokyo that the city of Hiroshima in southwest Honshu had been the target of an air raid , which had leveled the city with a " blinding flash and violent blast " .
Later , U.S. President Harry S. Truman 's broadcast was received , announcing the first use of an atomic bomb , and promising " We are now prepared to obliterate rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have ...
It was to spare the Japanese from utter destruction that the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam .
Their leaders promptly rejected that ultimatum .
If they do not now accept our terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air , the like of which has never been seen on earth . "
At first , some refused to believe the Americans could have managed to build an atomic bomb .
The Japanese knew enough about the potential process to know how very difficult it was ( and the fact that both their Army and Navy had independent atomic - bomb programs had further complicated their own efforts ) .
Admiral Soemu Toyoda , the Chief of the Naval General Staff , argued that even if the Americans had made one , they could not have many more .
More detailed reports of the unprecedented scale of the destruction at Hiroshima were received , but two days passed before the government met to consider the changed situation .
- August 9th , Russia reentered the war by attacking Japan in Manchuria , and Nagasaki was the victim of a second nuclear strike .
---------------------------------------
-----
Now , think about this , if we had n't used the nukes , after reading all of that , is n't it obvious that we were certainly winning the war ?
We were suffocating them with blockades , running constant air raids , and Russia of all people came back into the war , and not on their side .
If we would have dropped both of those bombs off of the shore of Tokyo as a display , it would have saved hundred of thousands of lives , and scared the shit out of Japan ... especially at this point .
News would n't have to travel to Tokyo , it would have happened in Tokyo at the same time as they were looking into a peace agreement and Russia stepped back into the war .
Hundreds of Thousands of lives , which might not seem like much to you Joe , but I 'm sure once you 're put into a situation where you 're life is at risk , you will realize it 's worth .

So it was about a month from the time the Japanese thought about surrendering until they actually surrendered and during that time they were contemplating killing more Americans and were totally OK with their civilian casualties due to conventional weapons .
And our leaders should have known ( through ESP ? ) that the Japanese were going to surrender any day now ( regardless of their stall tactics ) and that victory was assured .
And even though the Japanese appeared to be totally delusional about their ability to continue the war , dropping the bomb on some insignificant island was sure to get them to see reason ( in spite of what we had learned about them up to that point ) .
So what if we wasted one of the few bombs we did have and God knows how long it would have taken to make more ( in case we did n't quite convince them ) , we should have gambled that the Japanese were a reasonable people that can be dealt with .
Well , if a bullfrog had wings , it would n't bust his ass every time he hopped .
But guess what ; a bullfrog does n't have wings so it 's pointless to consider what if scenarios .
The U.S. made a decision based on the information they had at the time and at that time ( given the information they had ) it was the best decision .
The fact that after the decision had been made new information pointed to other alternatives means nothing .
It 's done .

No , it was n't about a month since they started thinking about it , it was about a month since someone spoke about it .
I would imagine it would have taken some time to think about it before bringing it up to a war hungry emperor .
Point is , Russia joined us , if we knew that before the bombing , which we did , why could n't we have waited , and with Russia 's help .
The Soviets kicked Japan 's ass in Operation August Storm in Manchuria , Sakhalin , and the Kuril Islands , and they were planning to invade Hokkaido , the larger island north of Japan , before Operation Downfall ...
If this were true , if Russia was planning to come from the north , and in Operation Downfall were to come from the south ( west ? ) , do you really think they would have kept fighting until they killed 400,000 of our troops .
I do n't know , but I do know that looking at this objectively , we can learn more from it than just accepting it as a possible mistake and just putting it off .
Was it right ?
That 's what we 're talking about .
In this case , we are required to look at things from their view points because , after all , it was war and I 'm sure things would have been very cloudy .
Still , if Hiroshima were to happen anyway , should we have dropped the second on another city three days later without further diplomacy ( other than a radio transmission that basically said " Stop or we 'll blow up your whole island " ) ???
What I mean is , even if the first bombing is just , what about the second ?
I doubt it .

In response to the first part .
Assuming we did give the Japanese citizens a chance to verify for themselves what happened to Hiroshima , what then ?
Their army would have kept on fighting because the civilian population does not control the military and it does n't necessarily follow that the military would have gotten the word if the government did not sanction such a message .
You have to impress the leaders .
And if the devastation of Hiroshima did not impress their leaders enough to act within the alloted time , what does that tell you about the situation ?

If we had n't nuked the Japanese and went on with the invasion not only would a comparable number of Japanese lives be lost but thousands upon thousands of Americans as well .
The Japanese military mindset was that of win or die trying much like the ancient samurais .
This was considered honorable .
They would not have surrendered after the first bombing and more lives in the end would have been lost .

Japan was not going to surrender .

PRINCETON , NJ --
The current political landscape , with the percentage of those identifying themselves as Democrats outnumbering those who identify as Republicans by a 37 % to 28 % margin , provides a significant advantage for Barack Obama 's presidential chances .
These data are based on 5,299 interviews with registered voters conducted as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking during the six - day period of June 5 - 10 , representing the period since the general - election matchup of Obama versus John McCain became definite .
Thirty - seven percent of Americans identify themselves as Democrats , compared to 28 % who identify as Republicans .
Another 34 % say they are independents and do n't choose ( in response to this initial question ) to identify with either party .
Following very well - established patterns in American presidential elections , voter identification as a Republican or Democrat is strongly -- but not totally -- correlated with support for the two parties ' candidates .
Those who identify as Republicans at this juncture appear to be a bit more loyal to their party 's candidate , with 85 % supporting McCain , compared to the 78 % of those who identify as Democrats supporting Obama .
Looked at differently , Democrats have a slightly higher defection rate -- at this point -- than do Republicans .
( Although these data were collected after Hillary Clinton 's announcement that she was suspending her campaign , it is possible that the Democratic defection rate represents some residual anger among Clinton - supporting Democrats , anger that may dissipate between now and November . )
Independents -- who initially do not identify with either party -- break toward Obama by a 46 % to 39 % margin .
( McCain and Obama have been competitive for the independent vote since March . )
When all of these data for June 5 - 10 are put together , the overall vote pattern for this period among registered voters is a six - point margin for Obama over McCain , 48 % to 42 % .
The margin is in Obama 's favor in part because there are more Democrats than Republicans in the sample , which helps compensate for the fact that Democrats are slightly less loyal to Obama than are Republicans to McCain .
Obama 's margin is also based on Obama 's ability to swing independents slightly in his direction .
Hypothetically speaking , if there were no independents in the race , Obama would still win by a five - point margin , 49 % to 44 % -- reflecting the higher percentage of Democratic identifiers in the voting population .
All in all , for McCain to win the popular vote in November , some combination of the following would need to occur :
An increase in the percentage of the voting population who identify as Republicans An increase in the percentage of Republicans who support McCain
An increase in the percentage of the vote McCain receives from those who identify as Democrats
An increase in the support McCain receives among independents A much higher turnout rate for McCain supporters than for Obama supporters
It appears that McCain 's chances of increasing his support among independents may not be extremely high .
The accompanying table shows the split when the 34 % who are independents are asked if they " lean " one way or the other .
This more detailed analysis provides a better understanding of why Obama is leading among independents .
When pressed to say which way they lean , independents tilt toward identifying with the Democratic Party by a significant margin .
The 34 % independent segment breaks down into 15 % who lean Democratic , 11 % who lean Republican , and 8 % who remain " pure " independents and refuse to indicate which way they lean .
Looked at differently , 44 % of the initial independent segment leans Democratic , compared to just 33 % who lean Republican .
These " leaners " are essentially as loyal to their party 's candidate as are those who initially identified with a party without being prompted .
Eighty - one percent of independents who lean Republican support McCain , while 83 % of those who lean Democratic support Obama .
Thus , all in all , this profile of the relationship between party identification with leaners allocated and vote choice reveals a situation similar to the situation before leaners are allocated .
McCain gets a slightly higher 84 % of Republicans with leaners than Obama 's 80 % of Democrats with leaners , but the significantly higher percentage of Democrats in the electorate gives Obama his overall edge .
What about the small sliver of " pure independents " who refuse to admit that they lean toward one party or the other ?
This group constitutes only 8 % of the voting electorate , and is largely an apolitical group .
They are much more likely to be undecided than other voters , but the basic tilt is 35 % to 26 % for McCain over Obama .
This , of course , is not nearly enough to compensate for the large number of Democratic identifiers .
Implications
At this point , Obama 's lead in the general - election popular vote is correlated with the fact that there are more American voters who identify themselves as Democrats than as Republicans .
This allows Obama to compensate for the slightly smaller percentage of those identifying as Democrats who support him than is the case for Republicans who support McCain .
Obama is further helped by the fact that voters who initially identify as independents are more likely to lean toward identifying as Democrats than to lean toward the Republican Party .
McCain does have a slight edge among pure independents , but this is not enough to compensate for these other dynamics .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 5,299 registered voters , aged 18 and older , conducted June 5 - 10 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Philosophy & Religion Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be .
The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world ; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge , truth , good and evil , love , friendship , and much more .
Thus , philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience .
The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting inquiries such as these .
As with philosophy , the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins .
The possibility of a higher being ( or beings ) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought .
Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil , and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior .

Politics , Law & Government
The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries , each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens .
Governments can be classified in any number of ways .
For example , they might be classified by the number of rulers , thus distinguishing government by one ( as in a monarchy or a tyranny ) from government by the few ( in an aristocracy or oligarchy ) and from government by the many ( as in a democracy ) .
Governments can also be classified by mode of succession ; for example , ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession , or it may be determined through elections or by force .
Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows .

Sports & Recreation Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society .
In both team and solo sports , the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and to break record upon record .
The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess .
In modern times , sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry , while other leisure activities , such as card and video games , can be competitive or can just be a way to unwind or socialize .

FOR centuries , illicit poitin has been the only tax - free commodity on Ireland 's islands -- despite the best efforts of the English who first introduced a levy on distilled spirits in 1660 to pay the debts incurred by Cromwell 's wars .
Now , under proposals put forward by Udaras na Gaeltachta , all the Irish islands could become tax havens -- modelled loosely on the tax - free principality of Andorra .
The regional authority responsible for the economic , social and cultural development of the Gaeltacht has proposed a radical plan to the Commission on Taxation recommending a special taxation incentive scheme for islands .
The islands that could benefit from a change in tax status include Tory and Aranmore islands in Co Donegal , Clare Island in Co Mayo , the Aran Islands and Inishbofin in Co Galway , and the Co Cork islands of Cape Clear , Bere Island and Sherkin Island .
Making the islands tax - free would promote economic activity on them and attract people to live there .
The last three censuses taken in Ireland have each shown a decline in population .
One part of the proposal is a pilot scheme that people living on these islands for at least six months of the year would be able to earn € 100,000 a year tax free for 10 years -- even if they earn their money on the mainland .
The exemption would apply to both new and existing businesses on the islands .
Udaras has also proposed having a 100 per cent capital allowances / free depreciation write - off for any equipment or buildings provided for use in a business allowable against non-exempt income and a BES - type tax relief to apply to investors who invest capital in any business located on the islands .
They also propose a VAT - refund scheme to be implemented for community - based activities that require capital expenditure on buildings and fit out .
Padraig O hAolain , CEO of Udaras na Gaeltachta , said : " While the infrastructure of our offshore islands has been substantially upgraded in recent years -- and substantial State investment is currently being made in this sector -- and while access via air and ferry services has been greatly improved , the overall population of the offshore islands continues to decline .
" As far as our function of enterprise promotion is concerned , the most challenging task for us is to create new employment and income - enhancement opportunities for island residents and especially for young islanders and islanders wishing to return to reside on the islands .
We feel this is what holds the key to the future viability of the island communities . "
At the moment , only 3,000 people could be described as permanent residents of the islands .
The proposal is aimed at all islands , both within and outside the Gaeltacht .
Mr O hAolain says the proposal has a relatively modest overall potential cost to the exchequer , but is believed could have the effect of giving a huge boost to the future sustainability of island life .
Europe has a number of tax havens , including the small principality of Andorra , which has a population of just 65,000 .
Companies and individuals pay no taxes in Andorra though there are annual registration fees , rates and property transaction taxes .

The House Judiciary Committee cited Karl Rove for contempt for not appearing at a July 10 committee hearing related to the politicization of the Justice Department , but as has been her habit Speaker Nancy Pelosi could block a final vote .
Rove claimed executive privilege immunity , and did n’t bother to show up for the hearing .
Committee chair Rep. John Conyers said in a memo to his committee , “ Mr. Rove has refused even to appear before the committee and assert whatever privileges that he believes may apply to his testimony , relying on excessively broad and legally insufficient claims of ‘ absolute immunity ’ — never recognized by any court — in declining to appear . ”
The vote to cite Rove was by party lines , 20 - 14 .
Republicans claim that there is no evidence against Rove , and they might not be the Democrats only problem .
In order for Rove to be found in contempt , the full House has to vote on the citation , and there is no evidence that Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) is willing to let this happen .

In a statement about the matter yesterday , Pelosi made no mention of allowing the citation to come to a full vote , “ The Judiciary Committee ’s ongoing investigation of the politicization of the Justice Department , including the effort to obtain testimony of individuals with knowledge of the improper firing of the U.S. Attorneys , must continue .
The American people must find out what happened , and the politicization of law enforcement at the Justice Department must end . ”
Pelosi favors the passage of new legislation , “ I will be asking Chairman Conyers to consider legislation to ensure that the politicization of hiring of career employees at the Justice Department never happens again . ”
This has become a regular pattern with Pelosi .
She favors investigation , not prosecution .
She has taken the same stance with the impeachment question .
Both Pelosi , and her Senate counterpart Harry Reid , routinely block this kind of activity because they are worried about a political backlash from the public .
My hunch is that this dies at the committee level .
With an election coming up in November , Pelosi wo n’t want to risk firing up the Republican base , or the appearance of a political witch hunt .
This is spineless , but typical of the Democratic congressional leadership .
The Hill Story
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has prepared an order to cut the pay of about 200,000 state workers to the federal minimum wage of $ 6.55 an hour until a budget is signed .
Administration officials said Schwarzenegger was expected to sign the order , a draft of which was obtained Wednesday by The Times , early next week as part of an effort to avert a cash crisis .
The deadline for passing a budget was July 1 , and without one soon , the officials said , California may be unable to borrow billions of dollars needed to keep the state solvent .
State Controller John Chiang , asserting that the state has enough money on hand , said through a spokesman that he would not implement such an order .
Chiang ’s office handles payroll for government workers .
The Republican governor ’s controversial plan , likely to be challenged in court by public - employee unions if carried out , would allow the state to defer paying about $ 1 billion a month , administration officials said .
Workers would be repaid their lost earnings once a budget was in place .
Advertisement
As drafted , the order also calls for the state to immediately lay off 21,855 part - time workers , stop overtime payments for almost all employees and cease all hiring until a budget is enacted .
“ Because the Legislature has failed to pass a budget and our state does not have a rainy - day fund , this is one of a number of options we are considering to make sure we have sufficient cash to cover our costs , ” said administration spokesman Matt David .
Until recently , the governor had played a relatively minor role in budget negotiations since offering his revised spending plan in May .
As public frustration over Sacramento ’s handling of the budget has mounted , much of the blame has fallen on him .
His approval rating among voters is 40 % , according to a Field Poll released this week , down from 60 % in December .
The executive order appears intended to show that Schwarzenegger is taking action and to pressure lawmakers to finish work on the budget .
Democrats rely on the major public employee unions to help bankroll their political campaigns , and the public - safety unions that Republicans often look to for support could be affected by his order .

Once the order took effect , most state employees , who are paid once a month , would not see another paycheck until the end of August .
If the budget was passed late in that month , their full salaries would still be reflected in that paycheck .
The response to Schwarzenegger ’s plan from unions was immediate and angry .
“ The governor is turning a budget crisis into a catastrophe , ” said Yvonne Walker , president of Service Employees International Union Local 1000 , which represents 95,000 state workers .
“ How can you tell people , ‘ We will just pay you this amount and you can catch up later ? ’
“ We are in the middle of a housing crisis , and people are losing their mortgages , ” she said .
“ Are they going to issue a notice to mortgage companies that employees will just catch up later ? ”

Walker said she believed the governor ’s plan was illegal , and union attorneys are already drafting a lawsuit to file if the order is signed .
Chiang , a Democrat , said in a statement that the governor ’s order would be unnecessary because the state will have sufficient funds available to cover all its financial obligations through September -- a point on which the administration does not agree .
Officials in Chiang ’s office said the controller would not comply with Schwarzenegger ’s order .
“ I will urge the governor to rethink his proposal , ” Chiang ’s statement said .
Advertisement
“ Cutting workers ’ salaries will do nothing meaningful to improve our cash position or help us make our priority payments , ” the statement said .
He called the order a “ poorly devised strategy to put pressure on the Legislature to enact a budget . ”
Administration officials contend that state law would require the controller to carry out the governor ’s order .
A court battle could ensue if Chiang refused .
Lawmakers so far have shown no sign of agreeing on a budget .
Democrats continue to rally around their plan to close a $ 15.2 - billion deficit with new taxes on the wealthy and corporations , and Republican lawmakers say they will stick to the pledge almost every one of them has signed to vote against tax hikes .
Democratic lawmakers urged Schwarzenegger not to sign the order .

“ I do n’t believe the governor would put public servants in the crossfire of this budget battle , ” said Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) .
Republican legislative leaders issued a statement saying they were working hard to get a budget passed “ to avoid drastic measures like the one that is being proposed ” by the governor .
The state Supreme Court has declared it legal to drop the pay of even union workers down to the federal minimum wage in the event there is no budget , but not if they work overtime .
It is unclear whether the state ’s electronic payroll systems are sophisticated enough to sort out which employees would be eligible to have their pay suspended .
Administration officials say they hope to avoid that problem by suspending almost all overtime .
Only workers whose jobs are vital to public safety would be exempt from the governor ’s order .

Meanwhile , officials at the state treasurer ’s office have said California will need to borrow $ 10 billion sometime in September to have enough cash to make it until the usual flood of tax receipts arrives in the spring .
Securing such a loan takes at least four weeks , they say , and it ca n’t be done until the budget is enacted .

The ability to work together and capture larger prey has allowed social spiders to stretch the laws of nature and reach enormous colony sizes , UBC zoologists have found .
The findings , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , may also explain why social spiders thrive in tropical areas but dwindle with increasing latitude and elevation .
“ The size of organisms tends to be constrained by a scaling principle scientists call ‘ surface to volume ratio , ’ ” says Leticia Avilés , lead author and associate professor in the UBC Dept. of Zoology .
While organisms typically have energetic needs proportional to their volume , they must acquire nutrients through their surface .
“ As the organism grows , this surface to volume ratio declines .
In a way , this is how nature keeps the sizes of various species in check . ”
The same principle may apply to social groups .
The surface area of the three - dimensional webs social spiders use to capture prey does not grow as fast as the number of spiders contained in the nests ; so number of incoming prey per spider declines with colony size .
But Anelosimus eximius , a species of social spider notable for its enormous colony size – some total more than 20,000 individuals – have gained the ability to stretch that law by cooperating and thus capturing increasingly large insects as their colonies grow .
“ The average size of the prey captured by the colony increased 20 - fold as colony size increased from less than 100 to 10,000 spiders , ” says Avilés , who studied the spiders in the wild in Amazonian Ecuador with undergraduate student Eric Yip and graduate student Kimberly Powers .
“ So even though the number of prey falls sharply as the colony grows , the biomass that individual spiders acquire actually increases . ”
The study also found that large prey , while making up only eight per cent of the colony ’s diet , contributed to more than 75 per cent of its nutritional needs .
“ But that only works to a certain point , ” says Avilés , who adds that the biomass of prey consumed by the colony peaks when the colony reaches between 500 and 1,000 individuals .
As for the scarcity of social Anelosimus species in higher elevations and latitudes , “ there simply are n’t enough large insects in those areas to sustain this type of foraging behaviour , ” says Avilés .
Enlarge By Jae C. Hong , AP Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks in New York during one of Barack Obama ?s campaign stops last month .
CREATE A SCENARIO FOR 2008 CREATE A SCENARIO FOR 2008 USA TODAY 's interactive electoral vote tracker lets you build election scenarios , share them with friends and study past election outcomes .
It may be Barack Obama 's party , but that may not prevent an emotional show of support for former rival Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Democratic National Convention later this month .
Aides to Obama , who will formally accept the Democratic nomination in Denver on Aug. 28 , are girding for the possibility that Clinton 's backers will force a roll call vote that would demonstrate the extent of support for the New York senator .
" There 's no perfect solution for anybody , " Steve Hildebrand , Obama 's deputy campaign manager , told USA TODAY this week .
But he expressed confidence Democrats will pull together no matter what the outcome .
" I think we will end up being just fine roll call or no roll call . "
DEMOCRATS : Read rules for ' 08 convention ( pdf file ) Clinton picked up about 18 million votes and nearly 1,900 delegates in her primary battle against Obama .
He got more than 2,250 delegates — more than necessary to clinch .
She conceded to the Illinois senator June 7 and threw her support behind him , but has n't ruled out lending her name to an effort that some ardent supporters are mounting to put her name in nomination at the four - day convention that begins Aug. 25 .
At a California fundraiser last month , Clinton suggested that a roll call would be " a catharsis " for her supporters .
" I happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel their voices were heard and their views were respected , " she told a group of Democrats in Los Altos Hills .
" I think it would be excellent , " said Lorraine Hariton , who hosted the gathering .
Others are opposed .
" I think it would be very divisive , " said Santa Clara County Assessor Larry Stone , who also attended the fundraiser .
Stone , who said he backed Clinton in the primaries , argued that a convention tally of her support would only help the cause of the presumptive Republican nominee .
" John McCain would love it , " he said .
At issue is whether a floor vote on the nomination would help heal or further open wounds left by a bruising primary campaign between two history - making candidates .
Obama is the first African American to win a major party nomination for the presidency ; Clinton is the first woman to have vied seriously for the same post .
To recognize Clinton 's accomplishment , convention organizers have given her a prime - time slot to address the convention on Aug. 26 — 88 years after the 19th Amendment took effect and gave women the right to vote .
Some of Clinton 's supporters are circulating a petition to put her name in nomination .
Democratic
Party rules require the signatures of 300 delegates , with no more than 50 coming from a single state .
The rules also require that the candidate sign the petition .
Whether Clinton will do so is now under negotiation with Obama .
" She 's in a dicey position , " Hildebrand said .
" She 's got a lot of people who worked incredibly hard for her , who dedicated their lives to her mission , her candidacy and who are very passionate about this . "
One of those supporters is Allida Black , a George Washington University historian who said she cashed in her retirement savings to finance travel to 14 states for Clinton .
Black , a Clinton delegate from Virginia , is helping circulate the nominating petition .
" This is not a spite Obama effort , " she said .
" This is for Hillary to get the respect her campaign merits . "
Another Clinton delegate , Rosina Rubin of New York , argued that in acknowledging Clinton 's supporters , the Democratic convention would also be paying tribute to an important constituency .
" Her achievement this year is really a culmination of everything women in politics have done in this country since before we had the right to vote , " Rubin said .

Obama :
It 's too risky not to change Associated Press
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008
Print This Email This SPRINGFIELD , Mo - Democatic presidential contender Barack Obama said Wednesday his Republican rival " thinks we 're on the right track , " drawing a chorus of boos from a swing state audience vocal about the status quo .
" These anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day , " Obama said on a campaign swing in this economically ailing battleground state .
" We can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what we 've been doing .
My opponent , John McCain , thinks we 're on the right track . "
That elicited boos from some of the 1,500 people who filled a Springfield high school gymnasium .
When an AP - Ipsos poll asked the " right track , wrong track " question this month , 77 percent said they thought the country was on the wrong track .
The same poll set President Bush 's approval rating at 28 percent .
Both were records for the AP - Ipsos survey .
" It 's true that change is hard , change is n't easy , " Obama said .
" Nobody here thinks that Bush or McCain has a real answer for the challenges we face so what they 're going to try to do is make you scared about me . "
Change with difficulty was a core theme Democrat Bill Clinton used when he opposed President George H.W. Bush in 1992 , a campaign also fought during tough economic times .
" We do n't need the same old tired answers , " Obama said .
" We need something new . "
Obama said McCain will resort to tired Republican charges that he 's a big - spending liberal , arguing his tax cut plans are aimed at the middle class .
" I want to cut taxes for middle - class families , ordinary folks who are working hard and playing by the rules , " he said .
He compared himself to western legend Wild Bill Hickock , who he said fought a duel in Springfield .
" I 'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes right here , quick draw , " said Obama .
That drew a quick retort from a McCain aide .
" If Barack Obama wants this so - called duel then why did he and his entourage run for the hills when John McCain challenged him to 10 town halls , " said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
Obama responded after shaking hands at a restaurant in Lebanon .
" I do n't hear very much positive from Sen. McCain , " he said .
" He seems to be only talking about me .
You need to ask John McCain what he 's for not just what he 's against . "
Obama was spending the day riding a bus across southwest Missouri , where Republicans have been dominant in recent elections , and arguing that he can bring new regions into play this election cycle because a sour economy is dominating the political landscape .
He faces the challenge of convincing voters in largely rural sections of the country to back his campaign .
After a weeklong overseas trip to burnish his foreign policy credentials , Obama has been working overtime to focus on the economy and overcoming doubts voters may have about the first black man to make a serious bid for the White House .
" It 's a leap , electing a 46 - year - old black guy named Barack Obama , " he said , adding that the message Republicans have for voters is simple : " He does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bill . "
Springfield is represented in the House by Republican Whip Roy Blunt , and its 7th District supported Bush with 67 percent of the vote in 2004 .
Obama traveled with Sen. Claire McCaskill , herself a product of rural Missouri .
She warmed up audiences by reminding them that Obama was elected in Illinois , a heavily rural state outside of Chicago .
" They said a young black guy named Barack Obama could n't get elected to the United States Senate from Illinois , " McCaskill said .
" They were wrong . "
Speaking to The Associated Press , McCaskill said there were gains to be made in rural Missouri .
" The idea here is it makes a difference if you demonstrate to people in Republican strongholds that you want their vote and that you care about them , " she said .
" I do n't think any of us on the campaign are anticipating that Sen.
Obama is going to win southwest Missouri .
The question is how many votes can we get in southwest Missouri . "
Obama spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki was blunt in explaining the strategy .
" What we 're trying to do is go into areas where people are more skeptical , " Psaki said .
" You have to go into the belly of the beast . "

SUMMARY
This essay explores some of the social , political , economic and technological issues that the world may have to face in the mid-21st century .
A central theme is the need to regulate molecular nanotechnology because of its immense abuse potential .
Advanced nanotechnology can be used to build small self - replicating machines that can feed on organic matter - a bit like bacteria but much more versatile , and potentially more destructive than the H - bomb .
The necessity to prevent irresponsible groups and individuals from getting access to nanotechnological manufacturing capability is a prime concern in 2050 .
The essay shows how this quest for containment shapes many aspect of society , most notably via the institution of a global surveillance network .
A dialogue format is used for two reasons .
First , in order to enable several conflicting views to be discussed .
And second , to illustrate how public debates may be conducted at that time .
[ P.S. This essay was written under various external constraints , including that it should deal with the in 2050 , so not too much weight should be put on the time line and some other details . ]
Host : Much has happened over the past fifty years , but what are the changes that really matter ?
Have they been for better or for worse ?
And where are we heading in the next fifty years ?
With us tonight to discuss these questions are three very distinguished polymaths : Emily Brown , CEO of Cisco Systems ; Dr. Chun Ten , technology editor of The Economist ; and Neil Brigge , professor of philosophy at New York University and a director of the Foresight Institute .
Neil , do you think that the human condition has changed over the past half century ?
Neil :
We live longer and healthier lives .
We are much richer .
We have the ability to choose our sensory experiences to a much greater extent than ever before .
Right now , you are watching a smooth - skinned , well - groomed Neil , but the real physical Neil sitting here in my VR - box may be a much less appealing sight - I may not have shaved or washed for a week !
Emily : People are still concerned with how they present themselves , both in physical space and in cyberspace .
The fraction of our income that we spend on personal presentation has been increasing steadily throughout the century .
As it becomes easier to satisfy our material needs , we seem to focus more on what we are in relation to others - there is great demand for what the economists call " positional goods " .
Host :
We are the vainest people ever ?
Emily :
Or the most " people - centered " , depending on how you want to see it .
Chun : I now see a backlash against conspicuous consumption in some communities .
High - status people try to signal their superiority by shunning cosmetic filters and other conveniences that the less well endowed cannot afford to do without .
But this " nudism " , as they call it , is very partial .
It is only a few selected enhancement - options that are being stripped off .
Host :
At the turn of the century , many were concerned about global warming and other ways in which humans were damaging the environment .
Global warming turned out not to be a significant problem , but did this early environmentalist movement have any lasting effects on how things developed ?
Emily : Environmentalist thinking opened a lot of minds to the idea that we are living on this finite planet and that what is done in one part of the sphere can affect what happens on the other side .
" Global conscience " , was perhaps the most beneficial lasting effect .
Remember that it is only in the last twenty years that widespread undernourishment has finally been eliminated .
Of course , bioengineering and nanotechnology were essential tools in achieving that , and this helped reshape environmentalist thinking .
At the turn of the century , many environmentalists were very suspicious of new technology .
Now most people accept that it is thanks to technological progress that we are able to sustain a world population of eleven billions and still preserve significant parts of the natural environment .
Neil :
What also happened was that the early focus on the environment gradually widened to include all aspects of human life .
Today we have the debate between transhumanists , who are enthusiastic about transforming the human condition , and naturalist conservatives who are happy about technology as long as it does n’t change human nature too much .
While most naturalists will take life - extension supplements , they do n’t approve of the use of mood - drugs or cosmetic psychopharmacology .
Chun :
The emergence of law and order in the international plane - " global conscience " as Emily calls it - is probably the reason why we are still here today .
There is still no effective global immune system that could defend against malicious self - replicating nanomachines .
Without the steadily improving global surveillance network , some terrorist group or scientifically - literate madman might long ago have made their own nanotech assembler and manufactured a " virus " that could have destroyed the biosphere and eradicated intelligent life from this planet .
Neil : Indeed , and this could still happen .
It just takes an ill will and a single security breach somewhere .
We must just hope the surveillance network improves rapidly enough that this will never happen .
Host :
How was it possible for the surveillance network to be put in place so quickly ?
Chun : Well , a lot of the infrastructure was already there .
Companies monitored customers , the police monitored public places , the military monitored foreign countries .
Once gnat - cameras became cheap and you could link everything up to data bases and face - recognition software , surveillance networks began covering larger and larger territories in more and more detail .
The other part of the explanation is that policy - makers could become persuaded by the necessity to regulate nanotechnology .
And here I think better collective decision - making institutions played a key role .
Idea futures is a good example of this .
As you know , idea futures is the market where speculators place bets on hypotheses about future scientific or technological breakthroughs , political events and so forth .
Trading prices - the odds - in idea futures markets gradually became recognized as authoritative estimates of the probabilities of possible future events .
In the twentieth century , policymakers would sometimes commission the opinion of bodies of experts that they appointed , but it turns out that the market is much better at making these predictions than politically selected committees .
Such markets were once banned under anti-gambling laws in most places .
Only gradually were exceptions granted , first for a stock market , then for various commodities and derivatives markets , but only in this century did we see the rise of wide - ranging free markets with low transaction costs , where speculators could trade on most any claim .
It ’s hard to overestimate how important this was in making society ’s decision - making a bit more rational .
Neil : I agree that this was important .
The tragedies of the tens and twenties , where genetically engineered biological viruses were used to kill millions , also helped prepare the world .
People have seen the damage that a malicious guy can do with self - replicating organisms .
And nanotech is much , much more powerful .
I think we have been incredibly lucky so far .
Maybe we are witnessing the result of what philosophers call an observational selection effect .
Maybe most civilizations in our infinite universe destroy themselves when they develop nanotechnology , but only the lucky ones remain to wonder about their luck .
So our success so far should not make us complacent .
Emily :
It ’s amazing how quickly people have got used to the idea that everything they do can now be known by anybody who is interested in finding out .
When you are going on a date with someone , you can check out their previous relationships , and so on .
If you had suggested this to somebody fifty years ago , they ’d have been horrified !
They would probably have referred to it as Brave New World , or Orwell ’s 1984 , with Big Brother watching you all the time .
But it ’s like a nudist colony : when everybody is naked , the embarrassment quickly wears off .
So we had all these little secrets that we thought were so important , little vices .
But when we can see that everybody has similar little vices , our standards adapt and we become more tolerant .
As long as you ’re not doing anything really bad or break the law , you do n’t have to worry .
And the streets are much safer now .
Chun :
The key to preventing global surveillance from turning into global suppression is to always insist on basic liberties and to keep government and law - enforcement agencies under constant scrutiny .
It is crucial that we make sure that the system is transparent in both directions , so that we can watch who ’s watching us .
Emily :
Yet there are still rumblings about it being a plot by the technologically advanced countries to monopolize the power coming from the nanotech revolution .
Chun :
The logic is crystal clear to every honest thinker .
Since there is as yet no general defense against nanotech attacks that could potentially destroy the biosphere , such attacks must be prevented at any cost .
The only way to do that is to limit the number of powers who have nanotechnology .
If a single evil madman gets it , then it ’s " game over " .
Emily : I agree that is a good argument , and that we have to limit access to nanotechnology until we have developed reliable defenses .
But that does n’t mean that the leading powers do n’t derive an unfair advantage from this technological monopoly .
The people who are excluded from building nano - assemblers have a right to be compensated .
Current transfer payments are nowhere near what they are entitled to .
Chun :
It is also a problem of intellectual property laws , which has been a burning issue for quite some time now .
- [ Emily Brown disappears ]
Host :
It appears that we have lost transmission from Emily - she was on her yacht .
Hope she has n’t run into bad weather - Ok , let ’s turn our gaze towards the future .
What lies ahead ?
Neil , I know that you have expressed pessimism about the future -
Neil : I ’m not a pessimist , but I ’m concerned that we might have underestimated the risk that nanotech could proliferate before we can build defenses .
There has been a series of incidents already .
As technological know - how spreads , it may be harder and harder to make sure that no rogue group develops an assembler .
Building an effective global immune system for self - replicating nanomachines is a very , very difficult challenge .
It has to be present everywhere , on land , sea , and in the atmosphere .
It must avoid attacking biological life forms .
And it has to work 100 % of the time .
We are very far from being able to do that at the present time .
Chun : Surveillance technology is improving rapidly , however .
Neil : Yes , but what if someone develops a good counter - surveillance technology ?
Intelligence agencies are now discussing proposals for monitoring and preventing research in that field as well .
But the problem is that the task is so ill - defined .
Who can say what research might potentially lead to some way of tricking the global surveillance network ?
Host :
Are there any idea futures claims that measure the probability of these things ?
Neil : Yes , but they do n’t really tell us much .
You see , who would want to bet on the hypothesis that civilization will be destroyed ?
If you are right , you would not get paid !
It is disconcerting to note that what economists call the time discount factor seems to have been going up .
( The time discount factor is a measure of how much more value people place on a present good compared to having the same good at some point later in the future . )
That could be interpreted as people being worried about whether they will be around to benefit from their savings .
[ Emily Brown reappears ]
Host : Welcome back , Emily !
Emily : I ’m terribly sorry !
I ’m on a yacht here , and my son was playing with the antenna - I ’m so sorry !
Host : Do n’t worry .
My attention - meter shows that the intermezzo increased our eyeball - count .
That ’s why we are doing this live .
Our viewers like it when things go wrong !
You should give your kid a bonus !
Emily : I do n’t think so !
Host :
We were talking about the future .
Neil was just trying to convince us that he is not a pessimist , and he went on to explain all the excellent reasons we have for thinking that there is a great risk that we will all be turned into gray goo by nanoreplicators running amok .
Is that a fair summary , Neil ?
Neil : I suppose so .
But on the other hand , if we do manage to avoid doomsday , things could turn out really nice .
That ’s why I do n’t call myself a pessimist , because if we are careful we might achieve a great outcome .
Chun :
My grandfather is 102 years old and he is quite active .
This is all thanks to life - extension .
We can only dream of all the wonderful things that will become possible when we learn to redesign and expand our minds .
There is more to lose than ever before .
Having got this far , we really must try to make sure that we do n’t destroy ourselves with rogue nanotechnology , even if it means holding some types of developments back temporarily .
Neil :
There are many people who wo n’t make it .
Over a hundred thousand people deanimate everyday , many due to aging - related ailments .
More than two thirds of the world ’s population still do n’t have a cryonics contract !
When they deanimate , instead of having the information in their brains preserved by freezing or vitrification , they are just cremated or buried .
For worms , there certainly are such things as free meals !
And this at a time when in the idea futures market there is more than a 50 % chance of reanimation of a human brain within three years !
This preventable loss of human life , day after day , year after year , almost makes the two world wars or the Baghdad flu insignificant by comparison .
Chun :
The difference is that this is largely self - selected death .
It ’s a price you pay for freedom of religion .
Neil :
For some people that is true .
But there are millions who simply cannot afford a cryonics contract , or do n’t have enough education to understand what the options are .
Now , I ’m not suggesting that we should force anybody to have themselves frozen when they deanimate , but I think we have a duty to provide enough information and financial help so that each individual can at least make an informed decision .
Host :
Wo n’t overpopulation be a big problem if all the people who are currently in cryonic suspension are suddenly reanimated ?
Chun : Actually , there are n’t that many of them .
About three billion people have made arrangements to have themselves suspended when they deanimate , but only about 150 million people have been suspended to date .
Neil : Idea futures indicate that if these people are reanimated , it will be through being uploaded into computers .
It looks much more feasible to disassemble these vitrified brains cell by cell , molecule by molecule , scanning off the neural network , and then run an emulation of that neural network on a computer .
In vitro repair is harder than in silico repair - that is , doing it in a computer simulation .
And I , for one , would much rather be uploaded than having my biological brain repaired .
I already spend most of my time in virtual reality , and I ’d like the security of being able to make a back - up copy of my mind every hour or so .
If for some reason I want to manipulate physical objects , I would rent a robot body that was suitable for what I wanted to do .
Emily : I can understand those who are scared of uploading .
I ’m scared of it myself .
Who can guarantee that a brain emulation would truly be conscious ?
And even though our virtual reality is pretty good at vision and sound , I still think it ca n’t compete with the meatspace in the other sensory modalities .
Virtual sex is great , but I prefer to touch my husband ’s body directly .
Neil :
The other sensory modalities of virtual reality will work much better for uploads .
It is easier to do it for uploads , because you can directly activate neurons in their sensory cortices .
You do n’t have to build these complicated mechanical devices we have now to stimulate our body surfaces .
Emily : I still see it as a last resort .
I would rather be an upload than be dead , but I think that as long as my biological body is functioning well , I ’ll stick with that .
Neil :
There could be huge advantages to being among the first uploads .
I was attending a neurocomputation conference last week , and I was talking to several groups there who are studying hypothetical ways of enhancing the intellectual abilities of an upload , by adding new neurons and new connections and so forth .
If uploads could become more intelligent than humans , I would prefer to be an upload .
Also , computing power increases .
There is an idea futures claim that within two years of the first human upload , there will be an upload running at a clock speed one hundred times greater than a biological brain .
That means the upload will think a hundred times faster than we do !
Last time I checked , this claim was trading at better than even odds .
Chun :
Since uploads are software , they can easily make copies of themselves .
We could see a population explosion with a vengeance , and we might have to brush up on Malthus again .
Malthus was a late eighteenth century political economist who argued that unless population control is instituted , then population growth will eventually annihilate any improvement in the standard of living for the masses that economic growth has brought about .
Even rapid space colonization , which has n’t been economical so far , but which idea futures indicate is likely to begin within a decade , will not be able to keep up with a free - breeding population of uploads .
Emily : Uploading raises huge ethical and political issues .
Not to speak of the legal challenges .
If you are an upload and you make a copy of yourself , so there are now two almost identical implementations of you , who is married to your husband ?
We have only scratched the surface of this problematique .
I would like to see a moratorium on uploading experiments and some form of artificial intelligence research until we have a better understanding of where we are going .
We are playing with fire .
Host : I ’m afraid we ’re out of time .
It ’s been fascinating .
I suppose we ’ll see over the next few years how this plays out .
Thank you all for participating .
Neil , I leave the final word with you .
First - class Macros Have Types
Abstract
In modern Scheme , a macro captures the lexical environment where it is defined .
This creates an opportunity for extending Scheme so that macros are first - class values .
The key to achieving this goal , while preserving the ability to compile programs into reasonable code , is the addition of a type system .
Many interesting things can be done with first - class macros , including the construction of a useful module system in which modules are also first - class .
Here is the paper as it appeared in POPL 2000 : In PostScript ( 59K ) .
Here is the current code distribution .
Anyone trying to understand this code may find it useful to start by reading this earlier system of mine that uses many of the same techniques for implementing macros , and that is much more extensively commented .

Indicted Saudi Gets $ 80 Million US Contract Financier has been indicted for his alleged role in US scandal .
June 4 , 2008  --
The US military has awarded an $ 80 million contract to a prominent Saudi financier who has been indicted by the US Justice Department .
The contract to supply jet fuel to American bases in Afghanistan was awarded to the Attock Refinery Ltd , a Pakistani - based refinery owned by Gaith Pharaon .
Pharaon is wanted in connection with his alleged role at the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) , and the CenTrust savings and loan scandal , which cost US tax payers $ 1.7 billion .
The Saudi businessman was also named in a 2002 French parliamentary report as having links to informal money transfer networks called hawala , known to be used by traders and terrorists , including Al Qaeda .
Interestingly , Pharaon was also an investor in President George W. Bush 's first business venture , Arbusto Energy .
A spokesman for the FBI said Pharaon was not wanted in connection with the French report , but confirmed he was still sought by the US Justice Department .
" Ghaith Pharaon is an FBI fugitive indicted in both the BCCI and CENTRUST case , " said Richard Kolko , a spokesman for the FBI .
" If anyone has information on his location , they are requested to contact the FBI or the US Embassy . "
The US military purchases jet fuel from Attock through the contractor Supreme Fuels , according to a US government website .
The $ 80 million contract for 2008 was posted this week on a US government website .
Attock supplied the US military more than $ 40 million in jet fuel in 2007 , according to another spreadsheet posted on the site .
An official at Attock , who did not wish to be named , confirmed the refinery was supplying thousands of tons of jet fuel to the US base at Bagram Air Base every month .
The US military has not responded to requests for comment .
Pharaon could not be reached for comment .

Bionic Humans
Unlike chimpanzee brains , the human brain shrinks with age .
Age - related loss of brain volume may be the price we pay for outliving our reproductive years .
( Image credit : National Institute of General Medical Sciences , Arthur Toga , University of California , Los Angeles )
Scientists are getting closer to creating a bionic human , or at least a $ 6 million one .
Today , we can replicate or restore more organs and various sundry body parts than ever before .
From giving sight to the blind to creating a tongue more accurate than any human taste bud , gentlemen , we have the technology .
Bionic eyes
The patient would wear a special set of glasses with a small digital camera mounted in the lens .
The camera would have a wire that communicates to an external signal processor that in turn would translate the camera image into neural impulses and transmit them wirelessly to an implanted stimulator .
The stimulator would drive an electrode , surgically placed in the brain , delivering images to the visual system .
( Image credit : John Pezaris , adapted with permission from D.H. Hubel )
When you 're blind , being able to see even the basics of light , movement and shape can make a big difference .
Both the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis , currently in FDA trials , and a system being developed by Harvard Research Fellow Dr. John Pezaris record basic visual information via camera , process it into electronic signals and send it wirelessly to implanted electrodes .
The Argus II uses electrodes implanted in the eye , which could help people who 've lost some of their retinal function .
Dr. Pezaris ' system , still in the early stages of research , would bypass the eyes entirely , sending visual data straight to the brain .
Both systems will work best with people who could once see because their brains will already know how to process the information .
" The visual brain depends on visual experience to develop normally , " Pezaris explained .
Regrown bone
( Image credit : UCLA )
Since the 1960s , researchers have known about proteins that can prompt bone tissue to grow its own patches for missing or damaged parts .
Unfortunately , that technology never worked perfectly , often growing the wrong type of tissue or growing bone where bone should n't be .
In 2005 , researchers at UCLA solved the problem , using a specially designed protein capable only of triggering growth in specific types of cells .
Called UCB - 1 , the protein is now used to grow new bone that can fuse and immobilize sections of vertebrae , relieving severe back pain in some patients .
Portable pancreas
( Image credit : stock.xchange )
An artificial pancreas , capable of monitoring a person 's blood sugar and adjusting the level of insulin to meet their body 's needs , will likely be on the market within a few short years , said Aaron Kowalski , director of strategic research projects at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation .
Kowalski said the device would initially be a combination of two existing technologies : an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor .
The contraption could help insulin - dependent diabetics lead more normal lives and make it easier for them to avoid the disfiguring and life - threatening side effects of having too little or too much blood sugar .
Inhuman taste
( Image credit : stock.xchng )
The tongue can be a powerful tool , but also a highly subjective one , said Dean Neikirk , professor of computer and electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin .
When food companies want to create the same flavor every time , they turn to the electronic tongue , a device developed by Neikirk and his team to analyze liquids and pick out their exact chemical make - up .
Neikirk 's tongue uses microspheres , tiny sensors that change color when exposed to a specific targets , such as certain kinds of sugars .
The result is a system that can't replace the person who says , " This tastes good ! " but can make sure the chemistry of good taste is reliably replicated .
New limbs
The i-LIMB has flexible hydraulic drives are located directly in the movable finger joints .

Amputees can now use a prosthetic arm the same way they 'd use a real one :
By the power of thought .
Developed by Dr. Todd Kuiken of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago , the " bionic arm " is connected to the brain by healthy motor nerves that used to run into the patient 's missing limb .
These nerves are re-routed to another area of the body , such as the chest , where the nerve impulses they carry can be picked up by electrodes in the bionic arm .
When the patient decides to move her hand , the nerves that would have sent the signal to real hand send it to the prosthetic one instead .
Now , Dr. Kuiken 's team is working on improving the arm , using surviving sensory nerves to communicate the feeling of temperature , vibration and pressure from the bionic arm to the patient 's brain .
Smart knee
( Image credit : Ossur )
The knee is n't a part of the body you 'd expect to think for itself , but the RHEO , a prosthetic knee developed by MIT artificial intelligence researchers Hugh Herr and Ari Wilkenfeld , really does have a mind of its own .
Earlier electronic knee systems usually had to be programmed by a technician when the patient first put them on .
The RHEO knee , on the other hand , creates realistic , comfortable motion on its own , by learning the way the user walks and by using sensors to figure out what kind of terrain they 're walking on .
The system makes walking with a prosthetic leg easier and less exhausting .
Wearable kidney
( Image credit : 3Dscience.com )
For people with failing kidneys , basic necessities of life like removing toxins from the blood and keeping fluid levels balanced requires hours hooked up to a dialysis machine the size of a clothes dryer .
But a new , portable artificial kidney , small and light enough to fit on a belt system , could change that .
Despite its small size , the automated , wearable artificial kidney ( AWAK ) , designed by Martin Roberts and David B.N.
Lee of UCLA , actually works better than traditional dialysis because it can be used 24 hours a day , seven days a week , just like a real kidney .
Artificial cells
( Image credit : Todd McDevitt , Georgia Tech . )
Sometimes , when you need to deliver drugs to just the right spot in the body , a pill or an injection wo n't cut the mustard .
Daniel Hammer , professor of bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania , has a better method : artificial cells , made from polymers , which can mimic the ease with which white blood cells travel through the body .
Called c , these fake cells could deliver drugs directly where they 're needed , making it easier and safer to fight off certain diseases , including cancer .
Old man , new penis
Tularemia , or rabbit fever , can be spread from rabbits , raccoons , skunks or other small mammals .
( Image credit : Stock.xchng . )
Erectile dysfunction can take the fun out of a man 's life , but Anthony Atala and his team at Wake Forest University have come up with a method that could put the spring back in many a guy's , uh , step .
In 2006 , Atala succeeded in growing new corpora cavernosa , the spongy tissue that fills with blood during an erection , for male rabbits who'd had theirs removed .
The new tissue was grown from the rabbits ' own cells and , after a month , the bunnies were back to doing what they do best .
Prosthetics for your brain

Replacing a part of your brain is n't as simple as replacing a limb , but in the future it could be .
Theodore Berger , a professor at the University of Southern California , created a computer chip that could take the place of the hippocampus , a part of the brain which controls short - term memory and spatial understanding .
Frequently damaged by things like Alzheimer 's and strokes , a hippocampus implant could help maintain normal function in people who'd otherwise be severely disabled .
Berger is still testing this implant , but he'd like to see more .
He even wrote a book , " Toward Replacement Parts for the Brain , " in 2005 .
All problems can be solved by adding another layer of abstraction , except the problem of having too many layers of abstraction .

During my presentation at RubyFringe , I shared a question that has been swirling around in my brain for a while :
Are IDE features really language smells ?
I do n’t think it ’s an original thought .
If nothing else , it ’s a corollary to what I believe to be true about many of the GoF design patterns :
Many of them are workarounds , ways to Greenspun missing language features .
Now , this is probably not the case for all IDE features , and in truth it may be that there are some features which could be implemented in either the language or the IDE , but the IDE may be the best place to put them .
But there is a fairly large class of IDE features that strike me as language workarounds .
One of them is definitely the ability to spit out a lot of boilerplate .
If you need a lot of code written , you ought to be able to get your programming language to do it for you , not your IDE .
There is room for people to disagree about this .
There are some who feel ( Strawman alert ! ) that programs consisting of large numbers of simple elements are easier to understand than programs consisting of a small number of highly abstract elements .
Those folks feel an IDE gives you the ease of writing a program quickly plus the ease of reading that same program quickly .
They feel that abstractions make the program easier to write but harder to read .
I happen to disagree with this , and if you have been reading this weblog for more than a couple of days you have already read why my experience leads me down a different path .
Although in deference to my colleagues with different views , I offer this quote : Anyone who has dealt with an hammer factory will agree .
So back to “ L. ” Two speakers before me , Giles Bowkett gave his excellent Archaeopteryx — um — presentation .
I hesitated over that word , because I could just as easily say performance .
Performances are terrific entertainment , but they sometimes obscure the message behind them .
I want to say outright that while this is true of many other subjects , I felt it worked for Giles because the subject of his presentation was software development as a how rather than a what , and for Giles the “ what ” is performance .
( Giles got a standing “ O , ” and many people might be tempted to rush out and make their presentations just as stimulating ( 400 + in - your - face slides punctuated with loud , driving drum and bass ) .
Be sure that your material matches your presentation style !
If not , people may walk away saying “ Wow , amazing , but what exactly did she say ? ” I think it worked for Giles and that ’s quite an accomplishment . )
Now really , back to “ L. ” Giles is one of the people using closures in Ruby .
Meaning , he is passing functions around and storing functions in objects .
I am not going to try to say exactly what Archaeopteryx does , so I will describe this style of programming using an imaginary companion program that creates walking bass lines .
I will call it Troody Let ’s simplify things greatly and say that Troody will only ever play in perfect 4 - 4 time and further that Troody only ever play one of the eight notes in a particular chord ’s standard scale .
The probability of playing each of those notes on any one “ beta ” could be represented as an array with eight elements , like this : [ .35 , .05 , .1 , .05 , .25 , .05 , .1 , .05 ] .
You can imagine passing arrays like this around in Troody .
For example , we can pass this array to an object that actually plucks the strings : Plucker.new.start_plucking ( [ 0.35 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.05 , 0.25 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.05 ] ) .
Let ’s try writing a naïve Troody Plucker : You pass it a set of probabilities , it produces bass notes .
But stop , that ’s so procedural .
Let ’s learn from a flying creature , let ’s learn from Archaeopteryx .
Instead of passing arrays , let ’s pass lambdas , like this : lambda { [ .35 , .05 , .1 , .05 , .25 , .05 , .1 , .05 ] } .
Now whenever Troody needs the probability of something , we call the function with . call or Ruby ’s [ ] alternative syntax .
So now we write Plucker.new.start_plucking(lambda { [ .35 , .05 , .1 , .05 , .25 , .05 , .1 , .05 ] }) Our new Plucker code is the same as the old , except we write :
We now call the probs lambda when we need a note .
That ’s it , we ’ve added a .call call .
What does that get us ?
Well , here ’s one thing :
If we want the probability to change over time , our function can do that , and we do n’t have to rewrite our start_plucking method to handle the idea .
For example , here ’s a probability lambda that usually plays the same way but from time to time decides it ought to play pedal notes ( refactoring to OO is an optional exercise ) :
Thanks to the way we ’ve separated the probabilities from the plucking , we do not need to subclass Plucker to try a different playing style in Troody .
As Giles pointed out , this is the Strategy Pattern .
We are making different kinds of pluckers by encapsulating the logic of what to pluck in something we pass to a plucker .
Archaeopteryx appears to do this everywhere .
There are lambdas paramaterized by lambdas , lambdas that return lambdas … This creates a problem .
Imagine a programing language where all the keywords are in upper case : IF foo THEN bar ELSE bizzat .
Try reading such a program aloud , and you end up shouting the punctuation but speaking the words .
This is wrong !
We should be shouting the words and whispering the punctuation !
And the problem with Ruby ’s lambdas is that if you use a lot of them the word lambda really starts to stand out .
So Giles fixed this by aliasing it to L : and using [ ] instead of .call ( ) : Much nicer , and as Giles pointed out , this is an example of Ruby ’s strength .
If you have a program that rarely uses lambdas , you probably want lambdas to stand out when you use them , so you do n’t alias lambdas to L and you use the call method , not the square brackets .
But if you use lambdas a lot , it ’s a win to abbreviate things .
Okay , we ’re talking about “ L. ” Good .
Now in my talk , I said that abbreviating lambda to L was a code smell .
I was wrong !
Giles , my bad !!
What I actually think is that needing to abbreviate lambda to L is a language smell .
Very different .
If you show me a Java program and you show me Strategy Pattern , I should n’t say it ’s a code smell .
I should say too bad for you that you need all that boilerplate when Ruby lets you do that with the word lambda and a pair of curly braces .
So now to “ L : ” Giles , if lambdas are integral to Archaeopteryx , if they are so woven into the fabric of what Archaeopteryx does that you want the keyword “ lambda ” to fade away , I honestly think this is a place where the language could help you .
For example , what if Ruby had call - by - name semantics ?
You could write :
And you would get the same behaviour as if you were using lambdas .
That ’s it , that ’s what I should have said on stage : any time you are working around your language — whether in your IDE , or by modifying open classes , or by abbreviating things — that ’s a place where we should step back , where we should ask if our language is missing something .
The answer may very well be “ no . ”
But we ought to at least ask the question .
While that seepage is not yet evident in the Consumer Price Index , Fed policy makers , in the statement they issued after the June 25 meeting , suggested that inflation in the weeks ahead could be as troubling as any economic weakness .
It was the first time this year they had given the two equal billing .
The June statement said : “ In the light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations , uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high . ”
The emphasis on inflation reflected in part the views of Mr. Fisher , and one or two others on the Fed ’s policy making open market committee .
They argue in effect that as prices for food and fuel outrun incomes , American workers will somehow find the bargaining power to get raises and their employers , in turn , will raise prices to offset the additional wage costs , setting off an inflationary wage - price spiral .
That last happened during the first great oil crisis , in the 1970s , when workers had far more bargaining power than they do today .
Whatever the future holds , seven weeks after the policy makers ’ last meeting , in late June , the surge in food and oil prices has not spread to the multitude of other items in the price index .
Indeed , oil prices have declined in the last two weeks .
The economy , on the other hand , appears to have weakened , suggesting to most Wall Street forecasters that an increase in the federal funds rate  to reduce inflation pressures by slowing the economy  will not be forthcoming from the Fed until early next year .
“ You can make the argument that the inflation risks are a little less than in June and the growth outlook a little worse , ” an economist at Lehman Brothers , Michelle Meyer , said , adding : “ We are starting to see signs that consumers are pulling back even faster than we expected .
We thought the tax rebates would really boost consumption in the third quarter and we are not seeing that . ”
Device Creates Energy , Fuel , and Usable Compost from Trash
August 13th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
If you ’ve ever seen the movie Idiocracy , you may have a vague fear of giant landfills toppling over and spilling into the streets .
Fortunately , that fear may never become a reality now that the Powermaster ReCyclone is available .
The ReCyclone works by grinding trash into small pieces , thereby reducing landfill space up to 97 percent .
Trash compacted by the ReCyclone can be used to create energy or compost material — organic waste becomes diesel fuel , and plastic becomes oil .
The machine can grind up any piece of waste ranging from 20 microns to 12 inches .
For some perspective , the ReCyclone can get more gold out of electronic devices than from a gold mine ( one metric ton of circuit boards contains between 80 and 1,500 grams of gold , which is 40 to 800 times the concentration of gold available in gold ore mined in the United States ) and 1 kilogram of plastic recycled in the machine can yield 95 percent of 1 liter of diesel .
Essentially , the machine gives any piece of trash the chance for a second life as a renewable resource .
Possible uses for the technology are seemingly endless .
Not only can the ReCyclone create space in already overcrowded landfills , but it can also reduce industrial waste from factories and help out in disaster relief efforts by reducing debris .
To see the ReCyclone in all its glory , check out this YouTube video .

In discussion of McCain 's painful fumbling over why health insurance covers Viagra but not birth control , The Situation Room panel of Wolf Blitzer , Gloria Borger , Stephen Hayes and Jack Cafferty debate the position between a rock and a hard place that McCain finds himself , eager to win over those feminist Clinton supporters but hesitant to speak out against that mainstay of the Republican platform : restricting women 's reproductive freedom .
Ignoring for the moment that CNN cannot bother to have a single pundit on for " balance " from the left against The Weekly Standard 's Hayes and US News ' Gloria Borger , it 's Jack Cafferty who issues the befuddling " answer " to McCain 's predictament :
CAFFERTY : Well , you know , the answer is Viagra is used to treat a medical condition , erectile dysfunction .
Birth control is a lifestyle choice .
And that 's why insurance companies do n't reimburse for it unless pregnancy represents a danger for the woman .
And then there 's a gray area where you can do a negotiation .
Excuse me ?
I know that most men do n't have a huge well of knowledge on the workings of a woman 's body ( any more than I completely understand all of your equipment ) , but I think that in absence of knowledge , it might be smarter to avoid definite declarations like that .
Oral contraceptives are absolutely used to treat medical conditions :
Although they are most commonly prescribed to prevent pregnancy , birth control pills are also used to treat a variety of menstrual disorders including amenorrhea ( absence of menstruation ) , dysmenorrhea ( abnormally painful menstruation ) and hypermenorrhea ( abnormally Menstruation is the periodic shedding of the lining of the uterus , causing bloody vaginal discharge .
heavy menstrual bleeding ) .
They may also be prescribed to treat a number of other conditions , including polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) , hirsutism ( abnormal hair growth ) and endometriosis .
In addition , birth control pills may be taken to regulate irregular menstrual cycles and to help in the transitional period prior to menopause .
In addition to preventing pregnancy and treating various medical conditions , birth control pills also offer women a number of significant health benefits , including a decreased risk of colorectal , ovarian and endometrial cancers .
And since when is the life of a woman to be considered a " gray area " for negotiation ?
But there 's no gray area about a man 's desire to get it up , nor any consideration to the consequences of what happens when he can ?
Jack , you disappoint me .
Transcripts below the fold :
BLITZER : Planned Parenthood is seizing on a stumble by John McCain when he was asked about insurance coverage for birth control and Viagra .
Let 's talk about that with once again , our senior political analyst , Gloria Borger , Jack Cafferty and Stephen Hayes of " The Weekly Standard " .
Here 's the ad that Planned Parenthood is now running , guys .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP , PLANNED PARENTHOOD AD )
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Ever use birth control ?
Then you 'll want to hear this .
QUESTION : It 's unfair .
Health insurance companies cover Viagra , but not birth control .
Do you have an opinion on that ?
MCCAIN : I do n't know enough about it to give you an informed answer .
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Planned Parenthood Action Fund is responsible for the content of this ad .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BLITZER : All right , so , Gloria , let me start with you .
What do you think ?
Is this going to be an effective ad , because Planned Parenthood is running it in several of these so - called swing states ?
BORGER : I think what was clearly on John McCain 's mind is that he did n't want to talk about Viagra and that 's why you saw him in such agony during this .
But , you know , McCain is trying to get those women voters that say that they 're alienated from Obama , they were supporting Hillary Clinton .
And , you know , this is not the way for him to get young women voters .
He may have a lot of the Viagra voters , but he needs those young women if he 's going to try and win the election ( INAUDIBLE ) .
BLITZER : Steve , what do you think ?
HAYES : Well , you know , you could see McCain just struggling to come up with any kind of an answer .
( LAUGHTER )
HAYES : I think he was probably thinking , jeez , on the one hand , I really need women voters .
I do n't want to say anything that will offend them .
On the other hand , I 'm essentially a conservative .
I might make the point that maybe the federal government should n't be in the business of funding , you know , things for erectile dysfunction or birth control .
BORGER : Or -- right .
BLITZER : Jack ?
CAFFERTY : Well , you know , the answer is Viagra is used to treat a medical condition , erectile dysfunction .
Birth control is a lifestyle choice .
And that 's why insurance companies do n't reimburse for it unless pregnancy represents a danger for the woman .
And then there 's a gray area where you can do a negotiation .
But this is not going to help John McCain .
It brings to mind his opposition to freedom of choice .
He 's a pro-life guy .
You take a look at the Justices on the Supreme Court , you put McCain in office , you replay this ad from Planned Parenthood , you can figure out what kind of justices are going to be appointed if he 's the next president .
BORGER : And , by the way , this whole thing was started by one of McCain 's surrogates , Carly Fiorina , who pointed out this imbalance between insurance companies paying for Viagra and not paying for birth control .
So I 'm sure John McCain was kind of scratching his head .
BLITZER : All right .
Let 's have a -- let 's have a laugh .
Now here 's a rate of progress we could get used to .
Nary a month after Pioneer trumpeted a 400 GB Blu-ray Disc , out pops another press release from the firm boasting about a 500 gigger with a score of layers .
Based on research at its Tokyo headquarters , specifications have been drafted for an incredibly capacious 500 GB BD .
Granted , this very company already had plans for a 500 GB optical disc nearly four years ago , but there 's no time like the present to make this stuff a reality , right ?

( CNN ) --
A man , incensed that a 6 - year - old girl chose to walk through a path reserved for upper caste villagers , pushed her into burning embers , police in north India said Wednesday .
She was seriously burned .
Dalits , or " untouchables , " are victims of discrimination in India despite laws aimed at eliminating prejudice .
The girl is a Dalit , or an " untouchable , " according to India 's traditional caste system .
India 's constitution outlaws caste - based discrimination , and barriers have broken down in large cities .
Prejudice , however , persists in some rural areas of the country .
The girl was walking with her mother down a path in the city of Mathura when she was accosted by a man in his late teens , said police superintendent R.K. Chaturvedi .
" He scolded them both and pushed her , " Chaturvedi said .
The girl fell about 3 to 4 feet into pile of burning embers by the side of the road .
The girl remained in critical condition Wednesday .
The man confessed to the crime and was charged with attempted murder , Chaturvedi said .
The assault took place in India 's Uttar Pradesh state , about 150 km ( 93 miles ) south of Delhi .
The state is governed by Mayawati , a woman who goes by one name and is India 's most powerful Dalit politician .
Her Bahujan Samaj Party seeks to get more political representation for Dalits , who are considered so low in the social order that they do n't even rank among the four classes that make up the caste system .
Hindus believe there are five main groups of people , four of which sprang from the body of the first man .
The Brahmin class comes from the mouth .
They are the priests and holy men , the most elevated of the castes .
Next is the Ksatriyas , the kings , warriors and soldiers created from the arms .
The Vaisyas come from the thighs .
They are the merchants and traders of society .
And the Sudras , or laborers , come from the feet .
The last group is the Dalits , or the " untouchables . "
They 're considered too impure to have come from the primordial being .
Untouchables are often forced to work in menial jobs .
They drink from separate wells .
They use different entry ways , coming and going from buildings .
They number about 250 million in India , about 25 percent of the population , according to the Colorado , U.S. - based Dalit Freedom Network .
" Dalits are seen to pollute higher caste people if they come in touch with them , hence the ' untouchables , ' " the group says on its Web site .
" If a higher caste Hindu is touched by , or even had a Dalit 's shadow fall across them , they consider themselves to be polluted and have to go through a rigorous series of rituals to be cleansed . "
Recent weeks has seen a rise in violence against Dalits in Uttar Pradesh , CNN 's sister network , CNN - IBN , reported Wednesday .

‘ My dear , let us hope that it is n’t true ! ” the wife of the bishop of Worcester is reputed to have exclaimed 150 years ago , on hearing that human beings might be descended from apes .
“ But if it is true , let us hope that it does n’t become widely known ! ”
When it comes to sociobiology -- better known these days as “ evolutionary psychology ” -- the bishop ’s wife has modern counterparts :
The religious right and the secular and supposedly scientific left are remarkably on the same page , both sides inclined to dispute or misrepresent the relevance of evolution to human beings .
The former , of course , deny the underlying science .
But what about the latter ?
They ’re secular , they ’re rational , they ’re tolerant , are n’t they ?
And there ’s the rub .
For more than 30 years , left - leaning academics -- notably residing in the humanities and , to a lesser extent , the social sciences -- have been strongly opposed to using evolutionary theory to help make sense of human behavior , in part because their professional training emphasizes the role of social learning and cultural traditions , and -- perhaps even more -- because they fear the possible findings .
Do racial differences imply genetic distinctions that might argue against social equality ?
Are women fated for kitchen work and childbearing , not high - level physics ?
And even if the science is more nuanced than that ( which it certainly is ) , will the simpler message drown out the details and provide ammunition for social regression ?
In fact , there are some good reasons for leftists ’ caution :
We ’ve already seen the gross misuse of evolution -- under the guise of Social Darwinism and the “ survival of the fittest ” -- to justify class oppression , monopolies and imperialism .
We ’ve also seen the even grosser abuse of biology by eugenicists and Nazis ; a history of employing biology ( and the supposed “ natural inferiority of women ” ) as a misogynist club with which to beat half the human race ; the disgraceful pseudoscience of “ The Bell Curve ” and its ilk , promoting the false claim that , if any trait or tendency is “ in the genes , ” there ’s nothing that society can do .
But the fact that something has been misused in the past does not make it bad , or even untrue .
Moreover , applying evolution to understanding ourselves offers , for example , a potentially powerful antidote to some of the things that the left fears the most : ethnocentrism or racism .
That ’s because evolution emphasizes the underlying biological commonality shared by all members of the species Homo sapiens , regardless of superficial differences .
As for sexism , does n’t that reside in differential valuing of the sexes , not in the struggle to understand them ?

To honestly assess the role of genes is to recognize that every trait -- structural , physiological , behavioral -- comes from the interaction of genes and experience .
Contrary to Prospero ’s description of Caliban in Shakespeare ’s “ The Tempest , ” there is no one “ upon whose nature nurture can never stick . ”
And is n’t it ironic that a science of adaptation and change should be denounced by progressives as somehow supporting the status quo or worse ?
( Karl Marx , seeing evolution ’s revolutionary potential , once offered to dedicate “ Das Kapital ” to Darwin . )
Just as the Catholic Church brought great discredit on itself for its persecution of Galileo , political ideologues of all stripes do themselves no favors by politicizing biology .
Speaking of the church ’s blindness , a devout Blaise Pascal wrote that “ if the Earth actually moves , a decree from Rome cannot stop it . ”
In terms of evolutionary biology , if we are the products of natural selection , with consequences for behavior no less than morphology ( and indeed , we are ) , the disapproval of my fellow leftists will not stop it .
Admittedly , there is an important difference : Whereas celestial dynamics are unaffected by whether earthlings adopt a Ptolemaic or Copernican worldview , social reality can be influenced by the prevailing attitude toward our own behavioral tendencies .
If it is concluded ( falsely ) that women are fit only for reproduction , or that African Americans can jump but can’t cogitate , then unfortunate social consequences are bound to follow -- and in the past , conservatives have shown themselves all too eager to make exactly these fallacious connections .

Indeed , ideologues of both stripes seek to have it both ways : denying evolution when they choose , but , when convenient , twisting its insights to support their causes .
Accordingly , some on the political right have actually endorsed aspects of sociobiology , claiming that evolution ’s “ selfish ” individualism and the way it rewards and amplifies personal fitness accords comfortably with laissez - faire capitalism .
At the same time , liberals are willing to enthusiastically support sociobiology when it suggests that gene - based “ selfishness ” frequently operates in nature by way of an altruistic sacrifice on behalf of others -- social altruism being a leftist ’s dream .
But cherry - picking science is as bad as ignoring it .
It may not sit right with modern descendants of the bishop of Worcester ’s wife , but would n’t it be nice if everyone -- regardless of political preference -- simply tried to understand what is true , and stopped trying to fit evolution into ideologic pigeonholes ?
Climate change and nuclear prospects
Given the power to decide who would go first — anti-nuke Ralph Cavanagh from Natural Resources Defense Counsel or pro-nuke Peter Schwartz from Global Business Network — the large audience Friday night voted for Schwartz to make the opening argument .
It is the threat of “ abrupt climate change ” that converted him to support new emphasis on nuclear power , Schwartz said .
Gradual global warming is clearly now under way , and there is increasing reason to believe that human activity is driving it , mostly through the burning of coal and oil .
If warming is all that happens , it will be an enormous problem , but some regions of the Earth would gain ( Russia , Canada ) while many others would lose …
Read the rest of Stewart Brand ’s Summary
Sara Seager , a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said astronomers hunt for planets by detecting telltale wobbles they induce in their host stars , a method that selectively nets the too big or too near .
Nevertheless , she said , “ the fact is , as soon as astronomers started looking for low - mass planets , they found a whole bunch , and that ’s a real breakthrough . ”
Just imagine the orgy of moderation that a more inclusive scan would reveal .
To some theorists , the new results virtually guarantee the existence of other Earthlike worlds .
“ Suppose you have a tribe , and the most noticeable members are the warriors , because they ’re adventuresome , they roam around , they ’re the first to be spotted , ” said Douglas N. C. Lin , a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
“ But you know that for every warrior , there ’s a family behind the warrior . ”
Dr. Lin continued , “ Just as you can extrapolate from the warriors you see what the size of the larger population deep in the woods may be , so the presence of these short - period , super Earths implies that there are clusters of other planets farther out . ”
Potentially pleasant planets at that .
“ I would imagine that a significant fraction of ordinary Sunlike stars , maybe more than 10 percent , have habitable planets around them , ” Dr. Lin said .
Whether habitable or abominable , planets are inescapable .
“ You make a star , you ’re probably going to get planets , ” said Seth Shostak , a senior scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View , Calif .
“ They ’re like those knives that get thrown in for free when you order a Veg - o - matic . ”
When a cloud of dust and gas collapses to make a new star , spinning faster and faster as it shrinks , competing forces of gravity , pressure and rotation cause some of its midriff to flatten into a disk , rather as the skirt of a skater flies into a circle as she pulls in her arms for a twirl .
The planets in turn condense from the dust , gas and ice of that central disk , in sequences that researchers have just begun to model .
In Dr. Lin ’s view , planetary evolution is a kind of Darwinian affair , as embryonic planets compete to enlarge themselves with heavy metal “ food ” from the disk , while struggling not to be consumed by a sibling or pulled into the mother star .
I am also energy - sensitive , and I understand your fears .
You 've been given something that you worry may carry a negative intent , and you hold the presumption that this item was infused with " black " magic .
This is rather like an acquaintance at work who , after I touched a wound he was showing me , asked if I had " put bad juju on it " - which makes me wonder why his first assumption was that I was doing something bad .
In any case : Metals hold and transfer energy easily , though various metals may have differing properties .
Hematite , as noted above , tends to gather energy - particularly darker , heavier , or low - cycle energies .
As suggested by the other answers , your own emotional energies may be feeding into this item and coloring its original energy state .
You state that your expertise lies in energy fields .
Since charms , curses , spells and other magic ( k ) s rely on energy fields in the first place , you 're working at the deepest level anyway .
All you need to do is take hold of the energies within the item , visualise the emotion and spirit toward which you wish to transform those energies , and release your held breath , simultaneously allowing your energies to flow from the heart .
Let go of all these these energies at the end of that breath , so that you are no longer in contact and therefore not adding anything else to the working .
With the next breath you take , the transformation will be complete .
I would suggest that you focus on a positive relationship with the giver of this gift when you perform the working .
Remember that love energy transforms darkness over time ; therefore , include love ( agape and friendship ) with your goal .
Breaking a curse or spell is as simple as snapping your fingers .
Take hold of these energies ; then , as you snap , visualise the disconnect or disjunction - the cut or crack by which those energies and / or their controlling circuit become broken and stop flowing , soon to dissipate .
To simply toss the energies aside , just flick them off with your fingers .
But part of me wonders , since you 've been working with spirits , why you did n't just consult with your spirit guides .
After all , they ought to know something about this stuff too .
George Clooney Still In Love With His Electric Tango
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
While he waits for his all - electric Tesla sportscar to be delivered ( hopefully , sometime in August ) , George Clooney is sticking with his Tango — the tiny itty - bitty electric one - seater that he ’s had since 2005 .
“ It can be embarrassing , ” he told The Times Online recently .
“ There ’s nowhere to hide , because it ’s just me behind the wheel and there is n’t enough space for anyone else .
But it goes from zero to 60 mph in four seconds , which is faster than virtually every other car on the road , so I can take off with a burst of speed if I get too many insults . ”
Clooney believes that the future of transportation lies in cars like the Tango — especially when it comes to utilizing new sources of energy .
“ We are going to have to find a way to get away from oil , ” he says .
“ It has to start with someone , somewhere , changing policy .
I try and be photographed in the Tango and hope that someone thinks it ’s a good idea . ”
You can check out the rest of the interview here — which also has Clooney admitting that he still is not the best person to speak for the environment , especially with his tendency for private jets .
But “ electric cars are a start , ” he reasons .
It ’s worth noting that George is still broken up over the loss of his potbellied pig , Max — who he cherishes through photos that “ he could never throw away . ”

Nearly 2 in 3 voters want someone else : 62.4 % of Americans say they would like to see better choices of candidates , parties in future
Unlike any other scientific poll conducted in 2008 , this survey asked randomly selected respondents about their level of enthusiasm for presidential candidates and offered the actual alternatives to the major party candidates that will appear on most ballots across the country – as well as the option of simply not voting .
Farah reported :
" I think what we see here confirms my observation that there is widespread disenchantment with the two major - party nominees , something that has simply not been adequately measured before this poll .
There is a leaderless , grass - roots movement out there to boycott both McCain and Obama in 2008 - to make a statement , to demand better candidates in the future from better parties .
This could be a historic election for non-participation in a year with no high - profile third - party alternatives . "
Barack Obama came in first with just 38.1 % of the vote to John McCain 's 33.6 % .
A whopping 21.3 % said they were still undecided - a remarkably high figure for this late in the campaign that ends November 4 .
But another 7.3 % indicated they would not be voting at all .
Only 21.7 % of respondents described themselves as very excited about the choice of candidates for president this year .
A similar number , 21.5 % , said they were " not at all " excited about the options .
Younger voters say they want more competition in the political marketplace .
Some 83 % of voters 18 - 24 express that opinion , while 73 % of those between 25 and 34 do .
In addition , 76.4 % of those who describe themselves as " very conservative " say they want more viable candidate and party choices in the future .
It also appears the enthusiasm gap hits McCain harder than Obama , with 22.3 % of Republicans expressing no excitement at all over the election vs. 11.9 % of Democrats .
On the other hand , 35.3 % of Democrats say they are " very much " excited about the choice vs. 14.4 % of Republicans .

Japanese Nursing Home for Dogs
Japan will get its first nursing home for dogs with round - the - clock monitoring by doctors and a team of puppies to help aging pooches feel younger , a pet products company said Wednesday .
Owners pay 98,000 yen ( $ 800 ) a month to keep their dogs at the Soladi Care Home for pets , which opens Friday , according to a joint release by Soladi Co. and the Endo Veterinary clinic in Tochigi , eastern Japan .
Veterinarians at the home will offer round - the - clock monitoring and residents will be fed specially fortified food , the release said .
The home , which can accept 20 dogs at one time , will also employ puppies to play with the aging dogs to help them keep fit and feel younger , the release said .
Analysts say that a boom in pet ownership in Japan , coupled with better health care and a more balanced diet , has led to a surge in elderly pets in Japan .
That has spurred doting owners to turn to vitamins , aromatherapy and even acupuncture to help their companions through their old age .

Barack Obama tends to John McCain ( via sahil )
1. 243 Win , 2 . 7.62UKM , 3 . 280AI , 4 . 7mm08 , 5 . 7mmSSAI , 6 . 243AI , 7 . 6x47 FM
In response to some of the many questions ask ; I like to tell you about my experiences regarding the conversion from a standard cartridge case to an improved version and the development of save wild cat loads with basic tools and equipment readily available to the hand loader .
At the outset I like to dispel the notion that wild cats only gain higher velocities with high - pressure loads meaning above accepted standards .
The wild cat or improved cartridge gains higher velocities by having greater case capacities and consequent lesser expansion ratios .
However little or greater that may be is not the issue here .
With the same pressure as the standard or unmodified case the wild cat will reach higher velocities .
A reckless or unknowledgeable hand loaders can as easily produce unsafe high - pressure loads in a standard loading as well as a wild cat .
More case volume produces more velocity in general .
With exceedingly large cases , small bores and some types of powders , this is not always the case .
Also I will not cover the actual brass conversions , conversion may entail the necking up or down to different calibers .
Or one type of brass case completely revamped to another .
Nothing that I am writing here is new , and very few if any conversions are the best there ever were , most of them have been done before in one way or another , but some of them are totally new and exotic .
The most beneficial reasons of improving a standard cartridge is the ease of handloading the much better designed case .
Effecting more efficient burning of powder charges , which can result in higher velocities and longer lasting brass .
Most improved cartridges do n't always produce velocities as high as being claimed .
Some of them improve considerable compared to the standard case .
The 243 Ackley Improved is one of them and all the others based on the 308 .
The 250-3000 , 22-250 , 257 Roberts , 6 mm Rem and many others .
These small cases are excellent candidates for wildcatting and a pleasure to shoot and reload .
Why some of them do improve more than others is not too well understood .
Combustion energy is a very complex science .
More powder will push bullets faster but not always more accurately .
In the improved case powder combustion is enhanced because of the shape of the powder chamber and more powder is burned inside the case due to the steep shoulder and minimal case wall taper .
The improved shoulder I believe acts as a deflector , and gases first collide inside the neck at the point of convergence before being allowed traveling down the barrel .
Perhaps this increased shoulder impediment is what I believe gives us more gas mileage from the same amount of powder ?
A look at the 30 - 06 will tell you , too reach 3000 ft/sec with a 150 gr bullet will use 15 % more powder then the same bullet in a 308 .
This is not a fair comparison because the 308's operate at a higher chamber pressure .
Just the same you can do nearly as much with less .
When you put a 40 degree shoulder on the 308 and straighten the case wall , you are right there with the 06 using comparable pressure with nearly the same velocity with considerable less powder , and of course using a short action for a handier rifle .
Less powder also means less recoil .
Wildcatting or improving in general has similar parameters , when using a sharp shoulder and minimum body taper .
The 30 - 06 type family , like the 280 Rem AI , 270 Win AI , 6.5-06 AI , and the 25 - 06 Ackley improved and the Gibbs designs are hand loading favorites .
The 280 Rem case is the largest of them with generous long neck .
It will provide the largest powder volume , especially if the shoulder is moved forward .
A 0.300 " long neck is long enough for any 300 caliber and under .
Two other favorites are the 338 AI and the 35 Whealen AI either can be made from the 280 Rem case or the 06 case .
The 280 case with its longer neck and a little more capacity would be better for these two calibers .
Also the necks need annealing before necking up that much .
And then there are the magnum wild cats with endless possibilities , almost impossible to cover them .
These big and smaller numbers produce power and velocities with modern powders that were unheard of when the magnum cases came into being .
Wild cats of the big magnum sort are specialty guns , and as such have limited appeal to the general shooting public , except the long range target shooters .
Besides these big powder burners need a seasoned rifleman and enough weight to tame recoil some ?
Also the many standard magnum cartridges have nearly eliminated the need for wild cats in that category .
Most of the Ackley Imp are designed to shoot the parent factory cartridge , for fire forming cases .
I never use bullets to fire form cases ; as a matter of fact non -of my wild cats can fire a factory loads .
I simply do n't see any reason to accommodate a factory load .
The idea of replacing your custom loads
" you lost "
with factory stuff is laughable .
And god knows where the factory loads will shoot if you did manage to find some in the woods .
A good smith that understands what it is all about should build your wild cat .
It is after all a custom gun in all respects .
Forget about the factory ammo and concentrate on neck length , twist , neck diameter , overall chamber length and performance .
Fire forming without bullets is simple and saves the barrel for real shooting .
Fire forming without bullets should always be done with a lubricated case , to allow the case to slide back against the bolt face .
When the primer goes off it will drive the case forward a bit before the pressure increases .
An unlubricated case sticks to the chamber wall and may produce undesirable headspace ?
Chamber length is important since fire forming will shorten your case - necks from 10 to 18 thousands depending on case and caliber .
By fire forming with cream of wheat the chamber neck can be made shorter by the amount the neck will shorten .
Further more the shoulder can be moved forward if wanted .
Cases are not trimmed before fire forming .
They are forced into the throat by the amount the cases shorten .
They are then trimmed for 0.005 " chamber clearance .
The slight crimp created by forcing the case into the throat is straightened with a tapered expander .
Since I have never made cases by necking up , I can't say what happen to the neck length ?
Note :
Some bench rest shooters using the PPC cartridge and others fire form in three stages for extended brass life and uniformity .
My fire forming method with cream of wheat could be used for this special process , I think ?
A custom wild cat chamber is one that allows almost no brass stretching .
A fitted steep shouldered case prevents the brass from flowing into the neck .
Case life is long if the elastic limit of the brass is not exceeded .
What that means is , do n't try to get every last foot of velocity .
It also means that the maximum safe pressure ring expansion on the case must be carefully established .
Wild cats work best with good dimensional consistent cases that are made with quality tempered brass .
With the amount of work that goes into these cases it only makes sense to buy the best .
It is no coincident that some are more costly than others are .
Using second hand cases for wild cats could cause trouble I never use them .
They are out of shape before you use them .
When a cartridge is fired the chamber expands and should not exceed the safe pressure limit of 60000 psi .
The brass follows that expansion .
The spring back of the brass due to its greater elasticity is more than the steel barrel .
When the barrel is stressed above the brass spring back limit , the relaxing barrel compresses the brass .
You then have a sticky case , a stuck case or worse , a damaged rifle .
Cases should always come out of the chamber easy .
The wild catter must make himself familiar with the reading of pressure ring indications .
Also I must point out that these expansion readings can be misleading in some tough extra strong brass , like the Winchester 300 H&H and 375 H&H brass .
Other pressure signs such as sticky bolts , gas leaks around primers , flattened and gratered primers , loose primers , and hard to extract cases must be looked at with concern .
This is where the chronograph comes in to warn you of high - pressure velocity spikes .
The Varmint Hunter Magazine July 99 issue # 31 has a very interesting article by Don Miler for pressure estimation using the chronograph and formulas for the Powley method .
This is a very fine article .
Some times this winter I will put together an Excel spreadsheet to simplify this procedure .
Actually the calculation can be done with a hand calculator .
The Wild - catter should also be familiar with the use of the Powley computer for establishing starting loads ; the Powley computer is available on the web .
For obvious safety reasons very little official wild cat data with modern powders is available and I do n't think that will ever change .
The hand loader must be capable of producing safe hand loads without loading data .
In this respect the hand loader should possess the necessary knowledge to do so .
Any published load for any wild cat cartridge should always be approached with caution .
Your own cartridge water volume behind the bullet should guide you with the loading density this published load produces in your cartridge case .
Do not assume any thing what so ever .
You do n't know the chamber size where this cartridge was being fired in .
Another good guideline for a starting load density is 85 % with an appropriate powder .
And never build any reduced loads with slow burning powder .
The best loads are with powders that nearly fill the case .
( LD= PC / WV . )
LD = loading density , PC= Powder charge in grains , WV=
Water volume behind the bullet in grains .
It is save to say here that any listed standard load in loading manuals for the parent standard cartridge is a save starting load for the improved cartridge .
Such as a max load of a 243 Winchester will be a good starting load for the 243 Win Ackley Improved .
A 6 mm-06AI and the 6 mm - 284 can use starting loads designed for the 240 Wheatherby .
The key here is to find the water case - volume in grains , to the underside of a seated bullet and compare them .
If the wild cat is smaller than the parent is , reduce starting charges it by the percentage point less 15 % .
When developing a load I make three or four sets of 3 cases , each set is charged with powder in one - grain intervals .
Each set of three is chronographed and recorded .
Pressure ring measurements are also recorded .
Each set is marked with indelible ink such as 1 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 1 - 3 , 4 - 1 , 4 - 2 , 4 - 3 , etc .
All cases are measured prior to firing and again after firing .
An index line is put on the case at the pressure ring and measuring is always done with the index line centered between the micrometer anvils .
That way you measure at the same spot every time .
The Idea is to establish a bench mark pressure reading .
Index lines and numbers are refreshed with repeated loading if needed .
After multiple reloads you can measure and find out what is happening to the case , and allows you to pin point a loose primers and its cause .
What this means is
" Back off with the powder " .
With the increase of powder in 1 / 2 or one - grain increments , you will see increases in velocity and measurements .
With most new brass you need to take up the initial slack found in most cases .
If you do n't know your chamber size at the pressure ring , drive in a lead ball in your chamber with a wood dowel .
Gently tab it back out and get a measurement .
This will tell you how much initial clearance you have .
I have seen cases as much as 0.006 undersize at the base .
However at gradual powder increases you will see when measurements will gradual increase by .0001 " or .0002 " .
Your increases in velocity will also be in fairly gradual steps .
Perhaps 40 to 50 ft per grain of powder .
Now the next grain of powder will show a 75 or 80 ft or more increase , and the measurement has increased by 0.0005 " or more .
This means you are in the high - pressure zone .
Reduce the load by 1.0 gr or 1.5 gr ( grains ) of powder and compare the pressure ring dimension with the velocity .
This measurement is your bench mark or near maximum load .
This is not a very exacting way to get pressure values .
Nevertheless , for lack of laboratory testing equipment it is the only save way for the home wildcatter .
Even with a piezometer type gage like the Oehler strain gage , the home wildcatter would have to calibrate the gage .
This would require a similar exercise of working up a load until cases start to stick and the bolt is hard to open .
This happens in the 70000 - psi range and then back off 15 % to 60000 psi .
It is still a guessing game but a calculated one .
Once you know what that reading is on the gage , you got it made .
One other key indicator is a loose primer .
When I develop a load I always have a Lee hand press along .
At the range I deprime an empty case after firing , and install a new primer with a Lee Priming tool .
A primer that shows any looseness is a
back off
signal .
Your records will tell you where that point is .
Again this not cast in stone either because cases with below standard base dimensions will do that even with lower pressures .
This can be detected with a velocity correlation .
Do n't use undersize brass !
There are always some variations because of different alloy make up , used in brass case production .
Always record your brass weight .
When you prepare a new batch of cases it is helpful to know the difference of weight .
Brass is 8.6 times heavier than water .
This allows you to adjust loading densities and charges without actual filling the case with water again .
You should also know the bulk densities of the different powders you use .
Bulk density is the amount of powder that occupies the volume as the water .
Like a certain case will hold 100 gr of water to the top of the case mouth and say 94.0 gr of a certain powder .
Bulk density would be 0.94 .
A higher bulk density powder may provide better ballistics .
The reading of books on the subject and the use of conventional data to compare the standard loads with improved loads are definite priorities .
A chronograph and good measuring tools are a
" must have "
when loading data is produced .
For wild cats the production of the most accurate ammo possible is a forgone conclusion .
Mass production of ammo does not bring out the best performance in wild cats .
If all this sounds involved , laborious and time consuming , it definitely is .
On the other hand there are no shortcuts to safety .
This is not a game of chance but a careful intelligent and investigative hobby .
Only you can decide if wildcatting is worth your efforts .
Wildcatting is at its best when an outlandish concocted wild cat cartridge wins consistently in major bench rest competition .
Or perforates the " egg " at 500 yards .
But I am quite happy using hunting wild cat rifles and hit a gopher now and then at 400 yards with a rifle of moderate weight .
" Play it safe and wear safety glasses ! "
I like to hear from you and welcome your critique .

Aug. 5 , 2008 -- A drug originally made to fight HIV may help treat West Nile virus encephalitis , a dangerous brain infection .
West Nile virus is usually spread through mosquitoes ; it can also be transmitted through blood transfusions , organ transplants , breastfeeding , and during pregnancy from mother to infant .
Most people who get infected with West Nile virus do n't get sick .
Some have mild symptoms ; serious symptoms such as encephalitis are rare .
The drug , called AMD3100 , did n't pan out as an HIV drug .
And it does n't actually tackle West Nile virus itself .
Instead , it paves the way for immune system cells to do the dirty work .
In lab tests , mice were injected with a virulent strain of West Nile virus .
Some of the mice got a continuous infusion of AMD3100 ; for comparison , other mice got a placebo infusion .
All of the mice got sick , but half of the mice in the AMD3100 group got better within eight days , while all of the mice in the placebo group got sicker and died .
AMD3100 targeted the mice 's blood - brain barrier , a fence that keeps infection - fighting inflammatory cells out of the brain , to help protect the brain from too much inflammation .
By blocking a receptor in the blood - brain barrier , certain T - cells made by the immune system specifically to fight West Nile virus gained access to the brain .
AMD3100 might also prove useful against other causes of encephalitis , note the researchers , who included graduate student Erin McCandless and assistant professor of medicine Robyn Klein , MD , PhD , of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
They report their findings in this week 's early online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The brainchild of Udi Manber , Google 's head of search engineering , the search firm 's next big product is a Wikipedia - like online encyclopedia , written by experts .

Google announced on its official blog Wednesday the debut of Knol , a Wikipedia - like online encyclopedia penned by authoritative sources .
Udi Manber loves cartoons .
Not animations , but the single - panel graphics that appear in magazines like The New Yorker .
He studies the history of the field , has covered the walls of his house with framed originals , and has edited a book of cartoons about Google , where he works as the head of search engineering .
" Udi's not just a fan , he 's a connoisseur , " says Robert Mankoff , cartoon editor of The New Yorker . **
When not thinking about cartoons , Manber spends endless time thinking about how search can be improved .
One big reason many searches do n't succeed , he believes , is that despite the 20 billion or so Web pages in Google 's indexes – including the 2 million items in Wikipedia – the information simply is n't there .
For instance , what if you wanted to learn all about Peter Arno , a celebrated New Yorker cartoonist who died in 1968 ?
You would n't get lucky .
The items appearing in the first page of results give only the barest information on Arno 's life and work .
Of course , it 's not just information about cartoonists that 's missing – according to Manber there are thousands of black holes when it comes to things searchers want to know .
What people need , Manber concluded about a year - and - a - half ago , is the information that would come " when an expert who knows this topic would tell you , if they had 15 minutes to explain . "
So Manber began what he refers to as his pet project – an effort to generate exactly those kind of answers in the top search results .
The product , announced Wednesday , is called Knol .
" It 's a nice , very simple word to remember , and it's part of knowledge , " says Manber .
Google hopes that Manber 's project will give experts who know their stuff a platform to share it with everyone else .
Google is especially keen on seeding this information internationally , in languages where the online corpus is sparse .
From the Knol team 's loft at Google headquarters , software engineer Mohsin Ahmed works out bugs in front of a panel of monitors at Googleplex .
With $ 20 Ahmed created a simple red , yellow and green light bug detector that glows green above his head .

Here 's how Knol works .
Experts in a given subject log into a Google account and use the Knol software to post an item , also known as a knol .
In some senses , the process is like producing a blog post – but in this case it's not something written off the cuff but carefully crafted to coherently explain a single subject .
One key attribute : Knols are meant to be signed with the author 's actual name .
With permission , Google will actually verify the writer 's identity , either by credit card or phone .
" The process will take 20 seconds with credit cards , " says Knol product manager Cedric Dupont .
Phone checks will take a minute or so .
This vetting , Manber hopes , will give knols accountability and , in the case of high - status authors , the benefit of a solid reputation .
The format and tone are up to the author : Google wo n't intervene if your knol on F. Scott Fitzgerald opines that The Great Gatsby was really a dud .
And it will certainly help if the knol delivers the goods in a pithy , captivating style .
( Google wo n't , however , tolerate knols that violate copyright or include porn . )
Google is attempting to establish a model for a standard item , and has seeded the " Knolosphere " with a few hundred entries appearing on launch , largely in the field of health and medicine .
Working with Google on this is Robert M. Wachter , a professor of medicine at the University of California , who also sits on Google 's health advisory council .
Just like blogs , knols can include images , video and links .
As a special bonus , The New Yorker will allow knol authors to include , free of charge , a single cartoon from the publication 's 20,000 - image archive to illuminate the subject .
( Guess which Googler was behind that deal . )
Knols are treated pretty much like any web page – found by following links , but readers will encounter most through search results from Google or other search engines .
Google says that knols will get no special favors when its algorithms choose results , but clearly expects the best efforts to rocket towards the top of search results .
Maybe even ahead of the ubiquitous Wikipedia items .
" A high - quality knol will rise up not just on Google but all the search engines , " says Michael McNally , the project 's technical lead .
Knol software engineer Ben McMahan concentrates on " firefighting last - minute bugs . "

There 's no limit on how many people can write knols on the same subjects , but presumably the inferior ones will be stalled in the back results pages while searchers encounter the best ones immediately .
Why would an expert on a subject take the time to write a knol ?
One reason would be an altruistic impulse to share wisdom with the world .
There 's also the ego juice that might come with being the first authority one encounters in a search for absinthe or Daryl Lamonica .
By default , knols use a Creative Commons copyright license , which allows copying and remixing .
If they wish , authors can change the settings to register traditional copyright protection .
In addition , there 's money involved .
If authors OK it , Google will compensate them with revenue from advertisements served by the company 's AdSense program .
If someone writes a top - ranked knol on a subject that 's matched with high - value clicks from Google ads ( diseases , travel destinations , personal finance ) , the payout could be thousands of dollars .
( Purists can keep the ads off . )
But Manber is emphatic that his project is not about the bucks .
" If Knol does n't improve search but generates some revenues , that 'll be a failure for me , " he says .
Many people , however , will find it puzzling that Google thinks it necessary to create a new platform for people to share information .
Why bother , when Wikipedia will give you answers whether you 're wondering about George M. Dallas ( James Polk 's vice - president ) or the 13th Floor Elevators ( an Austin psychedelic rock band formed in late 1965 ) ?
One person asking that question is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales , who learned about Knol a few months ago , when Google posted a blog teaser about the project .
" What is the added value ? "
Wales asks .
" People already can put up web pages somewhere on the internet , put some ads on it if they want to get revenue or not put ads if they do n't want the revenue . "
Wales clearly thinks that his brainchild will satisfy most searchers .
" If I type in Thomas Jefferson , there 's a pretty good chance that the Wikipedia entry is more or less exactly what I 'm looking for , " he says .
Google says it is n't trying to compete with Wikipedia , but providing an alternative .
" I 'm not suggesting one is better than the other , but different , " says Manber .
And what would the difference be ?
" One article is written by one person , and it's one person 's opinion , " says Manber .
" You know who that person is and where they 're coming from . "
From the team 's loft , Xiangtian Dai makes sure that Knol runs uniformly on different web browsers .

During one of my interviews with Manber I asked him to compare the first commissioned knol , about insomnia , with a Wikipedia item .
The knol was written by Manber 's wife , Rachel , who is an associate professor at Stanford University 's Psychiatry and Behavioral Science Sleep Center .
Though Rachel Manber 's item is a more coherent and thorough treatment of the subject than Wikipedia 's , in some respects it 's similar to the crowdsourced entry : a general definition followed by a discussion of causes and treatments .
But the top of the Wikipedia page on insomnia displays this caveat : " This article is in need of attention from an expert on the subject . "
Touché .
By the way , Google is n't rejecting the wisdom of the crowd .
Once an author creates a knol , the general public can improve it .
People can suggest corrections , edits and amendments to the content – a technique Google calls " a moderated edit . "
Readers can also leave comments alongside the content .
While the author is the arbiter of the item itself , and can reject suggestions , he or she can't delete the comments .
Users can also rate knols on a five - star scale .
" I'm sure there will be knol spam , " says Dupont , who says that Google will use its experience fighting spam in Blogger and other products to minimize it .
" If Google is able to pull it off , bring expert knowledge to the masses , that 's absolutely wonderful , " says Jorge Cauz , president of Encyclopedia Britannica , the company best known for providing trusted expert information in an encyclopedia format .
It 's not Google that worries him , but Wikipedia , and he sounds like he'd like some help fending off Britannica 's crowdsourced rival .
" It 's not the presence of Wikipedia that 's a problem , it 's the omnipresence of Wikipedia , " he says .
In fact , he says , from what he hears about Knol , " it 's very similar to things we 're thinking and retooling Britannica to do . "
He hints that the company might be changing from its subscription model to a scheme where much of its content would be free to users – and show up in search engines .
" If you 're charging for content , you 're behind the firewall .
And if you 're behind the firewall people do n't call on you first , " he says .
As part of this process Britannica now encourages anyone to link to its items .
Those following the link can read the full article free .
Britannica also posts a daily info - nugget on Twitter .
But Cauz does imply that Google is stepping out of its sweet spot by generating content .
" The issue here is that Google will become a publisher and will have moral liability and moral obligation for something that happens under its own brand – and that is something that Google has never done , " he says .
Google sees it differently , viewing Knol as a common - carrier platform like Blogger or YouTube .
Knol pages wo n't even carry a Google logo .
" We are not publishers , " says Manber .
" We do not want to be editors .
We do not want to have influence over what is written . "
He can't say it enough :
It 's about search .
" There are millions of people with something in their head that they 're not writing down , " he says .
" If I can get some of them to write it down , I 'm helping everybody . "
If Google 's plan works , future searchers will get higher - quality results from searches of subjects commonplace and obscure – even Peter Arno .
In fact , a knol has already been written about The New Yorker cartoonist .
If its author posts it – he has n't pulled the trigger yet – Google wo n't have to work hard to verify the expert who worked for weeks to pen that item .
It 's Udi Manber .
Most of the Knol team takes a moment from working out last minute bugs to pose for a group shot at Google headquarters in Mountain View , California .

David DeMartini on the Renaissance of EA Partners
By Chris Remo
For years , EA Partners operated as a relatively quiet division of publishing behemoth Electronic Arts , releasing externally - developed titles that received less visible support and attention than EA 's own fully - owned projects enjoyed .
Over the last eighteen months , EAP has undergone something of a renaissance , putting the group more out in the open than it ever has been .
Top - down directives from recently - appointed CEO John Riccitiello have stressed new degrees of studio autonomy throughout the organization -- policies that have allowed EA Partners to attract top - shelf independent developers who historically would have balked at the idea of partnering with the megalithic publisher .
Last year , it released The Orange Box from notoriously independent Valve , Rock Band from Harmonix Music Systems , and Crysis from Crytek -- but also the less successful Hellgate : London from now - all - but - defunct Flagship Studios .
The 2008 lineup also includes sequels to Rock Band and Crysis , and Valve 's Left 4 Dead .
Looking forward , EAP boasts id 's Rage as well as freshly revealed deals with Epic Games and Painkiller creator People Can Fly , plus Grasshopper Manufacture and Shinji Mikami .
Gamasutra sat down for an in - depth interview with group general manager DeMartini to discuss the recent deals as well as EAP 's overall philosophy , its understanding that not all development must originate from EA , its Metacritic scores compared to EA 's internal projects , and where Hellgate : London went wrong .
How did you actually end up with the Grasshopper deal ?
David DeMartini : EAP is a worldwide organization , and over the course of the 18 months when the new leadership team has been in place , we really set an objective for ourselves to start looking in parts of the world that maybe we had not paid enough attention to .
We specifically focused on going to Eastern Europe , and Japan , and India , to try and see what development talent was available in those regions that EAP might be able to partner with .
We were at the Tokyo Game Show last year , and we were also at the Gstar show in Korea .
We started attending things we had previously not attended in such large numbers , and we obviously had a tremendous number of meetings with many developers .
Obviously , Mikami comes with no need for any kind of introduction .
Suda we knew from Killer7 and his other games .
CAA [ Creative Artists Agency ] also got involved -- Seamus [ Blackley ] from CAA had been talking with some of our biz dev people .
We approached it from two different directions : one was from our additional exposure in Tokyo , and also through CAA .
By the time we approached it from those two angles , and heard Suda 's pitch about the game concept and Mikami 's pitch about the game concept , we were very excited , and it led to a bigger relationship .
Q Entertainment , Tetsuya 's Mizuguchi 's studio , was also involved in brokering that , right ?
DD : I do n't know that I 'd necessarily say " brokering " it , but doing business for a U.S. company in Japan is very complicated .
What Q? brings us is some minimization of complexity and reduction of risk .
What kind of risk ?
DD : Certainly , some design issues come around translation issues , and us not being aligned around design , and what Q? is providing is some level of design clarification and partnership .
It 's really a three - way relationship with ourselves , Q? , and Grasshopper .
I imagine that leads to a different kind of relationship than with most EA Partners .
DD : It 's not any different than it would be if they were in Colorado as compared to them being in Tokyo .
We use the same methodologies , the same milestone schedules .
Our production team is equally involved .
The travel is a bit longer .
Sometimes , communicating exactly the methodology is slightly more challenging , but when you 've got two dedicated partners who want to make something successful , both sides are willing to meet each other in the middle .
That 's what we 've been able to do with Mikami and Suda .
Mikami has obviously had huge commercial successes .
Suda , while his games have been well - appreciated for their creativity , has n't had games with explosive sales .
Was that a worry for you ?
DD : I think your analysis is absolutely correct .
We think the stuff that Grasshopper and Suda have done is incredibly innovative ; it 's very well received by the press .
With regards to sales , I think they 've done okay .
They certainly have n't done blockbuster sales like Mikami has .
But when you lay on top of that Mikami 's sensibilities for the mass market , and Grasshopper and Suda and Q ?'s desire to have a breakout hit , combined with our own team 's sensibility about what would work in North America , what would work in Europe , I think that 's the ideal way to bring those entities together to have the kind of blockbuster hit that Mikami had with [ Resident Evil 4 ] .
I assume Grasshopper does n't have the bandwidth to do four platform versions in - house .
Are you guys handling any porting like you did for Valve on PS3 ?
DD : Grasshopper is very capable with regards to platforms .
They 've currently got one of the platforms subbed out to another developer , but they 're handling the rest of them -- Grasshopper and Q? in combination .
Is that the Wii version ?
DD : Um --
EA PR : I do n't think we have detail on that stuff yet .
Regarding Eastern Europe and India , are there studios you 're actually talking to about partnering with ?
How do you go about looking ?
DD : There are studios all over the world we 're talking to .
It 's opening another door , and we 're looking for creative relationships all around the world .
I would n't say those areas are previously excluded , but I do n't think we approached them with as much creativity as we needed to considering they 're largely emerging development markets .
I think in the last 12 to 18 months we 've taken a new look at that , and I think that 's part of the entire rebirth of EAP : looking through doors we maybe previously were n't looking through to see what opportunities do exist .
We 're only 50 or 60 people , but we work within a 7,000 - person organization .
We get to leverage the strength and reach of EA with so many offices in so many countries .
It 's not always my people who find the developer or find the next great idea .
Maybe it 's somebody in the Singapore office who gets wind of a developer and comes out and does the first visit .
I really do n't care where we find it , I do n't care who finds it , as long as somebody from EA turns us on to a great new developer .
I do n't care if we get credit for it ; I do n't care who gets credit for it , as long as a great game gets published under the EA label .
And what exactly has happened in the last 12 to 18 months ?
DD : That 's kind of tied to when I took over EAP , but honestly it is very much tied to [ CEO ] John [ Riccitiello ] 's return to Electronic Arts , and EAP moving under Frank Gibeau , who 's the head of the EA Games label .
Those two gentlemen know as much about developing video games and creative talent as any two executives in the industry for anybody combined .
They 've opened the door with regards to ways to developing creative talent .
Obviously , we want to develop a lot of creative IP internally , but that 's not the only place that IP gets created .
There is always an opportunity and an opening for the most creative people in the industry -- whether they work for Electronic Arts , or they 're partners -- to be part of EA , and take advantage of EA 's global publishing and distribution .
What have you tried to individually bring to the group ?
DD : The key thing is that every partner brings a tremendous amount to the table .
All EAP is trying to do is see where we can assist .
In some cases , someone might need a PS3 port .
In other cases , they might need help sourcing out the PS2 .
They might need one of my development directors to help with process .
Just like us as human beings , we have certain things we do great , and other things where someone else is maybe better .
What we try to do is assess a situation .
If it 's on rails and everything 's great , we sit in the back seat and make sure the publishing and distribution go great .
If somebody runs into trouble , we play off of the partner , and try to have the resources available either within EAP or the greater EA to assist in the way they think they need to be assisted .
I think it 's that more modest [ approach of ] EA being in the back seat , rather than with our hands on the wheel , that has brought partners like id and Epic who five years ago said , " EA is n't a company that I want to work with . "
Now they 're out in front of the bandwagon saying , " EA is n't like what we heard them to be . "
Providing service when asked is a rather subtle change , but it 's a rather significant change for the fiercely independent development organizations that are the best in the industry .
When I spoke with [ Epic president ]
Mike Capps , he said EA works " checklist - style " -- where they tell you which services they want , and you provide them .
Valve told me similar things , indicating they leave most of those boxes un-checked .
DD : Yep. ( laughs )
How accurate is that metaphor ?
DD : We do n't necessarily hand them a menu and wait for them to check boxes , but we do have rather mature and sophisticated processes .
We more or less step in where our partners indicate they need some assistance .
Where our partners do n't need assistance , we 're not going to try and get in the way , because that 's rather inefficient .
It 's that " bull in a china shop " versus " delicately walking through a china shop " nuance that represents what the new EAP is attempting to be : high - level customer service where the customer is asking for service .
If somebody every five minutes comes up to you and says , " Can I clear that tray ?
You want me to clear your tray ? , " the service gets to a certain level .
It 's like , " Look , I do n't need you to clear the tray .
I 'll tell you when I need you to clear the tray . "
So if you want , we wait for you to finish the meal , then we come and ask you .
It 's a strange metaphor , but it 's just not imposing yourself when you do n't need to be imposing yourself into a situation .
So is that a problem with executives at EA who are not accustomed to that kind of mentality ?
Because historically , that 's a change .
DD : Those who would not be named at this point ?

What I 'd equate it to is that there 's one steering wheel and two front seats .
Three years ago , EA always had to have their hand firmly on the wheel , and in many cases on the driver 's seat .
Now , we 're far more comfortable sitting in the passenger seat , ready to lend a hand so you can adjust your glasses .
It 's a difference that is represented by John 's and Frank 's leadership , and it's a philosophical thing that carries throughout the whole EAP organization .
I think it 's also having a very mature team of game - savvy experts who work worldwide in EAP , and the quality of those individuals is fantastic , maybe even relative historically .
We 've continued to add people with more and more game experience , with the ability to judge those situations in terms of when to get involved , and when to back off .
What I want to have is a strong team of people who can come in and consult with our partners , and have the maturity to know when to step in rather than step on a bunch of toes .
While I 've talked to several studios that indicated EA is hands - off if requested , those are studios that are already quite successful , so there 's less risk operating that way .
Is it really more of a sliding scale where you appraise studios individually ?
DD : Well , it 's based on the assessment we make of any studio .
Those are certainly studios each with a long successful history with other partners , and certainly their work stands on its own merit .
With regards to how much we step in -- whether it's a highly - successful studio with a long history , or a very creative studio with not as long a history -- we 're trying to take a more modest approach , and not force ourselves upon the studio , but to try and demonstrate a value add by virtue of the decades of experience the people in EAP have .
It 's more or less the partner wanting to hear what we have to say , rather than , because we 're funding a project , us forcing our opinion on a prospective partner .
Obviously , we 're not going to let any partner go sideways , but it 's really them wanting the participation based on the value we bring .
But , for example , Flagship and Hellgate : London did basically implode .
Should you have stepped in more ?
DD : Yeah , I mean ...
We 're certainly sad with the results for Flagship and what 's happened with Hellgate , because at the time we signed it , we were trying to get involved in a very complicated relationship between Namco and Flagship .
We were coming late to the party , and trying to do whatever we could to sprinkle the game magic on the project and get it headed in the right direction .
Flagship Studios ' Hellgate : London
I think that 's an example where all three parties had the best interest of the game in mind , and sometimes the game does n't work out .
Hellgate is still an incredible concept .
The guys who worked on it spent thousands of hours trying to make that concept work , and sometimes we just do n't see something .
Sometimes , we just did n't take enough time .
Sometimes , things do n't work out the way you expect .
It 's kind of like a film with all big stars -- on the script , it should be successful , but the movie does n't turn out as good as everybody hoped .
That 's why EAP takes a portfolio approach with its games .
You have to place a lot of bets , and hope for a lot of hits .
Were you actually funding it , or were you just marketing and distributing , or what ?
DD : We were co-publishing with Namco .
I 'm not going to dodge a bullet -- we had people who were actively working with them on the title .
We thought it would have been slightly higher quality than it turned out to be , and I think the problem with the game was that by the time it got really good , we were four to six months post - release .
That was too late ; we 'd lost the fanbase .
It was strictly an issue of the gameplay and game quality needing to be higher at the start .
Unfortunately , Flagship was in a situation where they were n't in a position to hold the game any longer , and the situation kind of took over .
Bill Roper said this week that there were conversations about EA acquiring the studio .
Was that a serious discussion ?
DD : I can't really comment on any kind of acquisition conversation .
I know I was n't involved in any of them .
EA paid upwards of $ 800 million for BioWare and Pandemic -- I know that is n't really your department , but how do you make the call as to whether to just publish a company 's game or try and make the plunge of taking it over ?
DD : Well , they are different departments , but it 's one EA .
We totally respect an organization 's desire to remain independent .
If they 're delivering high - quality products , we 're just interested through the EA Partners program with regards to publishing and distribution .
If , during the course of that relationship , the partner demonstrates an interest in being part of the EA family because the experience is so positive , then other discussions could take place .
It 's something that evolves organically based on both parties saying , " Wow , we like the way this is working .
Maybe a closer fit would be more appropriate . "
We completely respect organizations like Valve and Epic who have stayed independent but do great things , just like id does .
Have you looked at some of the apparently - discarded Activision titles that fell by the wayside after the merger , like Double Fine 's Brutal Legend or Ghostbusters from Terminal Reality ?
DD : Are some of those available ?!
( laughs )
Now , having had this conversation with me for thirty - eight minutes , you certainly could n't believe that , if there were an opportunity , we would n't take a look at that opportunity based on any situation .
We certainly read your site , and some of the observations you guys make with regards with what people are planning to publish and what they 're not planning to publish , and that occasionally presents an opportunity to us .
Like I said , if there 's a great creative team -- or a couple of great creative teams -- that have product that need to be published , we certainly might be their partner .
BioWare 's Mass Effect
After I played the PC version of Mass Effect , I noticed the credits had a number of EA Partners , rather than EA Games , names .
That was after BioWare was acquired .
Was that a transitional thing ?
DD : We helped them in a little bit .
As they were new to EA , we talked to [ studio co-founders ] Ray [ Muzyka ] and Greg [ Zeschuk ] and offered some of our resources , because we were so familiar with helping external teams .
They were an external team becoming an internal team , and we thought it would be an easy way to help EA out and help welcome that team to the EA family .
Just to clarify very quickly , that game was completely developed by the BioWare team .
[ Ed. note : Demiurge Studios also handled the PC port and enhancement work . ]
They did all the heavy lifting .
The EAP staff was helping with localization and process - related things .
How much of what you do is full publishing and funding , and how much is purely distribution ?
DD : It 's all over the board .
It 's very much a portfolio approach we 're managing .
It 's also based on what great game makes itself available in what fiscal year .
Rock Band showed up last year , and that delivered a tremendous amount of revenue , and that skews us heavily towards distribution and co-publishing , especially in conjunction with The Orange Box .
In a year where we 're releasing Crysis and an Epic game and an id game and the Grasshopper game , then that could skew us more towards a publishing model than a distribution model .
It 's very fluid , and it 's really based on the opportunities .
We do n't look to have any particular mix of co-pub versus dev/pub versus distribution .
We 're just looking to do any deal that is additive to the bottom line at Electronic Arts , and to publish the highest - quality games that the industry sees .
How cognizant are you of how the company is perceived ?
It seems like the tide of gamer opinion might be starting to change , in part due to the perception of how EA treats studios now versus historically .
DD : I feel like it's a specific responsibility of each of the 50 or 60 individuals that are part of EAP to get out there within the community -- not only the independent development community , but at shows with consumers , to demonstrate to gamers that the quality of the game is the most important thing .
It 's a philosphy that John and Frank have brought to EA in general .
It 's not so much , " We want to make a lot of money , so let 's make a good game , " it 's , " We 're going to make the best game we possibly can make . "
Whether internally or by an independent studio , it does n't matter .
Any time we put a game into the market , we 're going to try and maximize the quality , so the game player 's experience is stellar .
Ultimately , it helps the bottom line .
That subtle nuance , from " We 're making money " to " We 're making great games , " many of us strongly believe will lead to greater profitability , but most importantly it will lead to greater player satisfaction .
That in and of itself will lead to greater profitability down the road .
How do EA Partners titles perform relative to the larger EA catalogue ?
DD : The average Metacritic for the EAP titles was higher than EA 's overall average Metacritic last year .
Obviously , [ that 's ] buoyed by great titles like Rock Band , The Orange Box , and Crytek 's Crysis -- those three titles were all 90 + rated titles .
We had a huge string of good fortune with some of the best partners in the industry .
With regards to sales , we were delighted by how all the EAP properties did .
The notable exceptions would probably be Ninja Reflex and Hellgate : London .
One thing I would add -- we do n't really distinguish between EA Partners titles or EA internal titles .
Through the sales , distribution , and publishing organizations , it 's an EA title .
The quality titles get the attention .
What we look for from an independent developer is exactly what we 're looking for from an internal team .
The hot properties get all the heat .
Fortunately , we had a lot of EAP titles being a lot of the hot properties , and we certainly hope that to continue in the future based on the lineup of partners we have .
Analyst Todd Greenwald of Signal Hill criticized EA Partners this week by saying it harms the perception of EA by implying that EA has to go elsewhere to get top - shelf development ; also , it causes concern for shareholders because external development has lower profit margins than internal development .
How do you respond to that ?
DD : Yeah , that 's crazy talk !
That 's crazy talk .
It 's very interesting .
When we do a deal with an independent developer , we are held to the same level of accountability on our deals that internal teams are held to .
Obviously , if it 's owned IP , we have an opportunity to have higher margins , but on the stuff that 's not owned IP , we still have responsibility [ for ] profits we need to deliver to the company .
Distribution deals are an entirely different animal , but I believe they are still helpful to delivering the earnings that our shareholders come to expect .
You know , with regards to not being able to develop enough of our own hit IP , which is why we need to go outside , I just think it's an acknowledgement that there 's a huge gaming community of developers who can create quality IP .
Some of it comes from EA 's internal teams , some comes from external teams .
EA Redwood Shores ' Dead Space
We 're going to look everywhere for the best gaming ideas , and the best game developers in the world .
If they happen to be from EA , great , and we 've got plenty of those -- Mirror 's Edge , Dead Space , and a lot of the new IP we 're creating internally -- but likewise we have n't cornered the market on the brightest people in the industry .
We try to , but there are a lot of other really smart people who have a lot of great game design ideas .
Sometimes , they think differently than we do at EA , and why should we not give them the same benefit our internal teams get by being able to publish and distribute through the best publisher and distributor in the industry ?
That 's all we 're acknowledging .
It 's a recognition that it all does n't have to be created here .
It can be created here , and it can be created there .
You 're admitting the reality that there are other developers out there making games that are n't EA .
DD : Well , the thing is , for id and Epic and all these companies -- when EA was n't publishing those companies , somebody else was .
You all recognized them as great games .
If they 're making great games and they 'd like to work with the best publisher in the world , we are more than happy to work out a deal .
We 're fortunate that some of the best in the industry have seen that change , and acknowledged it by wanting to work with us .
We 're incredibly proud to be mentioned with those companies .

When Ishmael Dube got his own small plot of land , it felt like justice .
He ’d grown up a black child under a racist white regime when this country was called Rhodesia .
Half his youth was gobbled by darkness : war and prison .
He got the farm in 2000 , two decades after Zimbabwe ’s independence from Britain , when President Robert Mugabe urged liberation war veterans to invade white farms .
For the war veterans , it was a time of exhilaration and violence .
For white farmers , it was a time of bitterness and terror .
“ When the land invasions started happening , people were excited , ” Dube said .
“ When we were fighting , land was one of the things that we were fighting for . ”
But Dube lasted just one year ; farming was much more difficult than he had expected .
After 12 months , the veterans were evicted from the land by a ruling party heavyweight .
Advertisement
Mugabe , who has ruled since 1980 , often draws on land , history , blood and race in the bitter liberation rhetoric that peppers his speeches .
He called the March 29 elections a new phase in the war over land , describing the opposition as British puppets poised to give back property to white farmers .
But the dire warnings are no longer working .
Even many of the war veterans , who helped Mugabe oust the British and stay in power for nearly three decades , are n’t listening .
And that could mean the end of the liberation hero ’s long reign .
“ People have seen through that kind of cheap propaganda , ” Dube said .
Mugabe ’s rhetoric about land and the liberation war now has a tiny , but extremely powerful , circle of supporters : the cronies who still have farms , mainly Mugabe relatives , ministers , generals , judges and intelligence , police and security chiefs .
Many of them own several farms , most of them unproductive .
Advertisement
“ Mugabe is now losing , because of his greed , ” said Percy Gombakomba , 53 , a war veteran and former bureaucrat in the president ’s office .
“ I believe that if Mugabe walked in the streets , he would be stoned .
“ People ask , ‘ Why did you go to war ?
What were you fighting for ? ’
If you say you were fighting for the land , they will laugh at you . ”
So few have benefited from the redistribution that Mugabe ’s broader support has been undermined among traditional allies such as the war veterans .
But he was careful to ensure that the top military and security commanders , on whom he relies for protection and survival , got one or more farms .
With Mugabe looking increasingly precarious , analysts believe that in the end it will be the “ securocrats , ” the 20 or so commanders who form the strategic Joint Operation Command , who will determine whether the president goes .

Mugabe began the land seizures in 2000 , after he faced his first serious political threat : the emergence the year before of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change from the union movement , supported by white farmers .
Last month , Mugabe ’s regime began a new wave of evictions of the few remaining white farmers after it lost control of parliament for the first time since independence in 1980 .
He sent out security forces in a campaign of intimidation against farmers , opposition supporters and activists .
But many influential Mugabe supporters in the ruling ZANU - PF party do n’t believe the violence is working this time .
Most believe that Mugabe will lose an expected second round of voting in the presidential election .
“ I think we allowed corruption to go uncontrolled to the extent that it affected the majority of the people , ” said one influential ruling party figure and war veteran who spoke on condition of anonymity .
He said public support for Mugabe had eroded because of corruption in the ruling elite .
Advertisement
“ They ’re saying if you live with thieves and protect them , you are also a thief . ”
One reason Zimbabwe ’s economy imploded was Mugabe ’s failure to manage the expectations of war veterans .
The more he revisited the liberation war rhetoric , the more the veterans expected pensions , land , businesses or jobs .
War veteran Gombakomba said Mugabe should have given them “ a good reward ” for their wartime sacrifices .
“ That ’s why we thought of grabbing the farms .
People had to jump into farms before they saw any fruits of the liberation struggle , ” he said .
But after Mugabe paid out lump sums to war veterans in 1997 and pledged monthly pensions , the Zimbabwe dollar collapsed , never to recover .
Advertisement
When they seized farms in 2000 , war veterans such as Dube had no idea how to farm .
There was no hope of bank loans for equipment without title deeds to use as security .
Agricultural production , the country ’s biggest export earner , fell and the economy lurched further into crisis .
Gombakomba and eight war comrades invaded a farm near Lake Kariba .
He said the owner had fled to Zambia .
But like Dube , he did not last long .
“ The thing is , I was never a farmer myself , ” he said .
“ I did n’t know what farming was , to tell you the truth .
And there was no equipment , no financial support .
It was difficult .
And that ’s when we began to understand that farming was not a picnic .
Advertisement
“ We had the place for two years .
We wanted to put in soya and maize but when we were ready for plowing , a big man came from the president ’s office and we had no power and we were chased off .
“ One by one , all the farms were given to these bigwigs . ”
Belatedly , Mugabe ’s regime is trying to the counter the widespread cynicism over the redistribution with promises to hand over more farmland .
Twice before the recent elections , a ruling party chief offered Dube and his friends a new farm in place of the one confiscated in 2001 .
They refused , seeing it as a belated effort to buy back their support .
Advertisement
“ He tried to convince us to return , ” Dube said .
“ But even if we went back to the land , what were we going to do ?
There ’s no equipment .
We simply said we were angry with the first decision . ”
As the farmer - generals contemplate the ruling party ’s defeat , what worries them most is losing their farms .
When it comes to land , most of them distrust MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai , the senior ruling party figure said .
Without a clear guarantee from Tsvangirai to army commanders that they can keep the land , “ there will be chaos . ”
“ And if , as soon as he comes in , he tries to reshuffle the army , he wo n’t be able to control them .
There will be chaos , serious chaos . ”

Dixon recently was on assignment in Zimbabwe .
Aug. 20 , 2008  -- Scientists at the California Institute of Technology have discovered a new form of synesthesia , a rare but benign condition in which some people see the world quite differently than the rest of us .
To them , letters or numbers have specific colors and tastes , may have specific shapes , because one sensory perception mysteriously leads to an automatic experience in a second sensory pathway .
Now , it turns out , some synesthetes hear sounds when they see movement or flashes of light .
The discovery took neurologist Melissa Saenz by surprise .
She was running a program on her computer in the Caltech Brain Imaging Center when a group of students passed by .
The screen on her computer showed bright lights moving rapidly back and forth , and a student asked a question that has precipitated a whole new field of inquiry .
" Out of the blue , one of the students asked , ' Does anyone else hear something when you look at that ? ' "
Saenz said in a telephone interview .
None of the others heard anything , because there was no sound associated with the lights .
Saenz interviewed the student at length , and determined that the student did , indeed , have synesthesia .
Along with Christof Koch , professor of cognitive and behavioral biology at Caltech , Saenz searched the scientific literature for similar cases , but " no one had published a paper on auditory synesthesia , so it had n't been reported before , " she said .
It did n't take long for Saenz to locate three other people affiliated with Caltech , either students or members of the community , who also have auditory synesthesia .
A series of experiments have demonstrated that the condition is quite real , and even somewhat beneficial to the synesthetes .
" They have a slightly enhanced soundtrack in life , " she said , and she suspects they are more numerous than had been thought , especially since a new form of the condition has been discovered .
Saenz believes auditory synesthetes have not been known about before because objects that move , and bright flashes of light , often occur with sounds , so it 's a little harder to detect .
In some cases , she said , synesthetes may realize they are different when they hear sounds where there clearly should be none , like sounds coming from a television set when the audio is turned off .
In fact , that 's similar to what happened to the student who raised the question in her lab .
He was at an art show , and " there was a very bright flashing light that made such a clear sound for him that he could n't ignore it , " Saenz said .
" He asked his mom , ' Do you hear that , too ? '
Then he realized it was only him . "
The study of synesthesia is so new that there are still many questions unanswered .
Some studies have indicated that the experience is different for each synesthete , and this research reinforces that .
All four participants in her study reported hearing sounds from flashing lights that were similar , in that they were basic , uncomplicated sounds , yet different in that the sounds varied from beeps to scratching to tapping .
One experiment showed that the synesthetes benefited from what some call the " cross activation of brain regions , " or simply cross fertilization of sensory pathways .
Several participants , including the synesthetes and others without synesthesia , observed patterns of rhythmic flashes similar to visual Morse code , and had to guess whether subsequent patterns were the same or different .
When the flashes were accompanied by sound , like beeps , Saenz and Koch found no difference in the performance of those with synesthesia and those without .
But when the test was repeated without the audio track , the synesthetes outperformed the nonsynesthetes dramatically because they still " heard " the sounds .
Two sensory pathways are better than one .
Although people with synesthesia are not handicapped , and do not suffer from their condition , they are fascinating to neuroscientists because of what their condition might tell about how the human brain functions .
" Very little is known about how the auditory and visual systems work together in the brain and communicate with each other , " Saenz said .
" We know that when we see and hear something at the same time , what we hear can influence what we see , and vice versa .
But we do n't really know why . "
Lee Dye is a former science writer for the Los Angeles Times .
He now lives in Juneau , Alaska .
" The local people do n't agree with the protesters coming here , " he said .
" It 's only going to create a war .
After they come here and mess everything up they are going to go home and we have to stay . "
A Westword staff member took photographs before and after a woman was struck by a police officer during an August 26 protest near Civic Center Park ;
They can be seen below .
In an August 27 Rocky Mountain News ' report on the story , which includes a video that is also viewable by clicking " More , " the officer in question is n't identified .
However , an enhanced version of the photo seen here clearly shows the name on the officer 's uniform to be " Stewart . "
It also includes the number " 0520 . "
Bert Ross , a veteran of Westword 's sales department who also happens to be an accomplished photographer , was driving in the Civic Center area when he saw what looked to be an impending confrontation between a large group of protesters and a sizable contingent of police officers -- so he hurriedly parked his car , grabbed a camera and rushed to the scene .
" The people were coming out of the park , and the police were saying , ' Get back .
Get back , ' " Ross recalls .
" I got out and started snapping . "
Shortly thereafter , he saw the aforementioned officer face off against a woman identified in the Rocky article as Alicia Forrest , 24 , a member of CodePink , an anti-war organization that advocates non-violent protest .
" He was coming forward and she was n't backing up , " he notes , adding that although obscenities were flying , he can't say for certain if any of them came from Forrest .
The officer " was directing all of his attention at her , and he was getting worked up , " Ross says .
" You could see him gritting his teeth .
And then he corked her , and down she went . "
Afterward , " a lot of people swarmed around her and she got shuffled off " -- and apparently , so did the officer .
According to Ross , the contingent of police dispersed within minutes amidst shouts from protesters about " fascist pigs . "
Rob Savoye , co-founder of a group called the Colorado Legal Eagles , confirms that his associates are currently seeking out more information about the incident , which , he says , seems to be " very serious . "
The following photographs appear in the sequence Ross took them .
The Rocky video is beneath them .

Getting back to zero
She was shocked when John told her that , even if you pay a collections company , your credit is still affected .

Back to my beginning
lower the card 's rate to 7 % .
Why I 'm pleased -- and mad
one
trying
BUT ...
definitely
Try not to be startled , folks , but I think the apocalypse may be at hand .
Why ?
Because a credit card company gave non-payers ato help them pay off their balance .
Okay , let me backtrack a little : I have this friend , let 's call him ...
John ( because I 'm unimaginative ) .
He and his wife had to live apart for part of this past year , when he got a job in another state .
She stayed behind to finish schooling .
Now , John comes from a well - off family and so his financial priorities have always been slightly off from mine .
And there 's no law against that ( yet ) , so hey live and let live .
But , once he met his now - wife , their combined sense of financial appropriateness really got skewed : --
They decided that , since their honeymoon was going to be one of the last big hurrahs before repayment of student loans and credit card debt set in , they would really do it up .
So they spenton a two - week trip to one of those all - inclusive resorts in the Bahamas .--
About a year later , the wife visited John and , while he was at work , won a Nintendo Wii off eBay .
When he expressed concern about the purchase -- given that they werepaying off the honeymoon -- she told him that he should relax .
" It was only $ 300 , " she said .
Plus , she 'd sign for her promissory note next week -- and any --
Recently , John became aware that there were some very angry creditors calling .
His wife had been in charge of making payments on the credit cards and , in the stress of graduation , she apparently just
And while looking for work , she continued that trend .
When the creditors began calling , John figured out something was wrong .
He mentioned to wifey dearest that Bank of America had called , threatening to send them to collections .
The wife thought they should let it happen , then make a deal with collections to get it off their credit report .
How do these people not get picked off by natural selection ?
So , John decided perhapsshould take control of their finances .
( Maybe he'd read a personal finance article by Liz Pulliam Weston ; maybe he just was too scared not to take the helm . )
After all , aside from the collections threats , they had late fee pains :
Their 6 cards were all getting late charges .
At $ 39.99 a pop , that 'sSo this brings us full circle back to the beginning of my post , dear readers .
When John called good ole '
B of A , the operator asked him why , exactly things had gotten to this point .
John explained :
He and his wife had lived apart , she was still a student so barely making money , and he had been out of work twice in the last 12 months .
The operator said he understood .
He said the company would let them set up a $ 150 - a - month , 6 month payment system , and then -- and this is the part where you hear the hoofbeats of the 4 horsemen -- said the company wouldJohn was so surprised , he actually asked if he had said 17 % .
Nope , said the operator , the company would like to have its money , and so it was in everyone 's best interest if B of A gave a lower rate .
Okay , here 's the thing : I 'm torn .
On the one hand , I 'm happy that at leastcredit card company has gotten a clue .
The thing that is so insidious about credit card debt is that those high rates of interest make it hard to see any real progress .
If you 're paying off debt , a good chunk of any payments made goes straight to interest .
Of course , this is how the companies make money , which is how they can afford to operate .
So it 's something of a necessary evil .
But to keep punishing people with high rates when they 'reto do the right thing ...
It 's always struck me as vaguely counterintuitive .
And perhaps it 's a sign of the economy .
People are starting to pinch pennies .
Lots of people are in way over their heads .
So maybe , just maybe , the credit card companies realize that their best chance to get their money is to give folks some leeway .
It will certainly create customer loyalty , if I had to guess .
It 's really annoying to watch all these other folks get breaks .
Maybe I 'm just over - inundated with the potential housing bailout ( and I'msick of hearing about private companies getting federal help ) .
It just feels like people who do the right thing are punished for it .
People who do n't walk away from their houses are still struggling .
Granted , people who do walk away have that major credit blemish , but they can plead victimhood and have probably already rationalized the whole thing to themselves .
Tim and I pay our cards -- in fact , we try to pay every week , just so that the money does n't get frittered away on other things while waiting for the due date .
We intend to pay every last cent we owe .
And yet we 're not getting any breaks from our credit cards -- other than more credit card offers of introductory rates .
I am just getting tired of people who take shortcuts getting rewarded .
The rest of us are running a marathon .
We 're sweaty and tired and have quite a few more miles ahead of us .
But it seems like the ones getting the Gatorade are the same ones who cheat and take the bus to the finish line .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
In a bid to show the demand for the upcoming all - electric Chevrolet Volt , a proponent of the car has released details of an unofficial waiting list for the vehicle with over 33,000 prospective buyers .

REUTERS / Handout
Lyle Dennis , a New York neurologist who has emerged as a prominent enthusiast for the battery - powered car from General Motors Corp , has been assembling a list of prospective Volt buyers for over a year through his Web site GM - Volt.com .
On Tuesday , Dennis released details gleaned from the list showing that 33,411 people had signed up to show their intent to buy a Volt when the rechargeable car is released in 2010 .
The list shows the highest number of potential Volt buyers in California , Texas , Florida and Michigan .
It also includes potential buyers from 46 countries outside the United States .
The average price buyers were willing to pay for the car was $ 31,261 -- substantially less than the $ 40,000 GM has said it will cost to build the first - generation of the car equipped with a massive lithium - ion battery pack .
GM has been racing to finish development of the Volt in time for the planned launch as the centerpiece of its effort to break a costly association with gas - guzzling vehicles at a time when truck sales are tumbling and gas prices remain high .
Like most automakers , GM typically keeps its vehicle development programs under tight wraps and shuns publicity .

But with the Volt , GM has taken the opposite approach , actively consulting enthusiasts like Dennis and featuring the concept version of the Volt in high - profile advertising , including a television spot broadcast during the Olympics .
Dennis , who organized a meeting between enthusiasts called the “ Volt Nation ” and GM executives at the New York Auto Show earlier this year , said he was motivated by a desire to show the Detroit - based automaker that the Volt would have a wide base of buyers from the start .
“ If everyone who wanted a Volt could get one , that would be the dream , ” said Dennis .
GM , which does not expect to make money on the first - generation of the Volt , has said it will ramp up output slowly when production of the plug - in hybrid starts at a Hamtramck , Michigan plant .
A GM spokesman said that the automaker expected an initial shortage for the Volt , similar to the shortages for other hot - selling recent models .
“ I do n’t know if there is any other vehicle or any other technology that has generated this kind of interest because of the state of the market and gas prices , ” said GM spokesman Dave Darovitz .
“ We know the demand is going to be there . ”
Darovitz declined to discuss pricing for the Volt
GM showed off a concept version of the Volt in January 2007 but has retooled the look of the vehicle significantly since then , in part in order to improve its aerodynamics , representatives of the automaker have said .
GM is designing the Volt to run for 40 miles on a lithium - ion battery pack that can be recharged at a standard outlet .
The Volt will also capture energy from braking , like a traditional hybrid , and feature an on - board engine that will be used to send power to the battery on longer trips .
GM is racing Toyota Motor Corp to bring the first mass - market , plug - in car to the marketplace .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama took the lead in the race for superdelegates on the eve of a contest that 's expected to fall easily into Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's column .
Sen . Barack Obama has a big lead over Clinton in overall delegates .
Rep. Tom Allen of Maine , Dolly Strazar of Hawaii , Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii and Keith Roark of Idaho all endorsed Obama Monday , giving him a lead of four superdelegates for the time being .
Obama and Clinton face off Tuesday in West Virginia , where polls show Clinton ahead by more than a 40 - point margin .
Under pressure from some to withdraw from the race , Clinton insists that West Virginia , where only 28 delegates are at stake , is a key state in the fight for the White House .
She said again Monday that no Democratic candidate since 1916 has gone on to win the White House without first winning West Virginia .
" West Virginia is making a decision that has far - reaching consequences to send a message to people what you expect from your next president , " she said at a stop in Clear Fork , West Virginia .
Clinton currently trails Obama across all fronts -- superdelegates , pledged delegates and the popular vote , according to CNN 's latest estimates .
Obama leads in the race for superdelegates , 277 to Clinton 's 273 , and he's ahead in the overall delegate count , 1,869 to 1,697 .
At the beginning of the year , Clinton led the superdelegate race by more than 100 .
Clinton has vowed to stay in the race until someone gets enough delegates to clinch the nomination .
The focus of the Democratic race has largely turned to the superdelegates because they outnumber the remaining pledged delegates up for grabs .
Superdelegates are party leaders and officials who will vote for the candidate of their choice at the Democratic convention in August .
Some have already committed to vote for a particular candidate and some have not .
Clinton 's campaign says she would be more electable in a general election because she has done well in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania , as well as Florida and Michigan , which were stripped of their delegates .
West Virginia is also a key swing state .
Bill Clinton won in 1992 and 1996 , and George Bush carried it in 2000 and 2004 .
Obama spoke in Charleston , West Virginia , on Monday , sounding patriotic themes and saying he expected Clinton to win on Tuesday .
" But when it 's over , what will unify us as Democrats -- what must unify us as Americans -- is an unyielding commitment to the men and women who 've served this nation and an unshakable fidelity to the ideals for which they 've risked their lives , " Obama said .
Clinton 's campaign says if she leads in the popular vote , she should become the Democratic nominee .
" Hillary is within striking distance of winning the popular vote nationwide -- a key part of our plan to win the nomination , " campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe said in a letter to supporters Sunday .
Her campaign is trying to turn out the vote in the remaining six contests , hoping the popular vote argument will persuade superdelegates to endorse her instead of Obama .
West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin , an uncommitted superdelegate , said the delegate numbers are in Obama 's favor , but the popular vote is important to the people of his state .
Watch what Manchin says about Tuesday 's contest »
" I think we see what happened in 2000 , when Al Gore won the popular vote , and where the country has gone and the feelings toward government since then .
I put a lot of stock in that , " he said on CNN's " American Morning . "
" If the people believed that it was over , they would n't be voting maybe in the way they might vote tomorrow or in the next few campaigns , " he said .
Clinton is expected to trounce Obama in West Virginia , but Manchin said he thinks Obama would also be able to carry the state in the general election .
Clinton had a 43 - percentage - point advantage over Obama in West Virginia , 66 percent to 23 percent , according to a survey from the American Research Group released Friday .
The poll was conducted after last Tuesday 's contests and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .
" This state is really Hillary Clinton 's wheelhouse .
It 's an older population , socially conservative , blue - collar workers , " said Kennie Bass , a political reporter for WCHS in West Virginia .
CNN 's Alexander Marquardt contributed to this report .

The US is already in a recession and it will be longer as well as deeper than many people expect , US investor Warren Buffett said .
Warren Buffett said the economy is still in a recession and unlikely to improve before 2009 but that stocks appear better valued than a year ago .
He said in an interview the US was “ already in recession ” and added : “ Perhaps not in the sense that economists would define it ” with two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
“ But the people are already feeling the effects , ” said Buffett , the world ’s richest man .
“ It will be deeper and last longer than many think . ”
“ You always find out who ’s been swimming naked when the tide goes out .
We found out that Wall Street has been kind of a nudist beach , ” said Buffett , who in March was called the world ’s richest person by Forbes magazine .
But that is just part of a market system .
And you know , if I had to pick the chances that we are going into a recession , I would say they are fairly significant , but I do n’t know anything that you do n’t know .
However he said that wo n’t stop him from investing in selected companies and said he remained interested in well - managed German family - owned companies .
“ If the world were falling apart I ’d still invest in companies , ” he said .

Well , historically they ’ve always said that if we get a cold , the rest of the world gets pneumonia or something .
But , we are still very important in the U.S. , and we are still very linked in many ways .
But we are n’t as important as we used to be relative to the rest of the world .
Buffett also renewed his criticism of derivatives trading .
“ It ’s not right that hundreds of thousands of jobs are being eliminated , that entire industrial sectors in the real economy are being wiped out by financial bets even though the sectors are actually in good health . ”
Buffett complained about the lack of effective controls .
“ That ’s the problem , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t steer it , you ca n’t regulate it anymore .
You ca n’t get the genie back in the bottle . ”
Buffett earlier said anyone found responsible for wrongdoing should leave ratings group Moody ’s , in which his investment company Berkshire Hathaway owns some 20 per cent .
In terms of pure economics , you know , our children will live better than we live , our grandchildren will live better than our children .
There is economic progress .
Mankind has not used up its potential yet and we find ways to become more and more productive , turn out more and more goods and services that people want .
So I ’m a bull long - term on mankind ’s possibilities .

Retaining its spot as the largest company in the world , the retail giant spent the last year making strides toward becoming friendlier to its workers and the environment .
Long derided for the limited health - care packages offered to its employees , the company focused on expanding its options .
As of January , 93.7 % of Wal - Mart�s U.S. employees had some form of health care , up from 90.4 % last year .
On the sustainability front , the retailer sold 145 million energy - efficient light bulbs in 15 months and joined forces with the Clinton Climate Initiative .
Some say it is n�t enough ; a union - backed ad campaign by WakeUpWalMart.com at the end of 2007 targeted the quality of the company�s imported products .
Still far from pleasing all its critics , Wal - Mart did please its shoppers :
Its renewed focus on lower prices delivered a stellar second half , bolstering total revenue for the year to $ 379 billion .

Pregnancy = Prison in Alabama
Beware of zealots .
Today 's zealot is Greg Gambril , the district attorney in rural Covington County , Alabama , who is making a name for himself by prosecuting women who use drugs during their pregnancies .
Over an 18 - month period , at least eight women have been prosecuted for using drugs while pregnant in this rural jurisdiction of barely 37,000 , a tally without any recent parallel that women ’s advocates have been able to find .
Gambril 's prosections are likely to convince drug using women to avoid seeking medical care during their pregnancies , lest they face imprisonment .
Physician - patient privilege assures that wo n't happen , you think ?
Police affidavits make it clear that local doctors are cooperating in these investigations .
Separating women from their newborn children does n't promote " family values " -- it simply prevents mother and child from bonding during the child 's critical formative years .
Sensible alternatives would focus on helping women , not sending them to prison .
It is n't at all clear that the prosecutions are consistent with the law upon which Gambril relies : [ more ... ]
Now that all the cool biology students wear skinny jeans and talk that superorganism jive , I 'd just like to say : Wired Science was there first .
In today 's New York Times profile of legendary evolutionary biologist E.O. Wilson , Nicholas Wade describes Wilson 's new fight :
The issue is the level at which evolution operates .
Many evolutionary biologists have been persuaded , by works like “ The Selfish Gene ” by Richard Dawkins , that the gene is the only level at which natural selection acts .
Dr. Wilson , changing his mind because of new data about the genetics of ant colonies , now believes that natural selection operates at many levels , including at the level of a social group .
I started covering group - level selection last summer , when the behavior of bass parasites in my parents ' pond made me wonder how characteristics that emerge through population - level interactions fit within the rubric of evolution .
Out of those musings came a series of posts on evolution and complexity , eventually culminating in a feature article , " Biologists Take Evolution Beyond Darwin — Way Beyond . "
If you 're interested , here 's the whole series :

We ’re well past the point at which congressional Republicans have jumped the shark , but let ’s pause to appreciate the fact that at least one leading GOP lawmaker is now looking to a fake ad by a 27 - year - old heiress / reality - show star as a serious source of public policy .
The lines between celebrity and politician blurred into a haze Thursday at a Republican news conference , as one congressman began pushing Paris Hilton ’s “ plan ” on energy .
“ Let ’s bring up the Paris Hilton plan , ” goaded Rep. Michael Burgess , R - Texas . [...]
“ Even Paris Hilton had an energy plan that she ’s talking about , ” said Burgess , seizing a chance to make Democrats look lackluster on the issue .
The Texas congressman tried to put Hilton in the Republican camp , claiming her words mirrored current GOP legislation known as the “ No More Excuses Energy Act ” .
But , while that proposal does allow offshore drilling , a congressional summary shows it does not contain tax credits to encourage new automobile technology .
For crying out loud , Paris Hilton is not a policy expert .
She was n’t seriously offering an energy proposal for members of Congress to embrace as an actual solution .
For that matter , Hilton ’s fake ad talked about using expanded coastal drilling to “ carry us until the new technologies kick in , ” which does n’t make any sense , since even the Bush administration and McCain ’s policy aides concede that we ’re about a decade away from new coastal drilling having any kind of effect on the marketplace .
And even then , we ’re talking about pennies on the gallon .
There ’s nothing to actually “ carry us ” at all .
And yet , we actually have an elected member of Congress announcing , “ Let ’s bring up the Paris Hilton plan . ”
It ’s as if Republicans are going out of their way to appear ridiculous .
On purpose .
In the last week , two major pillars of President Bush ’s approach to foreign policy have crumbled , jeopardizing eight years of work and sending the administration scrambling for new strategies in the waning months of its term .
From the earliest days of his presidency , Bush had said spreading democracy was a centerpiece of his foreign policy .
At the same time , he sought to develop a more productive relationship with Russia , seeking Moscow ’s cooperation on issues such as terrorism , Iran ’s nuclear program and expansion of global energy supplies .
And in pursuing both these major goals , Bush relied heavily on developing what he saw as strong personal relationships with foreign leaders .
The recent setbacks to the president ’s approach were all the more unsettling because Georgia had appeared to be one of the few success stories in the administration ’s effort to nurture new democracies that could advance U.S. interests .
Advertisement
Efforts to create multiethnic , democratic regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan have run into repeated difficulties .
And the American push for Palestinian elections in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip ended in victory for the radical group Hamas , complicating an already formidable task of reaching a Middle East peace accord .
Since the Georgia conflict erupted , Bush has repeatedly cited that nation ’s progress toward democracy as he promised American support .
“ The people of Georgia have cast their lot with the free world , and we will not cast them aside , ” he said .
Faced with a massive deployment of Russian military power , however , the U.S. response was confined to condemning Moscow ’s actions , pushing for humanitarian aid and pressing Georgia to accept a cease - fire agreement brokered by France that would leave Russian troops still inside Georgia ’s two breakaway enclaves .
“ What freedom strategy ? ” asked David L. Phillips , a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of a report on Georgia .
“ It is scorned worldwide .
Afghanistan is backsliding .
The bar has been set low in Iraq .
Georgia is in ruins . ”
Advertisement
The damage may not be confined to Georgia , many analysts believe .
The U.S. had intended to renew its push for expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into Georgia and Ukraine in December .
But with its military action , Russia has signaled its categorical opposition to further expansion .
And several Western European nations are likely to be reluctant to expand the alliance , though German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday during a visit to Georgia that the path to membership was still open to the former Soviet republic .
“ This action is a real challenge to the idea of building a Europe whole , free and at peace , ” said Stephen Flanagan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Advertisement
And Moscow ’s violent intervention in Georgia may put democratic movements in Ukraine and other nearby countries at risk , in the view of Leslie H. Gelb , former president of the Council on Foreign Relations .
The Bush administration should not “ jeopardize these nascent democracies by letting them think that they can put themselves in this kind of situation and survive , ” Gelb said .
“ You are not just putting democracy on the line in Georgia , you are putting all of these places in that neighborhood on the line . ”
Although U.S. officials say they repeatedly warned Georgia not to give Russia an excuse to attack , many observers believe the warm embrace that the Bush administration gave President Mikheil Saakashvili gave him a false sense of support and a mistaken view that his friendship with the U.S. would deter a large - scale Russian invasion .
James J. Townsend Jr. , a former Pentagon official now with the Atlantic Council , said emerging democracies and democratic movements often assume the U.S. can or will do more to back them .
Advertisement
But the realities of international affairs mean American cheerleading may be simply that .
“ I have seen it over and over again be misconstrued by nations not used to dealing with us , ” Townsend said .
“ I think they misunderstand our eagerness and enthusiasm and think we are going to be behind them for anything .
“ That is what happened in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 , ” he added , referring to Soviet invasions of those two nations to crush uprisings .
The United States was not wrong to encourage democratic movements in Georgia and other nations , experts argue .
But along the fringes of the former Soviet Union the task is sensitive , especially since the Bush administration coupled support for democracy with efforts to forge new security alliances there .

And rather than focusing on individual leaders , critics say , the administration should have put more effort into building up a middle class and bolstering civil institutions , a slower process .
“ Every president has to stand for democracy , ” Gelb said .
“ But the notion of force - feeding democracy into societies that have never practiced it is a mistake .
And in most cases we pay some price for trying to do it . ”
Bush rejected the evolutionary approach , hoping to create democratic governments where they had not existed before and relying on individual leaders who demonstrated charisma and espoused noble goals .
Many of those leaders have struggled .
Former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi in Iraq and President Mahmoud Abbas in the Palestinian territories did not marshal enough public support .
President Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan has so far failed to build an effective government .
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf came to power in a coup , has undercut democracy in his country and is on the brink being impeached .
And Saakashvili badly miscalculated Russia ’s tolerance .
Advertisement
But perhaps in no case did Bush rely on a warm individual relationship with a charismatic leader more than with Russia itself .
To a significant extent , Bush built U.S. policy on his individual rapport with Vladimir Putin , rather than on more traditional and impersonal diplomacy .
Early in his term , Bush famously said that he got a “ sense of his soul ” after a meeting with Putin , who after eight years as Russia ’s president stepped down this year and became prime minister .
“ I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy , ” Bush said .
Yet Putin has consolidated power and ruled with an authoritarian might that has sharply diminished Russian democracy .
“ Bush ’s notion was that his and Putin ’s personal chemistry would be enough to manage the relationship and deal with Russia ’s concerns , ” Flanagan said .
“ And that proved not to be the case . ”
Advertisement
Officials from an older school of international relations have long shied away from making policy decisions based on the personality of leaders .
“ I have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust , ” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday when asked whether he trusted Putin .
“ I think you make national security policy based on interests and policies . ”
Gates has advocated engaging with Russia in meaningful strategic dialogues .
But meaningful negotiations with Moscow will be difficult in the wake of the Georgia conflict , analysts agree .
On Thursday , Gates said Russia ’s military action had “ called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward , ” Gates said .
Advertisement
Still , many experts believe that Washington must try to talk to Russia on a broad number of issues , including U.S. plans to install a missile defense system in Europe and Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
“ Russia is more dangerous if it is marginalized , ” Flanagan said .
“ Its potential for mischief and disruption is even greater . ”

Smalltalk
Since around June 2008 , Étoilé has included a Smalltalk Just - In - Time ( JIT ) compiler .
Smalltalk is a simple , pure object oriented , language originating at Xerox PARC in the ' 70s .
Objective - C , in which GNUstep and the core of Étoilé are written , is an attempt to combine Smalltalk and C into a single language .
Everything you see between square brackets in Objective - C can be thought of as ' inline Smalltalk ' in a C program .
For example , the following are Objective - C and Smalltalk versions of the same thing :
Objective-C :
[ object messageWith: anArgument ] ;
Smalltalk :
object messageWith : anArgument .
As you can see , the two are very similar .
The main difference between Smalltalk and Objective - C is that this is all that Smalltalk does - everything is done in terms of sending messages to objects - while Objective - C uses C syntax for a lot of things .
One particular example of this is flow control .
If you want to execute something based on whether a condition is true , then you send it an ifTrue : message with a code block as the argument , like this :
condition if True : [ ' The condition was true . ' log . ] .
A block is a Smalltalk construct which creates an object representing a block of code .
It responds to a value message , which causes it to execute and return the value of the last expression to execute .
This simple snippet will run the block if condition decides that it in some way represents a true value .
Blocks can take arguments too .
A common use of blocks is performing permutations on collections .
For example :
array map :[ :x | x transformWith :y. ] .
This block will respond to a value : method and will run the code with the value of x set to whatever was passed in as a parameter .
The array will send this block a value : message with each element in the array as an argument .
You will get back an array with the result of sending a transformWith :y message to every object in the array .
Note that y is not declared inside the block .
Code inside blocks can reference any variables that are valid when the block is created .
The dialect of Smalltalk used by Étoilé is similar to that provided by GNU Smalltalk .
The main difference you will encounter is that the class libraries are different .
While most Smalltalk implementations come with the set of classes found in Smalltalk - 80 and some extras , the Étoilé implementation is designed to work closely with GNUstep .
The core objects provided by the system ( e.g. collection classes ) are all from OpenStep .
You can send messages to Objective - C classes and objects as if they are Smalltalk objects ( in fact , Smalltalk objects and Objective - C objects are represented in exactly the same way at run time ) .
For example , you can create an array and add objects to it like this :
a := NSMutableArray array .
a addObject : b. a addObject : c .
You can also use the shorthand form :
a := {b. c} .
These two are functionally equivalent , although the second form is slightly more efficient .
Smalltalk uses parentheses to indicate precedence .
So , if you wanted to log the second item in the array created above , you would use :
( a objectAtIndex : 1 ) log .
To create classes in Smalltalk , you send a subclass : message to an Objective - C or Smalltalk object , for example :
NSObject subclass : LS [ run [ | fm files out | fm := NSFileManager defaultManager .
files := fm directoryContentsAtPath : '.'. out := NSFileHandle fileHandleWithStandardOutput . files foreach :[ :x | x printOn : out . '
' printOn:out . ]. ] ]
This creates a subclass of NSObject ( the OpenStep base class ) with one method , run .
If this code is fed to the Smalltalk launcher tool , then an instance of this class will be created and sent a run message .
Inside the run method , three local variables are declared .
fm is set to the default NSFileManager instance ( this class is a singleton , so you only get one per program ) .
The local variable files is then set to an array of all of the files in the local directory .
This array is then sent a foreach : message .
This message causes it to run the block passed as an argument with every object in the array , in order .
It will print each of the items in the array , followed by a newline .
This is therefore a very simple implementation of the standard UNIX ls tool .
Categories ( sets of methods added to an existing class ) can be written in Smalltalk by sending the class an extend message , instead of a subclass : message .
Foundation Data Types
A lot of things in OpenStep are not quite purely object oriented .
OpenStep was originally designed to run on 25MHz Motorola 68 K machines , and in some places a pure object system was sacrificed for speed .
There are a small number of C structures in the Foundation and AppKit libraries that are used in a lot of places .
These include NSRect , NSRange and a few others .
In Objective - C , you would create a substring like this :
NSRange r = NSMakeRange ( 0 , 9 ) ; NSString substr = [ @" Substring of longer string " substring WithRange:r ] ;
Here , r is a C structure with two elements , a location and a length .
This is then passed as an argument to the substring WithRange : message .
Smalltalk , however , is a pure object - orented language .
It does not have structures .
This was a problem for OpenStep in the past .
It is sometimes convenient to put these structures into an OpenStep collection class , like an NSArray or an NSDictionary .
Unfortunately , these only support objects .
The solution to this is the NSValue class , a class used to wrap ( ' box ' ) a primitive C type .
You can create an NSValue representing a range in Smalltalk like this :
range := NSValue rangeWithLocation:0 length:9 .
In Objective - C , you would then send this a rangeValue message to get the primitive C type .
In Smalltalk , you do n't need to do this , you just use it directly :
substr := ' Substring of longer string ' substring WithRange:range .
Behind the scenes , the Smalltalk compiler introspects the substring WithRange : method and learns that it expects an NSRange as a parameter .
It then sends the range object a rangeValue message and passes the result as the argument , instead of the range object itself .
This means you can use any Objective - C object ( including one of your own creation ) as long as it responds to a rangeValue message .
You can even use Smalltalk objects , as long as they implement a rangeValue method .
Since the compiler knows that rangeValue must return an NSRange , anything the Smalltalk object returns from its rangeValue will also have rangeValue called on it - at some point you need some Objective - C glue to create the primitive type , but it can be via as many layers of indirection as you please .
This same boxing mechanism is used to turn Smalltalk SmallInt objects into C integers and vice - versa .
Any object responding to an intValue message can be passed to a method expecting a C int , or returned from a method returning a C int .
HONG KONG --
At $ 800 an ounce , the golden bathroom sink had to go .
At $ 1,000 , say goodbye to the golden horse - drawn chariot .
But do n't even think about touching the golden toilet .
Global economic uncertainty over the past few years has pushed gold prices into the stratosphere , and few people have felt that rise as much as Hong Kong entrepreneur Lam Sai-wing has .
He has spent the past decade constructing a palace of gold , decked out in six tons of the precious metal .
In recent years , the palace has become an attraction mainland Chinese tour groups could n't miss , and a boon for Mr. Lam 's retail jewelry business , Hong Kong- listed Hang Fung Gold Technology .
Since gold prices hit four - digit territory earlier this year , Mr. Lam has been taking apart his hall of gold as quickly as he once raced to construct it .
He is melting down golden chandeliers , armchairs and armored knights and selling gold by the ton to fuel growth plans that include hundreds of new retail outlets in mainland China .
But even with the selloff , one thing is certain :
The toilet stays .
" I do n't care if gold hits $ 10,000 an ounce , " Mr. Lam says .
" I 'm not melting it down . "
As far as Mr. Lam is concerned , the golden toilet is more than a Guinness World Record - certified , 24 - karat , fully functional flushable throne .
Holy crap .
I did n't see that one coming .
Do not , I repeat do not try this yourself , you boneheads .
Now , who wants to take a guess at what sly viral marketing this is and what it 's going to end up trying to sell us ?

Back in the mid-90s , when Linux was still at 1.something , website design was a simple exercise that left matters such as font choice up to the user .
It was blessedly free of the Tyranny of Typography , the Legacies of Layout , and other controlling influences from the Provinces of Print .
Better yet , it was free by design from withering rebuke by aesthetes whose high - minded " taste " made life miserable for both writers and readers .
Back then
the Web was meant to be maximally usable and minimally controlled by Authorities who knew more about what you need than you do .
That was the Idea , and it stuck .
For about two years .
Now it 's all but forgotten .
The Web is overrun by " design " out the wazoo , made worse by SEO and other forms of Google - gaming greed .
I am reminded of how far we 've come by UI Guru Jakob Nielsen 's Site Is Unreadable , by Hank Williams , in his blog , Why Does Everything Suck ?
Hank begins ,
Ok , this is only half a dig .
Jakob is one of the most respected writers and thinkers about user interface on the web .
He is clearly bright , and he writes intelligent and useful things .
In fact I quote Jakob and reference his work all of the time .
But I find his site unreadable .
It hurts my eyes .
What got my attention most recently was this new post on the year 's 10 best application UIs .
Unfortunately , I have to say , Jakob has perhaps the worst site design I have ever seen .
It is as if , while he is handing out the Oscars , he is wearing a plaid polyester suit .
In truth his site is fine from an information architecture perspective .
But from an aesthetics perspective it is awful .
And aesthetics is important in UI .
If you begin to look at something and want to avert your eyes , the site has failed .
In truth , Jakob 's site has always been ugly .
But this time it felt , to me , beyond ugly .
I looked at the bulleted list of the top sites , and the bold cramped disorganized looking type starting each bullet , and I could not bear it .
He concludes ,
... do we think less of Jakob Nielsen as an interface consultant if he seems to have no taste ?
Jakob 's absence of " taste " is what I like and appreciate about his design sense , or delightfully usable lack of it .
It is to Jakob 's enormous and enduring credit that he rejects everything that compromises simple usability , no matter how tasteful ( translation : fashionable ) it may be .
Jakob 's home site , useit.com , has a design that remains unchanged since 1995 .
That was when I lifted his html and used it to frame up searls.com .
Watch how fast either of those pages loads .
Better yet , read them on a mobile device and see how fast they load on those things -- where more and more of the Web is being read , every day .
Speaking of usability , I just tried posting a comment to Hank 's blog , but failed .
Hank handily gives commenters a choice of identity systems : Google , LiveJournal , WordPress , TypePad , AIM , OpenID , Name / URL and Anonymous .
Each one I picked brought me a CAPTCHA , and after that a bold response ( in white , reversed out of a red block ) that reads " URL contains illegal characters " .
This happened no matter what ID system I chose , including Anonymous .
So I just figured the hell with it , and am posting my comment here :
I like Jakob 's page because it is * absent * of " design " that makes too much of the rest of the Web , including this page , slow to load and unreadable to me unless I upsize everything with the zoom + command .
( And that 's not just because I 'm old .
Rather it 's because I do most of my work on a laptop , where pixel density has increased over the years , so what used to be an inch now runs at about 5 / 8 of one , making 12 - point type into 7 - point type . )
Jakob 's html is simple , straightforward and readable by human beings , just as God ( or Tim Berners Lee ) intended .
Thanks to minimal stylistic burden , his pages load quickly , which is extraordinarily helpful .
Case in point .
Your page here just took 15 seconds to load over my iPhone .
Jakob's ( which you find unreadable ) took about a second and a half .
What 's more , it was instantly readable , whether I was looking at it straight up , or with the iPhone turned sideways .
I also do n't need to spread two fingers to read any of the text .
In fact , I 'd say his html is ideal -- from a simple usability standpoint -- for both web page and mobile devices .
So I agree with Patrick Neenan , at least in this case .
Taste is overrated .
Usability is usability .
Employing * no* typography principles is a radically practical choice on Jakob 's part .
And I appreciate it for the rare and valuable practice that it remains .
In fact , I think that 's beautiful .
By the way , I wrote this in plain html of the Old Skool human - readable sort .
The fact that I can still do that is beautiful too .
We already knew that the Maliki " clarification " came only after pressure from the White House & CENTCOM , and that that " clarification " largely just reaffirmed his point that Obama 's time frame is more in line with the views of the Iraqi government .
We also already knew that the original translation was done by Maliki 's official translator , not Der Spiegel .
Well , now TNR is reporting that Maliki 's office personally reviewed the translation and signed off on it .
But it turns out that Maliki actually got a copy of the interview before it was printed and had the option to make any changes .
A writer at Der Spiegel sent us this tidbit of info :
The reason the magazine scores so many high level interviews is that the editors agree to allow the subjects to " authorize " the interviews before they go to press .
It was n't just a slip of the tongue , in other words : Maliki not only endorsed Obama 's plans for withdrawing from Iraq , but his office then explicitly approved the endorsement before it was printed .
The denials , then , were doubly facetious .
Spiegel could n't say so , though , without revealing its embarrassing authorization policy .
We can all debate Der Spiegel 's policy of allowing it 's subjects to " authorize " what gets published , but the fact that Maliki enorsed Obama 's position is now , unequivocally , beyond dispute .
Just so we 're clear , the sovereign government of Iraq explicitly embraces the idea of withdrawing US troops by the end of 2010 -- directly in line with the plan put forth by the so - called " unexperienced " Barack Obama .
The only conclusion that can be drawn from the entire episode , besides that Maliki wants US forces out of his country , is that George Bush and John McCain want the opposite , despite any rhetoric to the contrary .
It 's hard to overstate how monumental a game - changer this all is , but Matthew Yglesias does a pretty good job of summing it up .
You are here : Home / Bizarre Stuff / Cartoon ’s Biggest Bastards
The world of cartoons may be full of happy bunnies , singing clouds , and that sort of happy horseshit , but there ’s always the cartoon characters who are dumped into those worlds just to mess everything up for everyone else .
Â
Without them , there would be no real entertainment to cartoons at all and therefore , with this list , we salute the 20 greatest cartoon bastards of all time !
20 .Â Pete
Pete ( also known as Black Pete or Peg - Leg Pete ) was the nemesis of Mickey Mouse from way back in the Steamboat Willy days and then later became the sworn enemy of Donald Duck .
Pete was large and ever the bastard , picking on Mickey and his friends for no real reason other than to show that he was bigger and stronger than the whiney little runts .
He usually played an authority figure as well making himself all that much more of a thorn in the sides of our heroes .
A monstrous amalgamation of a dog and Long John Silver , Pete proved that he was an even bigger bastard than we thought when he actually befriended Goofy in A Goofy Movie and in the spin - off series Goof Troopâ€ ¦ probably all in a perverted attempt to make things purposefully awkward for the three loveable Disney icons during get togethers .
Peteâ€¦ AKA Black Pete , AKA Peg - Leg Peteâ€¦ YOU are a bastard !
19.Â Cobra Commander
Retreat !
Retreaaaaaaat !
Take the greatest dictators of all time , pair them with The Phantom of the Opera , and then throw in the intelligence of Jessica Simpson , and youâ€™ve got the chief nemesis of America and GI Joe , Cobra Commander .
We never really learned why Cobra Commander wanted to take over the world and why the entire membership of C.O.B.R.A. thought that this raspy and cowardly Nancy boy was the best choice to rule it , but never the less you have to admire Cobra Commander for his tenacity .
Even when his own people got sick and tired of his shit , replaced him with a bigger badass and then changed him into a snake , he still came back with this dipshit schemes and ultimatums .
Oh , and if you were one of his pals , he had no qualms about leaving your butt behind to save his own .
What a bastard .
18.Â Mumm Ra
Why did this guy hate the Thundercats so much ?
Was it because he landed on a planet he considered his own ?
It never stopped him from going after the Amazons or those retarded Ro-Bear Berbils things .
Mumm Ra picked on The Thundercats for no good reason , sort of like little kids pick on the new kids in school .
Instead of stealing lunch money , Mumm Ra wanted to steal Lion - Oâ€™s sword .
Later on in the series , with the addition of Mumm Raâ€™s faithfull pooch Ma Mutt , we learn that Mumm Ra hated the Thundercats simply because he was a dog person .
Plus , did anyone find it more than a little odd and disturbing that Mumm Ra – while in his weaker mummified form – basically paraded around naked with only a cape and some well - placed bandages to hide his shriveled shame ?
I ’m not saying anything , but I had an uncle who paraded out on his back porch wearing the same thing and he ’s not due for parole for another three years .
17.Â Daffy Duck
Yeah , I know .
Â
Heâ€™s a beloved Looney Tunes character and I ’m sure I ’ll get tons of hate mail over this choice , but Daffy Duck the biggest bastard of the Looney Tunes bunch !
Not even Yosemite Sam would stoop so low as to steal the spotlight from someone busting their ass to do a show or to steal a treasure from your best friend who accidentally stumbled upon it in a burrow .
Â
How big of a bastard do you have to be to make it so that the audience actually wants Elmer Fudd to shoot you ?
I mean , for Godâ€™s sake , to save himself from the possibility that he might actually get shot during hunting season , Daffy was willing to murderâ€¦ murder Bugs Bunny , the closest thing he has to a friend !
Youâ€ ™re despicable , you bastard !
16.Â Bender
I love the guy , but his bastardliness knows no bounds .
Now , you can argue that he is a machine and therefore immune to said accusations of bastarditude , but Benderâ€™s bastardisity is apparent whether he is human , animal , or mineral thanks to his scheming , thievery , and overwhelming ego .
What kind of a bastard steals from his friends that much ?
Tries to kill his friendâ€™s pets ?
Sells nude pictures of his friends on the internet ?
Granted , there are times when Bender saves the day , but in my opinion that makes him a loveable bastard rather than a plain old everyday bastardâ€ ¦ and thatâ€™s why we love the tin can .
He is the greatest Latino on television .
15.Â Mr. Cogswell
I know what youâ€™re saying , â€ œWhat about Mr. Spacely ?â€
True , Spacely was a bastard , but for the premiere bastard of the future , you donâ€™t look at George Jetsonâ€ ™s diminutive boss , but rather to his competitor , Mr. Cogswell .
So what makes Cogswell a bigger bastard than Spacely ?
Â
Spacely may have been a foul - tempered tyrant who would fire George without a second thought , but Cogswell was a person of questionable morals who would probably molest Elroy without a second thought if he thought it might give him the smallest leg up on the competition .
Cogswell was well known for sending spies into Spacely Sprockets to steal all of Spacelyâ€™s greatest ideas .
Why ?
Well , itâ€™s obviousâ€ ¦
Cogswell was one of those bastards who never got any great ideas on his own , so he had to steal them from other people .
Weâ€™ve all run into these kinds of bastards before and they are infuriating , arenâ€™t they ?
The fact that Cogswell revels in the idea of being an idea theif only makes him that much more insufferable .
14.Â Doctor Zin
Doctor Zin was a charismatic leader that somehow managed to recruit hundreds if not thousands of people to his side and what does he do with that power ?
He picks on a couple of kids and their dog .
What a bastard !
Later on , he even got his own daughterâ€ ¦ his own daughter , mind you , to seduce Hadji so that he could screw with the Quests that much more .
Not only is he a bastard , but heâ€™s a lousy father as well and now poor little Hadji , still hung up on his love , canâ €™t even fight Zin without popping a boner now .
Dr Zin has been a long - time enemy of the Quests .
No one knows exactly who he is , where he comes from , or what his doctorate is in — but everyone knows that he wants to take over the world .
( He ’s not shy about telling everybody who ’ll listen , and those who ’d rather not . )
Armed with a brilliant mind and seemingly bottomless pockets , Dr Zin is almost Dr Quest ’s evil twinâ€¦ .
His bastardly twin .
13.Â Flintheart Glomgold
The biggest bastard of Duckberg , no doubt , was Flintheart Glomgold .
True , Scrooge McDuck might have been a little greedy , but Flintheart made him look like the Salvation Army .
This was the classic case of keeping up with the Joneses .
If Scrooge got an airplane , Flintheart wanted a bigger airplane made out of gold .
If Scrooge made a million , Flintheart wanted to make a billion .
Now , a little ambition is fine , but this feathery bastard actually went out of his way to sabotage and steal from his rival , enlisting the help of lesser bastards like The Beagle Boys or Magica DeSpell and , if he was successful in knocking Scrooge down a peg or two , he would come over and gloat about it .
Bastard !
12.Â Dungeon Master
You want to talk about Bastards , Iâ€™ve got one of the more sadistic examples right here .
In the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon of the 80â€™s , four teens found themselves trapped in a mystical fantasy world guided only by the dwarfish Dungeon Master who they relied on to try and get home .
Instead of telling them , â€ œGo this way and get home , â€ this sawed - off little shit gave them riddles so convoluted that no one could solve them and continued to taunt them by saying he was going to send them home every weekâ€¦ only to watch in glee as their dreams shattered like glass .
Not to mention , he was the father of Venger , the villain of the entire story and was manipulating these kids to try and help redeem him .
A sadistic and selfish little bastard who really didnâ€™t give a rat ’s crap if the kids who trusted their lives to him got home or not ..
11.Â The Mooninites
What list of cartoondomâ€™s biggest bastards would be complete without these two pricks ?
There is literally nothing that these two do that isnâ€™t bastardly on one level or another and , letâ€™s face it , when the Mooninites are involvedâ€ ¦ those are really big levels .
Usually , the Mooninites spend their time trying to corrupt the poor innocent Meatwad to their bastardly ways making them bigger bastards than they would be if they would just remain individual bastards .
I mean , they actually out - bastard Master Shake .
Do you realize the amount of bastarditude it takes to pull that off ?
10 .Â Bluto
Tell me you people didnâ€™t see this one coming .
Bluto ( AKA Brutus ) is the epitome of the bully , large , crude , and Neanderthal - like .
Of course , merely being a bully doesnâ€™t get you on this listâ€ ¦
Bluto is the kind of guy who will go and try and steal your girlfriend every time even if sheâ€™s an ugly skinny chick with no rack at all .
Whatâ€™s worse , he loves to pick on the guy heâ€™s stealing said bimbo from and , of course , in his mind when a woman says no , it means “ take me , Iâ€™m yours . ”
Thankfully , Blutoâ€™s a bastard but not a bright one as he never once thought of eating spinach and beating the shit out of Popeye every now and again .
Stupid bastard .
9.Â Jerry
Jerry reminds me of a little brother .
Yeah , the big brother may start the confrontation every now and again , but the little brother does nothing but fan the flames and makes things worse because he knows that his parents arenâ€™t going to let the big brother kick the shit out of him even when he sorely deserves it .
Generally , Jerry wouldnâ€™t be on this list except for the fact that there are plenty of times that Jerry starts fights with Tom for no good damn reason .
Jerry steals Tomâ€™s food , bed , or girlfriend ( which is sick in of itself ) and when Tom tries to stop him , Tom gets bashed in the head and then kicked out by that fat black woman who always takes Jerryâ€™s side , leaving the little vermin to spread bubonic plague and drop mouse feces wherever he goes .
Little brothers are bastards and so is that fucking mouse .
8.Â Skeletor
Skeletor was not only a bastard , but he was a grade - A asshole as well .
He was mean to his henchmen , abused his powers , and even though he had a whole flippinâ€™ mountain to himself , he wanted to take the Sorceressâ€™ castle too .
Letâ€™s not forget , this is the same guy who made He - Man think that he killed an innocent person just to mindfuck him .
In many ways , Skeletor reminded me of this bastardly boss that I had once .
Our office would make $ 30,000 one month and heâ€™d throw a fit because it wasnâ€™t $ 45,000 .
Weâ€™d work our asses off and make $ 45,000 the next month and heâ€™d throw a fit because it wasnâ€™t $ 65,000 .
Skeletor is that bastardly boss that wants more but isnâ€™t grateful for what he has .
If anything , the 2002 rebirth of He - Man only saw Skeletor become just that much more bastardly .
Heâ€™s got his own sorceress , heâ€™s got a freakinâ€ ™
Beast Man as a minion , and best of all , he doesnâ€™t have Orko or anyone else retarded enough to call themselves Ram - Man !
But nooooooo , Skeletor has to continue to be a bastard and want more and more for himself .
If thatâ€™s not enough , I think he was gay too .
How could you have a hot piece of ass like Evil - Lynn sitting next to you all day and continually obsess about He - Man ?
Supergay .
7.Â David Xanatos
Xantos is the slick kind of bastard that I aspire to be one day .
Rich , good - looking , and charismaticâ€ ¦ he lived in an ancient castle he moved brick - by - brick to New York and then placed on top of the worldâ€™s tallest skyscraper just to get in with and screw over a bunch of Gargoyles .
Xanatos is another example of a bastard who wanted just a little bit more , but unlike Skeletor , Xanatos was slick about it only adding to his level of bastardliness .
He knew what he wanted and it was immortality and he wasnâ€™t going to let anyone get in his way .
I mean , for Godâ€™s sake , he turned his faithful right - hand manâ€™s right hand into stone just to test to see if one of his schemes worked or not .
That , my friends , is bastardly behavior .
Xantosâ€™ bastarditude fueled the show and , after his dramatic and slow change over to the side of good , Gargoyles turned into a pile of ostrich shit .
A testament to the true power of Xanatosâ€™ bastardliness , or just something else this awesome bastard had planned from the beginning ?
You be the judge .
6.Â Mr. Burns
It pains me to put Burnsey on the list , because despite his bastardliness , I love the old fart .
His presence brightened up even the lamest Simpsons episode and at his best , or should I say his worst , he makes the show worth watching .
I mean , what other 104 year - old would go out of his way to skin puppies to skin for a coat or steal the sun from an entire town ?
How would you feel if you worked for a boss for over 20 years and he couldnâ€™t remember your name ?
( I know that most of you are going to be spared this humiliation because youâ€™ll probably be destined to work a job with your named embroidered on a shirt , but let me tell youâ€¦ the pain cuts deep ! )
I love you , C. Montgomery Burns ( not in a Smithers way ) , but you are a bastardâ€ ¦ a magnificent bastard , but a bastard none the less .
5.Â Eric Crtman
Goodness , what a little bastard he is .
Itâ€™s not that Cartman is a spoiled only child of a mother who smothers him with attention and food , itâ€™s not that heâ€™s a greedy manipulative pig of a human being , itâ€™s not that heâ€™s a smartass and a foul - mouthed little brat .
Itâ€™s not that Cartman is vindictive or shallow , itâ€™s not that heâ€™s a liar , a cheat , a smug winner , or a backstabber .
Itâ€™s because heâ€™s got a big fat ass and this , my bastard - watching friends , is what makes Eric Cartman the biggest bastard in South Park .
4.Â Lex Luthor
With the Lex of Superman the Animated Series and Justice League Unlimited , there arenâ€™t any pansy - ass schemes to take over the world by using a team made up of a monkey and a retard who leaves clues so that the good guys can catch him , there isnâ€™t a fat pig - squealing sidekick or idiotic nephew , and there ainâ€™t no high school rich - boy angst .
Lex is a no-nonsense businessman , a power hungry egomaniac , and a bastard through and through .
Lex rhymes with sex and Lex is a sexy bastard .
Women want him and men want to be him … or with him too .
Â I guess it just depends on the man .
The thing about Lex Luthor that makes him such a bastard is the fact that people love him .
I mean , he could fire nuclear missile up Supermanâ€™s ass and have him crash into a orphanage for crippled war children and the public would still eat him up .
I mean , for Godâ€™s sake , he went to prison , made a supervillan out of himself , and still almost won the presidency of the United States .
I hear that Lex was originally scripted to win the election , but George W. Bush ’s lawyers threatened to sue for copyright infringement .
Here ’s to you , Lex , you magnificent chrome - domed bastard !
3.Â The Grinch
Do you honestly need a more thorough explanation for this bastard ?
I mean , this little fuzzy green hunk of crap actually tried to steal Christmas !
I donâ€™t mean that figuratively , either kids , I mean this asshat actually rode into town , impersonated Santa Claus , and committed multiple acts of home invasion and burglary on Christmas Eve â€ “ stealing gifts , decorations , and food â€ “ simply because he found one day out of the entire year annoying .
I mean , even your grade - A bastards will tolerate a lot more than that before they start acting overly bastard - like , but not the Grinch , oh no !
He doesnâ€™t even do the normal bastardly things like filing noise complaints or trying to get city ordinances or court orders going like those annoying Aethists do every Christmas , this bastard decided to go in and physically take Christmas away from the Whos and throw all of their holiday spirit into a canyon !
Now , I know what youâ€™re saying , â€ œDuh , but didnâ€™t he reform at the end ? â€ 
Well , yeahâ€ ¦ but it wasnâ€™t permanent as we thought it was as he returned to torment the poor Cat in the Hat for no good damn reason and then terrorized Whoville yet again on Halloween .
Some reform that was !
The Grinch is a bastard and once a bastard , always a bastard .
Whatâ€™s next , Grinch ?
Are you going to steal Arbor Day ?
You can take my sapling when you pry it out of my cold dead hands , you cheese - eating dick monkey !
2.Â Stewie
Stewie is , perhaps , the most bastardly baby in the known universe .
With his eyes set on global domination and with killing the woman who gave birth to him , one must shutter at the very real threat that this toddling asstard poses to the world .
The thing with Stewie is that this little bastard has cuteness on his side and that cuteness blinds many people to the level of bastardicity that he actually exudes .
Itâ€™s sort of like the California electionâ€ ¦ everyone thinks it would be so cute to have a one - liner spewing movie star as governor , but the next thing we all know , the state is surrounded by a barbed - wire fence , Junior is playing in art houses , and everyone is wandering around in a daze saying , â€ œWhy !?
Why !?
Why didnâ€™t I vote for Gary Coleman!â€ 
With his lust for power , penchant for murder , and his bastardly ability to get away with it all , Stewie will forever go down in the annals of cartoon history as one of the most vicious bastards of all time !
1.Â Michael Eisner
Yeah , so heâ€™s not a cartoon character .
Fuckerâ€™s still a bastard , though .
Over the last ten years or so , I believe that Michael Eisner has single - handedly caused more damage to the animation world than any other man who has ever existed on the planet .
Thereâ€™s the obvious reason that heâ€™s a bastard in that he was instrumental in killing classic 2 - D animation at Disney when sub-par Disney films like Brother Bear and Home on the Range failed to make any money .
Instead of blaming a shoddy product , Eisner felt that cell animation is just dead and moved accordingly to stamp it out .
With Disney stock falling and the theme parks getting fewer and fewer visitors thanks to his micromanaging , Eisner was called on to leave his position by Walt Disneyâ€™s nephew , but he continued to hang on like a tick sucking the life blood out of his company .
Â
Finally , the bastard left and there were few tears .
The failure of Valiant and the other shitty CGI movies goes to prove that , like so many other things , Eisner was wrong about cell - animation being dead and I only hope that the next person to fill his shoes undoes the damage heâ€™s done to the industry and to Disney in general .
Yeah , he may not be a cartoon , but Michael Eisner is cartoondomâ€™s biggest bastard none the less .
A flight attendant escorted the girl on her eventual flight to Paris Staff at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel have found a four - year - old girl alone in a duty - free shop after her parents accidentally took a plane without her .
The parents boarded the flight to Paris with four of their five children .
The mother and father were sitting in different parts of the aircraft and did not realise their mistake until the captain informed them after take - off .
The girl was accompanied on the next flight to Paris .
The parents will be questioned when they return to Israel .
It is understood that the ultra Orthodox family , who were emigrating to France , were late for their flight and carrying a large amount of luggage .
Each parent thought the girl was with the other , but she was instead wandering around the airport 's large circular duty free area in tears .
She was able to give her name to officials who spotted her .
They tried to contact her parents over the airport 's public address system before realising the plane had already taken off .
" She was upset , crying , and asked over and over again for daddy and mummy , " said Sarit Ben - Eden , the police officer in charge of the departures hall .
The incident was a reminder of the 1992 film Home Alone 2 in which a large family leave one of their children behind in an airport while rushing off on a Christmas holiday .
' Top - notch people '
It is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child
Police official
The child 's grandmother , who had driven the family to the airport , told the Ha'aretz newspaper she did not know how the mistake could have happened .
" We 're in shock .
They 're very responsible and organised , top - notch people .
Apparently each one relied on the other and this is what happened , " she said .
Friends of the couple have told the Israeli media that they had a lot on their mind .
But a police official told AFP news agency : " It is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child .
This never happens . "
An Israeli police spokesman told the BBC that they would be keen to speak to the couple on their return to Israel to examine the extent of their negligence .
Separately , the Israeli airline company is investigating how it allowed only six people on board with seven ticket stubs .

McQueen ?
It turns out the designer of the dress was none other than the star herself and her stylist Jeanne Yang !
Though this original Holmes Yang design has gotten rave reviews , Holmes ’s rep tells PEOPLE that there is no line in the works .

Dear EarthTalk : I am considering solar panels for my roof to provide heat for my hot water and possibly to do more than that .
Are there some kinds of solar panels that are better than others ?
How do I find a knowledgeable installer ?
-- Elise , Watertown , MA
What type of solar energy capture system you put on your home depends on your needs .
If you want to go full tilt and generate usable electricity from your home ’s rooftop — and even possibly contribute power back to the larger grid — tried and true photovoltaic arrays might be just the ticket .
A typical installation involves the panels , which are constructed of many individual silicon - based photovoltaic cells and their support structures , along with an inverter , electrical conduit piping and AC / DC disconnect switches .
These systems can cost tens of thousands of dollars to install , and as such may not pencil out for those looking for the cheapest power solution .
But the upside is that homeowners with photovoltaic panels on their rooftops can rest assured that as long as the sun shines , they will have power to spare without generating emissions of carbon dioxide and other noxious pollutants .
Qualified solar installers can usually advise clients on which specific types of systems will work best given the specific location of a home .
U.S. homeowners can find qualified photovoltaic installers via the website FindSolar.com .
And the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners ( NABCEP ) provides a free searchable database of its U.S. and Canadian members specializing in home solar set -ups .
For less demanding applications , such as for heating water for your home or swimming pool , a much simpler ( and less expensive ) solar thermal system might be all you need .
A basic hot water system usually consists of a solar collector — basically a small metal box with a glass or plastic cover and a black copper or aluminum absorber plate inside — tied into the building ’s plumbing and electrical works .
According to the industry tracker website Solarbuzz , such solar collectors are usually mounted on rooftops .
Professional installers can get your home up and running with a solar thermal system for less than $ 4,000 in most cases .
While the savings in your electric bill may be small , homeowners in it for the long haul will definitely save over time , all the while enjoying the fact that you have lowered your family ’s carbon footprint significantly .
Homeowners looking to find out more about residential solar systems should be sure to check out the RealGoods Solar Living Sourcebook , a 600 + page renewable energy “ bible ” now in its 30th edition .
The book features the latest nuts - and - bolts information on how to harvest renewable energy in a variety of ways depending on need .
And RealGoods also sells much if not all of the equipment needed .
Another reason to consider going solar in one fashion or another is tax incentives .
According to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency ( DSIRE ) , 17 states now offer homeowners some kind of tax rebate or incentive for the purchase and / or installation of solar power equipment of any kind .
You can see what if any your state offers by logging onto the dsireusa.org website , where the searchable database is available in its entirety for free .

What is netfilter.org ?
netfilter.org is home to the software of the packet filtering framework inside the Linux 2.4.x and later kernel series .
Software commonly associated with netfilter.org is iptables .
Software inside this framework enables packet filtering , network address [ and port ] translation ( NA [ P]T ) and other packet mangling .
It is the re-designed and heavily improved successor of the previous Linux 2.2.x ipchains and Linux 2.0.x ipfwadm systems .
netfilter is a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack .
A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack .
iptables is a generic table structure for the definition of rulesets .
Each rule within an IP table consists of a number of classifiers ( iptables matches ) and one connected action ( iptables target ) .
netfilter , ip_tables , connection tracking ( ip_conntrack , nf_conntrack ) and the NAT subsystem together build the major parts of the framework .
The best diet is the one you can stick to .
You do n’t have to stop eating carbs or fats .
You do n’t have to eat crazy amount of proteins .
You do n’t have to eat every 3 hours .
You just have to control your calorie intake .
You can do this by counting calories directly .
Or you can do this by building simple eating habits .
You ’ve probably heard that lifestyles beat diets long - term .
That ’s actually the original meaning of the word diet – “ a way to live ” ( from the Greek word “ diaita ” )
So the StrongLifts diet advice is to focus on building simple eating habits you can stick to long - term .
You do n’t need any supplements to get stronger and build muscle .
You can get results without taking supplements .
Most supplements do n’t even work anyway , so you ’re better off without .
I barely take supplements for this reason .

An A - 10 pilot in Afghanistan used flares , infrared cameras , his 30 - millimeter gun , some quick thinking and his huge brass balls to save the lives of a German reconstruction team in Afghanistan two years ago .
On July 11 ,
Capt .
Brian Erickson was awarded a much - deserved Distinguished Flying Cross .
It happened like this : On Oct. 16 , 2006 , Erickson and a wingman were called in to help six German soldiers pinned down by insurgents firing rockets , machine guns and small - arms .
" As Captain Erickson flew his A - 10 deep into the moonless valley , the only light on the ground was from insurgent weapons - fire , " the Air Force reported .
* " I initially had my infrared sensor on to pinpoint the location of the insurgents , " said Captain Erickson .
" The problem with using the infrared is every time an RPG went off the glow impeded my ability to navigate the dark canyon .
The whole screen would go white and I could n't see outside my cockpit .
The only solution was to turn the screens off . " *
His wingman climbed high to use his own infrared camera pod to try to spot the bad guys .
Meanwhile Erickson , all but blind after turning off his sensors , " continued his low - level runs while illuminating the area with pyrotechnic self - protection flares in order to uncover the enemy location . "
" After we located where we thought the insurgents were , I had my wingman light - up the area with his targeting pod , " Erickson said .
...
In a single - pass , Captain Erickson employed 240 30 - mm rounds from the aircraft 's GAU - 8 cannon .
This completely halted the enemy 's fire .
Two hundred rounds from an A - 10's tank - killing gun ?
I 'll bet it " halted " the insurgents .
More likely , it turned them into pink grease .
Well done , Captain .

Deep in China ’s heartland is a region known as “ The Bethlehem of China , ” where , more than a thousand years ago , Western missionaries first brought Christianity to the area .
It is here , in a series of caves hidden in the hills , where members of China ’s underground Christian Church tell FRONTLINE / World and Chicago Tribune reporter Evan Osnos how they have kept the religion alive .
For years , they moved from place to place to avoid government detection , until they found safety in these hills .
“ When we were in an underground state , we would gather here to meet , ” Zhang Yinan , a pastor who ’s chronicling the rise of Christianity in China , tells Osnos .
Today , Zhang and the rest of his congregation have left the caves , as Christianity is beginning to emerge from the shadows in China .
But while it is not illegal to be a Christian , the Communist Party still maintains tight control of where and how Christians can practice .
“ Right now , it ’s not completely secret , but it ’s not considered public , ” a church leader tells Osnos .
Some Chinese Christians have chosen to remain underground , worshipping in what are called “ house churches . ”
As Osnos observes one such Evangelical Protestant service that looks more like a party , he says it is easy to forget that this was just the kind of gathering of Christians that the government tries to prevent – and that the leaders of this house church were risking arrest .
“ They ’ve tried to catch me several times , but they never succeeded because God protects me . ” says Wang Guiyan , who runs the church .
“ Christianity is freedom .
But Chinese Christians , they still have restrictions .
They are not completely free . ”
Near the end of the service , the congregation gathers around the wife of a well - known church leader , who says her husband has been arrested five or six times .
He has done stints of seven years and 11 months in prison and three years in labor camp .
Most recently , he was charged with a passport violation .
Before that , he was convicted of being a “ counter revolutionary ” and disturbing social order .
In case after case , the Chinese government gives a variety of reasons other than faith to arrest local house church leaders .
Sometimes , they demolish the house churches altogether .
But the government ’s attempts to control the underground church have largely failed to diminish their faith .
“ Looking back at our history , we ’ve had the age of the Republic , the age of intense war , the age of intense politics , and the age of intense economics .
The next 30 years will be the age of the gospel , ” says the historian , Yinan .
In today ’s booming China , the age of the gospel already seems to have arrived .
Back in Beijing , Osnos finds the Communist Party ’s answer to Christianity – an official church where Christians are supposed to worship .
The Party actually started the church right after the revolution to put religion under state control .
But in recent years , the official church has grown dramatically , running services to accommodate more than 4,000 people on Sundays .
Figuring out why this official version of Christianity is tolerated can be a little confusing .
One big difference : its pastors are trained and approved by the government .
And they adhere to strict rules of worship .
To get the official answer from the Communist Party , Osnos sits down with one of the directors of the State Adminstration of Religious Affairs , Ma Yu Hong .
“ The Communist Party officially is an atheist party , and yet there ’s an official Christian Church .
How do you explain that ? ”
Osnos asks .
“ The Party feels that differences in religious beliefs are secondary to our shared love of the country , ” Yu Hong says .
“ The relationship between the government an religious organizations , it should be said , is very close these days . ”
Still , the party remains worried that Christianity , or any rival ideology , could become a threat .
In recent years , they have taken a hard line with people they call Muslim separatists – the Uigher ethnic minority in Western China .
And they ’ve cracked down on Falun Gong , a once - popular spiritual movement whose members the government has branded “ enemies of the state . ”
“ If people use religion to divide the country or engage in terrorist activities , that will absolutely not be tolerated , ” said Yu Hong .
On the outskirts of Beijing , Osnos finds one dissident pastor who is openly challenging the government as an outspoken critic of the official church .
“ The pastors and ministers are all hand - picked and trained by the government .
They ’re guided by the Communist Party ’s philosophy , ” says Zhang Mingzuan .
“ But they have n’t given their hearts to Jesus .
They ’ve given their hearts to the country , and the Emperor . ”
For a time , Zhang ran his own house church , but today he runs an alliance of house churches all around the country – putting him under government scrutiny .
“ In the eyes of the communist party , everybody in my family , me , my wife , my two sons and younger daughter - in - law , we are dangerous people .
Our phone is bugged , we are followed everywhere , ” he says .
Osnos accepts an invitation to join Zhang as he travels to the countryside to check on a house church in his network .
On the long trip there , Zhang tells Osnos that the House Church Movement grew up in the aftermath of Chairman Mao ’s Cultural Revolution .
In the 1960s , Mao declared war on China ’s past .
The Red Guards targeted independent thinkers , closed down churches and burned bibles .
Thousands of clergy and church members were treated as counter revolutionaries , shipped to labor camps or even executed .
In the decades that followed , underground Christians like Zhang kept their faith alive by meeting in secret .
After eight hours in the car , Osnos and Zhang arrive in the Shandong Province .
“ We ’re going to see some people who were arrested for having an illegal church .
Since they were arrested , they sued the local government .
So the church is still functioning but they ’re in court essentially trying to ensure its existence , ” Zhang says .
Osnos asks one of the church members if he thinks he can depend on China ’s courts for help ?
“ I believe God loves our country .
And he loves us .
He will give us a fair answer , ” the man says .
That night , Pastor Zhang is the guest preacher at the house church .
“ The gap is becoming larger in China between the rich and the poor , the powerful and the powerless , ” he says .
“ I believe only Jesus , and not the communist party , can save this country and its people . ”
One small congregation at a time , the spirit of the rural house church movement is now spreading to the cities .
In what was once the land of Mao , there are thought to be as many Christians as Communist Party members .
Even China ’s new business class is getting religion .
In the city of Wenzhao , Osnos meets an influential Christian business executive who believes that Christian values are a perfect fit with capitalism .
“ Doing business requires trust , and Christian faith places great emphasis on trust and honesty , ” he says .
Back at Beijing University , Zhao Xiao , a prominent Chinese economist , explains what he found on his recent quest to discover the secret of America ’s economic success : Christian values .
“ If my motivation for doing business is for the glory of God , there is a motivation that transcends profits .
If I use evil methods to enlarge my company or to earn money , then this is not bringing glory to God , ” he says .
Zhao , a Communist Party member , was so convinced by his findings that he converted to Christianity .
Then , in a provocative article called “ God is My Chairman of the Board , ” he urged the Party to embrace Christianity as well .
It is a hopeful view of Christianity ’s evolving place in China , but how it will run up against the realities of party rule is still unclear .
A former pastor in the government ’s official church , Jin Mingri broke away last year to start his own church , Zion , in the belief that he could help define a new way for Chinese Christians to worship .
Housed in an old nightclub building on the edge of Beijing , Zion Church is an attempt to break down the barriers between China ’s official and unofficial churches and bring all Christians out into the open .
“ That ’s the direction we are moving towards , ” Jin says .
“ Churches will be given more and more space .
This is because reform and liberalization have resulted in a transfer of power to common people .
So naturally individuals will gradually be empowered to exercise their religious freedom . ”
At the most recent Communist Party congress , President Hu Jintao made an historic move , adding the word “ religion ” to the party constitution for the first time .
He urged party leaders to strike what he called a harmonious balance between church and state .
But not everyone trusts the party ’s new friendly face toward religion .
Fan Yafeng , a lawyer specializing in religious freedom , tells Osnos that the government ’s acceptance of Christianity is strategic .
“ To control the Chinese society , the government sometimes chooses to be lenient and sometimes tough , ” he says .
As Osnos goes back one more time to see house church leader Zhang Mingzuan , he learns about how Zhang was arrested just a few months ago .
“ I was preaching , about 12 o’clock , and people from the Bureau of Religious Affairs came in with the police .
I was in the middle of my preaching , ” he explained .
“ All we ’re doing is believing in Jesus , nothing else .
If there is no religious freedom , how can the country be in a harmonious state ? ” REACTION ( anonymous )
Phenomenal story .
In a time of greed and corruption within our own country ( USA ) , it is great to see Christianity breeding a new philosophy of business by implementing truth and integrity .
I can only hope that Americans will wake up and revolutionize our culture with those types of values .

What I do n't understand is why such a horrible picture of the pastor was chosen to be the main picture on the website .
It makes the whole commentary look diabolical .
When quite the contrary is true .
I really enjoyed the commentary and thought it was very well done .

I am a Chinese Christain , I know it 's ture .
family churchs are not protected by the law , their pasters can be arrested according to the law only if the local government wanna do it .
But thanks to the lord , because of all that we suffered , we can understand more about the pain Jesus suffered .
Thanks to God .
We believe God is here .
Please pray for China , brothers and sisters : ) )

Today I received a prayer request for a Pastor " Bike " .
He is the very same Pastor Zhang in this program .
He was arrested just before the Olympics started !
This should n't shock me , and yet it does .

Alan Amsted :
Thanks for the reference .
The Shanghai Scrap blog presents quite a devastating critique of this documentary .
The author of that blog has written some excellent articles for the Atlantic which present a nuanced picture of Chinese Christianity , and I respect his opinion .
What most Americans do n't seem to realize is that China has had a rough history with religion .
In the Taiping Rebellion of the 19th century , some guy went insane , decided that he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ , and launched a revolt that resulted in the deaths of 20 million people .
This is not unlike the Wars of Religion that Europe went through in the 17th century .
The European attitude of free - religion - within - limits is a better model for China than the American model of anything - goes .
Europe has established churches , not unlike China 's state - supported churches .
America lets you preach whatever you want , even if it's hate speech against gays or Muslims or whatever .
But Europe does n't have religious exemptions for preaching hate .
We let all sorts of cults run rampant ; the Germans crack down on Scientology ( and the Germans are ordinarily very sensitive to any type of limits on freedom ) .
I do not see any incompatibility between freedom of religion and regulation thereof .
Championing China 's illegal house churches is a mistake .
The Vatican has realized that it is better to deal with the legal churches than the illegal churches .
They can see this because they have a centralized hierarchy which is willing to weigh the pros and cons and accept imperfect solutions for the greater good .
The simplistic viewpoint of " legal churches bad , illegal churches good " is an unfortunate consequence of American absolutism which descends from our Puritan heritage .

After viewing the video " Jesus in China " I went to Adam Minters Blog to read " Not Exactly Jesus in China " which I found to be helpful .
I was struck by Mr. Minter 's insistence that there was little persecution of the house churches in China .
I have found many accounts which say other wise .
I can see Mr. Osnos has touched a nerve and placed Mr. Minter in a defensive posture .
Mr. Minter stats that Mr. Osnos " marginalizes the spiritual life of the tens of millions of Chinese Christians who choose to worship in churches registered " .
It is the house church movement which marginalizes the registered churches ; this includes the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury .
What we are seeing in China is a Christianity like which we read of in the book of Acts .
One of the characteristics of the house church movement is there willingness to put aside personal comfort and at times suffer prison to spread there faith .
What Mr. Minter does not see but his conscience is telling him , the Christianity we see the world today is not true Christianity .
Where is Jesus in China ?
The Chinese government has this figured out , and they are n't putting out the welcome matt .

This was a great video for revealing what is happening in China regarding Christianity .
I was surprised it did not further reveal the actual atrocities that have taken place to some of the house church leaders and their families or congregations who never returned from prison .

This report was so awesome and its great to see the fire of the Holy Spirit spreading across China .
This is especially impotant to me because , God willing , I will be there someday helping my brothers and sisters in Christ to spread the love of the Lord Jesus .
Amen !
People say and do things out of ignorance or hatred , but I pray that even those with that kind of attitude towards God may be saved .

As a student of China for the past 27 years and having lived and worked with Chinese , your report was excellent .
Of course , there are other dimensions and angles that you could explore .
But all in all , this is perhaps the best reporting around .
I 'm passing it on .

What frustrates me most about this story is that it neglected to mention the TRUE church of Hong Xiuquan , Jesus ' little brother , in the middle of the nineteenth century .
This church is so underground , that it is lost to even history .
We would have been better off if both Chinese and Western powers had accepted the true revelation and joined the Taiping Revolution .
All other Christians today are merely worshipping false idols .
I pray to Shangdi that they realize the errors of their ways .

As a volunteer for Voice of Martyrs ( a Christian organization that has served the persecuted church for 41yrs ) I thank you for this story .
I was pleasantly surprised to see some of the people I have been praying for for years .
Thank you so much for being a voice for millions who suffer severe persecution for their faith in Jesus Christ .
I would like you to do a follow up exposing what happens when these underground pastors are arrested and sent to re-education through labor camps .
The barbaric interrogation and torture needs to be exposed to the world .

It 's sad to see religion spread it 's tentacles , even in places like China .
I 'm amazed that some book from 2000 years ago by primitive man would have such a impact today .

I 'm really glad that for the first time in a long time , Media is not biased against Christianity .
I feel that Media tends to highlight fake Christians ( unrepentant sinners who claim to be Christians while raping boys , or committing financial fraud ) .
For the first time in a long time , especially in this feature , media is being unbiased and balanced .
Showing Christians and how they really are , and not highlighting the fakes .
Thank you .

This is a very done work , Mr. Osnos carefully documented his work , and faithfully narrated in its essence of what Christianity is all about in China .
The persecuted house churches , which is non-Three Self Church .
They do not want to join them because the house church leaders know too well that the Three - Self Church is not a true , living , and active in missions , evangelism , and does not honor to the Lord Jesus Christ as the head of the Churchã , See Colossians 1:18 .
To join the Three - Self Church will be committing idalatry , say the leaders .

I just returned from China after serving there as a " missionary " for a year ( of course , this was n't officially my job as that would be illegal in China ) .
I thought that this segment was very well done .
In response to the comment from Tulsa , Oklahoma , Jesus is relevant today because He saves souls .
This fact is infinitely more important than the nuclear crisis with Iran and the other situations that you cited ( as important as those are ) .
On a practical , political level , Jesus is still extremely important because Christianity ( and competing worldviews ) affect how people view the world and how they relate to other people - as individuals , communities , and nations .
Whether you believe in Him or not , Jesus has a tremendous impact on global politics , greater than any other force in history .
Sergio Paramo
Bellevue , NE
Great presentation !
I watch your documentaries and others in PBS to see another points of view of what is happening around the world .
I believe the mainstream U.S media is extremely self centered , just like mainstream U.S society .
This report has affirmed some of the suspicions and beliefs I have ponder upon for a long time .
I hold the view that the reason this country has been able to achieve the level of success economically and socially is because of the values permeated by Christianity thru its formation .
I believe this has been true not only in the U.S but in all other cultures which have embraced the teachings of God thru the Bible ( I would love to see a full excerpt of Xiao 's study ) .
As a Christian , I am also interested in learning about other Christians around the world ; this has been shaped by my heritage .
I grew up as an Evangelical Christian in Mexico .
In the begging o the 20th Century when the evangelical movement began in Mexico ; my grandparents , among others , suffered a similar type of repression under a society ruled by the Roma Catholic Church .
In many occasions my grand had to bunker down in their house because their fellow villagers wanted to lynch them while where worshiping in their " House Church . "
The reason ?
leaving Catholicism .
One difference is that in Mexico the government many occasions helped the evangelical church , by enforcing the constitutional right to freedom of religion , and the separation of church and state .
In others the Evangelicals were not so fortunate .
Lately there have been reports about how in the villages of southern Mexico , indigenous converts to evangelical Christianity are being killed by their tribes .
Yet this should not come as a surprise .
This has been the way the Gospel of Jesus Christ has spread from the beginning , and it will continue to be so ...
There is no doubt China is rising as a world power .
What is happening in to Christians China is similar to what happened to the Christians during Roman Empire in the 1st and 2nd century , this is !
why thi
s article extremely relevant today

Thank you PBS for this well done documentary on the issues facing Chinese Christians today .
Thank you Evan Osnos for the care you took in research and presentation .
Your thoughts on how Christianity is effecting the worldview of Chinese people in various strata of society is very interesting .
We 'd love to see a follow up documentary ... things are developing so quickly in China .
What will the situation look like in 2010 ? ( anonymous )
How refreshing to hear an unbiased report on the growth of Christianity and how it is impacting individuals , business and culture .

Enlightening and accurate !
I 've been in China for several weeks and have attended both registered and house churches .
I 've inquired of Chinese Christians with great interest , their perceptions of their " religious freedoms " .
Interestingly enough most believe they have religious " freedom " - depending on how you define it .
I believe your reporting captured the essence of Christianity in China , but it fell short by not mentioning the " rift " that has formed between the registered and unregistered house churches .
While there appears to be doctrinal unity , there is division in how each views as the appropriate church - state relationship .
The registered church feels more " persecuted " by the house churches than by the state because of the house churches ' criticism of their " duplicitous " loyalty to the state ; the house church on - the - other - hand , feels the registered church is perhaps even hindering the spreading of the Gospel by falling under the state umbrella .

I enjoyed much of the special story on Christianity in China .
I was distressed , however , that several items were factually incorrect .
As a Christian minister I have preached in several Chinese churches which are registered with the government .
Certainly their freedoms do not compare with ours , but neither are their services conducted as you stated , under strict rules from the government .
I have , in fact , never been told of a single rule I had to follow when I have preached in those churches .
I have also visited the national seminary in Nanjing and several regional seminaries , and have found pastors being trained by their respective educational institutions , not the government .
Change is occurring rapidly in China , so rapidly that even many Chinese Christians do not know what is going on .
There is much understandable mistrust and suspicion .
No one knows if these changes are for real or if they will last , but if we wish to encourage religious freedom in China , and if we wish to encourage human understanding between our people , we must fairly report what is going on .

I found this program very educational regarding China 's return to Christianity .
It seems that some are spinning it to show an economic benefit for embracing the ' western ' religion .
In fact , Christianity was embraced by the ' west ' at the same time it was embrace by China through middle Eastern monks from Mesopotamia .
Centuries before the west ' brought ' Christianity to China , China had churches and monasteries worshiping Christianity .
The patriach of the Chruch of the East was actually Chinese ( Mar Yobalaha ) .
I felt that the program neglected to mention the long history of Eastern Christianity in China .
This is important to make sure that it is not interpreted as a western influence .
Washington , DC
How can someone look to the now floundering Western economy and find that Christian values can be attributed to its success and not realize that the success of China 's economy and the East Asian Tigers are in fact due to Confucian values of hard work ?
This article fails to realize many aspects of Chinese culture and fails to address the perspectives of the everyday Chinese that live in China by following a stereotypical and outdated view of the Chinese bureaucratic system and merely focusing on a government vs. other ideology stance .
Tulsa , Oaklahoma
Jesus is irrelevant today .
There are far more important stories out there to report on : global warming , the coming U.S. confrontation with Iran , the ongoing tragedy in Iraq , the Palestinian / Israeli crisis , the global credit collapse , massive crop failures , growing world hunger , etc .
What does Jesus have to do with the real world problems we are facing today ?
How will Jesus help us ?
If he could 've done anything , he would have done it already .
What 's he waiting for ?

THEY ARE TRULY GOD'S DIVINE PLEASURE AS THEY LAID THEIR LIVES DOWN FOR THEIR LOVE FOR JESUS CHRIST .
WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR THEM AND MAY THE PRESENCES OF OUR GOD BE WITH THEM DAILY .

Thank you for this interesting report on Christian churches in China .
One of the comments here made a valid statement in that some of the pastors are not necessarily well - trained to become leaders of the church .
This IS one of the issues Chinese churches must resolve as it tries to free themselves from the rein of the Communist government .
However , I disagree with the comment that one must be professionally trained in order to become pastors / leaders of the church .
There are MANY great leaders in Christian history that are uneducated , including those contemporaries of Jesus Christ .
The fact that they are not well - educated does not disqualify them from being leaders of the church .
I also want to comment that one of the house churches you visited would be considered a cult by many Christians , especially by those who are either working closely with the missionary workers in China or by other Christian ministries whose aim is to reach out to the mainland Chinese .
Again , this is one of the typical issues that have been around places where the Christian faith is thriving and spreading .
Thank you again for your coverage on this topic .
I really enjoy watching it .

I was very pleased with this presentation .
It documented well the divide between Christian house churches and the official patriotic church in China .
It also indicated a recognition by many Chinese that trust of fellow citizens is needed .
This trust was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and devastated their culture .
I am involved with Chinese students ( attending a major U. S. University ) who are interested in finding out about Christianity for the first time .
They connect the prosperity of the West with the foundation of America on Judeo - Christian values .
But their hunger goes beyond economic desire for the prosperity they see in the U.S.
There is also a hunger for meaning and purpose in life which Christianity provides .

Another excellent piece from Frontline .
China is very much in a state of transformation and adaptation at the same time that its world influence is increasing .
Only time will tell us just what kind of China will impact the world in the coming years .
Thank you for keeping us abreast of China 's developments through timely , well - informed reports like this .

I agree with Morristown NJ that it was a wonderful piece but I was similarly puzzled that Jesus in China did not even mention Roman Catholicism .
Roman Catholicism and Protestanism are both denominations of the same religion of Christianity .
I would have expected the doumentary to at least refer to the history of the two parts of the Catholic Church in China , the government sanctioned and the underground churches .
The Vatican is currently making efforts to reconcile these two parts in China .

Still , I am deeply disturbed by the Westernization of the Chinese expression of Christ there .
When I watched " Jesus in China " I saw that the Greek Pagan Mind has made its way to China just as it made its way to America with its Pulpits , Constantinian Church Building , Pews , Pastors , ( some of these traditions and practices were added in America ) and even more terrible , its Caucasian image of Christ on the wall .
Western missionaries have always ( even if their intentions were pure ) brought their western practices and philosophies onto foreign soil and made " western - towns " like we have a " China Town " here in Boston .
How come we can't preach the gospel and let other cultures have their own expression of Christ in their own way ?
How come Christ has to look Greek / Western in every country we go to ?
Even here in America , it is extremely difficult to find an " American " expression of Christ .
It mostly looks like Greek Paganism with its Stained Glassed Church Buildings , Pulpits , Greek Orator - like Preaching , etc .
When Watchman Nee was alive the expression of Christ was Chinese , not Protestant , Catholic , or Western .
And although the Little Flock was destroyed through internal conflicts and the egos of men , their expression was the most beautiful in China .

The Chinese Christian churches are still a threat to peace and order in China .
The origins of the churches are clouded in history and unpleasant experiences with outsiders and barbarians .
The church brought missionaries and schools and hospitals in the best circumstances but it also came with the soldiers , the politicans and the overzealous who pushed people into paths that were interpreted not Chinese .
A slow new understanding must be reached with these expressions of personal faith and belief .
The government is trying to accomodate the new situation but does n't want anything to disturb the balance of state and religion -- whatever the form .
But the changes are coming and the country is changing .
This is a good indication of the willingness of the Communist state to allow religions to be practiced .
There is a fear of the zealot and the uncontrolled power of the various religions in forms they can't imagine .
Eventually , it comes back to social justice and the need of the government to help the poor through the economy , the health system and welfare system .
They will see that religions can work for them in these areas and that they should n't fear the spreading of religious freedoms .
Los Angeles , CA
There were some encouraging and discouraging things in this report .
It 's good to see Christians being more open to confess who they are , but at times it seemed to require a bit of bravery due to the current conditions .
There is definitely more work and pressure needed so that the gov't can actually become tolerant towards people of different religions .
One other thing that bothered me was how the government has attempted to fabricate it's own church , and how some seem to think that Christianity is a means to an end so that a country can be prosperous .
Whenever I see people attempting to change Christianity for a culture and ideology , I get a sick feeling .
Christians can be of different backgrounds , but must still hold to certain crucial beliefs .
Christianity has distinguished itself by its beliefs and creeds since antiquity .
If Christians do n't hold to a core of common beliefs , then what unites them ?
It seems that Christianity has slowly stopped being creedal in our times and become more of an experience .
My dismay for some of things reported does not mean I thought the reporting was bad .
On the contrary , it was very informative , and I would love to hear some follow up reporting .

I am glad that I help introduce Mr. Osnos some of the leaders he interviewed in this piece .
Well done .

I have been to China 5 times in the last few years .
Taking in Bibles and literature ...
You are right on and I am proud of the progress the Christians have made .

Good job , Evan !
I am a Chinese Christian and communist .
I like these reporters like Evan who explore the facts as much as he can and report without much political , national bias .
Like your video , Evan .
Chapel Hill , NC
This documentary was done with a wonderful mix of professional objective reporting while still allowing for matters of the heart and soul .
Evan was bold to raise some tough questions re : the interplay of morals / values and the emerging market economy in China !
My time in China was ' 97 -'02 .
I was moved to tears during several segments while watching the video online .
Thank you , Evan !!!

As a Christian living in China , I found this report fascinating as it confirmed what I have seen with my own eyes .
I have been to churches in several small towns and in big cities and they are overflowing .
At every service people have been worshiping from outside .
Back home in the UK congregations are dwindling but here in China the story is very different .
I have been open about my faith and have received nothing other than respect for my beliefs , even from those who did not agree .
It is a very exciting to watch the growth of Christianity and I pray that soon the persecution and suspicion will end .

As a fan of Frontline , I am disappointed in this documentary , " Jesus in China " .
I think your documentary fail to bring in the view of the Chinese people like me , whose view on this issue represents the large majority of people in China .
We are open to Christianity / religion , and we welcome Christianity / religion into the Chinese society .
However , we are concerned when the religious leaders are untrained and unqualified .
From what I saw in your movie , the so called underground church leaders are mostly farmers .
What gives them the qualification to lead a large group of people in their spiritual world ?
Being a religious zealot is not a qualifier to me .
Doctors , teachers , engineers , all professions are regulated by the government .
in any country , should n't religion be treated the same way ?
If the government - sponsored church practice is " untrue " to the real Christianity , what makes the practice of the underground church " true " to God ?
If you interview any " regular " people in Chinese society , you 'd find my view largely echoed .
It wold have made your documentary more complete .
Thank you .

Rochester Hills , MI
Excellent , Excellent program !!
Thank you PBS for showing this great story .
I will be watching your programming more often to see similar programs .
It is not a surprise to me to watch the great Chinese economic boom coincide directly with the great Christian conversions going on in that country .
If the USA wants to stay an economic powerhouse , we need to stop with the moral relativism and secularism and bring God and Jesus Christ back into our schools and our homes .
The further we push Christianity out of our lives , the more deprived we will become .
Remember , Europe was also the center of the world 's economy at one point but they too have far too often turned their backs to God.

I want to add my " thank you " to the long list of " thank yous " , for such an honest and personal story .
I also have read " The Heavenly Man " by Paul Hattaway , though I have never been to China .
It seems as if the primary time that Christianity makes national or world news , is either because of flagrant sin in the church , or true revival .
Another story of revival in America is " A Time To Be Born " , by Brain Vachon ( c)1972 , which documents the Jesus People Movement in California .
At the end of the story , the author gives his life to Christ .
Evan , again , excellent work .
I will be praying for you , that if you do n't know Jesus , that you will choose Him soon .

Although Christian belief is not new to China , I find the present context particularly interesting in light of what is taking place in Russia .
What atheistic communism could never offer to these two great nations is the power to change an individual coupled with truth in its teachings to the society at large .
This is a stunning contrast to the distintigration of the person that is taking place in Western society .
We seem to be receding quickly into the past .

I am once again amazed by what our awesome God is doing in the midst of a rapidly changing world .
His purpose will be served !
I have known for many years that there is an underground church in China ; but until now , very little has been known publicly .
It is still a secret in our media .
America and Great Britain sent missionaries to China for years , beginning in the 1800's .
Many were killed during WWII and others were forced to leave in the late 40's .
But there have been many stories of underground churches and groups smuggling bibles .
I agree with the comments of Anonymous who compared the statements of Zhao Xiao and deTocqueville about America 's strength coming the preaching in our churches .
The problem now is that our liberal anti-Christian media makes every effort to keep our preaching a secret and bashes Evangelicals at every opportunity .
Thank you PBS for doing this program .
I am emailing this story to all my Evangelical friends .
State College , PA
Thanks so very much for this important series .
These changing state of religious restriction / freedom in China - the worlds largest people group are very important to understand .
And it seems that reporting on such things often would be fitting as it changes so fast .
We no longer can live like we 're in a bubble here in the USA .
It 's important that people everywhere have basic freedoms like worship .
America is the largest buyer of goods from the largest producer of them - China .
We must insist on or at least strongly encourage basic human rights and unless we know what 's really going on today ( as your piece very well shows ) , we cannot intelligently defend those rights .
As a minister to Chinese scholars studying here , I have seen much of the hunger to know the truth of the existence of God which is not widely or freely shared in China .
One visiting Chinese professor I met with here ( at a coffee house ) , to discuss the Bible told me we would not be able to do that in his city in China .
But that was 2 years ago so perhaps he would n't feel as afraid now or in the near future as China relaxes those controls .

Thank you for the wonderful story " Jesus in China " .
We have been involved in a ministry with graduate students for the past 6 years .
Most of those we get to know are from mainland China .
Some are now coming to the US to study as Christians .
Others are seeking to know God .
We really appreciate your coverage .
It was excellent and gives us , who have never been to China , a picture of what is happening in this land of over a billion people .
Keep up the good work .
We hope to see and hear more about this topic .

Another great reference to this study would be a book called , " The Heavenly Man . "
It is a great insight on a mans walk with God along with the many struggles , miracles , and supernatural occurrences throughout his journey .
Thank you for this study .
It has piqued my interest .
China has always been a favorite country of mine .
I have always wanted to do missions .

Living here as a Chinese American , the problem with Fundamentalism and Evangelism is that those people seem to have less respect for those of different religion or have no religion at all , even those in your own family .
Many people in China and in Asia in general are Buddhists because Evangelism and Fundamentalism is in conflict with their family , moral and cultural values as someone say " One more Christian , one fewer Chinese . "
TSPM believes that you can keep Chinese values while keeping your Christian faith .
When one of the priest says that only God can save the communist government , it scares the heck out of me because he does n't believe in secular societies .

Fontana , CA
I read mostly good and as with several , know folks in the video .
Roman Catholicism has a long hx with the Chinese , but is monolithic and the report is about the current revival , not the church of Rome .
And , why should n't the gay / lesbian and etc. lifestyle not be condoned ?
This is a discussion about Christians , and their Bible is the guide .
Ephesians 5 says that such should not even be mentioned .
God loves all peoples , even rebellious , so think about my comments based on that rule !
That 's why Jesus went to a cross 2000 years ago .
And ,
He 's coming back as the Judge , that seems to be anytime soon .

Following the Pew Report , which tells us that 98 % of the American public believe in God , although this is a god of their own making devoid of all historical and / or Biblical foundation the freshness of the commitment to Jesus Christ among Chinese Christians is indeed wonderful .
I am reminded over and over again that soon and very soon , white , anglo / saxon residents of the United States will no longer be the dominant voice in the world - wide body of Christ .
At this point I think that 's something to be greatly celebrated .
Perry , UT
I was really happy to see this Frontline coverage of the fervent , joyous faith of Chinese believers under threat of persecution and torture -- what an encouragement for all of us .
These people know how to depend upon God for their daily existence .
They know how to pray and praise Jesus .
I wish I could be in their number even for one service !
Frances Ren
Phoenix , AZ
I am so moved by the video !
God is doing great works in China !
After being persecuted for so many years , Chinese Christians have been purified to be like gold .
They are bolder than before to claim their constiitutional rights , since more and more intellectuals , businessmen , artists , even politicians have accepted the Lord .
Will keep praying for our brothers and sisters there !
I also pray that I can go back more often to join the " Christian wave " !

Mr. Osnos and his colleagues have done a fascinating piece of reporting , but I hope that eventually he can pay the same close attention to the other sects and religions in China -- Catholicism , Buddhism , Daoism , Islam and the host of others practiced by minorities .
We all know about the issues which Islam and Tibetan Buddhism have with the Chinese government , but these tensions have not only obtained with the Communist Party .
The tradition of interference in religious matters by the powers that be in China -- and vice versa -- goes back thousands of years .
I would be particularly interested in the situation of Daoism , whose once - great influence in local civic affairs surely has not been forgotten by the current government .
Seattle , WA
In old times , most Chinese believe in Buddha , Ghosts and Wise Men .
Then the Communist party took over , and there was the Cultural Revolution , which virtually vacuumed China 's religious space .
And now , she is ready more than ever to house Christianity on a scale that you could have never imagined before !
Does that not make you to want to praise the Lord !
God Bless all !

It seems as if the Christian values of freedom & morality & the " do unto others " rule are entering Chinese society and business community ( which the US was founded on ) at the same time as they are being ignored and denied by many in the USA today .

Hopefully the Chinese Christian can understand and practice " the separation of the State and the church " .
There are numerous examples that local religous leaders trying to uproot the governments thought the Chinese history .

Becky Blitch
Largo , Florida
Thank you for this insightful reporting !
Despite trying to stay current on issues regarding the changes happening in China , this is the first time I 've seen any attempt to take a comprehensive look at the role of Christianity in particular in the " new " China .
Mr. Osnos reports that , in China , declaring oneself to be Christian ( or a person of faith in general ) is an incredibly personal , intentional act .
That 's not surprising , given that the overwhelming number of Chinese Christians do n't have a family history in the church , as is so common in the West , and the state 's history of controlling religion & persecuting " free thinking . "
A couple things strike me here : one is that this closely mirrors the early Church , as well as the early times of the church in many new areas , notably the recent rise of Protestant house churches in Latin America .
This ties into my second thought , which is that this could foreshadow a rise of identity politics in China that has as much potential to shake things up as the economic boom .
Christianity , from the outset and even as an evangelical faith , has been about insiders vs. outsiders .
When professing faith means risking your well - being , it becomes an act of radical defiance .
This does n't have to threaten the state ( indeed , driving faith groups underground is n't , history tells us , effective in the long run ) .
But it 's a clear indicator that China is moving in a direction of individualism and personal freedom that will reverberate for centuries .
I hope Mr. Osnos is thinking about expanding his reporting on the many aspects of this issue into a book .
I suspect that this piece was only the tip of an iceberg ( although definitely a needed one ! ) .
Christianity in China is clearly a complex , interdisciplinary issue , and an important one that the world needs to be aware of .
Thank you , PBS and Frontline , for once again looking at the critical but unexamined issues of our times !
( anonymous )
I am extremely impressed by Zhao Xiao 's analysis of the reason for America 's economic prosperity .
I believe it mirrors deTocqueville 's own analysis of America 's greatness after the Revolutionary War .
DeTocqueville attributed it to what was being preached in America 's churches -- reliance upon the grace of Almighty God .
Now today , Zhao Xiao attributes America 's economic prosperity ( blessings ) upon its moral foundations -- which he attributes to the Puritans , to ' let the entire world see the glory of Jesus Christ , whom they believed in . '
Alas , the moral foundations of our country are crumbling as Americans choose to remove any mention of God from the marketplace of ideas ; from the discussion in open society .
Perhaps Zhao's insight into the relationship of our moral foundation to our economic prosperity is an accurate one , and helps to explain why our nation is rapidly losing its economic power in this rapidly changing world .

How exciting to see a documentary on the Chinese Christians .
I 've read throughout the years of persecution and imprisonment that occurred for those who followed Christianity .
This program plus the program about youths in China , with the businessman who seeks Christ through his business has renewed my faith in public television .
Thank you Mr. Osnos and to the Chicago Tribune !
God Bless You !

As a Christian who has traveled to China to smuggle bibles to the underground churches , I was amazed at how open things have become since my visit almost 2 years ago .
What an amazing " God thing " that is happening there .
All your videos and articles were right on the money with what I observed and learned firsthand from the underground church members .
China is in the midst of a great spiritual awakening .
Thank you for reporting it and doing such an objective job .
I was a little hesitant to watch the videos and read the articles as I thought they would show a secular bias in the reporting , but they were done in an excellent manner .
More reports of this caliber are needed in the media today .
Kudos and keep up the great work !

I grew up in China in the 70s and 80s .
My grandparents practiced Christianity before they passed away .
One of my aunts on my father 's side is a founder of one of the numerous house churches that sprung up in China since the 90s .
The first time I learned about Jesus Christ was from my grandma when I was about 10 years old .
I still remember the look of the bible she used .
Since I came to the U.S. , I explored Christianity , but finally concluded that organized religions , in general , tend to impose their values upon the society at large .
This is especially true when it comes to issues such as abortion , equality for people with alternative sexual orientations , as well as priesthood for women .
While the Frontline reporter asked the underground church organizers many questions , he did not explore the issues mentioned above .
Giving Christians in China the freedom to worship is undoubtedly a good thing , but will China 's Christians , upon gaining their freedom someday in the future , oppose the equality for women , gays and lesbians ?

The powerful impact that Christ has had on the Chinese populace is what is supposed to be normal Christianity .
I would love to see people 's faith affect them this much in North America .
It would change our culture for the better .
Our hearts need to be gripped and our lives changed as theirs have been .
Thanks for the wonderful broadcast !

I thank first and foremost The Lord Jesus Christ for making the Gospel reach out unto the uttermost parts of the world .
And also the men and women who died in the first century by living through their faith in Jesus .
For more than fifteen hundred years , God 's New Covenant has been attacked , slaughtered and disgraced by Pagan traditions and Politics .
I as a believer in the Establishment of God , I support the House Church / Underground Church Movements in China .
I also stand with the House Church and Organic Church Movement here in Canada , the United States and the Rest of the World .
" I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith . " ( Romans 1:16 and 17 ) .

I was plesantly surprised that you reported the findings that connected ecomomic success with Christian values .
That is the kind of unbiased reporting that will keep you far ahead of your peers .
Morristown , NJ
While the report was well done and interesting , as usual , I was dismayed that there was not even a mention of the Catholic Church in China .
There is a long history of Catholic Christianity in China and to air a segment on " Jesus in China " without any reference whatsoever to Catholicism does a grave disservice to the topic .
Dustin Wieske
Ancaster , Ontario
Upon watching this , I was amazed at the perseverance of the Christians in China .
This appeared to be a non-biased representation of the suffering that Chinese Christians are undergoing .
I am a Christian and find this very strengthening to see the spread of the gospel in the face of heavy opposition .
I pray that the pastors of the underground churches continue in their ways and proclaim the gospel to every corner of China .
May they stand firm in their beliefs and not conform to the communist view of Christianity .
Hopefully the government will ease up and allow these churches to exercise the religious freedom they should have .
Minneapolis , MN
I have been to China four times recently .
I have meet registered and underground church leaders and Christian .
Your story was " right on . "
Well done .

July 29th , 2008 Tags : c , programming , psyco , python Security : Subject : N - Queens problem Time : 06:38 pm
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EightQueensInManyProgrammingLanguages
This is the shorter solver written in C that I have composed ( from the original C code of that page ) , it 's 195 bytes long :
typedef unsigned u;u s(u L,u C, u R, u N ) {u b;if(~C ) for(u S=L|C|R;~0U!=S;b=~S&( S+1 ) , S|=b , N=s(( L|b ) <<1 , C|b , ( R|b ) >> 1,N ) ) ; else N++; return N ; }main ( int n , char ** v ) {printf ( " %u " , s ( 0,~0U >> atoi( v [ 1 ] ) , 0,0 ) ) ; }
It accepts the board size in input , and outputs the number of queens .
Using GCC you can compile it with this ( ignoring the warnings ) :
gcc - O3 -s - std=c99 - fprofile - generate nq.c -o nq
Followed by a run with n for example 16 , followed by :
gcc - O3 -s - std=c99 - fprofile-use nq.c -o nq
Beside being very short it 's pretty fast too .
You have to work a lot to write a faster solver .
For example , with N=16 finds the correct result 14_772_512 in 17.85 seconds on a 2 GHz Dual Core CPU , using 1 core , 32 bit compiled .
The program as is works up to N=18 , finding the 666_090_624 solutions .
The result for N=19 requires more than 32 bits to be represented , so you have to replace the 0U with 0UL , atoi ( ) with atol ( ) , the u with typedef unsigned long logn ( and maybe a litte more , it may need around 2 hours of time to compute the result with N=19 because each times N grows by one , it requires about 8.1 times more time to run , so I have n't tested it much for sych inputs ) , this makes the code a little longer .
The same algorithm for the Python Psyco runs about 100 times slower ( but it 's fast still for being a Python program ) , but you need to add a & 0xFFFFFFFF to reduce the precision of the numbers ( note that on 32 - bit Python version 2.x the value 0xFFFFFFFF is a long ) :
import psyco , sys def search ( lb , cb , rb , cnt ) : if cb == 0xFFFFFFFF : cnt += 1 else : bs = lb | cb | rb while bs !=
0xFFFFFFFF : b = ~bs & ( bs + 1 ) bs |= b cnt = search ( ( ( lb | b ) << 1 ) & 0xFFFFFFFF , cb | b , ( rb | b ) >> 1 , cnt ) return cnt psyco.full ( ) print search ( 0 , 0xFFFFFFFF >> int( sys.argv[ 1 ] ) , 0 , 0 ) The faster C program I have found ( This page shows various algorithms to solve the N - Queens problem :

On August 6th , in 1945 , the world saw the first use of atomic weapons against human targets .
On this day 63 years ago , humanity lost its nuclear virginity .
Until the end of time we will be a species that has used fission bombs in anger .
Time has passed , and we still have n't blown up our world , despite a close call or two .
Which makes it difficult to criticize the decision - would things still have turned out all right , if anyone had chosen differently , anywhere along the way ?
Maybe we needed to see the ruins , of the city and the people .
Maybe we did n't .
There 's an ongoing debate - and no , it is not a settled issue - over whether the Japanese would have surrendered without the Bomb .
But I would not have dropped the Bomb even to save the lives of American soldiers , because I would have wanted to preserve that world where atomic weapons had never been used - to not cross that line .
I do n't know about history to this point ; but the world would be safer now , I think , today , if no one had ever used atomic weapons in war , and the idea was not considered suitable for polite discussion .
I 'm not saying it was wrong .
I do n't know for certain that it was wrong .
I would n't have thought that humanity could make it this far without using atomic weapons again .
All I can say is that if it had been me , I would n't have done it .
Law enforcement experts and housing researchers argue that rising crime rates follow Section 8 recipients to their new homes , while other experts discount any direct link .
But there is little doubt that cultural shock waves have followed the migration .
Social and racial tensions between newcomers and their neighbors have increased , forcing suburban communities like Antioch to re-evaluate their civic identities along with their methods of dealing with the new residents .
The foreclosure crisis gnawing away at overbuilt suburbs has accelerated that migration , and the problems .
Antioch is one of many suburbs in the midst of a full - blown mortgage meltdown that has seen property owners seeking out low - income renters to fill vacant homes .
The most recent Contra Costa County records available show that from 2003 to 2005 , the number of Section 8 households in Antioch grew by 50 percent , to about 1,500 from 1,000 .
Many new residents are African - American ; Antioch ’s black population has grown to about 20 percent , from 3 percent in 1990 .
Federally assisted tenants in Antioch brought a class action lawsuit against the police department last month , claiming racial discrimination , intimidation and illegal property searches .
The lawsuit , which was filed in the Northern District of California , claims that the police routinely questioned Section 8 residents about their housing status and wrote letters to the county ’s housing authority recommending termination of subsidies .
They say the police also threatened Section 8 landlords for infractions by tenants .
A December 2007 study of Antioch police records by Public Advocates , a law firm in San Francisco , counted 67 investigations of black households , compared with 59 of white families ; black households , it found , are four times as likely to be searched based on noncriminal complaints and to be contacted by the police in the first place .
Chief James
Hyde of the Antioch Police Department denied that his officers routinely asked whether tenants were Section 8 recipients and said that the police department did not have information about which homes were on federal assistance .
But Chief
Hyde also said that the local housing authority was not meeting its obligation to screen tenants properly , and that as his department focused on nuisance issues , the police had become a de facto enforcement arm of the federal government .

“ Other cities have come asking us for guidance , ” Chief Hyde said .
The Section 8 program is designed to encourage low - income tenants to settle in middle - income areas by subsidizing 60 percent of their rent .
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development issued 50,000 more vouchers for suburban relocations in 2007 than in 2005 , bringing the total number of renter families to 2.1 million .
The government has targets for more physics teachers by 2014 Almost one in four secondary schools in England no longer has any specialist physics teachers , a survey suggests .
The report into the supply of physics teachers , published by academics at the University of Buckingham , warns of a threat to the subject 's future .
The government has set targets to promote the number of physics teachers in secondary schools .
But the report 's authors warn that half of the schools in inner London do not have specialist physics teachers .
The report , by Professor Alan Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of the Centre for Education and Employment Research , says that 26 % more physics teachers are leaving or retiring than are being recruited .
Lost subject From September , pupils who do sufficiently well in tests for 14 - year - olds will have an entitlement to be taught physics .
But this report highlights concerns that this will have to be provided by non-specialist staff .
The survey shows substantial differences in the availability of physics teachers - both regional differences and by the type of school .
And it raises concerns about the viability of physics as a separate subject .
In inner London , there is a tendency to have general science teachers rather than specialist physics teachers - and 50 % of secondary schools do not have any physics teachers .
In contrast , in the Yorkshire and Humberside region , only about 10 % of schools do not have any specialist physics teachers .
Where schools have sixth forms , they are much more likely to have specialist physics teachers .
However in schools without sixth forms , about two in five schools do not have any specialist physics teachers .
Instead they will have teachers from other disciplines who will take combined science classes .
The research also shows that physics teachers are more likely to be concentrated in particular types of school , such as those which are high - performing , grammar , all - girl and faith schools .
The report 's authors argue that physics has been pushed into decline by a drive for general science courses .
They call for the subject to be supported in a way that protects its separate identity .
" One admissions tutor said : ' Until recently we have barely admitted that physics existed as a school subject - physics , chemistry and biology have not been allowed to be mentioned in official documentation ' , " says the report .
Recruitment
The government wants to promote science subjects such as physics and chemistry and has a target that 25 % of science teachers in England will have a physics specialism by 2014 .
A spokesperson for the Training and Development Agency for Schools said : " We have helped secure a significant increase in the recruitment of physic teachers , up by almost a third last year and the previous year .
The number of science teachers overall hit 3,000 for the first time ever last year .
" We are investing £ 7 m in enhancement courses for teachers with related degrees to become physics teachers .
This produces up to 150 new physics teachers a year .
" Both the Institute of Physics and Ofsted confirm that these courses are succeeding in producing good physics teachers . "
A spokesman for England 's Department for Children , Schools and Families said it was investing £ 140 m over the next three years to enhance recruitment and retention of physics and chemistry specialists and to help boost the number of young people studying science subjects post - 16 .
" The number of pupils taking individual physics , chemistry , and biology GCSE is rising and by September 2008 , all pupils achieving at least level 6 at Key Stage 3 will be entitled to study triple science GCSE , " he said .
Primary school teaching
Other efforts included after - school science clubs and 18,000 " science ambassadors " - people with industry experience in science and engineering who would enthuse young scientists .
Meanwhile Scotland 's science centres are to get an extra £ 250,000 this year in an effort to improve primary school teachers ' delivery of science subjects .
Last month the annual Scottish survey of achievement in science showed that too few pupils were achieving the expected levels in science .
Scotland 's education and lifelong learning secretary , Fiona Hyslop , said : " Scotland 's economic future is increasingly dependent on science , engineering and technology . "
She added : " Our children must be inspired by the world of science and , in order for that to happen , they need the best teaching available . "

And despite what you might hear on the news , drones are n’t replacing couriers just yet .
Put simply , there is no robot that could replicate the monumental service and work that couriers around the UK currently undertake .
Every single one of these men and women drivers who work as a courier , need to take out specialist courier insurance .

Once upon a time lived a young woman from a St. Louis suburb .
She was an honor roll student , she played the violin , she donated blood and volunteered for American Heart Association walks .
She elected to put off college for a while and joined the Army once out of school .
At Fort Campbell , KY , she was assigned as a weapons supply manager to the 129th Corps Support Battalion .
She was LaVena Johnson , private first class , and she died near Balad , Iraq , on July 19 , 2005 , just eight days shy of her twentieth birthday .
She was the first woman soldier from Missouri to die while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The tragedy of her story begins there .
An Army representative initially told LaVena 's father , Dr. John Johnson , that his daughter died of " died of self - inflicted , noncombat injuries , " but initially added that it was not a suicide .
The subsequent Army investigation reversed this finding and declared LaVena 's death a suicide , a finding refuted by the soldier 's family .
In an article in the St. Louis Post - Dispatch , Dr. Johnson pointed to indications that his daughter had endured a physical struggle before she died - two loose front teeth , a " busted lip " that had to be reconstructed by the funeral home - suggesting that " someone might have punched her in the mouth . "
A promise by the office of Representative William Lacy Clay to look into the matter produced nothing .
The military said that the matter was closed .
Little more on LaVena 's death was said until St. Louis CBS affiliate KMOV aired a story last night which disclosed troubling details not previously made public - details which belie the Army 's assertion that the young Florissant native died by her own hand .
The video of the report is available on the KMOV website .
Reporter Matt Sczesny spoke with LaVena 's father and examined documents and photos sent by Army investigators .
So far from supporting the claim that LaVena died from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , the documents provided elements of another scenario altogether :
Indications of physical abuse that went unremarked by the autopsy
The absence of psychological indicators of suicidal thoughts ; indeed , testimony that LaVena was happy and healthy prior to her death
Indications , via residue tests , that LaVena may not even have handled the weapon that killed her
A blood trail outside the tent where Lavena 's body was found
Indications that someone attenpted to set LaVena 's body on fire
The Army has resisted calls by Dr. Johnson and by KMOV to reopen its investigation .
We have seen in other military deaths , most infamously that of Army Ranger and former professional football player Cpl.
Pat Tillman , that the Army has engaged in an insulting game of deny and delay when it comes to uncovering embarrassing facts .
Only when public and official attention is brought to bear on the matter - as happened , eventually and with great effort , with the case of Cpl. Tillman - do unpleasant truths come to light .
Astonishing as it seems , it takes that level of outrage to compel the Army to find the truth and tell it , to honor its own soldiers .
No such groundswell has yet emerged in the case of LaVena ; not enough voices have demanded that someone in the military , anyone , speak for her .
At first glance , the contrast between the cases of Pat Tillman and LaVena Johnson seems vast , but at the core the situations are the same .
In each case , the death of a young soldier in a dangerous place and time was not explained to the families they left behind , the families that gave them up so that they could serve us .
An honest accounting of their passing is all the dead ask of us .
The mother of Pat Tillman put the matter in stark and honest terms :
" This is how they treat a family of a high - profile individual , " she said .
" How are they treating others ? "
In the case of Private First Class Johnson , we know the answer .
This color image is a three dimensional view of a digital elevation map of a sample collected by NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander 's Atomic Force Microscope .
A Martian particle -- only one micrometer , or one millionth of a meter , across -- is held in the left pit .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech / University of Arizona / University of Neuchatel / Imperial College London
( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander has taken the first - ever image of a single particle of Mars ' ubiquitous dust , using its atomic force microscope .
The particle -- shown at higher magnification than anything ever seen from another world -- is a rounded particle about one micrometer , or one millionth of a meter , across .
It is a speck of the dust that cloaks Mars .
Such dust particles color the Martian sky pink , feed storms that regularly envelop the planet and produce Mars ' distinctive red soil .
" This is the first picture of a clay - sized particle on Mars , and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the Red Planet , " said Phoenix co-investigator Urs Staufer of the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland , who leads a Swiss consortium that made the microscope .
" Taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off Earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the Martian dust , " said Tom Pike , Phoenix science team member from Imperial College London .
" We always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small . "
It took a very long time , roughly a dozen years , to develop the device that is operating in a polar region on a planet now about 350 million kilometers or 220 million miles away .
The atomic force microscope maps the shape of particles in three dimensions by scanning them with a sharp tip at the end of a spring .
During the scan , invisibly fine particles are held by a series of pits etched into a substrate microfabricated from a silicon wafer .
Pike 's group at Imperial College produced these silicon microdiscs .
The atomic force microscope can detail the shapes of particles as small as about 100 nanometers , about one one - thousandth the width of a human hair .
That is about 100 times greater magnification than seen with Phoenix 's optical microscope , which made its first images of Martian soil about two months ago .
Until now , Phoenix 's optical microscope held the record for producing the most highly magnified images to come from another planet .
" I 'm delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand Mars at the highest detail ever , " Staufer said .
" This is proof of the microscope 's potential .
We are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other Phoenix lander instruments . "
" After this first success , we 're now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on Mars , " Pike added .
Mars ' ultra - fine dust is the medium that actively links gases in the Martian atmosphere to processes in Martian soil , so it is critically important to understanding Mars ' environment , the researchers said .
The particle seen in the atomic force microscope image was part of a sample scooped by the robotic arm from the " Snow White " trench and delivered to Phoenix 's microscope station in early July .
The microscope station includes the optical microscope , the atomic force microscope and the sample delivery wheel .
It is part of a suite of tools called Phoenix 's Microscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer .

Landon Brown Throws Whitney Houston Under the Bus ( Photos )
Like father like son .
Singer Bobby Brown 's son Landon Brown does n't have much good to say about his former stepmother Whitney Houston and her parenting skills .
Landon even went as far as to say she was a nightmare .
Hey , what about your daddy ?
Bobby did n't seem to be the biggest prize himself .
Because no one else would listen or for that matter believe him , Landon told the National Enquirer that Whitney made him sleep in the guest house .
Oh , the horror !
Also he was not allowed to spend any quality time with his lil sister Bobby Kristina .
Whitney and I never really got along .
She did n't necessarily hate me , but she would n't really speak to me either .
In Whitney 's eyes , I was the stepchild . "
She decided to turn me into one of her security personnel .
I was a teenager but I was walking around dressed up in all black with a Security shirt and she 's have me work for her .
I was just another one of her staff . "
So we 're expected to believe that Whitney thought so little of her safety that she had a child dressed in a security outfit watching her every move .
She might as well have hiredtoo .
It sounds more like an excuse for the kid to be cool and hang with the big guys since his daddy probably was n't around much .

What a picture .
When the weather turned violent and stormy on Tuesday evening , Lori Mehmen , who lives in the small farming town of Orchard in northeastern Iowa , looked out her front door and saw a funnel cloud bearing down — and evidently had the presence of mind to grab her digital camera and capture this shot before taking cover .
The local paper , The Mitchell County Press - News , posted the photo on Wednesday and The Associated Press picked it up today .
The Press - News report says no one was injured by this tornado , which was one of scores reported in Iowa and across the Midwest this week , where storms and heavy rains have also produced widespread flooding .
Ms. Mehmen told the paper that her funnel cloud came close to the ground only briefly , then retreated back up into the clouds .
Still , the high winds from the storm knocked down trees , damaged crops , and left behind one indelible image .
Ah , Fox News .
Are we surprised when the session ends with an FNC personality insulting everyone else in the room , and inciting a brief , but spirited shouting match ?
Oddly , no .
But then , every FNC session comes with the promise of contention , given FNC 's not - so - implicit assertion that the rest of the media is , by contrast , unfair and unbalanced .
But actually , FNC makes its biases extremely clear , particularly when it comes to its institutional distaste for Democratic nominee - designate Barack Obama .
( see also : ' terrorist fist jab , ' open yearning for his assassination , and etc. )
And while it 's fine for a news channel to have a bias , it 's just a trifle grating to be accused of wielding a bias when FNC is actually the most spirited wielder of that same bias .
Last time around ( in ' 06 , if memory serves ) news chief Roger Ailes was as in - your - face as expected .
This time they show a more moderate face , a four - man panel with Chris Wallace , Karl Rove , Howard Wolfson and John Moody .
Rove , of course , was Pres .
Bush 's top political adviser , while Wolfson was a senior aide to Hillary Clinton and a self - described progressive .
Wallace comes off on FNC as a voice of reason , e.g. the time he publicly scolded the hosts of " Fox & Friends " of engaging in two straight hours of " Obama bashing . "
Wolfson , who calls himself a life - long progressive , says his very presence is a testament to FNC 's fairness and balancedness , and so on .
Wallace asked about scolding the " Fox and Friends " anchors for what they said about Obama , andnow the caricatures : " I think the fact that I felt free to go on Fox & Friends , and say what was on my mind , that there had been two hours of Obama bashing , and I 'm still here today means that we are fair and balanced .
I really do n't think an MSNBC reporter could go on Olbermann 's show and tell him to knock it off , and be here to talk to you guys .. . . had n't heard about the caricatures ... " my own feeling is that a news organization should run real photographs . "
Moody , though , says " F&F " is edgy , humorous , not strictly news - oriented .
Someone asks Rove if he believes Obama is a Muslim , a Jihadist , or un-American .
Rove : " No . "
What 's more , he continues , it 's bad for America and the process to even have this as part of the conversation .
" I do n't believe he 's anti-American .
I do believe he 's got a liberal perspective that I do n't share .
And that a lot of Americans do n't share . "
Oh , but then things begin to get sideways when a questioner asks
Rove a prickly question about why he 's talking to a room full of tv critics when , maybe , he ought to be testifying under oath to the Congress , as per their repeated supboenas .
Rove bats this away with a well - rehearsed riff on the longstanding disagreement between the Congress and the White House regarding executive privilege .
And the gang accepts it , more or less , and that 's that .
Until Wallace re-opens the issue a few minutes later .
And this is where things get very Foxian , and more than a little grating .
I 'm going to paraphrase here , because it all happens quickly as the session is wrapping up .
Wallace , raising his hand as another panelist finished answering an unrelated question , asserts that he thinks it 's telling that reporters would grill Rove on his ducking the Congress 's subpoena .
Because , he continues , Rove is a Republican and the U.S. Congress is currently controlled by Democrats .
Surely , he continues , if the tables where turned and James Carville were on the panel despite the efforts of a Republican Congress , we would NEVER ask him the same question .
Let alone grill him so severely .
Cue the bellowing from the back of the room .
Yes we bloody well WOULD ask him that , being its basic gist .
Wallace shrugs .
Oh , really , he says .
Huh .
Okay , fine .
And that 's that .
But that 's not really that .
Because that kind of hypothetical accusation is a familiar FNC tactic , and it seems like the very opposite of fair and balanced .
Because it 's formless and free of substance .
And yet , it 's also impossible to argue against , because a hypothetical obviously comes with no attendant facts .
It 's the press conference equivalent of a terrorist fist jab .
And it does n't make FNC look like a serious news organization .
Let alone fair and balanced .
A German court has ruled that Internet users operating a WiFi router are not responsible if others use their equipment to infringe copyright on P2P networks .
The news is likely to be seen as yet another blow for lawyers Davenport Lyons who have been insisting that German law decisions would be mirrored in the UK .
All around Europe there are instances of individuals receiving demands for compensation due to the fact that their open WiFi routers have been used by others to infringe copyright .
Now , a new judgment has come from the Frankfurt court of appeal .
The judges have decided that the owner of an Internet connection is not responsible for copyright infringements carried out without their knowledge on their open WiFi .
The same court already ruled that parents are not responsible for copyright infringements carried out by their children .
Lawyers representing copyright holders have long insisted that it is the responsibility of the bill payer to ensure that nothing illegal happens on his connection by taking technical measures to stop unauthorized access by a 3rd party .
The plaintiff in this case stated that the IP address of the defendant was tracked making unauthorized uploads of copyright works and demanded damages .
The defendant had insisted that not only was he innocent but also away on vacation at the time of the alleged offense .
Regular readers of TorrentFreak will know that lawyers Davenport Lyons in the UK have been sending out many letters which accuse people of copyright infringement when , through ignorance or simple generosity , have simply left their WiFi open for others to use .
Davenport state that a previous German court decision has ruled that users are responsible for the infringing actions of others on their Internet connection , and in their opinion UK courts would rule the same .
This is the ruling that the Frankfurt court has just over - ruled .
Given this decision , further recipients of Davenport letters should expect to see these comments about open - WiFi liability removed , at least until the highest court in Germany has had the opportunity to review the situation .
Describing the decision in Frankfurt as “ sensational ” , Christian Solmecke , a lawyer currently defending around 500 file - sharers told TorrentFreak :
“ The future will show us what the highest court in Germany – the Bundesgerichtshof – says to this difficult question . ”

It ’s been about two weeks since the Justice Department ’s inspector general released a report on the unprecedented politicization of employment practices at the Justice Department .
The IG report concluded that disgraced officials such as Monica Goodling and former chief of staff D. Kyle Sampson “ routinely broke the law ” by applying political litmus tests , even when hiring prosecutors and immigration judges .
Since then , no one in the Bush administration has wanted to talk about the scandal .
The good news is , Attorney General Michael Mukasey addressed the subject this morning in a speech to the American Bar Association .
The bad news is , what he had to say was far from encouraging .
Initially , it seemed like Mukasey was , at long last , prepared to be candid and forthcoming .
The problem came when the nation ’s chief law - enforcement officer addressed what he was prepared to do as a consequence of the DoJ ’s rampant lawbreaking .
Mukasey said he will not prosecute the DoJ employees who repeatedly and flagrantly violated the law .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey said Tuesday that the Department of Justice would not pursue criminal charges against former employees implicated in an internal investigation on politicized hiring practices .
“ Where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing , we vigorously investigate it , ” Mukasey said in a speech at the American Bar Association .
“ And where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime , we vigorously prosecute .
But not every wrong , or even every violation of the law , is a crime . ”
Wait , not every violation of the law is a crime ?
Is n’t that the definition of a “ crime ” ?
WASHINGTON - Former US Ambassador to the United Nations , John Bolton , said on Tuesday that he believes Israel will stage a raid against Iran 's nuclear facilities if Democratic nominee Senator Barack Obama wins the upcoming presidential elections .
Bolton said the IAF would likely strike in the interim term between election day ( November 4th ) and the inauguration ( January 20th 2009 ) – while George W. Bush is still in office .
" I think if they are to do anything , the most likely period is after our elections and before the inauguration of the next President , " Bolton said in an interview with FOX News .
" I do n’t think they will do anything before our election because they do n’t want to affect it .
And they ’d have to make a judgment whether to go during the remainder of President Bush ’s term in office or wait for his successor . "
In a related interview with the British ' Daily Telegraph , ' Bolton said he believed the Arab world would be " pleased " by an Israeli strike .
Their reaction , he told the paper " will be positive privately .
I think there 'll be public denunciations but no action . "
Bolton believes that Israel may consider postponing the attack if Senator John McCain emerges as the victor in the race , and said apprehension of Obama 's foreign policy in Jerusalem would likely be the
motivating factor behind an early strike .
The former ambassador , often labeled a resolute neo-conservative , said he found McCain 's stance on Iran far more realistic than that of the Bush administration .
Bolton said he doubted Iran would respond immediately with a counterstrike of its own , partially because Tehran would fear an American reprisal .

Britain faces a home - grown food crisis unless the Government steps in to protect the UK's threatened honey bees , beekeepers said yesterday .
They warned that honey bees - which are critical for pollinating crops as well as producing honey - are under threat from a mysterious disease which is spreading across the world .
Numbers of UK honey bees have been falling for years because of parasites and diseases .
But bee experts fear numbers could be devastated if Britain is hit by Colony Collapse Disorder - a condition which has wiped out bee colonies in America and has reached France and Germany .
Scroll down for more ...
Sting operation : A crack team of beekeepers will be introduced
Hives and colonies hit by the condition abruptly lose all their worker bees .
Scientists have yet to explain the disorder , although some experts have blamed disease , pollution , pesticides and even GM crops .
The British Beekeepers ' Association ( BBKA ) said new research was essential to ward off the threat .
Earlier this month , ministers revealed plans to protect honey bees in England and Wales .
However , the BBKA yesterday told MPs that there were " substantial shortcomings and omissions " in the 10 year strategy .
It wants the Government to spend £ 8 million on bee health research over the next five years .
BBKA president Tim Lovett said : " Does the Government want the nation to go without honey on their toast , not have home - grown strawberries to go with cream , and even put their own crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables at risk ?
" Food production is now an important issue and bees are central to it .
" We note that the US government immediately invested 80 million dollars ( £ 40 m ) into research on the condition known as Colony Collapse Disorder , which has devastated their bee colonies , affecting pollination of the apple orchards , the almond and orange crops .
" CCD has not yet crossed the Channel from Europe , but we are urging the Government that it needs to be prepared should this happen .
The central plank in that preparation is a better understanding of diseases and that needs research .
" Immediate action needs to be taken to avoid this economic and ecological disaster in the making . "
The BBKA says pollination by honey bees contributes £ 165 million a year to the agricultural economy .
Honey bees play a crucial role in the production of home grown foods on farms , allotments and gardens .
There are between 200-300 commercial beekeepers in the UK and around 44,000 who keep bees purely as a hobby .
In recent years , numbers have been hit by the varroa mite , a pest which has spread to Britain from Asia .
The mites feed on bees and make them more vulnerable to disease .
Lord Rooker , minister for sustainable farming and animal health , said : " There are a number of threats to bee health .
" We need to ensure that these can be tackled effectively and that requires a joint approach between Government and other stakeholders , most importantly individual beekeepers . "
He added : " Some losses over winter are not unusual , particularly given the weather we 've been experiencing last summer and this spring , as well as ongoing problems with varroa .
Large scale inexplicable losses are being investigated , and bee inspectors will continue to investigate any others reported . "
He said evidence seen by bee inspectors did not suggest the UK was facing the problems reported in America .

FactCheck : Pay discrimination still subject to time limits
The Facts : The legislation McCain was referring to was the Lilly Ledbetter Act of 2007 .
Ledbetter alleged that she had suffered years of unequal pay .
Ledbetter ’s case was throw out by the Supreme Court on the grounds that she should have filed suit within 180 days of the first unfair paycheck .
The Lilly Ledbetter
Act would allow people to sue up to 180 days after the last instance of pay discrimination -- not the first , as curren law requires .
The Verdict : False .
The legislation does not waive the statute of limitations on discrimination suits , as McCain says , but changes the interpretation of when the limitation begins in cases of continuing violations .

Supports CA Prop. 8 : one - man - one - woman marriage
The muted announcements -- McCain supports the proposed ban , Obama opposes it -- will have little if any bearing on the presidential contest in California , but the ramifications are serious elsewhere .
McCain announced his support last week for the California ballot measure , known as Prop .
8 . “ I support the efforts of the people of California to recognize marriage as a unique institution between a man and a woman , just as we did in my home state of Arizona , ” he said .
McCain ’s case is a tricky one to make ; he opposes the proposed federal constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage , which Bush promoted in 2004 .
McCain ’s nuanced explanation is that it ’s up to the states to decide .

Voted against MLK holiday in 1983 ; now calls that a mistake
A : Well , let me say in 1983 I was wrong , and I believe that my advocacy for the recognition of Dr. King ’s birthday in Arizona was something that I ’m proud of .
The issue in the early ‘ 90s was a little more complicated .
I ’ve never believed in quotas , and I do n’t .
There ’s no doubt about my view on that issue .
And that was the implication , at least , of that other vote .
But I was wrong in ‘ 83 , and all of us make mistakes , and I think nobody recognized that more than Dr. King .
Supported CA Prop. 209 , canceling affirmative action quotas
Can anyone parse exactly what McCain thinks of affirmative action from that answer ?
In summing up his views in 2000 , the National Journal wrote , " McCain supports affirmative action , although he 's somewhat inconsistent on the subject .
He opposed quotas , but has denounced initiatives that attempt to eliminate quotas or racial preferences . "
" Inconsistent " is one word for such a confusing triangle of beliefs .
Pro-Confederacy activist continues as top S.C. adviser
Private ceremonies fine , but no gay marriage
In 2004 , he called the idea " antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of Republicans , " and because it " usurps from the states a fundamental authority and imposes a federal remedy for a problem that most states do not believe confronts them . "

Praised immigrants who join army to advance citizenship
Do n’t ask , do n’t tell is working ; do n’t tamper with it
ROMNEY : No , actually , when I first heard of the “ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy , I thought it sounded awfully silly .
I did n’t think that would be very effective .
And I turned out to be wrong .
It ’s been the policy now in the military for what , 10 , 15 years , and it seems to be working .
This is not the time to put in place a major change , a social experiment , in the middle of a war going on .
I would n’t change it at this point .
McCAIN : We have the best - trained , most professional , best - equipped , most efficient , most wonderful military in the history of this country , and I ’m proud of every one of them .
There just are n’t enough of them .
So I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue .

And I am convinced that that ’s the way we can maintain this greatest military .
Let ’s not tamper with them .

Confederate flag on top of capitol was wrong ; in front is ok
A : It is not flying on top of the capitol .
Yes , I was wrong when I said that I believed that it was up to the state of South Carolina .
Now , after long negotiation amongst most parties , there is an agreement that that flag no longer flies on top of the capitol of the state of South Carolina .
Q : It is flying in FRONT of the capitol now .
A : Almost all parties involved in those negotiations believe that that ’s a reasonable solution to this issue .
I support it .
I still believe that it should not have flown over the capitol , and I was wrong when I said that it was a state issue .
But now I think it has been settled , and I think it ’s time that we all moved on , on this issue -- especially the people of South Carolina .

As a freshman senator and something of a POW celebrity in Washington , McCain also got a seat on the powerful Armed Services Committee , which controlled budgetary appropriations .

We embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community .
But that does not mean that we will pander to their self - appointed leaders .

Ban on same - sex marriage is unRepublican ; leave it to states
Source : CNN.com , “ Presidential bids ” Nov 15 , 2006
Voted YES on recommending Constitutional ban on flag desecration .
the flag of the US is a unique symbol of national unity ... the Bill of Rights should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted to restrict freedom ... abuse of the flag causes more than pain and distress ... and may amount to fighting words ... destruction of the flag of the US can be intended to incite a violent response rather than make a political statement and such conduct is outside the protections afforded by the first amendment to the Constitution .
Proponents of the Resolution say : Fifty State legislatures have called on us to pass this amendment .
This amendment simply says that " Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States . "
In other words , in passing this amendment , we would give to Congress the power that the Supreme Court took away in 1989 .
48 States had anti-desecration measures on the books before 1989 .
It was then that five unelected judges told those 48 sovereign entities that they were wrong .
Opponents of the Resolution say : I am deeply offended when people burn or otherwise abuse this precious national symbol .
I also believe that the values and beliefs that the American flag represents are more important than the cloth from which this symbol was created .
Prominent among these beliefs are the right to voice views that are unpopular , and the right to protest .
I oppose this amendment not because I condone desecration of our flag , but because I celebrate the values our flag represents .
Flag burning is despicable .
However , the issue is whether we should amend our great charter document , the Constitution , to proscribe it .
Is this a problem needing such strong medicine ?
Are we facing an epidemic of flag burnings ?
Voted NO on constitutional ban of same - sex marriage .
Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman .
Neither this Constitution , nor the constitution of any State , shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman .
Proponents of the motion say : If Members of the Senate vote as their States have voted on this amendment , the vote today will be 90 to 10 in favor of a constitutional amendment .
Marriage is a foundational institution .
It is under attack by the courts .
It needs to be defended by defining it as the union of a man and a woman as 45 of our 50 States have done .
The amendment is about how we are going to raise the next generation .
It is not an issue that the courts should resolve .
Those of us who support this amendment are doing so in an effort to let the people decide .
Opponents of the motion say :
This proposal pits Americans against one another .
It appeals to people 's worst instincts and prejudices .
Supporters rail against activist judges .
But if this vaguely worded amendment ever passes , it will result in substantial litigation .
What are the legal incidents of marriage ?
Is a civil union a marriage ?
Married heterosexual couples are wondering , how , exactly , the prospect of gay marriages threatens the health of their marriages .
This amendment would make a minority of Americans permanent second - class citizens of this country .
It would prevent States , many of which are grappling with the definition of marriage , from deciding that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry .
And it would write discrimination into a document that has served as a historic guarantee of individual freedom .

Scientists have studied superconductors and superfluids for decades .
Now , researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have drawn the first detailed picture of the way a superfluid influences the behavior of a superconductor .
In addition to describing previously unknown superconductor behavior , these calculations could change scientists ' understanding of the motion of neutron stars .
A neutron star , the high - density remnant of a former massive star , is thought to contain both a neutron superfluid and a proton superconductor at its core .
Despite widespread agreement that neutron stars contain both materials , superfluid - superconductors have not been widely studied .
" Not many people have thought seriously about the interactions between a superfluid and a superconductor that are co-existing like this , " said Mark Alford , associate professor of physics and lead author of the paper published in the July issue of Physical Review B , " They tended to treat the two components separately . "
Super Phenomena
Separately , the two phenomena are well understood .
A superconductor allows a flow of current without resistance .
Similarly , a superfluid flows without friction .
Unlike superconductors and superfluids , a superfluid - superconductor does not exist on earth .
But , understanding its hybrid behavior may be a first step toward creating one in the lab and understanding what goes on inside neutron stars .
In addition to conducting current without resistance , superconductors also exclude magnetic fields .
Neutron stars have massive magnetic fields , but scientists do not know how a superconductor behaves in the presence of this field , specifically whether it will be a type I or type II superconductor .
A type I superconductor forces a magnetic field around its exterior .
A type II superconductor , however , strikes a compromise , letting the magnetic field pass through tiny non-superconducting holes called flux tubes .
Type II superconductors permit one unit of magnetic field per flux tube .
Whether a superconductor is type I or type II depends on a value called kappa .
If kappa is greater than a set critical value , the superconductor is type II .
Likewise , if kappa is less than the critical value , the superconductor is type I .
Add a superfluid , however , and these calculations show that the superconductor 's boundary shifts , changing the critical value of kappa and causing exotic behavior at the boundary .
Living on the Edge
Ariel Zhitnitsky at the University of British Columbia was the first to report this boundary shift .
Curiosity piqued by the shift , Alford and his collaborator , graduate student Gerald Good , decided to take a closer look at the boundary .
" We found that the boundary was n't just shifted , but new behavior appeared when the superconductor is on the edge , between type I and type II , " said Alford .
Since superconductors and superfluids are older physics , Alford added , " We were surprised that there was anything new to mine here . "
To understand the boundary shift , Alford and Good examined two interactions between the superfluid and superconductor .
The first had a superconductor either attracting or repelling a superfluid .
The second had a flowing superconductor causing a superfluid to flow either with it or against it .
Exotic Behavior at the Shifted Boundary
Alford and Good found that the two superconductor - superfluid interactions ( attractive / repulsive and flow ) had opposite effects on the boundary shift and produced different , but equally exotic , boundary behavior .
The attractive / repulsive interaction increased kappa , favoring a type I superconductor and creating intermediate type II states near the boundary .
These intermediate states resemble type II because they have flux tubes ; but strangely , more than one unit of magnetic field appears to exist in each .
Depending on the parameters , an infinite number of intermediate type II states exist , with any number of magnetic field units in each flux tube .
Unlike the attractive / repulsive interaction , the flow interaction decreased kappa , favoring a type II superconductor .
Instead of intermediate type II states , the flow interaction creates meta - stable regions on either side of the boundary .
Specifically , in these regions a superconductor that should be type II can get stuck as type I and vice versa .
A familiar example of similar behavior is when , under the right conditions , water remains a liquid despite freezing temperatures .
Passing the Baton
Just as Zhitnitsky 's work inspired Alford and Good to look closer at the type I / type II boundary , this work has already spurred others in new directions .
A group at Dartmouth College is confirming some behavior seen by Alford and Good , but the Dartmouth results favor a different scenario for the intermediate type II phases ( unpublished ) .
The Dartmouth group is not seeing multiple units of magnetic field in one flux tube , but flux tubes that are a fixed distance apart ( with one unit of magnetic field each ) .
These flux tubes tend to " stick together " rather than spread out as far as possible , as in normal type II superconductors .
Alford and Good said they could not rule out this possibility due to limitations in the simplified model and in computing capacity .
" The Dartmouth group is seeing similar intermediate phases , " said Good , " but slightly different behavior .
That 's the next step in our research and it 's already being done , which is pretty neat . "

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Rap music mogul Marion “ Suge ” Knight was arrested on charges of assault and domestic violence on Wednesday after punching his girlfriend and pulling a knife on her during an argument , Las Vegas police said .

According to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department , Knight was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and battery domestic violence , possession of a controlled substance and possession of dangerous drugs without a prescription .
The charges stemmed from a domestic violence call involving his girlfriend early in the morning of August 27 , 2008 , police said .

Knight , 43 , co-founder of the rap label Death Row Records , also was charged with two drug offenses when he was found to be in possession of ecstasy and the prescription narcotic Hydrocodone , police said in a statement .
Police said Knight ’s girlfriend of three years , who was not identified in the statement , told officers that Knight punched her in the head during an argument while he was driving with her in an automobile .
In an effort to escape , the girlfriend grabbed the steering wheel causing the vehicle to hit a curb and come to an abrupt stop , then she fled with Knight in pursuit , police said .
When officers arrived on the scene , responding to a domestic violence call , they found Knight standing over the woman holding a knife , according to police .
He was arrested without incident and booked into the Clark County Detention Center , while his girlfriend was taken to a nearby hospital , police said .
Knight , who helped promote such rap stars as Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur in the 1990s , has seen his career as a record executive overshadowed by numerous run-ins with the law over the years .
He was sent to prison in October 1996 for violating his probation on a previous assault case by kicking a man during a scuffle at a Las Vegas hotel .
The scuffle took place hours before Shakur was gunned down in September 1996 in a drive - by shooting .
Knight was at the wheel of the car in which Shakur was fatally shot and was slightly wounded himself .
Months later , rap artist Christopher Wallace , who was known as Notorious B.I.G. and signed to a rival record label , was shot to death in Los Angeles .
Knight , who was incarcerated at the time , was named by police a few years later as a suspect in the Wallace slaying but was never charged .
Both rap murders remain unsolved .
Knight was released from prison in April 2001 .
The following year a federal racketeering probe of Knight and his record label , which stemmed from allegations of murder , drug trafficking , money laundering and gun running , was closed with the company pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges .
" A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain . . . a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief . . . " -- Rule 8 ( a ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
" In alleging fraud or mistake , a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake . " -- Rule 9 ( b ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
A 465 - page racketeering lawsuit filed with Washington State federal judge Ronald Leighton inspired Leighton to gin up the following limerick .
( Gavel bang : How Appealing )
Plaintiff has a great deal to say , But it seems he skipped Rule 8 ( a ) .
His Complaint is too long ,
Which renders it wrong , Please rewrite and refile today .
Drawing a rare comparison between Shakespeare 's " Hamlet " and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , Judge Leighton ( pictured ) , in a four - page order granting the defendant 's motion for a more definite statement , writes that brevity , in addition to being the soul of wit , is the soul of a pleading .

Despite declining energy costs , wholesale prices soared in July , giving the economy the worst 12 months of inflation in almost three decades and increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates .
The producer price index rose 1.2 % in July alone , about double the increase expected by economists , the Labor Department said Tuesday .
Excluding food and fuel , the index surged 0.7 % , also more than expected .
The overall index last month was up 9.8 % from a year earlier , the sharpest rise since 1980 - 81 .
Some analysts say inflation will moderate as lower fuel costs work their way through the economy , but Tuesday ’s report still generated concern .

“ The risks are as elevated as they ’ve been on inflation since the 1980s , ” said Vincent Reinhart , a former Fed official .
Meantime , the Commerce Department reported that the annual rate of housing starts in July was down 11 % from June , suggesting the worst is n’t over in that vital sector .
The economic news , coupled with persistent concerns about financial companies , drove the Dow Jones industrial average down 130 points .
Normally , the Fed would seek to choke off inflation by raising interest rates .
But with the housing and financial sectors still struggling , a rate boost could deepen and lengthen the current downturn .

“ This is a terrible time to be a central banker , ” said Reinhart , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
“ The Federal Reserve is caught in the economic cross - fire .
They ’re pinned down and they ca n’t do anything . ”
But other economists suggested the pressure on the Fed to cut rates would ease as the lower costs of energy and other commodities are felt .
Oil futures , which closed at a record $ 145.29 on July 3 , finished Tuesday at $ 114.53 .
“ With energy and other commodity prices currently on the wane , the July spike in core producer prices is quite likely to be the worst we will see in the near term , ” said Ken Beauchemin at forecasting firm Global Insight in Lexington , Mass .
Asha Bangalore , an economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago , noted that consumer inflation had remained more moderate than wholesale inflation because many businesses were absorbing some of their higher costs instead of passing them on to customers .

Inflation typically gets out of control when consumers and businesses start building higher prices into their long - term economic planning .
But the Fed is betting that consumers have not yet begun to act as if high levels of inflation are here to stay , Reinhart said .
“ So far inflation expectations remain anchored , but that ’s a risk , ” he said .
The trade - off between fighting inflation and fostering economic growth has been a subject of debate at the Fed for months .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , Va. , said Tuesday he did n’t want to wait too long to combat inflation by raising interest rates .
“ It is important to withdraw this monetary policy stimulus in a timely way , ” Lacker told Bloomberg News .
“ That may require us to withdraw before we are certain all of the weakness is behind us and before we are completely certain that financial markets are as tranquil as we would like to see . ”

But that view appears to be a minority opinion at the Fed , at least for now .
For Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , waiting too long to rein in inflation would be less costly than deepening the recession , said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pa .
“ He would rather make the mistake of keeping rates low too long , ” Naroff said , “ rather than raising them too soon . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Rep. Dennis Kucinich , a former Democratic presidential candidate from Ohio , introduced a resolution to impeach President Bush into the House of Representatives on Tuesday .
Kucinich announced his intention to seek Bush 's impeachment Monday night , when he read the lengthy document into the record .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said she would not support a resolution calling for Bush 's impeachment , saying such a move was unlikely to succeed and would be divisive .
Most of the congressman 's resolution deals with the Iraq war , contending that the president manufactured a false case for the war , violated U.S. and international law to invade Iraq , failed to provide troops with proper equipment and falsified casualty reports for political purposes .
Kucinich also charges that Bush has illegally detained without charge both U.S. citizens and " foreign captives " and violated numerous U.S. laws through the use of " signing statements " declaring his intention to do so .
Other articles address global warming , voting rights , Medicare , the response to Hurricane Katrina and failure to comply with congressional subpoenas .
Last year , Kucinich introduced a resolution to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
But in November when Republicans tried to force a debate on the move , the attempt failed .
Democrats voted to send the resolution to the House Judiciary Committee , where committee chairman Rep. John Conyers has taken no action on it .
An earlier resolution to impeach Cheney has languished in the House Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties since May 2007 .
The House of Representatives has voted to impeach two presidents -- Andrew Johnson , in 1868 , and Bill Clinton , in 1999 -- but both were acquitted by the Senate and remained in office .
No U.S. vice president has been impeached .
Kucinich dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination for president in January to focus on his re-election bid in Ohio .
He handily won the Democratic primary in his district on March 4 and faces former State Representative Jim Trakas in the general election .

If you thought tree climbing goats were strange , meet the breed of goats that faints and falls over when spooked .
Singularly and en masse these weird goats freeze for a number of seconds and generally fall over in the process .
The goats have a significant fan following , are frequently used as pets and are even at the center of an annual fainting goat festival .
As the story goes , fainting goats were actually handy for farmers to have around as decoys for the more valuable sheep .
While the sheep would flee from predators the fainting goats would fall to the ground stunned and provide a much easier meal to wolfs or other attackers .
Over time these goats have also been known as Scare , Nervous and Wooden Leg Goats .
Aside from their peculiar habit of fainting at the slightest scare , these goats have other benefits which have resulted in their continued breeding for over 100 years .
Their litters are generally larger , they are less prone to climbing ( for fairly obvious reasons ) and therefore escaping and they have a higher portion of tasty meat .
Of course , many people enjoy them simply for the novelty of their fainting behavior .
Finally , if fainting and tree - climbing goats were n’t enough … here is one that yells like a man .

Chasing the ISS

Explanation : Bathed in sunlight , the International Space Station ( ISS ) arced through the evening sky above the town of Lauffen in southern Germany on May 31st .
The timing of the bright passage was about 10 minutes after the launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery on the STS - 124 mission from Kennedy Space Center , Florida , in the southeastern US .
Of course , Discovery was headed toward an orbital rendezvous with the ISS .
In chasing after the space station , the shuttle also made a pass over Lauffen just 21 minutes after launch .
With a camera fixed to a tripod , astronomer Jürgen Michelberger recorded both magnificent machines streaking overhead in two different time exposures , each about 2 minutes long , and merged them in this composite view .
Parallax causes the paths of the ISS ( right ) and Discovery ( near center ) to seem to diverge as they were at very different altitudes .
Stars ( and bright planets ) leave two , separated , short trails .
The brief , flaring track of an Iridium satellite and faint dotted trail of a passing airplane are also visible .
A close inspection will reveal a dim reddish track , the jettisoned external fuel tank , just left of Discovery .

A new kind of photosynthesis that uses arsenic instead of water to harvest light promises to rewrite evolutionary history – at least that of arsenic metabolism on Earth .
Some bacteria use arsenate – arsenic with four oxygen atoms attached – as an energy source .
It was thought that this form of metabolism did n’t get going until long after photosynthesis filled the atmosphere with oxygen about 2.7 billion years ago .
When this happened , naturally occurring arsenite would be transformed into arsenate .
But Ronald Oremland and colleagues at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park , California , were puzzled by the great range of arsenic - eating bacteria .
If they evolved recently they must have passed the ability to metabolise arsenic to each other by lateral gene transfer , he says .
Alternatively , arsenic metabolism could have evolved much earlier , giving plenty of time for bacteria to diversify .
Newly discovered bacteria from oxygen - free hot springs in Mono Lake , California , support this interpretation .

Toxic lunch
Oremland ’s team isolated and bred these bacteria in the lab .
By growing them with with arsenite as the only possible food source , the researchers showed that the bacteria can indeed thrive .
“ It was quite tricky to culture the critters , because if you give them too much arsenic , it ’s still toxic even to them .
But once we had figured out the right dose and gave it to them at regular intervals , they flourished on the stuff , ” says Oremland .
The results suggest that arsenic photosynthesis evolved at the same time , or even before , “ normal ” photosynthesis .
Oremland says a similar mechanism might once have fuelled life on Mars or on Jupiter ’s moon Europa .
Jon Lloyd , a geomicrobiologist at the University of Manchester , UK , says it will be interesting to see how widespread arsenic photosynthesis is .
He also says that these bacteria might one day help to clean up arsenic - contaminated drinking water , but emphasises that there is a pressing need for detoxifying technologies now .
“ There are existing robust approaches that can be implemented more quickly , ” he says .

They were meant to show that gender was determined by nurture , not nature - one identical twin raised as a boy and the other brought up as a girl after a botched circumcision .
But two years ago Brian Reimer killed himself , and last week David - formerly Brenda - took his life too .
Oliver Burkeman and Gary Younge unravel the tragic story of Dr Money 's sex experiment
Until a few years ago , the name David Reimer meant little to those outside his immediate circle , and by the time he killed himself last Tuesday in unknown circumstances in his hometown of Winnipeg , it was already slipping back towards obscurity - a name belonging to nobody more remarkable than a local odd - job man , a 38 - year - old former slaughterhouse worker who was separated from his wife , and enjoyed shopping at flea markets and tinkering with his car .
In fact , to anyone taking an interest in the development of psychology in the 1970s and 1980s , Reimer 's life story would have long been infamous , but also pseudonymous .
Going by the name " John " , and subsequently " Joan " , David Reimer had been an unwitting guinea - pig - along with his identical twin brother Brian - in a medical experiment at first celebrated , then notorious .
Masterminded by a prominent Baltimore physician , John Money , it was an attempt to settle , once and for all , the fraught nature - versus - nurture debate : to prove that gender was so fluid that by a mere change in childrearing practice , plus a little surgery , a boy could be turned into a girl , while his twin developed as a male .
It would split the world of sexual psychology in two .
And after 12 years of traumatising treatment , followed by a further two decades spent attempting to repair the damage , it would drive David Reimer to his death .
" It was like brainwashing , " Reimer once said , having resumed his male identity after a childhood spent as Brenda .
" I 'd give just about anything to go to a hypnotist to black out my whole past .
Because it 's torture .
What they did to you in the body is sometimes not near as bad as what they did to you in the mind . "
The tragedy has its roots in what seemed like a routine trip to hospital in 1966 for Janet and Ron Reimer and their twin baby boys , Bruce and Brian .
Doctors had recommended circumcision , a practice still routine in much of north America , but Bruce 's operation went distressingly wrong .
Like almost every detail of the story , what actually happened is still fiercely disputed but what is clear is that the electric cauterising machine being used by doctors caused burning to his penis so severe as to render the organ unrescuable .
Reconstructive genital surgery was still rudimentary , and medical experts could offer only pessimism .
So when the despairing parents happened to catch a television show , some months later , on which John Money was propounding his radical new theories about gender formation , it seemed to offer a lifeline .
" He was saying that it could be that babies are born neutral , and you could change their gender , " Janet Reimer later told John Colapinto , author of a book on the experiment entitled As Nature Made Him .
In photographs taken at the time , Money - then , as now , affiliated to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland - looks like a parody of a progressive " sexologist " , turtlenecked and moustachioed , and his writings did nothing to dispel that impression .
Raised in a conservative religious family in New Zealand , he had rebelled and become a self - described " missionary of sex " , revelling in shocked responses to his tireless advocacy of open marriages and - a particular favourite - bisexual group sex .
At their most extreme , Money 's public statements had appeared to endorse , or at least not to condemn , incest and paedophilia , but there was no hint of that in the television show Janet and Ron Reimer saw .
They wrote to him , and he wrote swiftly back .
He was confident , he said , that Bruce could be successfully raised as a girl .
From an experimental perspective , Brian Reimer would provide the perfect control : his genetic inheritance was identical to Bruce's .
The only difference was that one would be nurtured as a girl , and the other as a boy .
Money 's emphasis on nurture over nature played well with the progressive spirit of the times , and especially with the women 's movement , its proponents eager to establish that women 's traditional social roles were not biologically pre-ordained .
" Postwar , in any case , there was a move away from people being innately , biologically , inherently anything , " says Lynne Segal , professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College in London .
" We 'd just seen Nazism , and the emphasis had been put on the idea that certain people were innately evil - Jews and gypsies , among others - so the emphasis on culture and society fitted well with social democratic ideals . "
The Reimers did not engage in this kind of debate .
" I looked up to [ John Money ] as a god , " Janet said simply .
Bruce Reimer started to become Brenda on July 3 , 1967 .
Physicians at Johns Hopkins surgically castrated him , and the remaining skin was used to forge a " cosmetic vaginal cleft " .
Money sent the family back to Winnipeg with strict instructions .
" He told us not to talk about it , " Ron Reimer told John Colapinto .
" Not to tell [ Brenda ] the whole truth , and that she should n't know she was n't a girl . "
Things started going wrong almost immediately .
Janet Reimer recalled dressing Brenda in her first dress just before the child was due to turn two .
" She was ripping at it , trying to tear it off .
I remember thinking , ' Oh , my God , she knows she 's a boy and she does n't want girls ' clothing . "
Brenda was bullied viciously at school .
When she urinated standing up in the school lavatories , she was threatened with a knifing .
Whether all the blame should lie with Money remains a matter of contention .
His supporters argue that reconstructive surgery techniques of the time were such that trying to turn Bruce into Brenda might genuinely have been the least worst option .
In public , Money advertised the " John / Joan " study as a resounding success .
" This dramatic case , " Time magazine reported , picking up on his salesmanship , " provides strong support for a major contention of women 's liberationists : that conventional patterns on masculine and feminine behaviour can be altered . "
In private , though , things were spinning into chaos .
Brenda was required to attend regular therapy sessions with Money in Baltimore , in the company of her brother .
According to Colapinto's account , they soon degenerated into horrifying encounters that deeply traumatised the two children .
Showing the children " explicit sexual pictures " was seemingly central to Money 's theories of gender reassignment .
David Reimerlater recalled , as Brenda , " getting yelled at by Money ... he told me to take my clothes off , and I just did not do it .
I just stood there .
And he screamed ' No ! '
I thought he was going to give me a whupping .
So I took my clothes off and stood there , shaking . "
In the children 's grimmest recollection - one they found almost impossible to talk about years later - Money allegedly made " Brenda assume a position on all fours on his office sofa and make Brian come up behind her on his knees and place his crotch against her buttocks " , an element of Money 's theory he referred to as " sexual rehearsal play " .
( The author John Heidenry , who wrote a recent review defending the sexologist , calls this charge " outrageous and offensive " , and says Brian , the source of the claim , may have been suffering false memory syndrome . )
By the time Brenda reached her teens she had attempted suicide at least once ; she refused further surgery but consented , though irregularly , to take oestrogen supplements to encourage the development of breasts .
John Money gradually drifted from the Reimers ' lives , but Brenda remained under constant psychiatric treatment .
It was after one such session with a Winnipeg psychiatrist in 1980 that Ron Reimer collected his daughter in the car and , instead of taking her home , drove her to an ice - cream parlour , where he told her everything .
The upturn in Reimer 's fortunes lasted several years .
Brenda opted for a sex change within weeks of her father telling her the truth .
Thanks to developments in phalloplasty , Brenda , taking the name David , received surgery that after five years left him with a reconstructed penis resembling a real one , with limited sensation , and usable for sex .
When he was 23 he met Jane , a single mother of three , and married her soon afterwards .
In 2000 , he went public with his story .
But his happiness did n't last .
For reasons that remain unclear , David and Jane eventually separated .
Then , two years ago , Brian Reimer apparently killed himself , taking an overdose of drugs he was taking for schizophrenia .
David reportedly felt responsible for the death , and visited Brian 's grave daily , weeding the plot and bringing fresh flowers .
Despite Colapinto's claims that David made a large amount of money from the book , those who knew him said he was often hard up ; at the Transcona golf club , in Winnipeg 's eastern suburbs , where he did odd jobs , the members had a whip round for him so he could afford to eat .
Friends say he had became particularly distraught during the last few months after he bought thousands of dollars ' worth of shares in an investment that flopped .
The world of psychology learned of the failure of Money 's experiment through a paper by a rival , Dr Milton Diamond , of the University of Hawaii , who eventually traced those who had taken over treatment of the twins .
For Lynne Segal , the story of the experiment does not settle the nature / nurture debate one way or the other - her view , widely shared today , is that the dichotomy is false - but it shows the perils of psychologists trying to prove too much through research .
" It 's far too simplistic , and far too interventionist , this idea that we can control and model and shape people to prove one thing or another . "
John Money remains an emeritus professor at Johns Hopkins .
" He 's not commenting on this story , " his assistant told the Guardian yesterday .
" There is no comment to make . "

Vortex Network , the touted replacement for the BrokenStones tracker , is today surrounded by controversy .
The site owner announced she will link the site to a non-profit organization as part of a wider plan to unite all BitTorrent sites in a new air of legitimacy .
Staff and members are leaving the site en masse .
A few weeks ago after difficulties with Malaysian hosting , the much - loved BrokenStones BitTorrent tracker went down .
When news of a replacement site started to filter through , staff , members and others were prepared to offer time and resources to make the site a success .
This led to the birth of Vortex Network – a brand new site put together in record time and one of the first to be built on the shiny new ‘ Gazelle ‘ codebase , developed by What.cd .
Around two weeks ago , a message appeared on the site , written by Rachel Faith Anderson , “ Owner , SysOp and Chief Admin of the Vortex Network ” .
In it were thanks to the ‘ heroes ’ who put the site together along with statements about Vortex Network becoming something unique and something different , a standard claim for a new BitTorrent site trying to get off the ground .
“ Welcome to the eye of the storm my friend ” ends the notice from Rachel , which has turned out to be quite the prophetic greeting .
The Start of the Storm
A few days ago the first rumblings of dissatisfaction started to appear from within the userbase of Vortex Network .
Although donations are an absolute requirement for most BitTorrent communities to stay afloat , there are many differing opinions on how this issue should be approached .
It ’s safe to say that some of the community were not happy with the site ’s ‘ donation ’ page .
While it ’s not compulsory for users to pay to use Vortex Network , there is a page where users can pay cash to fix their share ratio , enabling them to opt - out of seeding and get ‘ customer ’ or ‘ patron ’ status .
Some other members who wo n’t ( or can ’t ) seed have cautiously welcomed the scheme .
However , it seems that most are not in favor of it , labeling Rachel Faith – a self - confessed BitTorrent newcomer – as greedy .
For her part , Rachel denies that the site is accepting payments in this fashion , indicating that the code was already present in ‘ Gazelle ’ .
The P2L debate will rage on here and elsewhere , but this is really just a distraction .
Following this discussion came an announcement from Rachel Faith Anderson herself .
It ’s quite long but in order to present the entire picture , here it is in full .
To fully appreciate the nuances , a detailed read is required :
A Discussion not a Debate
That is what I shall be doing .
In a debate , sides present their case and then some other party gets to decide .
In a discussion , both sides can present their case and then that is that .
They are each understood .
But there is not the presumption that persuasion will occur .
I know this “ debate ” has been around for longer than p2 p .
I know the roots run deep and no one post can persuade those whose minds are already made up .
Thus , this is a discussion .
Feel free to discuss for as long as you wish .
Feel free to ‘ debate ’ if you wish .
Know that I am not interested in debate .
With that being said , let me make the brief introduction and outline the points I hope to present .
There are many issues , and not all of them are even related , so keeping this as a discussion not a debate , allows the latitude to include all the points being raised even if some are not germane .
The list of points : P2L is bad , impure , and somehow against the spirit of something greater .
It makes others ( those who pay not seed ) who are for this reason not as good as others ( those who see seeding as the ultimate sign ) equal .
Yeah , it does exactly that .
It says , just because you seed and do not donate , you are not better than someone who donates and does not seed as much as you .
If you are offended by the equality of the two different ways in which status can be obtained , that is your personal feeling .
But a feeling is not a fact .
Choose to act upon a feeling and not a fact , and you act irrationally .
That is also a fact .
The fact is , we fully declare that there is no superiority between those who seed and those who donate .
None .
We are neutral , unbiased and blind to any such thought , rejecting totally and without repentance the notion that seeders are “ better ” than “ donors ” .
That this is a point of contention for those who would like to think they are better than someone else , because their way is pure , is a very old elitist mentality which we fully intend to eradicate .
In short such thinking is beyond bullshit , and the mark of juvenile thinking and weak egos who cannot bear the thought that they are not superior to someone else .
This is why we do not have the titles as plain as other sites .
Take the word user , or power user .
What is a user ?
Someone who uses something or someone .
This too has been rejected .
You will never see the word user in any of our rules or guides .
You , the people are not users .
You are not using us , using each other , or using the community .
You are members , each equal under the rules and given the same opportunity to succeed or fail in your own right .
Now the other end .
The VIPs .
We do not have this term either .
Rejected is the idea that someone is more important or very important beyond anyone else .
All members are part of the same body .
Any opinion from any member is received with the same hope , optimism and credibility as is any other .
Each will be weighed on the merits of the idea , not on some favored status .
You are all Very Important People .
Words have meaning , and we have chosen the theme and the words for the titles with that care in mind .
What are the other problems ?
The red herring .
Server costs .
Let us be very clear .
Vortex Network is not a tracker .
It has a tracker .
True enough .
And we come to existence from the ashes of a tracker .
Also true .
But this is not who we are , where we are going and what is to be the future .
We are more than a tracker .
We are more than 22,000 members .
Not yet , not today , not this hour .
But sooner than later .
Sooner than many but a very small few who really understand what is going on , would dare to believe .
So let us be clearer for all .
We are a legal and legitimate Tax Exempt Corporation .
Any other site taking money of any kind for any reasons and not filing with the authorities needs to face the facts that p2 p may not have ever put anyone in prison , but tax evasion has done so to the best of mice and men .
There are two schools of thought .
One is old and is the conventional thinking .
One is new and is the wisdom we present .
The first school of thought says this :
Our technology is forbidden by most authorities , we must be small , quiet , hidden and meek .
If we get caught we must lie and erase our activities .
We , by these actions admit our guilt and we believe ourselves to be criminals .
Nothing , will or can change and we must act in this belief .
We reject every element of that thought .
We embrace a better future .
We believe the statutes change .
We believe public perception changes .
We are students of the law , of history and we are agents of change .
Like those before us who stood for the right of men to be free of slavery , like those before us whose suffrage was to bring the right of women to vote , and like those before us who have stood even for their most basic of human rights under much worse oppression and tyranny , we stand to bring the necessary changes to the use of p2p technology and to the common sense rights for intellectual property as well .
We do not hide .
We are not criminals .
Our behavior will not be that of cowards , criminals or those who are ashamed to speak out truth in this , a darkened night .
Your donation is not for access to a tracker .
That access is free .
And as the seeder club has pointed out , a donation is not needed at all to seed or even to build a ratio , provided you are willing to wait long enough .
Your donation will fund this change .
It will provide us the opportunity to build a community far beyond 22,000 members , beyond 220,000 members .
It will change the whole misunderstanding about what p2 p technology is , does and who and why we are doing what we do .
Our effort will be public , it will be open , it will be legal , and you will see exactly where your contributions are going .
And we use the word contribution , because it is not just a donation of money , but of time and effort , which will be rewarded as well .
This is just a single small step into a new world vision .
This is but the tiniest spark of hope in a hopeless future .
We are asking you to be part of that spark .
To be keen to lighting the brush fire which then can never be extinguished !
And to our dear friends who cannot .

Rachel Faith Anderson
We are a Legal and Legitimate Tax Exempt Corporation
In this headline and statement from Rachel lies the real controversy .
It appears that in order to supposedly protect Vortex Network from legal action , it ( or a parent organization ) has been incorporated in the US as a non-profit Subchapter “ S ” corporation , which was necessary to “ open a bank account , purchase equipment and report revenue to the taxing authorities ” .
We can find no evidence to suggest that Rachel is worried about copyright laws , which is an interesting approach .
The mere thought of being registered or linked to some sort of tax - exempt charity / organization has sent shockwaves through the Vortex Network community .
Add to this that she is suggesting that tracker admins should no longer hide in the shadows , but join her to face the world head on , has seen many of the staff deleting their accounts and leaving the site in disbelief .
Rachel Faith ’s Plan for World BitTorrent Domination
Although previously we ’ve spoken about non-profit organizations , Rachel actually wants prominent people and existing sites from the BitTorrent community to unite to join her in a new , “ for - profit entity ” which has already been registered in the US .
Labeling herself as a “ visionary ” she proposes – either by creation , merger or acquisition – the establishment of a network of private trackers which will operate together , combining resources , members and staff .
Her theory is that the unified resources of these sites will prove a more difficult target for the authorities to take down .
By making the sites “ 99 % community and 1 % tracker ” , Rachel feels legal issues surrounding the tracker can be mitigated .
She also hopes that by combining the sites – hopefully hundreds – the whole operation will become more secure and “ profitable ” .
Those enjoying a small club - like feel to their favorite tracker better get used to becoming a small cog in a huge wheel – if Rachel gets her way , that is .
Additionally , she views large and overly vocal public trackers as a menace and proposes that steps should be taken to put “ embarrassing ” sites ( such as The Pirate Bay ) “ out of business ” .
Rachel and her ever decreasing team believe that the way regular trackers operate is doomed to failure and so they intend to embark on a mission to change the public ’s perception of BitTorrent in order to encourage legal change to allow their plan to grow .
They aim to do this in 12 months , while at the same time amassing a minimum of 250,000 members as a base to work from .
Whatever this new plan for BitTorrent is , it ’s not calming nerves and there is growing opposition to this plan , before it even gets off the ground .
Rachel may want to take on the world in a blaze of glory , but most seem to want a quiet life .
We are students of the law , of history and we are agents of change .
According to sources close to the situation , Rachel Faith ( possibly Rachel Faith Anderson , possibly something else ) has a background in banking and is a lawyer ( or at least a law student ) using her real name .
Using real names consistently on the Internet has its problems .
As does hosting your avatar on your AOL page , which in turn reveals your AOL account name .
Unless , of course , this is all some elaborate case of misdirection .
But there again , Rachel said she is n’t hiding but it seems crazy to believe someone would be as open as this .
In any event , it ’s clear that the majority of staff and members who have expressed a preference are not happy to be treated as “ guinea pigs ” in Rachel ’s worldwide BitTorrent laboratory , especially when they now view the “ BrokenStones replacement ” line as a simple “ bait and switch ” tactic to get a solid base for her plans for domination .
Time will tell what will come of these plans , but in the meantime the opinions of others in the community are plain to see , especially if one visits any of the #crazybitch channels that have appeared on IRC , or the many outraged posters on the Vortex forums .
Or maybe Rachel Faith Anderson is sane and everyone else is crazy ?
Stranger things have happened …

Update : TorrentFreak managed to catch up with Rachel Faith Anderson but with other ‘ real - life ’ commitments ( hey , we all have them ) , she did n’t really have much time for much other than a very brief chat .
We ’ve offered her a full right of reply and even delayed this article for her to do so , but we have heard nothing further .
However , she has finally responded to the ex-BrokenStones community and staff .
Here is a small part of it which seems to have hit a raw nerve :
But there was existing , trained , competent staff from BS looking for a new home and so we tried to make it fit and tried to make it work .
But from the very beginning , I could tell that it would not .
The end was not unexpected , though it was untimely and unplanned .
And this is the sadness I share with many .
It is a loss and it came at a terrible time .
Such is the nature of life .
So long ex-BrokenStones staff who worked hard to put the new site together , seems the Vortex Network does n’t want you anymore …..

Hundreds of insect species spend much of their time underwater , where food may be more plentiful .
MIT mathematicians have now figured out exactly how those insects breathe underwater .
By virtue of their rough , water - repellent coat , when submerged these insects trap a thin layer of air on their bodies .
These bubbles not only serve as a finite oxygen store , but also allow the insects to absorb oxygen from the surrounding water .
" Some insects have adapted to life underwater by using this bubble as an external lung , " said John Bush , associate professor of applied mathematics , a co-author of the recent study .
Thanks to those air bubbles , insects can stay below the surface indefinitely and dive as deep as about 30 meters , according to the study co-authored by Bush and Morris Flynn , former applied mathematics instructor .
Some species , such as Neoplea striola , which are native to New England , hibernate underwater all winter long .
This phenomenon was first observed many years ago , but the MIT researchers are the first to calculate the maximum dive depths and describe how the bubbles stay intact as insects dive deeper underwater , where pressure threatens to burst them .
The new study , which appears in the Aug. 10 issue of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics , shows that there is a delicate balance between the stability of the bubble and the respiratory needs of the insect .
The air bubble 's stability is maintained by hairs on the insects ' abdomen , which help repel water from the surface .
The hairs , along with a waxy surface coating , prevent water from flooding the spiracles -- tiny breathing holes on the abdomen .
The spacing of these hairs is critically important :
The closer together the hairs , the greater the mechanical stability and the more pressure the bubble can withstand before collapsing .
However , mechanical stability comes at a cost .
If the hairs are too close together , there is not enough surface area through which to breathe .
" Because the bubble acts as an external lung , its surface area must be sufficiently large to facilitate the exchange of gases , " said Flynn , who is now an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Alberta .
The researchers developed a mathematical model that takes these factors into account and allows them to predict the range of possible dive depths .
They found that there is not only a maximum depth beyond which the bubble collapses , but a minimum depth above which the bubble cannot meet the insect 's respiratory needs .
Though the researchers found that the insects can go as deep as 30 meters below the surface , they rarely venture deeper than several meters , due to environmental factors such as amount of sunlight , availability of prey and the presence of predators .
The researchers first took an interest in the external lung phenomenon when they accidentally captured one of the underwater breathers while looking for water striders .
A few years ago , Bush and colleagues figured out how the striders use surface tension to glide across the water 's surface .
Other researchers have explored systems that could replicate the external lung on a larger scale , for possible use by diving humans .
A team at Nottingham Trent University showed that a porous cavity surrounded by water - repellent material is supplied with oxygen by the thin air layer on its surface .
The surface area required to support human respiration is impractically large , in excess of 100 square meters ; however , other avenues for technological application exist .
For example , such a device could supply the oxygen needed by fuel cells to power small autonomousÂ underwaterÂ vehicles .

The origin of magnetic fields in galaxies is still a mystery to astronomers .
Popular theories suggest continual strengthening over billions of years .
The latest results from Simon Lilly ’s group , however , contradict this assumption and reveal that young galaxies also have strong magnetic fields .
“ There is an astronomer joke that goes ‘ to understand the universe , we examine galaxies for radiation , gases , temperatures , chemical constitution and much more .
Anything we ca n’t explain after that we attribute to the magnetic fields ’ ” , explains Simon Lilly , Professor at the Institute of Astronomy at ETH Zurich .
The creations of the magnetic fields in galaxies remain a badly researched mystery .
Until now , it was deduced that galaxies which formed after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago had very weak magnetic fields that then proceeded to grow exponentially in strength over several billions of years .
At least that is what the dynamo theory ( see box ) , which is often used to explain the development of magnetic fields , conveys .
Statistical approach for exact proof
In the journal Nature , Martin Bernet , Francesco Miniati and Simon Lilly probed into the topic of magnetic fields in young galaxies .
The results are astonishing : Contrary to the popular dynamo explanatory model , the team was able to prove that even very young galaxies have a strong magnetic field on the basis of a statistical analysis of existing and new astronomical data .
Technically speaking , determining the strength of magnetic fields that are many billions of light years from Earth is difficult and extremely time - consuming .
This is probably one reason why the field has hardly been researched .
Using the Faraday Rotation ( FR ) as the parameter , however , the strength of a magnetic field can be deduced from the polarization of the light in the radio field .
If linearly polarized light radiates through a magnetized gas cloud , the polarization level of the light rotates .
The rotation of the polarization level is all the larger the stronger the magnetic field is .
This effect was first described by Michael Faraday in 1845 .
The researchers used quasars as radiation sources to measure the magnetic fields in the galaxies in question .
These are extremely luminous objects whose radiation can in all likelihood be explained through the existence of supermassive black holes at the heart of the galaxies .
Observations in Chile
For their analyses , the scientists around Lilly had recourse to FR quasar measurements conducted by the astronomer Philipp Kronberg from the University of Toronto .
Martin Bernet , a PhD student of Lilly ’s and Miniati’s , studied the relationship between the Faraday Rotation and the redshift of the quasars ’ light for 300 of these FR measurements .
In astronomy , the redshift is used to determine the age and distance of galaxies .
advertisement
The researchers developed a thesis from the statistical distribution of values obtained : “ The stronger , observed rotation of the quasar light with a higher redshift is on a longer path and can be ascribed to the subsequently greater probability of coming into contact with other galaxies ” .
To verify this thesis , the astronomers selected 76 quasars from the original Kronberg sample and , using the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile , observed how many magnesium absorption lines are contained in quasar spectra .
We know from earlier studies that almost every galaxy along a quasar ’s line of sight ( path of the light between quasar and telescope ) displays magnesium absorption .
The researchers were thus able to determine how many galaxies there are between ours and the quasar and ascertain the galaxies ’ magnetic field by comparing the FR values of the line of sight with and without magnesium absorption .
For the magnetic fields of the galaxies , the calculations yielded a value of approximately 10 μGauss , in other words a field that is about a million times weaker than the Earth ’s magnetic field .
This more or less corresponds to the values of our own galaxy , the Milky Way .
The results enabled the researchers to prove that young , distant galaxies also have a strong , large - scale magnetic field .
This at a time when the universe was only a third as old as it is today .
The realization contradicts the popular dynamo theory , according to which magnetic fields build themselves up exponentially over billions of light years through constant reinforcement .
“ A galaxy ’s magnetic field has to develop much more rapidly during its evolution than we previously assumed .
A lasting equilibrium then appears at a relatively early stage ” , explains Lilly .
Magnetic fields slip into the consciousness of astronomers
The scientific community has had doubts about the dynamo theory for some time .
Kronberg also repeatedly expressed misgivings with regard to the existing model during his thirty - year FR measurements .
The proof , however , has been lacking until now .
According to Lilly , the latest issue of “ Nature ” above all reveals the high quality of the VLT measurements and the clear response to the original question that is somewhat rare for astronomy .
advertisement
“ I could imagine that the methodology we recently introduced and the combination of Faraday Rotation measurements and data from telescopes like the VLT might open a new window into the distant universe ” , Lilly speculates .
As the authors point out in the conclusion of the “ Nature ” article , the results should also lead to the reconsideration of the existing astronomical practice , where the magnetic fields are often ignored .
Lilly and his team will continue to peer out of the window that has just opened and probe into the secrets of the magnetic fields .
The researchers have already been granted additional observation time with the telescope .
The next steps towards a more comprehensive understanding of the “ mystery of the magnetic field ” will be to increase the quasar sample and localize the magnetic fields precisely in the galaxies .
The Dynamo Theory
A dynamo converts mechanical energy into magnetic energy .
The dynamo theory is an attempt at explaining the mechanism with which bodies in the sky can develop a magnetic field .
In astronomical objects like planets , stars or galaxies , the dynamo effect occurs if there are turbulent currents and a non-uniform ( differential ) rotation prevails .
This so - called alpha - omega dynamo can generate large - scale magnetic fields – even if the initial field was chaotic .

The video is pretty self explanatory , but here it is for those who can't see it : A man and his wife had been noticing lots of ants on their computer desk but could n't figure out where they were coming from .
It was n't from outside or anywhere else in the house .
Later , the wife tells the husband that the printer was n't working correctly .
He checked out the printer / scanner combo only to find that the ants had turned it into a home .
The video 's pretty good , but what 's he going to do next ?
Throw out the printer / scanner ?
Evict the bugs ?
What would you do ?
Heavy metal pollutants are linked to genetic mutations , stunted growth and declining fertility among small crustaceans in the Parramatta River , the main tributary of Sydney Harbour , new research shows .
The finding adds to mounting evidence that toxic sediments and seaweeds in Sydney Harbour are a deadly diet for many sea creatures .
The new findings , published in the journal , Science of the Total Environment , reveal genetic mutations among crustaceans ( Melita plumulosa ) in the Parramatta River but none among those in the cleaner Hawkesbury River .
Earlier this year , UNSW scientists revealed that copper - contaminated seaweeds in Sydney Harbour were killing 75 percent of the offspring of small crustaceans that feed on a common brown seaweed .
That study showed that the harbour 's seaweeds have the world 's highest levels of copper and lead contamination as a consequence of stormwater run-off , industrial wastewaters and motorised watercraft .
The new study found the mutations and lower growth and fertility persisted through several generations of M. plumulosa in controlled laboratory conditions , suggesting that genetic changes are causing permanent negative impacts .
" The lower fertility and growth rates among the creatures exposed to contaminants is probably a stress response , " says the study 's lead author , UNSW science honours student , Pann Pann Chung .
The crustaceans were randomly sampled from two sites within each river : Homebush Bay South and Duck River in the Parramatta River , and Mooney Mooney and Half Moon Bend in the Hawkesbury .
M. plumulosa is a shrimp - like creature found among rocks and mudflats on shorelines and tide zones , although little is known about its genetic history .
A native to the south - eastern coast of Australia , the amphipod feeds on organic material in sand and sediment .
" These crustaceans are sensitive to heavy metals such as copper , cadmium and zinc and scientists use them as a ' test organisms ' for assessing the toxicity of marine sediments , says Ms Chung .
" They accumulate heavy metals inside their tissues and scientists use them to monitor environmental pollutants . "
Other research has revealed that chronic exposure to metal toxicants is linked to DNA damage in earthworms , periwinkles and some fish species .

Is Condoleeza Rice stupid ?
Has the US Secretary of State got her cassette stuck ?
For a week now she has been reiterating the same phrase “ Russian forces must leave Georgia now ” and for a week now the world has been informed of Georgian war crimes against Russians in Ossetia .
The war crimes happened , the Russians call the shots now , Ms. Rice .
Like it or lump it .
Is Condoleeza Rice stupid ?
Is Condoleeza Rice stupid ?
OK her boss is , we all know that and that ’s why nobody pays any attention to what he says or if they do , it is to have a good laugh at how such an imbecile could supposedly rule the roost in Washington ( when everyone knows it is Cheney and his energy and arms lobbies ) .
So Bush gets a discount , like the uncle that farts at family dinners , like the retarded nephew who belches swearwords after his third litre of Coke , like the simpleton that sits outside the church on Sundays begging for money informing everyone that he is an astronaut on Thursday afternoons .
Is Condoleeza Rice stupid ?
She claims to be a Russian expert but her command of the language was recently exposed as being basic / elementary level on a Russian radio programme , just as her grasp of what is going on in Russia today seems beneath the informed blogger level .
Is Condoleeza Rice stupid ?
How can this female purport to broker events between an evil regime in Tblisi supported by her own evil regime in Washington , and Russia , while not mentioning one single time the war crimes committed by Georgia against Russian peacekeepers and civilians ?
So we come to the conclusion that she is either stupid , or incompetent , or downright evil .
If she did n’t know about Georgia ’s war crimes , when everyone else did , she is incompetent ( as she proved as National Security Advisor during 9/11 ) .
If she knows about the war crimes and fails to mention them , as Secretary of State , she is plain stupid and if she purposefully covers them up , maybe because her own armed forces were involved , then she is one evil piece of work , as many of us suspected all along .
Is Condoleeza Rice stupid ?
Or incompetent ?
Or just plain evil ?

How often do we every go beyond just chatting and emailing ?
Not too often because not everyone lives in the same neighborhood .
Yesterday – the digital highway became reality as we finally met two wonderful people that we had so much in common with .
After 4 months of trying to hook up , it finally became reality when we met Sue from Entrecard and her husband Buck and son Jake .
Sue is the owner , author and artist from soul - to - soul .
And by the way the Bigfoot story was a hoax because he is a live and well living in Illinois ( Jake ) .
Jake is a 16 year old kid , but a gentle giant who has a passion for music like his parents .
He is a very cool and mature kid that any parent would be proud of .
We sat outside all night telling stories , jamming to music and pounding down drinks .
Buck is a music historian and that in it self made my day .
I can count on one hand the people who I met in my life who can go toe to toe with me on music trivia , Buck does have me beat , but what a lot of fun this man is to know and hang out with .
Sue ( Suzy ) is a warm , fun loving lady who really made us feel like family .
Sue is what every person should be like in this crazy world of ours .
We are so thrilled to have made new friends and we look forward to many outings with Sue and Buck .
There ’s one other person I did n’t want to forget .
Rick who is a friend of Sue and Buck showed up later in the day .
Rick is a cool guy who can make anyone laugh .
Rick and I were pounding down shots towards the evening hours and laughing up a storm .
Sue and Buck thank you for making us feel like family !
We look forward to hanging out again very soon !

Did you know that the first headphones were originally created in 1910 and only in 1958 they could be used for industrial and commercial purposes ?
A pair of good headphones is something we almost take for granted these days , especially since there are many different types of headphones available .
But why are they so popular ?
And why there are multiple types of headphones on the market ?
Keep reading this article to find out .
You ’ll discover an impressive list of commercial headphones that are specially built for a certain purpose .
1. Gaming Headphones
These devices usually do n’t need any introduction .
Gaming headphones are designed to be used by amateur and professional computer gamers .
They are comfortable and made from lightweight materials , so that gamers can wear them for many hours without feeling awkward or disturbed .
On top of that , gaming headphones are also equipped with high - quality microphones , so teammates can speak commands and instructions to each other during an intense game .
Some of these products also feature physical buttons for controlling the volume or turning the mic on and off .
One of the most important properties of gaming headphones is comfort , so if your ears start to hurt after just one hour of wearing them , you might need to buy better gaming headphones .
2. Wireless Headphones
Just as the name implies , wireless headphones come with no cords and they are the most portable ones out there .
They are frequently used by travelers or joggers because they are comfortable and practical .
Wireless headphones can be connected to virtually any smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth technology .
The user operates his phone or table to play music , increase or decrease the volume as well as control the main functions of the headphones .
Wireless headphones also eliminate the hassle associated with untangling a cable .
You just have to recharge them from time to time , put them over your ears and you ’re ready to go .
3. Noise - Canceling Headphones
Granted , many headphones , including gaming ones , have noise - canceling properties .
However , some headphones are specially designed to provide an undisturbed listening experience .
They come with microphones that record the surrounding sounds .
Then they create a sound wave opposite to the one recorded which basically cancels it out .
As a result , the surrounding noises such as traffic , voices or other sounds are mostly eliminated , allowing you to enjoy the pure beauty of your own music .
Noise - canceling headphones are some of the most popular out there .
They are frequently used by students , workers , fitness enthusiasts in the gym or gamers .
However , using them in a crowded street can be a bit dangerous because you need to hear cars or other people coming your way , so be mindful of that .
4. DJ and / or Studio Headphones
The headphones used by professional musicians are almost always different from regular headphones used by the rest of the people .
These devices are of a higher quality and they usually have a higher price tag as well .
Why ?
Because they can reproduce crystal - clear sounds in a broader acoustic range .
Studio headphones are used in musical studios , but also by producers who make music on the computer at home .
DJ headphones are more complex because they are usually used on one ear only .
The DJ listens to the music in the headphones with one ear while the other ear listens to the speakers in the room .
This is called beatmatching and it helps a DJ make smooth transitions between tracks .
Most DJ headphones can also twist and swivel on one side while still staying comfortable on the DJ ’s head .
5. Sport Headphones
You can also find sport headphones on the market today .
These are specially designed to be lightweight , comfortable , and made from waterproof materials .
Fitness enthusiasts and professional athletes can use these sport headphones both in the gym and outdoors .
Most sports headphones are resistant to sweat , rain or snow .
At the same time , sport headphones also come with embedded buttons , so you can quickly change the track or adjust the volume without taking the smartphone out of your pocket .
In some cases , sport headphones are shipped with extra earbuds which allow you to use the headphones while swimming .
6. Bass Headphones
These headphones are quite common among teenagers who love deep , groovy bass sounds .
Just as the name implies , the bass headphones are designed to reproduce low sound signals with greater accuracy .
If most headphones have a range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz , bass headphones might start at just 5 Hz or 10 Hz .
Additionally , bass headphones are equipped with other acoustic technologies that emphasize the low musical notes in each song .
You can find out more about bass headphones , disposable headphones , and other types of headphones on beatsbooster.com .
7. Wired Headphones
If you have wireless headphones , why would you want to go back to wired ones ?
This is a good question and the truth is that wired headphones usually provide a much better sound quality whether you ’re gaming or listening to your favorite tunes .
Wired headphones send the sound signals through a cable at a very fast rate of speed .
There ’s no latency and the sound quality is not diminished , even if the cable itself measures several feet in length .
On the other hand , wireless headphones usually rely on Bluetooth technology to send audio signals .
If the headphones are too far away from the smartphone , the sound quality might drop .
That ’s why many people still go for wired headphones , especially since these products can also be much cheaper .
Whether you want to game or make music at home , a wired headset can be a great acoustic companion for you .
Which One Of These Different Types Of Headphones Is Your Favorite ?
As you can see , different types of headphones can be used for different purposes .
Ideally , you would have a pair for each type of activity you do such as jogging , gaming or traveling .
If your budget is smaller now , go for a pair of wired headphones as they can be used for most activities .

Chinese officials have told U.S. President George W. Bush to stay out of other countries ' affairs after he condemned Beijing 's human rights record before heading to the Olympic Games .
U.S. President George W. Bush delivers a speech at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center in Bangkok on Thursday ahead of his visit to Beijing .
( ( Gerald Herbert / Associated Press ) )
" We resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Thursday in a statement on its website that was translated by the Associated Press .
The statement was published hours after Bush criticized China 's approach to freedom and rights of citizens in a speech in Thailand during a three - country tour of Asia before heading to China for Friday 's Olympic opening ceremonies .
" America stands in firm opposition to China 's detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists , " Bush said in Bangkok early Thursday .
" We press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs , but to allow the Chinese people to express theirs . "
China ' puts people first '
Bush said he was n't trying to antagonize China , but called for free press , free assembly and labour rights in China as the only path the U.S. rival can take to reach its full potential .
But China seemed irritated by the comments on the eve of the international sporting event .
" The Chinese government puts people first , and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens ' basic rights and freedom , " Qin said in a statement .
" Chinese citizens have freedom of religion .
These are indisputable facts . "
Qin said there are divergences between China and U.S. , but noted that it is in the common interest of both countries to have a good relationship , and advocated talks on the differing views .
Leading up to the Olympics from Aug. 8 to 24 , Bush has been walking a tightrope , trying to avoid causing China embarrassment for its time in the world limelight , but coming under pressure to use his visit to press China for greater religious tolerance and other freedoms .
Tries to address 2 polar issues
Bush 's speech praised China for market reforms , saying change in the country " will arrive on its own terms , and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions . "
" With this speech , Bush is trying to address two polar issues : easing the controversy created by those who oppose his visit during the Games and simultaneously maintaining America 's strategy with China , " said Yan Xuetong , an expert in U.S. - China relations at Beijing 's prestigious Tsinghua University .
Bush , who arrived in Beijing Thursday night , has said the Games are not the right occasion to push a U.S. political agenda , and he is visiting as a sports fan .
He plans to attend the opening ceremony and several sporting events .
Ahead of the Games , China has rounded up opponents and imposed restrictions on journalists , despite promises to the contrary when it landed the Olympics .
Bush is reportedly the first U.S. president to attend the Olympics on foreign soil .
The president , first lady Laura Bush and their daughter Barbara came off Air Force One together and had a red- carpet greeting from Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and others .
Dedication ceremony
However , several hours later Bush seemed to offer China the olive branch during a dedication ceremony for the U.S. 's new $ 434 million US embassy in Beijing , calling it a symbol of their burgeoning bond .
Bush said the eight - story structure , which is the second - largest U.S. embassy in the world after its diplomatic office in Baghdad , represented the " solid foundation underpinning " relations between the two countries .
" To me it speaks of the importance of our relations with China , " Bush said .
Both his father , former president George H.W. Bush , and former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger were in attendance for the ceremony on Friday morning in China .
China unveiled its own foreign embassy — the biggest in the U.S. — in Washington , D.C. last week .
LAKE JACKSON , Texas --
When Lisa Kelly learned she had leukemia in late 2006 , her doctor advised her to seek urgent care at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .
But the nonprofit hospital refused to accept Mrs. Kelly 's limited insurance .
It asked for $ 105,000 in cash before it would admit her .
Sitting in the hospital 's business office , Mrs. Kelly says she told M.D. Anderson 's representatives that she had some money to pay for treatment , but could n't get all the cash they asked for that day .

There 's more than a little skepticism surrounding the new Martin Jetpack .
Promising a new era of ultralight flight , many of the claims ( altitude capabilities and safety , especially ) sound too good to be true .
Before we took our test flight , we asked Glenn Martin , inventor , some of the tougher questions that we had n't seen asked anywhere else .
Being a good sport , he actually answered them :
What 's with all the videos showing people just a few feet from the ground ?
Can this thing actually go higher or not ?
Have you ever had an accident ?
OK , what 's it feel like to fly ?

Our constitution is now ‘ more honored in the breach than in the observance . ’
We are on the brink of war with a third country in the Middle East with the first two going very badly .
The Iraq war has cost over a trillion dollars and rising .
The economy is in tatters , teetering on collapse .
We have gone from a 2001 reputation as the most beloved country in the world to a 2008 reputation as the most despised .
Our President is hated the world over , massively distrusted even at home .
Tens of thousands of our country - men are dead from the wars and the events , including the terrible pollution , of 911 .
We cannot freely move about , gas prices soar , and we await another , and far worse , attack .
The government pumps out the frenzy and paranoia about terrorism .
The world has become seriously unhinged .
We stand at the brink of terrible and catastrophic change .
I will get to many more aspects of that .
But first , a few of the thousands of questions about 911 :
To my dear friends in the sangha ,
Today , I call to you for help .
I fear that I have gone mad .
I am convinced that the United States government is responsible for the attacks of 9/11 .
Please help me .
I have contacted many fellow sangha members , and received the ice of no response .
I am abandoned by my sangha in my time of need .
My life has become meaningless in light of my radically changed world outlook .
My days are spent in anxiety , my nights without sleep .
I have done significant research on the matter and each point only reinforces my certainty .
I have , in fact , encountered nothing to make me doubt this in the slightest .
I have put together the following list of questions .
No one is denying the data in the following .
The list could easily be far longer , into the thousands of questions .
Why was Max Cleland , the only person proved to have no conflict of interest , removed from the 911 commission ?
Why did he say , ‘ Bush is scamming the American people …it ’s disgusting .
The American people are being cheated .
We should n’t be making deals .
If somebody wants to deal , we should issue subpoenas .
That ’s the deal . ’
Why did Bush / Cheney testify in secret , allow only two members of the 911 commission , limit the meeting to one hour , disallow a recording , refuse to take an oath , and insist on testifying together ?
Why did it take 441 days to convene the 911 commission and require intensive political pressure from the 911 spouses ( family steering committee ) to get the commission convened ?
Why was Henry Kissinger taken off the commission only after the family steering committee pointed out his business ties to the Bin Laden family ?
Why did the commission refuse a popular choice from the family steering committee to replace Cleland ?
Why was Bob Kerry , an ultra - hawk neo-con , accused by military witnesses of the war crime of ordering the slaughter of 21 unarmed women and children , a man with significant oil and defense ties , chosen to replace Cleland ?
Why was the commission composed principally of White House staff and entirely of people with significant oil and defense connections ?
Why did they answer fewer than 20 % of the family steering committee ’s questions ?

Appeal of the national coordination of action committees for a New Anti-capitalist Party
The “ new anti-capitalist party ” proposed by the LCR in France had its first national meeting on the 28th and 29th June in St Denis near Paris .
About 1000 people were present including 800 delegates from local committees .
After a first session of contributions from local committees , the gathering split up into workshops on different themes such as ecology , feminism , internationalism , work in local neighbourhoods , in work places , with the sans papiers ...
The meeting ended with the creation of a national coordinating committee to prepare a further national meeting in the autumn and the adoption of a statement .
We will carry further reports on this meeting and the process of creating the new party but we publish here the statement adopted .
We are thousands of workers , men and women , from the cities and the countryside , with or without employment , with or without papers , young people , pensioners , precarious workers , activists from political organisations , trade - unions , associations , new and old , who are in the process of making this project a reality .
Today there are more than 300 committees and the dynamic is getting stronger .
This is a result of people becoming conscious : we can no longer put up with a globalised capitalist system which is leading the world to disaster !
We now find ourselves in an economic and financial crisis , an energy crisis , a food crisis , whose consequences no one can predict .
More than ever , this system is making the search for profit the centre of its decisions , treating the lives of millions of human beings with contempt .
Fundamental ecological equilibriums are threatened .
Because it is the source of the problem , capitalism , like all productivist systems , is unable to provide a solution to it .
In a world of greater and greater inequalities , hunger riots are spreading , as a consequence of the policies of the great imperialist powers , the institutions that serve them ( the IMF , the WTO … ) and of shameful speculation on essential commodities .
The war “ without limits ” decreed by Bush and his allies , including France , is spreading its horrors throughout the world .
Here in France , Sarkozy and the MEDEF [ French employers ’ organisation ] are multiplying attacks which express the arrogance of the powerful .
Seldom have right - wing policies been so openly aggressive towards the vast majority of the population .
Seldom have the owners of wealth , the shareholders , and the employers shown themselves to be so avid for profits , with contempt for the elementary wellbeing of the people .
Yes , everywhere people are exasperated by the attacks on the gains working people have made , on solidarity , on public services , by the difficulty of “ making ends meet ” , by the worsening of housing and living conditions , by racism and discriminations , by law and order policies …
We must not throw away the potential of this exasperation by letting ourselves be taken in by “ social dialogue ” with the government , by division , by one - day strikes in disorder , one sector after another .
Here and now , we can react !
Action “ all together ” , determined and unitary , the generalisation of the struggles and the strikes that exist , that is what is needed to defeat the government and its counter - reforms !
To push things in this direction , it is necessary to regroup our forces in a party which does not give up anything , which does not abandon anyone .
It is not possible to unite in the same party those who want to finish with capitalism and those who put up with it .
It is not possible to have in the same government those who defend the rights of the workers and those who defend the power of shareholders , those who want to break with liberal policies and those who put them into practice , those who want to build a Europe of the workers and the most dedicated artisans of a Europe of free competition and profit .
That is why we want a party completely independent of the Socialist Party , a party which defends to the end the interests of all the exploited .
We call on you to build , all together , a Left which does not give up , a fighting , anti-capitalist , internationalist , anti-racist , ecologist , feminist Left , a Left that is revolted by all forms of discrimination .
To change the world , we need a party which fights to the end against the system , for the revolutionary transformation of society .
The Left that we want must be organized on an international , and in particular European , scale .
It must be present in elections , without ever forgetting that it is the social , cultural and ecological mobilisations that will impose change .
Bearing in mind past experiences , we will work out together , by taking the time to discuss , a new democratic socialist perspective for the 21st century .
We do not have a model , especially not the regimes of the last century that claimed to be “ communist ” , but we have objectives .
To put an end to the dictatorship that capital imposes on the economy and the entire society , to build the broadest democracy that humanity has ever known , where the “ invisible hand of the market ” will be replaced by collective decisions .
There are more and more of us who want to meet this challenge .
Individuals , groups of activists , revolutionary political currents , libertarians , communists , socialists , ecologists , anti-liberals , let us keep on uniting ! …
In their village , their neighbourhood , their workplace , their place of study , each and every one can and must bring , at their own speed , their contribution to the building of this pluralist and democratic instrument .
Success is within our grasp .
Let us go forward !
St Denis , Sunday June 29 , 2008 .

Building a new anti-capitalist party - A progress report to the LCR 's national leadership
By Ingrid Hayes
Following on the meeting of the National Leadership ( DN ) of the LCR over the weekend of May 17 - 18 , some elements on the progress of the process of building the new anti-capitalist party ( NPA )
On what information are these elements based ?
on information coming directly from towns and departments , synthesized each week in an inventory of the situation sent out in the national circular of the LCR ;
on a questionnaire that was filled out by the members of the DN concerning the NPA committees in their department .
1 . How many committees are there ?
This information is still partial but gives us a fairly reliable estimate of the number of committees : at the present time we can calculate that there exist a minimum of 250 committees already established and active , and at least a hundred in the process of being set up .
Moreover , in a series of cities and departments , activity around the NPA has started but is not yet sufficiently advanced for us to consider that a committee is being set up .
In all , activity is under way in more than 80 departments [ out of 95 in Metropolitan France ] .
2 . What form do they take ?
a . In general they are set up on a geographical basis .
The great majority of the committees already existing or in the process of being set up are established on a geographical basis .
There also exist also several dozen youth committees , often organised around universities or high schools .
On the other hand , committees based on industries or workplaces are still very few , which undoubtedly reflects the difficulty of this work .
The majority of the industrial committees are centred on the health sector , some are organised by rail workers or teachers and one functions in the Paris region with workers from 12 enterprises of the graphic industries .
b. The size of the committees .
It varies , between committees which function through well - attended general meetings based on a town or a department and others which are very small ( less than 10 people )
3 . Who is involved ?
a . On the number of people involved .
It is still difficult to estimate .
It is certain that several thousand people who are not members of the LCR are involved , and that they are the majority in the process .
Furthermore , in certain cases ( more than 15 per cent ) there was no branch of the Ligue before the NPA committee was set up .
So although the existence of a branch of the LCR is an important criterion , it is not always a necessary precondition .
b. The composition of the membership
At the present stage , it is not yet possible to give elements of information in terms of social composition and age .
We will have to follow this up .
The new members for the NPA are often trade unionists , members of local or national associations , former members of political parties , but for the majority it is their first experience of being involved in an organized structure .
In any case we can see great political heterogeneity , since the process is brining together ex-members of various parties of the left and far - left , former supporters of Jose Bove ’s presidential campaign , radical ecologists , libertarians .
c. The ratio of women to men
According to a calculation carried out on a sample of approximately 160 committees , the numerical relationship between women and men is not up to our objective : there are approximately 35 per cent women .
Having said that , this ratio is comparable with that which exists within the LCR .
It is nevertheless an important question to work on , because it concerns an essential aspect of the kind of society that we want to build , it is a condition for women to be able to play a full part and for the concerns and the demands of women to be taken up and defended by the future organization .
4 . The diversity of rhythms
Seventeen pet cent of the committees were established before March and more than 70 per cent in March - April , without taking into account the committees that are in the course of being established .
That confirms the desynchronization that we have noticed since the beginning of the process , but it is actually quite limited , since work basically started after the municipal elections .
We should nevertheless note that a series of areas and departments are very much in advance of the rest : the Haut - Rhin department around Mulhouse , Aquitaine ( in particular Gironde and the Pyrenees - Atlantiques ) , Brittany , Franche - Comte , the city of Paris , Midi-Pyrenees ( in particular Tarn and the Toulouse area of Toulouse ) , the Nord / Pas - de - Calais region , Upper Normandy ( Le Havre and the Rouen conurbation ) and the Bouches - du - Rhone [ the area around Marseilles ] .
Although some towns and departments are reporting difficulties in launching the process , this only represents a small minority , to which we have to give help .
In the vast majority of cases , it is enthusiasm which prevails , and even a certain astonishment on seeing the extent of the interest and dynamics provoked by the project .
In conclusion
The first phase of the process is an indisputable success : the interest and the dynamics are there , the political delimitations defined by the appeal launched at the LCR congress already seem to be collectively accepted , in particular as regards independence with respect to the Socialist Party .
The discussions cover every possible subject , on the need to organise as a party , on democracy and internal functioning , on the link with mobilizations , on trade - union intervention , on how to address a broad audience , on strategic and programmatic questions ; and the activity of the committees themselves has really started .
It remains to amplify this phase in places where things are less advanced , but especially to pass on to the second phase , of the stabilization of the committees in terms of participation and commitment .
In general there exists a solid core made up of members of the Ligue and of non-members , the latter taking their share of responsibilities for the political and organisational aspects of the process ( this is a decisive element , in particular for the second phase ) , but we sometimes see , beyond this core , that there is some turnover .
We have to make sure that the party that is being built becomes a place that everyone feels is theirs , which means that we have to have more thorough collective discussions on the party , its functioning , its programme , but also that we have to strengthen its activity , anchored in local and national mobilisations .

Could this be the new iPhone ?
Tucked away inside both Mac OS X 10.5.3 ( released today ) and the newest iPhone SDK ( also new today ) you 'll find this icon , presumably ready to be deployed when the new iPhone shows up .
The main difference is the bezel .
It 's much narrower and also squarer - looking .
The whole thing is more like the current iPod Touch than the iPhone .
Below you can see an animated gif which morphs between the old and new icons , uploaded to the MacRumors forum thread by frijole .
You 'll also see a fairly convincing photograph of the new iPhone , which appears very similar to this new icon .

Or , if you do n't have the SDK , but have already updated your Mac , at
/ System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/
We would have expected this to turn up in an iTunes update on the day of the new iPhone 's release , but we guess even Apple makes mistakes .

Russia is so much better at war
August 10 , 2008 by twitterpaters

No wonder Kissinger looks so grumpy in this photo :
Michael Goulding / Orange County Register / MCT via McClatchy
From The Guardian on August 10 , 2008 :
Moscow appears to have calculated that the west , tied up in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and dependent on Russia for oil and gas , will do nothing to support Georgia beyond expressing impotent concern .
It is as if they ’ve been waiting patiently .
The Guardian reports on August 11 , 2008 :
In a series of media interviews , [ Georgian President ] Saakashvili sought to bring the United States fully behind him .
After speaking to Bush by phone , he told Germany ’s Rhein - Zeitung newspaper : “ [ Bush ] understands that it ’s not really about Georgia but in a certain sense it ’s also an aggression against America .
The Russians want the whole of Georgia .
The Russians need control over energy routes from central Asia and the Caspian Sea .
In addition , they want to get rid of us , they want regime change .
Every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of , ” he was quoted as saying .
From Bloomberg on August 10 , 2008 , another way to put it would be :
The conflict could endanger U.S. aspirations to secure an emerging energy corridor linking Central Asia to Europe and deals a blow to its plans for bringing the former Soviet republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ’s orbit .
… Georgia is a key link in a U.S. - backed “ southern energy corridor ” that connects the Caspian Sea region with world markets , bypassing Russia .
The BP Plc- led Baku - Tbilisi -Ceyhan oil pipeline to Turkey runs about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) south of the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali .
Another way to look at it :
The first U.S. aid came under the rubric of the Georgia Train and Equip Program ( ostensibly to counter alleged Al Qaeda influence in the Pankisi Gorge ) ; then , under the Sustainment and Stability Operations Program .
Georgia returned the favor , committing thousands of troops to the multi-national coalition in Iraq .
Last fall , the Georgians doubled their contingent , making them the third - largest contributor to the coalition .
Not bad for a nation of 4.6 million people .
Half of Georgia ’s 2,000 troops in Iraq plan to leave the country by Monday to join the fight against separatists in the breakaway province of South Ossetia , with the rest following as soon as possible , their commander said .
“ First of all we need to remove 1,000 guys from here within 96 hours , after that the rest of the guys , ” Colonel Bondo Maisuradze told The Times this morning .
“ The US will provide us with the transportation , ” he added .
As McClatchy notes on August 9 , 2008 , Russia knows how to wage a war :
WASHINGTON — Even as it accuses Russia of using “ disproportionate ” force in the conflict over Georgia ’s rebel South Ossetia province , the United States find itself with few diplomatic or military options to deter Moscow ’s ferocious air and ground assault .
In fact , most of the key cards , including the power to veto any United Nations [ action ] , were held by Russia …
Update : a map of the region dated August 12 , 2008 from the BBC :
Update : via The Guardian on August 11 , 2008 :
The Georgian authorities said the town of Gori , 40 miles north of Tbilisi , had , in effect , fallen to the Russians , who were also advancing from the breakaway province of Abkhazia in the west into territory previously under Georgian control .
“ The Georgian army is retreating to defend the capital .
The government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of Georgia and further loss of life , ” said the Georgian government .
and the Associated Press on August 11 , 2008 :
The Georgian president said Russia had sent 20,000 troops and 500 tanks into Georgia .
He said Russian warplanes were bombing roads and bridges , destroying radar systems and targeting Tbilisi ’s civilian airport .
One Russian bombing raid struck the Tbilisi airport area only a half - hour before EU envoys arrived , he said .
Another hit near key Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan oil pipeline , which carries Caspian crude to the West .
No supply interruptions have been reported .
and McClatchy on August 11 , 2008 :
Russian troops were reported in control of Georgia ’s main east - west highway outside the central Georgian town of Gori .
In the west , they seized Georgia ’s main port at Poti , according to the U.S. State Department , and occupied a Georgian military base .
In the north , they forced Georgian troops from the disputed city of Tskhinvali .
Everywhere , Russian jets had complete dominion of the skies , from which they bombed and strafed retreating Georgians at will .
Update : Via McClatchy on August 12 , 2008 :
For three days , Russian jets and bombers have unleashed a massive aerial campaign against Georgian forces that , more than anything , dramatically changed the war ’s direction .
and via the Guardian on August 12 , 2008 :
“ We do not yet have a peace deal , we have a provisional cessation of hostilities , but this is significant progress , ” Sarkozy said after several hours of talks with Medvedev in Moscow and before taking the terms to Saakashvili in Tbilisi .
The key Russian demands are that the Georgian leader pledges , in an agreement that is signed and legally binding , to abjure all use of force in his country in any attempt to resolve the territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia ; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint “ peacekeeping ” contingent there with Russian and local Ossetian forces .
Medvedev also insisted that the populations of the two breakaway regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia , prefiguring a possible annexation by Moscow that would enfeeble and diminish Georgia and leave Saakashvili looking crushed .
If Saakashvili balked at the tough terms from Moscow , Sergei Lavrov , the Russian foreign minister , said : “ We will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous Georgian aggression . ”

States have generally recognized marriages of other states .
Before 1967 , some states refused to recognize interracial marriage , the US Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia ended this as a matter of Equal Protection .
A current example would be a person marrying a first cousin in a state where that was legal , another state ( like West Virginia ) that makes such a marriage illegal would be able to not recognize the marriage on public policy grounds .
It can get more complicated than this , and state decisions are all over the map when deciding when to recognize for what purpose .
Congress has power to affect the procedural aspects of full faith and credit , like how in one state I can prove and enforce a judgment for damages or specific performance from a lawsuit in another state , that sort of thing .
It can't by statute affect the basic content of the clause , this requires a constitutional amendment .
Full faith and credit is geared toward judicial findings and proceedings .
A marriage is more of a contract , and the general rule is that a state can refuse to honor a contract if it violates some public policy of a state .

OK , it 's semi-official .
Nicholas Negroponte is thinking out loud , where we can hear him , about running only XP on the XO .
What will Negroponte say now ?
" Eventually Windows might be the sole operating system , and Sugar would be educational software running on top of it . "
Negroponte said he was mainly concerned with putting as many laptops as possible in children 's hands .
Notice the words " eventually " and " might " .
The deal is not done , or it appears even under serious discussion with Microsoft , so it is n't fully official yet .
Negroponte is famous for shooting off his mouth like this .
But if he means it , I 'm going to start the fork of Sugar myself .
I have written about this before .
Negroponte is attempting to optimize on only one variable out of the full equation , and that only in the short term .
Another major variable is source code availability for student programmers .
Yes for Linux and Open Source generally , no for Windows .
Then there is cost , which is necessarily higher for Windows , because it requires more hardware than Linux .
Language support is possible for any community in Linux , but in Windows it depends on the good will of Microsoft , or rather the bottom line market analysis results that Microsoft works from .
Volunteer development time comes from Free / Open Source practitioners for Linux and nobody for Windows .
Oh , sure , a lot of Free / Open Source apps run on Windows , but Microsoft would n't let you work on their OS code for free if you wanted to .
The biggest one is failing to put any value on getting laptops to children in prosperous countries , in order to build up a constituency for the XO , and apply it to the question of foreign aid , in addition to making money to fund further development .
" Men of one idea , like a hen with one chick , and that a duckling .
" -- Henry David Thoreau
He lamented that an overriding insistence on open - source had hampered the XOs , saying Sugar " grew amorphously " and " did n't have a software architect who did it in a crisp way . "
A Flash of reality
For instance , the laptops do not support Flash animation , widely used on the Web .
Apparently he has n't read , or has n't understood , The Cathedral and the Bazaar , by Eric Raymond .
And he apparently is unclear on the difference between R and D in R&D .
If you know what you are doing , and can plan it in advance , it 's big - D Development .
And if you do n't know what you are doing in advance , it 's big -R Research .
There is no precedent for the XO laptop .
Of course it can't be architected crisply ahead of time .
What was he doing all those years at the Media Lab if he does n't know this ?
Or should I be afraid to ask that question ?
Nonsense .
Any user can install Flash on an XO .
It is illegal to ship Flash with the XO , absent a license from Adobe .
Users have to install the free download instead , giving Adobe a chance to get them to its Web site .
XOs come with the Free Software Gnash player , which plays a subset of Flash , because Abode wo n't give out the information to permit the community to develop their own Flash players , optimized for the various new computer architectures out in the real world .
( I ca n't get Flash for the 64 - bit dual - core processor in the laptop I 'm writing this on , but that 's the same whether you are running Windows , Mac OS , or Linux .
There is no 64 - bit Flash . )
" There are several examples like that , that we have to address without worrying about the fundamentalism in some of the open - source community , " he said .
" One can be an open - source advocate without being an open - source fundamentalist . "
Oh ?
We somehow ran away with your project that you were in charge of ?
Is that because you never talk to the workers ?
And is that because we would have quit and forked Sugar if you had told us this before ?
OLPC is an education project , not a laptop project .
And the purpose of education in the OLPC project is to put an end to poverty .
So the economics of the project matter .
You have to pay attention to where the money comes from and goes to , both .
It has been estimated that aid to African nations has amounted to more than a trillion dollars in the last century , and that theft of government assets in these countries has also reached a trillion dollars or more .
Microsoft 's monopoly position in the industry is the issue here .
The children of the developing nations can have software freedoms and no-cost software , or can become Microserfs , having to pay an annual tax to Microsoft for software updates to have the privilege of using their own computers .
It would cost developing nations many billions of dollars annually to buy proprietary software to match what the children can access for free in Linux .
Many times more than the cost of the computers .
I have run the numbers .
For casual users , there may be enough software bundled with the system , but for power users and secondary school students needing the latest software technology in their textbooks , the ratio can easily reach 10 to 1 on conventional laptops , and even more on XOs .
Which then is better , a slower rollout of a more effective technology , or a blitz by the monopoly power ?
One does n't have to be a Fundamentalist to answer either way , but one does have to be clear on the criteria used .
Are we primarily trying to benefit the poor of the world in this program , or the already rich ?
The rich will have plenty of opportunities to get richer by selling to the no-longer - poor if we aim mainly to support the poor , but helping Microsoft maintain its dominance will cost lives , not just treasure .
A reason for empty chairs
Besides rethinking the laptop 's technology , Negroponte wants to get OLPC moving more efficiently .
Ridiculous .
OLPC is the most productive hardware and software development project I have ever seen .
The only reason to complain about selling more than half a million units in less than half a year is if you believe the fantasies in last year 's sales projections .
Negroponte has had to admit that he did n't understand the difference between a handshake from a head of state and a signed purchase order .
His problem has been believing his own marketing hype .
Really .
More than a million units a year run rate so far , which extrapolates to , oh , only a quarter billion dollars or so for the first year .
That would be remarkable for a for - profit startup , and is unheard of for a non-profit .
An executive - search firm has been looking for a chief executive for the group for more than a year .
When you can't find a CEO in over a year , that should tell you something about yourself .
Well , not something specific .
It should tell you that there is something important that you need to know about yourself , but you do n't .
So perhaps you should ask .

From the Fed : The July 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
In the current survey , large net fractions of domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months .
In particular , the net fractions of banks that had tightened credit standards on consumer loans increased notably relative to the April survey .
On net , considerable fractions of foreign institutions also had tightened their credit standards and terms on loans to businesses over the past three months , although these fractions were generally smaller than those reported in the April survey .
Large net fractions of domestic and foreign respondents expected their banks to tighten credit standards on all major loan categories in the second half of this year , and smaller , though substantial , net fractions of respondents expected their banks to tighten standards in the first half of 2009 .

Of particular interest is the increase in tighter lending standards for Commercial Real Estate ( CRE ) loans .
This graph compares investment in non-residential structure with the Fed 's loan survey results for lending standards ( inverted ) and CRE loan demand .
Note that any reading below zero for loan demand means less demand than the previous quarter , but the good news is demand in July was n't falling quite as fast as in April !
This is strong evidence of an imminent slump in CRE investment .

Things to Know About Python Super [ 1 of 3 ]
by Michele Simionato
August 12 , 2008
Summary
super is perhaps the trickiest Python construct : this series aims to unveil its secrets
Advertisement
Foreword I begun programming with Python in 2002 , just after the release of Python 2.2 .
That release was a major overhaul of the language : new - style classes were introduced , the way inheritance worked changed and the builtin super was introduced .
Therefore , you may correctly say that I have worked with super right from the beginning ; still , I never liked it and over the years I have discovered more and more of its dark corners .
In 2004 I decided to write a comprehensive paper documenting super pitfalls and traps , with the goal of publishing it on the Python web site , just as I had published my essay on multiple inheritance and the Method Resolution Order .
With time the paper grew longer and longer but I never had the feeling that I had covered everything I needed to say : moreover I have a full time job , so I never had the time to fully revise the paper as a whole .
As a consequence , four years have passed and the paper is still in draft status .
This is a pity , since it documents issues that people encounter and that regularly come out on the Python newsgroups and forums .
Keeping the draft sitting on my hard disk is doing a disservice to the community .
Still , I lack to time to finish it properly .
To come out from the impasse , I decided to split the long paper in a series of short blog posts , which I do have the time to review properly .
Moreover people are free to post comments and corrections in case I am making mistakes ( speaking about super this is always possible ) .
Once I finish the series , I may integrate the corrections , put it together again and possibly publish it as whole on the Python website .
In other words , in order to finish the task , I am trying the strategies of divide et conquer and release early , release often .
We will see how it goes .
Introduction super is a Python built - in , first introduced in Python 2.2 and slightly improved and fixed in later versions , which is often misunderstood by the average Python programmer .
One of the reasons for that is the poor documentation of super : at the time of this writing ( August 2008 ) the documentation is incomplete and in some parts misleading and even wrong .
For instance , the standard documentation ( even for the new 2.6 version http://docs.python.org/dev/library/functions.html#super) still says : super ( type [ , object - or - type ] )
Return the superclass of type .
If the second argument is omitted the super object returned is unbound .
If the second argument is an object , isinstance ( obj , type ) must be true .
If the second argument is a type , issubclass ( type2 , type ) must be true . super ( ) only works for new - style classes .
[ UPDATE : the final version of Python 2.6 has a better documentation for super , as a direct consequence of this post ; ) ] .
The first sentence is just plain wrong : super does not return the superclass .
There is no such a thing as the superclass in a Multiple Inheritance ( MI ) world .
Also , the sentence about unbound is misleading , since it may easily lead the programmer to think about bound and unbound methods , whereas it has nothing to do with that concept .
IMNSHO super is one of the most tricky and surprising Python constructs , and we absolutely need a document to shed light on its secrets .
The present paper is a first step in this direction : it aims to tell you the truth about super .
At least the amount of truth I have discovered with my experimentations , which is certainly not the whole truth ;)
A fair warning is in order here : this document is aimed at expert Pythonistas .
It assumes you are familiar with new style classes and the Method Resolution Order ( MRO ) ; moreover a good understanding of descriptors would be extremely useful .
Some parts also require good familiarity with metaclasses .
All in all , this paper is not for the faint of heart ;)
There is no superclass in a MI world Readers familiar will single inheritance languages , such as Java or Smalltalk , will have a clear concept of superclass in mind .
This concept , however , has no useful meaning in Python or in other multiple inheritance languages .
I became convinced of this fact after a discussion with Bjorn Pettersen and Alex Martelli on comp.lang .
python in May 2003 ( at that time I was mistakenly thinking that one could define a superclass concept in Python ) .
Consider this example from that discussion : +-----+ | T | |a = 0 | +-----+ / \ / \ +-------+ +-------+ | A | | B | | | | a = 2 | +-------+
+-------+ \ / \ / +-----+ | C | +-----+ : : instantiation c >>> class T ( object ) : ... a = 0 >>> class A ( T ) : ... pass >>> class B ( T ) : ... a = 2 >>> class C( A , B ) : ... pass >>> c = C ( )
What is the superclass of C ?
There are two direct superclasses ( i.e. bases ) of C : A and B .
A comes before B , so one would naturally think that the superclass of C is A .
However , A inherits its attribute a from T with value a=0 : if super ( C , c ) was returning the superclass of C , then super ( C , c ) . a would return 0 .
This is NOT what happens .
Instead , super ( C , c ) . a walks trought the method resolution order of the class of c ( i.e. C ) and retrieves the attribute from the first class above C which defines it .
In this example the MRO of C is [ C , A , B , T , object ] , so B is the first class above C which defines a and super ( C , c ) . a correctly returns the value 2 , not 0 : >>> super ( C , c ) .a 2
You may call A the superclass of C , but this is not a useful concept since the methods are resolved by looking at the classes in the MRO of C , and not by looking at the classes in the MRO of A ( which in this case is [ A , T , object ] and does not contain B ) .
The whole MRO is needed , not just the first superclass .
So , using the word superclass in the standard docs is misleading and should be avoided altogether .
Bound and unbound ( super ) methods Having established that super cannot return the mythical superclass , we may ask ourselves what the hell it is returning ;)
The truth is that super returns proxy objects .
Informally speaking , a proxy is an object with the ability to dispatch to methods of other objects via delegation .
Technically , super is a class overriding the __getattribute__ method .
Instances of super are proxy objects providing access to the methods in the MRO .
The dispatch is done in such a way that super ( cls , instance - or - subclass ) .
method ( *args , ** kw ) corresponds more or less to right - method - in - the - MRO - applied - to ( instance - or - subclass , *args , **kw )
There is a caveat at this point : the second argument can be an instance of the first argument , or a subclass of it .
In the first case we expect a bound method to be returned and in the second case and unbound method to be returned .
This is true in recent versions of Python : for instance , in this example >>> class B ( object ) : ... def __repr__(self ) : ... return " < instance of %s > " % self.__class__.__name__ >>> class C( B ) : ... pass >>> class D ( C ) : ... pass >>> d = D ( ) you get >>> print super( C , d ) .__repr__ < bound method D.__repr__ of < instance of D >> and >>> print super( C , D ) .__repr__ < unbound method D.__repr__ >
However , if you are still using Python 2.2 ( there are unlucky people forced to use old versions ) your should be aware that super had a bug and super ( < class > , < subclass > ) .
method returned a bound method , not an unbound one : >> print super( C , D ) .__repr__ # in Python 2.2 < bound method D.__repr__ of < class ' __main__.D' >>
That means that in Python 2.2 you get : >> print super( C , D ) .__repr__ ( ) # in Python 2.2 < instance of type >
D , seen as an instance of the ( meta ) class type , is being passed as first argument to __repr__ .
This has been fixed in Python 2.3+ , where you correctly get a TypeError : >>> print super( C , D ) .__repr__ ( ) # the same as B.__repr__ ( )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : unbound method __repr__ ( ) must be called with D instance as first argument ( got nothing instead )
The point is subtle , but usually one does not see problems since typically super is invoked on instances , not on subclasses , and in this case it works correctly in all Python versions : >>> print super( C , d ) .__repr__( ) < instance of D >
When I was using Python 2.2 , due to the bug just discussed , and due to the super docstring >>> print super.__doc__ super ( type ) -> unbound super object super ( type , obj ) -> bound super object ; requires isinstance ( obj , type ) super ( type , type2 ) -> bound super object ; requires issubclass ( type2 , type ) Typical use to call a cooperative superclass method : class C( B ) : def meth ( self , arg ) : super ( C , self ) .
meth ( arg )
I got the impression that in order to get unbound methods I needed to use the unbound super object .
This is actually untrue .
To understand how bound / unbound methods work we need to talk about descriptors .
super and descriptors Descriptors ( more properly I should speak of the descriptor protocol ) were introduced in Python 2.2 by Guido van Rossum .
Their primary motivation was technical , since they were needed to implement the new - style object system .
Descriptors were also used to introduce new standard concepts in Python , such as classmethods , staticmethods and properties .
Moreover , according to the traditional transparency policy of Python , descriptors were exposed to the application programmer , giving him / her the freedom to write custom descriptors .
Any serious Python programmer should have a look at descriptors : luckily they are now very well documented ( which was not the case when I first studied them :-/) thanks to the beautiful essay of Raimond Hettinger .
You should read it before continuing this article , since it explains all the details .
However , for the sake of our discussion of super , it is enough to say that a descriptor class is just a regular new - style class which implements a .__get__ method with signature __get__ ( self , obj , objtyp=None ) .
A descriptor object is just an instance of a descriptor class .
Descriptor objects are intended to be used as attributes ( hence their complete name attribute descriptors ) .
Suppose that descr is a given descriptor object used as attribute of a given class C .
Then the syntax C.descr is actually interpreted by Python as a call to descr.__get__( None , C ) , whereas the same syntax for an instance of C corresponds to a call to descr.__get__ ( c , type ( c ) ) .
Since the combination of descriptors and super is so tricky , the core developers got it wrong in different versions of Python .
For instance , in Python 2.2 the only way to get the unboud method __repr__ is via the descriptor API : >> super ( C , d).__repr__.__get__( None , D ) # Python 2.2 < unbound method D.__repr__ >
You may check that it works correctly : >> print _( d ) < instance of D > In Python 2.3 one can get the unbond method by using the super ( cls , subcls ) syntax , but the syntax super ( C , d).__repr__.__get__( None , D ) also works ; in Python 2.4 + instead the same syntax returns a bound method , not an unbound one : >>> super ( C , d).__repr__.__get__( None , D ) # in Python 2.4 + < bound method D.__repr__ of < instance of D >>
The core developers changed the behavior again , making my life difficult while I was writing this paper :-/
I cannot trace the history of the bugs of super here , but if you are using an old version of Python and you find something weird with super , I advice you to have a look at the Python bug tracker before thinking you are doing something wrong .
In this case , to be correct , the change is not in super , but in the descriptor implementation .
In Python 2.2-2.3 you could get an unbound method from a bound one as follows : >> d.__repr__.__get__( None , D ) # in Python 2.2-2.3 < unbound method D.__repr__ >
In Python 2.4 that does not work anymore : >>> d.__repr__.__get__( None , D ) # in Python 2.4 + < bound method D.__repr__ of < instance of D >>
Still , you can get the unbound method by passing for the underlying function first : >>> d.__repr__.im_func.__get__( None , D ) # in Python 2.4 + < unbound method D.__repr__ >

“ I ’ve never even met the man , never spoken to him , ” Limbaugh said .
“ I ’m sure there are things about him I ’d like if we meet .
This is n’t personal . ”
He then delivered a litany of the presumptive nominee ’s personal failings  too old , too intense , too opportunistic , too liberal .
But , he assured me , he would be with McCain in the fall .
“ It ’s like the Super Bowl , ” he told me .
“ If your team is n’t in it , you root for the team you hate less .
That ’s McCain . ”
It already seemed , when I made my visit , that McCain ’s opponent might well be Senator Obama , and I was curious to know how Limbaugh planned to take on America ’s first African - American major - party nominee .
“ I ’ll approach Obama with fearless honesty , ” said Limbaugh , who speaks of himself in heroic terms on air and off .
“ He ’s a liberal .
I oppose liberals .
That ’s all that ’s involved here . ”
I asked if he had any specific tactics in mind .
“ I have n’t yet figured that out exactly , ” he said .
“ You know , I ’ve had a problem with substance abuse .
I do n’t deal with the future anymore .
I take things one day at a time . ”
In this case , it took two .
I was back in New York , listening to the radio , when I heard Limbaugh say : “ Ladies and gentlemen , I had a conversation with a friend Wednesday afternoon after the program , and he said , ‘ Nobody ’s criticizing Obama .
How are you going to do this ?
How are you going to handle criticizing the first black American to run for president ? ’
I said : ‘ I ’m going to do it the way I always do it .
First , at the top of the list , I ’m going to do it fearlessly .
I ’m not going to bow to political correctness .
I ’m going to do it with humor .
I ’m going to focus on the issues .
I ’m going to react to what he says .
Simple .
I ’m going to do it just like it were any other case  he ’s a man , right ?
He ’s a liberal .
How do I criticize liberals ?
I criticize them . ’
But I have devised , ladies and gentlemen , an even more creative way of criticizing Obama .
I have , just this morning , named a new position here on the staff that is the Official Obama Criticizer .
The E.I.B. Network now has an Official Obama Criticizer .
He is Bo Snerdly . ”
Snerdly introduced himself as an “ African - American - in - good - standing - and - certified - black - enough - to - criticize - Obama guy , ” and declared that he was speaking , “ on behalf of our E.I.B. brothers and sisters in the hood . ”
The bit was typical Limbaugh  confrontational , deliberately insensitive and funny .
It was also a declaration of independence .
Whatever special courtesies John McCain might plan to extend to Barack Obama , Limbaugh is going to conduct his air war , as he always has , by his own rules of engagement .
ON AUG .
1 , LIMBAUGH WILL CELEBRATE the 20th anniversary of his national radio program .
At 57 , he is an American icon , although his fans and critics do n’t agree on precisely what he is iconic for .
I ’ve heard him compared to Mark Twain and Jackie Gleason , the Founding Fathers and Father Coughlin .
Serious people have called him a serial liar and a moral philosopher , a partisan hack and a public intellectual , nothing more than a radio windbag and nothing less than the heart of the Republican Party .
One thing is certain : Limbaugh has been a partisan force for two decades .
In 1994 , he was so influential in the Republican Congressional landslide that the grateful winners made him an honorary member of the G.O.P. freshman class .
He moved not only voters , but the party itself .
“ Rush talked about the ‘ Contract With America ’ before there was a ‘ Contract With America , ’ ” Karl Rove told me .
“ He helped set the agenda . ”
Bullshit .
According to the FBI , only 8 % of all rapes reported in the US are " unfounded " but not necessarily false .
( http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_97/96CRIME/96crime2.pdf ) 1997 was the last report in which they calculated that .
Figures in the UK bear this out as well .
( http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf
Here 's some statistics from http://www.rainn.org
Only an estimated 40 % of sexual assaults get reported .
Of that 40 % only 50 % of those will even be arrested .
Only an estimated 6 % of rapists will spend a DAY in jail .
Not prison , jail .
On this page of the RAINN site : http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates
It shows a tree of the disposition of reported rapes .
If you want you can go see it .
I did the math , it works out .
So , as a means of vengeance , false rape reporting has a really piss poor chance of coming to any fruition .
I mean , there 's only a 50/50 chance the victim of a false report will even be arrested .
Seriously , there are way more effective and sure ways to get revenge .
Ok , now apart from the fact that it 's highly unlikely to come to fruition , add into the equation that when a woman accuses a man of rape , her entire life is turned upside down and put under a microscope .
Her entire sexual history will go on trial .
She 'll have to justify every sexual act she has ever performed with anyone ever .
She 'll be accused of being a promiscuous whore who wanted it .
Her clothing will be scrutinized .
Her comings and goings .
Does she drink ?
Does she wear a thong ?
Was she wearing lacey underwear ?
And if you thinks it 's only adult women with suspect motives who are on the receiving end of these questions , just read the transcripts from a few child rape trials as well .
Seriously , it will turn your stomach to hear defense lawyers and defendants telling a jury in all honesty that a ten year old girl wanted sex .
The US and UK legal systems are not friendly even to women who come to them with a mountain of evidence , how much less friendly do you think they are to someone with only a story ?
Even when the story is true , it 's almost impossible to get a charge of rape taken seriously , even if you are a grandmother , nun or child , particularly without evidence .
Ok , so all that aside , of the 40 % of all rapes , the ones that actually get reported , only 8 % of that 40 % are unfounded , not necessarily false , just lacking evidence .
Some of those are victims who are bullied in recanting by their families and friends , or out of fear of the rapist or his family and friends .
Given how I 've seen actual rape victims treated , pretty much with all the tact and sensitivity of raw liver , very , very few women would ever willingly put themselves through that to " get back at " anyone .
Seriously .
Think about it .
My cycling had improved hugely during the mountain phases of Morocco , and I was earning my wings in the front group .
As we sped along the flats at speeds of more than 40 mph , I learnt how to conserve my energy and my sanity in the peleton .
But that meant keeping close .
The faster we went the more disciplined we had to be .
Yet the oncoming traffic was n't so accommodating .
Juggernauts blasted past at 60 mph , blowing and sucking us in their wake .
The cool , gentle tailwind dropped , and in its place a scorching hot continental headwind blew at us like a hair dryer straight off the Sahara .
Sue Relf complained that the words were sexually suggestive Knickers for young girls made to promote the film High School Musical 2 are being withdrawn after a complaint that they were sexually suggestive .
Sue Relf bought the underwear for her seven - year - old granddaughter at Asda in Broadstairs , Kent , and took them home to find the words " dive in " on them .
Disney apologised for any offence and said a genuine oversight had led to the words being used out of context .
Asda said the sale was completely innocent and was not meant to offend .
Mrs Relf said : " Both myself and my daughter looked at them and thought , ' Oh my goodness ' .
This product will not be part of any forthcoming collections
Disney statement " There was stuff written on them which I thought - and so did my granddaughter - was inappropriate for a seven - year - old to be wearing . "
Disney issued a statement which said : " We are very sorry to hear that a customer is unhappy with one of our High School Musical products and apologise for any offence caused .
" The knickers in question were designed using our High School Musical 2 artwork , which uses the creative theme of a swimming pool , as this is a key part of the film 's storyline .
" Unfortunately a genuine oversight was made and the text on this product was used outside the context of the swimming pool .
" This product will not be part of any forthcoming collections . "
A spokesperson for the company said the underwear , which was only sold at Asda , was part of a collection aimed at eight to 12 - year - olds , but was available in sizes from children aged four .
An Asda spokesperson said : " There is very limited stock available of this particular line still remaining in Asda stores .
" It was completely innocent and certainly not meant to cause any offence to customers .
However , we will now withdraw the product from all stores . "

What are these ?
Olly and George look forward to opening time in Fentonadle
The Limousin herd at Woodland Farm in Fentonadle get through up to 40 pints of local brew a day as part of their enviable diet .
And they even get a massage to help produce the speciality Kobe - style beef , based on traditional Japanese production methods .
Farmer Darren
Pluess says the cattle are not harmed by the diet .
' Kobe ' beef
" They are completely happy and they do like drinking beer , " he said .
" Beer is basically , hops , water and barley which is consistent with their diet anyway .
" We have problems digesting it , but they are ruminants and it suits them better . "
In Japan , Kobe beef is produced only by the expensive Wagyu cattle , but outside the country it can be sold as Kobe - style beef .
At Woodland Farm the beer , which is kept in 1,000 litre vats , is tapped into the sheds of the five Limousin cattle .
Two of the recipients , Olly and George , named after actor Oliver Reed and footballer George Best respectively , appear to be enjoying the diet which is complemented by regular massages to encourage tenderness .
' Run riot '
Mr Pluess 's wife Katy said Saturday night could get a bit rowdy .
" If they do n't have enough and they run out , when we bring the beer in they get incredibly excited and run riot .
" I do n't think they 're alcoholics because they do have water as well if they want , but they certainly do enjoy it . "
The result is fatty well - marbled beef with burgers from the herd fetching up to £ 40 each in London restaurants .
" You can't really taste the beer , it just tastes like really , really good beef , " said Mr Pluess .

Back in the ' 50s , home hair dyes were laced with toxic chemicals that turned a simple touch - up into a haz - mat operation .
Luckily , dye makers found substitutes like EDG , a fume - free organic solvent that keeps the ingredients in a thin , pourable consistency .
Oleyl Alcohol , Vegetable Fatty Acid
That thin , pourable consistency would be problematic during application .
Mixing the base with the separate bottle of " color developer " causes these two fatty organic thickeners to kick in , making the product cling to your hair like shampoo .
Ethanolamine
In last month 's episode of What 's Inside , this ingredient starred as a solvent in Easy - Off oven cleaner .
Here it 's an alkalizer that boosts the pH toward bleachlike levels and swells the hair 's outer layer so the color can penetrate more fully .
Erythorbic Acid
If you take ascorbic acid — aka vitamin C — and rearrange the atoms just so ( isomerization ! ) , you get erythorbic acid .
It 's a cheaper antioxidant that protects the dye from sun and oxygen damage .
Trisodium EDTA
With its ability to bind heavy metals , EDTA is used to clean up after radioactive spills .
That same talent is enlisted here to suck up copper in tap water , which might otherwise react with the product to create damaging radicals .
Dyed hair is messed up enough already .
Polyquaterium -22
Sounds like a comic- book invention , but this common polymer coats each strand , smoothing the shaft 's outer layer and improving lubricity — a fancy way of saying it 's a hair conditioner .
p-Aminophenol , p- Phenylenediamine
These so - called intermediates react inside the hair fiber to produce the appropriate color when oxidized .
This combination turns dark brown .
Other chemicals ( or different proportions of these ) can make any shade — from Sandy Blond to Jet Black .
Resorcinol
Is there anything this stuff can't do ?
It 's used as a chemical skin peel , a biological glue for aortic surgery , a sunscreen , a treatment for whooping cough , and — when mixed with the right acids — a TNT - like explosive .
In Just for Men , it 's a coupler , an additive that reacts with the oxidized intermediates to dial in the target color .
Hydrogen Peroxide
When combined with the other ingredients , this ubiquitous denizen of the medicine cabinet provides a superabundance of highly reactive oxygen , which turns those intermediates and couplers into luxurious dark coloring that will surely fool everyone into thinking that this is your natural look .

LOS ANGELES 
The Japanese video game titans , Nintendo and Sony , announced wide - ranging , if not entirely breathtaking , constellations of new games and services at the E3 convention here on Tuesday , but did not appear to significantly alter their overall strategies in the fast - growing game market , as Microsoft did on Monday .
Nintendo  which is riding high on the gangbusters popularity of its DS handheld game unit and its
Wii home console  continued to aim largely at children and the mainstream consumers who have adopted gaming in recent years , propelling the industry and the hobby beyond its historical base of young male players .
Sony , which is finally generating some traction and excitement around its PlayStation 3 console after initial stumbles , directed most of its new offerings at more traditional gamers , as well as at movie buffs interested in the company ’s high - definition Blu - Ray disc format .
While far from disappointing , the combined showings from the two companies appeared to leave some of the cognoscenti a bit underwhelmed .
“ They did n’t need to show a lot and so they did n’t show a lot , ” Brian Crecente , managing editor of Kotaku , a leading game blog , said of Nintendo .
“ I ’m a little disappointed that Nintendo did n’t make good on their promises of earlier this year that they would have a big new title for hardcore gamers .
People were expecting a big new Nintendo Wii game , like another Mario game or Zelda , or a big new intellectual property for core gamers .
And what they got was more casual games , and not a lot of them .
As for Sony , they did have to show a lot .
They met the minimal expectations but they did n’t blow it out of the water . ”
THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( AP ) 
The U.N. 's highest court ordered U.S. authorities on Wednesday to do everything possible to halt the executions of five Mexicans in Texas until their cases are reviewed .
The Bush administration has unsuccessfully tried to get Texas courts to review the cases and said it expected the World Court 's order to have little impact .
The World Court told U.S. authorities in 2004 to review the cases of 51 Mexicans sentenced to death by state courts after finding they had been denied the right to seek help from consular officials .
The World Court has no enforcement powers but President Bush issued a directive to the Texas courts to abide by the 2004 ruling .
The state courts refused to review the cases and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6 - 3 in March that the president cannot compel the state courts to comply .
Mexico turned again to the U.N. court in The Hague last month , arguing that the United States was defying the 2004 World Court order and asking the judges to issue an emergency injunction to stop the killings of five men whose executions were imminent .
Chief State Department advocate John B. Bellinger III argued that the World Court , the U.N. 's judicial arm for resolving disputes among nations , lacked jurisdiction because the Bush administration agreed with Mexico and there was no dispute .
" It almost never happens that the federal government enters an appearance in state court proceedings , " he said , calling the Bush administration 's intervention " highly unusual . "
Mexico 's chief advocate , Juan Manuel Gomez - Robledo , told the court the U.S. was nonetheless " in breach of its international obligations . "
He said international law applies not only to nations , but to their component states and asked the court to clarify its earlier ruling and in the meantime intercede with the U.S. authorities to halt the schedule of executions .
The U.N. judges ruled 7 - 5 Wednesday that it would consider Mexico 's case and also try to stop the executions .
The World Court acknowledged that the U.S. federal government " has been taking many diverse and insistent measures " to persuade Texas not to carry out the execution of any of the 51 Mexicans covered by the original 2004 ruling .
Bellinger said that the World Court has limited powers over U.S. states or federal authorities in Washington .
" It does not have technical legal effect in the United States that would ... have a direct impact either on the United States or on Texas itself , " he said .
Federal authorities were still discussing the case " constructively " with Texas , Bellinger said , and " Texas does take this all very seriously . "
Mexico's ambassador to the Netherlands , Jorge Lomonaco Tonda , said he was satisfied with the result .
" We have full confidence that the ruling will be applied , " he added .
The first of the Mexicans , Jose Medellin , is scheduled to be killed by lethal injection on Aug.
5 for taking part in the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls 15 years ago .

Where are my keys ?
Cam S. had checked under every couch cushion , in every jacket pocket , under every bed , everywhere for his keys .
While checking the kitchen counter for the third time , he glanced at the oven clock .
8:35 .
Even if the skies had opened up right that minute and his keys descended on a golden platter , he 'd still be at least ten minutes late for work .
It was then that he peeked in the garage and beheld a beautiful sight — his keys sitting on the drivers ' seat of his truck .
If he drove unreasonably , dangerously fast , he might still be able to get to work on time !
Cam breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the keys in his truck .
His locked truck .
Damn it !
The only other key was with his wife , who had left for work a while ago .
It was clear that it just was n't in the stars for Cam to go to work that day .
Oh well , there was a silver lining .
Working from home means no commute , no finding a parking spot , no changing out of your favorite robot PJs , no not watching Judge Judy and eating Doritos all day — pretty much exactly how the Bible describes heaven .
Cam fired off an email to his boss , " Joel , " to let him know that he would n't be in that day .
Immediately , an out - of - office autoreply came back , so per bank policy , Cam had to email Joel 's boss , " Ron , " with all of Joel 's team CC'd with contact information .
Minutes later , a smartass on Cam 's team replied - to - all with a snarky " Yeah , whatever , Cam .
We all know that by ' working at home ' you mean you 'll be sitting on your couch in your PJs eating Doritos and watching Judge Judy . "
It 's like he 's psychic !
Cam thought .
Still , he could prove them wrong with his new hobby project — a periodically updating webcam image on his personal web site .
Just as soon as he changed out of his PJs and moved the Doritos out of the shot .
It was a pretty crappy webcam — its maximum ( and only ) resolution was 320x240 with a color palette that rivaled EGA .
Fortunately , this resulted in small file sizes ( ~17 kb per image ) , and since he was hosting the site out of his basement , every little bit of compression helped .
Cam fought reply - all with reply - all , opening with " Nuh-uh , " and choosing his words carefully to avoid an escalating " yeah - huh ! " " nuh -uh ! " quagmire : " I 'll prove it !
Here 's a link to my personal web site ! "
Rather than continuing in the webcam site direction by adding eighth grade - level poetry , " which Backstreet Boy are you " quiz results , and PayPal donation buttons , he did the unthinkable — actually worked from home .
And he managed to get a lot done ; answering emails , chipping away at some bug fixes , preparing reports ( all the while remembering not to pick his nose on camera ) .
During a quick lunch break , Cam got a panicked call from his boss 's boss , Ron. " Cam , do you still have your webcam on ? "
" Yeah , wh - "
" Turn it off .
NOW , " he said in all caps over the phone .
" Uh , ok . "
Cam flicked the switch on the webcam off .
" So , why exactly is it so urgen - "
" Can'ttalknowbigproblems - " * click *
That was weird , Cam said as he checked his pants fly and the section of the room that was in the shot .
Finding nothing that could have upset anyone in the last few snapshots , he shrugged it off and got back to work .
It was then that Cam learned about one negative side - effect of working from home — being the guy that gets to work from home .
There 's a perception that the work - from - home guy 's life is so much better than yours , that they do jack squat all day , and get paid more for it .
True or not , it makes people jealous , and jealousy breeds contempt .
Contempt breeds blaming .
Blaming breeds repercussions for Cam .
See , it seems that there was a brief but major hiccup in a router somewhere between the bank 's data center and their T3 provider , causing a dramatic slowdown in outbound network performance , which rippled out into hundreds of branches and affecting thousands of online banking customers .
In the troubleshooting process , the lead network engineer caught wind that Cam had been " streaming live video " over the network , and was going to tell !
He complained loudly to Ron that Cam had caused the issues and lost some revenues for the bank in the process .
Adding to this theory was the fact that the issue had apparently resolved itself close to the time that Cam turned off his webcam .
One week later , Cam is sitting with his boss Joel to discuss the issue .
" Cam , I 'm going to need you to sign this disciplinary action report before we file it with HR , " Joel said weakly .
Appealing to reason , Cam began , " Joel , you know exactly what happened .
You know that all that was coming across the network was a static web page with a new image every so often .
I never had more than five HTTP sessions at a time .
It would take thousands , if not hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users accessing my web site at the same time to consume the bandwidth that it says I consumed on this report . "
" I know , " he said as his expression sank .
Clearly , he'd fought for Cam and been overruled .
" Besides that , " Cam continued , " I 'm hosting my site at my house .
My upstream connection is capped at 360 kbps .
There 's literally no physical way that anything I did from my house could even make a dent in our massive T3 lines , even if my upstream connection was 100 % saturated ! "
" I know , " Joel said as his face slipped into his hands .
At this point , it dawned on Cam that he was lucky that all that was happening to him was a writeup .
It sounded as though upper management would prefer to see him hanged .
Still , it was absolutely unfair that he'd be made to take the fall .
" Furthermore , " Cam pressed , " what about our QoS policies ?
Surely internal users browsing external web sites have lower priority than - "
" I know , " Joel said again .
" Look , I 've fought them on this .
You know I trust you , and that I know you would n't ever — that you could n't ever — do something like this .
I 'm saying this as a friend ; you 're better off just signing this .
It 's not just you ; management is pissed at me now , too .
It 's not fair , but it 's how it is . "
In the end , there was n't much Cam could have done .
Joel had backed him up and explained the inescapable facts that Cam could n't have caused the network issues even if he 'd tried .
Cam signed the form and spent several more years at the bank , eventually rising to the rank of Lead Developer .
And the network engineer that had pinned the issues on Cam even learned to respect him as a colleague ( though they never spoke of the incident ) .
Today , even though he'd left the bank for other opportunities , he and Joel occasionally share a laugh over the $ 30 webcam that brought down the bank 's network .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain has given the green light for an oral antibiotic to be sold without prescription for the first time , in a move that pushes back the barriers to self - medication .
Patients aged 16 years and over will be able to buy the azithromycin pill , sold as Clamelle by Icelandic drugmaker Actavis , to treat chlamydia , the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) said on Wednesday .
It is designed for use by people who have tested positive for the sexually transmitted infection and have no symptoms .
The drug will also be available on an over - the - counter ( OTC ) basis for their sexual partners .
Up to 70 percent of people who have chlamydia exhibit no symptoms but risk serious long - term health complications , including infertility and ectopic pregnancy .
“ Today ’s move means that symptom - free people diagnosed with chlamydia and their partner will be able to get convenient effective treatment from their local pharmacy , ” said June Raine , MHRA director of vigilance and risk management of medicines .
The British government has taken a lead in Europe in encouraging self - medication , as a way to increase patient choice and cut state healthcare bills .
The country already allows OTC sales of cholesterol - lowering and migraine drugs , as well as antibiotic eyedrops .
“ The MHRA is keen to support the availability of more medicines over - the - counter , where it is safe to do so , and we wish to move on to new areas such as prevention and chronic disease management , ” Raine said in a statement .
The increasing trend towards self - medication is expected to underpin future growth in the non-prescription medicines sector , which has seen a wave of consolidation .
Leading suppliers of OTC drugs include Johnson & Johnson , Reckitt Benckiser , Bayer , GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis .
Although azithromycin is a generic medicine , only Actavis ’s branded product Clamelle will be made available OTC from pharmacists .
Actavis , which was taken private last year , is working on launch plans for the medicine , as well as a Clamelle - branded chlamydia test kit .
S-300
Israeli defense officials declared the Jewish State would do " everything possible " to prevent Russia ’s potent S - 300 anti-aircraft batteries from reaching Iran .
The remarks were made to the Jerusalem Post and reported by its veteran military affairs correspondent , Yaacov Katz .
The advanced S-300 mobile weapons system can reportedly track as many as 100 airborne targets simultaneously — drones , airplanes , and missiles — and can engage a dozen at once as far as 200 kilometers away .
The system can even track missiles in outer space , that is , at 90,000 feet .
Many missiles briefly enter the exosphere before raining down on their targets .
As such , the S - 300 can defeat virtually every aerial assault asset in Israel ’s arsenal as it edges nearer to a pre-emptive strike against Iran ’s high speed nuclear program .
But now , Israel has pledged to develop “ black box technology ” to neutralize S -300 electronics if the system becomes operational in Iran .
If Israel does develop electronic countermeasures , those could be based upon aerial exercises held late last May and in early June .
At that time , Israel conducted a mock attack using drones and warplanes over Crete .
Greece possesses a similar S - 300 system .
The maneuvers were held jointly with the Hellenic Air Force .
The Cutting Edge News was the first to report the pivotal role of the S - 300 in the highly publicized Israel - Greek military exercise .
" Russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to Iran , which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either Israel or the US , since if the system is delivered , ” the defense official told the Jerusalem Post , “ an EW [ electronic warfare ] system will likely be developed to neutralize it ; and if that happens , it would be catastrophic not only for Iran but also for Russia . "
If Israel moves ahead with its countermeasure program , it would indeed undermine both the backbone of Russian national air defense and its sale to other oil - rich countries willing to pay millions for the system .
" No country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective , " the defense official told the Jerusalem Post .
Numerous countries are now lined up to purchase the powerful S - 300 system , this reporter has learned .
In April , 2008 , new agreements were reached on Russian - made weapons deliveries to Libya .
Oil -rich Libya agreed to purchase the S - 300 along with its TOR - M1 missiles as part of a package that also includes 30 MiG - 29SMT and Su-30 MK fighters , six Yak - 130 combat trainers , several dozens Mi-17 , Mi-35 and Ka-52 helicopters , 50 T - 90S tanks and an advanced submarine .
In exchange for the weapons deal , Libya asked Russia to write off old debt , totaling $ 4.6 billion .
Military analysts say , the weapons cost will cover half of the waived debt .
Russia could recoup the balance from Libyan cooperation in the oil sector ; and as a bonus , gain the release of one its citizens held as a spy in a Libyan prison .
The alleged spy is Alexander Tsygankov , a LUK Oil Overseas employee , who was released as part of the deal , reportedly on orders of Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi .
Saudi Arabia is also eying the S - 300 , as part of a mixed defense system which now includes U.S. - made Patriot missiles .
But Saudi Arabia is also insisting on Russia ’s best system , the S -400 .
But there is only one S - 400 installation , the one deployed near the town of Elektrostal to protect Moscow itself .
Venezuela has already purchased the TOR - M1 missiles and now Putin has told fiery Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez he is prepared to sell the S - 300 as well .
TOR - M1 missiles are most powerful when deployed with the S - 300 targeting system .
The question remains whether Iran really has taken delivery of the five complex multi-component S - 300 batteries promised ; and if it has , are they operational ?
The Iranian - Russian deal dates to 2005 and was linked to Russia ’s construction of Iran ’s nuclear reactor in Bushehr .
The Bushehr plant can produce a quarter ton of plutonium per year , which nuclear experts say is enough for at least 30 atomic bombs .
In December 2007 , bilateral discussions among Iranian and Russian military experts produced a breakthrough on the S -300 .
The talks in Tehran were led by Mikhail Dmitriyev , head of the Russian Federal Service for Military and Technical Cooperation , and Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi , regarded as the father of Iran 's missile program .
On December 26 , Iranian Defense Minister Mustafa Mohammad Najar announced that Moscow would supply TOR - M1 missiles in 2007 and several dozen S -300 systems to Tehran in 2008 .
Later that day , sources in the Russian military confirmed the information to the local Russian media .
Shortly thereafter , Dmitriyev himself told attendees at a meeting of the Russian - Indian intergovernmental committee on military - technical cooperation that the deal was going forward since it was not prohibited by international agreements .
The announcements set off alarms in Western capitals .
Despite protests , a shipment of 29 TOR - M1 missiles was made to Iran in 2007 .
But Moscow has waffled on whether it was honoring the pledge to delivery the S-300s .
Russian , Iranian , Israeli and American sources seem to be parsing whether the systems are actually “ delivered . ”
Israeli officials have stated , “ no one really knows yet if and when Iran will get the system . "
Others suggest the components have been delivered but not assembled , or “ title ” has not yet passed because the systems are being tested .
But Israeli officials and informed observers suggest that if the S - 300 is about to go hot in Iran , it will trigger a rapid , accelerated decision to move militarily .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told an interviewer for the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera , “ we need to keep every option open .
If they provoke us , or they attack us , our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly . "
Barack added , " It 's up to us to find the best way to get the best result with minimum damage . "

The Leipzig Games Convention held this week in Germany has been the subject of much controversy , owing to a remixed version of Space Invaders that was on display at the show .
The installation , titled " Invaders ! " , set the game 's familiar rows of aliens against the backdrop of the twin towers of the World Trade Center , which they destroyed while the player attempted to fight them off .
( It 's shown in the video at right . )
Outlets like the New York Daily News picked up on the story and asked families of 9/11 victims what they thought of the game .
You can guess what their responses were .
As the story of the game and its creator , Paris - based artist Douglas Stanley , continues to spread , Square Enix – owners of Taito and thus the Space Invaders series – sent out the following statement to the media today :
Taito Corporation , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Square Enix Co. , Ltd. , today stated unequivocally that the " Invaders ! " installation by Douglas Edric Stanley and displayed at the Games Convention held in Leipzig , Germany , was produced entirely without Taito 's knowledge and that the use of the world - famous Space Invaders content was wholly unauthorized .
The " Space Invaders : Die Jubiläumsshow ! "
( " Space Invaders : the Anniversary Show " ) exhibition of the Computer Game Museum Berlin hosting the installation was likewise planned and presented without Taito 's knowledge and authorization .
Taito is seriously considering all available options – including legal actions against the infringer and , if necessary , the Games Convention exhibitor involved – in order to end this unauthorized and impermissible misuse of the Space Invaders content and to protect Taito 's intellectual properties .
As of this writing , Stanley 's Twitter feed says that three hours ago , he gave the convention permission to shut down the game .

Dear all , as part of an effort to promote the current work on HTML to web developers , I 've been working lately on integrating the W3C Markup Validator with the HTML5 parser and checker developed over the past few years by Henri Sivonen .
Thanks to validator .
nu's well documented API and Henri 's helpful cooperation I managed to integrate the two tools fairly seamlessly .
The result of that work is in CVS , and testable on the dev instance of the validator : http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/HEAD/
Test with a " random " HTML5 page : http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/HEAD/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fintertwingly.net%2Fblog%2F
Test of error display : http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/HEAD/check?uri=http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/HEAD/dev/tests/html5-error-explanation.html;ss
( Note - the " revalidate " feature is broken on that dev server , apparently due to a bug in the latest version of libwww - perl .
We 're looking into that . )
The HTML5 parsing is triggered ( for now ) by these two cases : * if the user selects " HTML5 " in the doctype dropdown in the options
http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/HEAD/#validate_by_uri+with_options
* if the document contains the pseudo doctype declaration <! DOCTYPE html > ->
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#the-doctype
More triggers are likely to be added later .
This integration should hopefully provide more visibility to HTML5 and to the validator .nu tool : validator .w3.org gets about a million validations a day and if only a fraction of it looks into the HTML5 option that will provide some useful additional testing grounds .
In the meantime , bug reports ( or patches ! ) on how the integration of the two tools have been made would be welcome , either on the www - validator list , or on the bugzilla : http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/
Please do check for existing reports before you do : http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&product=Validator&component=HTML5

Avere un blog rende felici e sostanzialmente migliora la vita del blogger : ad affermarlo è uno studio condotto dal ricercatore James Baker dell ’università australiana di Swinburne , che ha dimostrato che dopo due mesi di attività su un social network , dalla semplice richiesta di amicizia allo scambio di video , tutti gli utenti si sentono meno ansiosi e depressi ma , in particolare , quelli che hanno affiancato a queste attività quelle del blogging vivono meglio anche le relazioni fuori dal web .
In pratica , chi aveva deciso di tenere un blog si sentiva socialmente inserito e più soddisfatto delle relazioni sociali e delle amicizie anche fuori dal web rispetto a quelli che non avevano aperto un blog .
In tutti i casi analizzati , blogger o meno , gli utenti si sentivano comunque meno ansiosi , depressi e stressati .
Gli studiosi hanno concluso che tenere un blog è come scrivere un diario che aiuta le persone a esternare le proprie emozioni e a parlare dei propri sentimenti e problemi .
La differenza con i diari cartacei sta però nel fatto che quelli online sono a carattere pubblico e invitano quindi gli altri a lasciare un’opinione su quello che leggono .
Un blogger migliora la sua capacità di pensare
Ma , tra gli innumerevoli vantaggi nell ’avere un blog , pare vi sia anche quello di rendere , chi lo apre , un miglior pensatore !
Per arrivare a queste conclusioni gli studiosi sono partiti dalla constatazione che le attività mentali dell ’ uomo possono causare dei cambiamenti nella struttura del cervello , non solo rispetto a ciò a che si pensa ma anche a come si pensa .
Ecco dunque che il blog è stato preso ad esempio come una nuova attività fondamentale del comportamento umano che potrebbe cambiare radicalmente la maniera di pensare delle persone fino a concludere che bloggare può potenziare la creatività , l ’intuito e il ragionamento per associazioni .
La facilità con cui chiunque può pubblicare un blog online promuoverebbe dunque connessioni spontanee e accrescerebbe la creatività .
I neurologi hanno inoltre concluso che i diari online migliorerebbero il pensiero critico e analitico anche solo perché , essendo ricchi di idee , informazioni e opinioni , facilitano lo scambio di pareri , il confronto e l’analisi .
Riflessioni sul blogger che c’è in me
Se è vero che , come sosteneva il New York Times in una recente inchiesta sui pericoli del blogging , postare quotidianamente notizie sempre fresche e nuove potrebbe fare male alla salute , e che , come noto , seguire tutti i giorni centinaia di feed rss , può , a lungo andare , stressare la propria vita di blogger ( che si vede rubare il tempo che altrimenti potrebbe passare all ’aria aperta ) , devo ammettere , che da quando ho aperto questo blog , ho potuto assistire in me delle trasformazioni di pensiero che prima non immaginavo e ho acuito e migliorato certe mie caratteristiche che sottovalutavo .
Se i primi articoli erano poco profondi e non molto originali , ad oggi mi ritrovo a scrivere post di approfondimento che , mi coinvolgono e mi appagano , scrivendoli solo per il gusto personale .
Ad oggi , in effetti , mi sento meno superficiale di un tempo : sarà anche che il vantaggio di essere cresciuto , ma credo di essere notevolmente più maturo di prima .
Inoltre , come è accaduto a molto , ho instaurato una certa cerchia di amici che seguo costantemente e contatto , a volte , anche nella vita reale .
E voi , amici blogger , cosa ne pensate ?
Siete più felici da quando avete iniziato a bloggare ?
IT COULD BE WORSE IT COULD BE WORSE Gas prices in the U.S. are rising at a slower rate than crude oil prices .
Oil , per barrel
98 % change
June 24 , 2007 : $ 68.83
June 25 , 2008 : $ 136.49 Gas , per gallon
37 % change
June 24 , 2007 : $ 2.98
June 25 , 2008 : $ 4.07 Sources : U.S. Energy Information Administration ; AAA.com WASHINGTON  A decline in Americans ' demand for gasoline is keeping record prices from skyrocketing even further , a USA TODAY analysis of gas and oil prices shows .
The price of crude oil has nearly doubled in the past year , while gas has risen in the U.S. by about one - third , according to statistics kept by the Energy Information Administration .
Oil prices are being driven up by rising demand in developing nations .
But U.S. drivers have cut back , causing a 1 % drop in demand for gas this year compared with the same period in 2007 .
That has forced refiners and retailers in the U.S. to reduce their profit margins .
" Whenever you look at $ 4 gas , you feel to some degree that you 're being taken advantage of , " says Eric Wittenauer , a Wachovia Securities energy futures analyst .
" Unfortunately , it could actually be worse . "
If crude oil prices come down , refiners and retailers say they will seek to recoup their losses , and the price at the pump is likely to remain high .
" When wholesale prices start to fall , retailers will try to expand margins to make up for what they lost on the way up , " says Jeff Lenard of the Association for Convenience and Petroleum Retailing .
With plenty of ethanol - infused gasoline on the market and drivers buying less , retailers are making about 12 cents per gallon , barely enough to cover expenses , Lenard says .
More than 3,000 gas stations closed last year , the most since 2001 .
In the past year , crude oil prices have risen from nearly $ 69 per barrel to $ 136 .
A gallon of regular unleaded gas has gone from an average of $ 2.98 to $ 4.07 — a 37 % increase .
For most of the past two decades , oil and gas prices have tracked each other , with gas costing two to three times the price of a gallon of crude .
Now the ratio is down to 1.28 - to - 1 , with crude oil representing 78 % of the price of a gallon of gas .
Combined state and federal taxes are between 6 % and 12 % .
Refiners , distributors and retailers divide up the rest .
The price of gas often has risen faster than oil — such as when Hurricane Katrina crippled the Gulf Coast 's refining capacity in 2005 .
Since last summer , the opposite has been true .
U.S. supplies have remained strong , thanks to ethanol mandates and gasoline exports from Europe .
U.S. demand fell 1.4 % in May compared with a year earlier and is down 1 % for the first five months of 2008 — the first drop since 1991 , according to the American Petroleum Institute .
Refiners ' profits — the difference between crude prices and wholesale gas prices — have shrunk this year , causing some to cut back on production , says Aaron Brady , an oil market expert at Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
Valero , the biggest independent refiner , had $ 261 million in profits for the first quarter of 2008 , down from $ 1.1 billion for the same period in 2007 .
" You 're looking at Economics 101 , " says Charles Drevna , president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association .
" People throughout the country are altering their driving habits , which means that demand is going south . "
Consumer groups are n't sympathetic .
Tyson Slocum , director of the energy program at Public Citizen , calls the lower profits " probably what they should be . "
For retailers , the average profit on a gallon of gas last week was 11.7 cents , down from 14.3 cents last year .
It was highest in the Northeast , at 17.4 cents , and lowest in the West , at 3.6 cents , according to Oil Price Information Service .
California retailers lost an average of 3.4 cents last week .
Many retailers have tried to make up the difference inside their stores .
While gasoline accounts for 71 % of convenience stores ' sales , it represents only 34 % of their gross profits , which increasingly come from packaged beverages , hot coffee and foods prepared on - site .
" The joke is they make more money on the Slim Jim than they do on the gasoline , " says John Felmy , chief economist at the petroleum institute .

Toxic proteins build up in organs over time Researchers may have found a way to halt the biological clock which slows down our bodies over the decades .
A US team thinks it may have found the genetic levers to help boost a system vital to cleaning up faulty proteins within our cells .
The journal Nature Medicine reported that the livers of genetically - altered older mice worked as well as those in younger animals .
They suggested it might one day help people with progressive brain diseases .
These results show it 's possible to correct this protein ' logjam ' that occurs in our cells as we get older , thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
Dr Ana Maria Cuervo
Yeshiva University
The researchers , from Yeshiva University in New York , are focusing on a process which is central to the proper working of cells .
The fundamental chemicals of cells - proteins - often have very short working lives , and need to be cleared away and recycled as soon as possible .
The body has a system for doing just that , but it becomes progressively less efficient as we get older .
This leads to progressive falls in the function of major organs - the heart , liver and brain , some of which contribute to the diseases of old age .
Dr Ana Maria Cuervo , from Yeshiva , created a mouse with two genetic alterations .
The first , when activated , boosted the number of specific cell receptors linked to this protein recycling function , while the second allowed the first to be turned on whenever Dr Cuervo wished simply by modifying the animal 's diet .
Switched on She waited until the mice were six months old - the point at which age - related decline in the protein - recycling system begins - then turned on the receptor gene .
When examined at two years old , the liver cells of these mice were far more effective at recycling protein compared with normal mice .
When the overall liver function of the very old genetically - modified mice was tested , they performed at a comparable level to much younger mice .
Dr Cuervo said : " These results show it 's possible to correct this protein ' logjam ' that occurs in our cells as we get older , thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age . "
She now plans to test animal models of Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases , believing that the abnormal protein deposits in Alzheimer 's in particular might be dealt with more effectively this way .
Thomas von Zglinicki , Professor of Cellular Gerontology at Newcastle University , said that the results were " very exciting " .
" It 's not often you see studies where they have managed to improve function in this way .
" What they seem to have managed is to maintain the mice at this young stage , and both restore and maintain normal activity . "
He said that it should , in theory , be possible to achieve the same effect across the whole body .
A spokesman for the Alzheimer 's Society said : " As we age we have an increase in protein misfolding and general faults in protein processing , so the ability to maintain an effective system to clear these would be beneficial .
" However , a direct line to the clearance of defective proteins in the brain is not so clear from this research . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Millionaire socialite Paris Hilton has jumped into the U.S. election campaign , calling Republican candidate John McCain a “ wrinkly white - haired guy ” and offering her own energy policy .
The blonde Hilton , dressed in a leopard print swim suit and gold pumps , jokingly declared her own candidacy in a video posted on the website Funny or Die , saying : “ I want America to know that I ’m , like , totally ready to lead . ”
She was responding to a television ad by McCain , 71 , that used her image to attack Democratic rival Barack Obama .
The 27 - year - old socialite said McCain ’s use of her in the ad , which sought to undermine Obama by likening his popularity to her celebrity , had effectively put her in the race for the top U.S. office .
Pretending to take time off from reading a travel magazine as she leaned back on a lounge chair , Hilton insinuated herself into the hot issue between Obama and McCain -- how to solve the U.S. energy crisis .
“ We can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get Detroit making hybrid and electric cars , ” Hilton simpered , drawing on suggestions from both candidates .
Hilton , a tabloid favorite who gained fame from a notorious home - made sex tape , offered to paint the White House pink and threw down the gauntlet to McCain and Obama .
“ I ’ll see you at the debates , bitches , ” she said .
Under U.S. law , Hilton would not in fact be eligible to hold the office of the presidency for eight more years .
McCain , meanwhile , released a second television ad that mocked Obama as a celebrity , but it avoided any mention of Hilton or other Hollywood types .
His spokesman Tucker Bounds said : “ Paris Hilton might not be as big a celebrity as Barack Obama , but she obviously has a better energy plan . ”
Hilton ’s mother , a McCain donor , had lambasted as a complete waste of money the Republican candidate ’s advertisement using her daughter ’s image .
“ It is a complete waste of the country ’s time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs .
And it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next President of the United States , ” she wrote on the political Web site Huffington Post .

I had n’t played any home games in a very long time .
The guys that I first got into poker with when we were young teenagers had stopped getting together for a while so I was left without a fun home game atmosphere to indulge in .
But recently , they have started up again , although still infrequently and it has been a lot of fun .
I ’ve find that playing a leisurely game with friends whose style you know and are between fairly and highly skilled is a lot of fun .
Some have significantly more advanced technical skill in the game than I have .
I ’ve been able to hang with them over the years with a combination of unorthodoxy in my play , friendly intimidation , and off the table gamesmanship ( see an earlier post entitled such ) .
The point is , that this kind of environment , at least for me , is a way to keep the game fun and connect to why I became interested in it in the first place .
It was an ENJOYABLE challenge .
Which brings me to a home game I just played last week that was anything but enjoyable .
The reason being a phenomenon I ’m sure many other people are aware of and perhaps have even been guilty of ; the home game poker know - it - all .
I had the misfortune of having one of these mind - searingly , irritating individuals at a game my buddies and I were playing at a Bar - B - Q .
Now at a serious game with other serious players , annoyances and generally unpleasant or at least annoying things are sometimes unavoidable .
They are tolerable to an extent because of the situation .
One is not playing in that game to make friends or even necessarily to have a good time .
For serious players , in a serious game , it is work .
Sometimes , like with any job , one simply has to put up with it and get down to business .
But when I ’m trying to relax and have fun with the game with friends , I want to HAVE FUN !
The poker - know - it all removes any semblance of fun .
This person is obnoxious with his constant calculation of odds , recitation of obscure anecdotes , and knowledge of advanced tactics .
All of which , mind you , are often slightly inaccurate , as a person who needs to flaunt their knowledge usually has a poor grasp of it .
When there is a complication or question about how to divide the pot because of multiple all in calls , or changing chips amongst players , he always has to have his hands in there whether he is involved in it or not .
This is so he can show off how quickly he can manipulate chips and calculate what amounts go where .
Since this person is usually a relative stranger to any group , he has no idea the skill level of the people he is sitting with .
So the fact that he assumes he is so much more advanced in skill level is that much more irritating .
So I beseech all of you reading this .
The fact that you are reading a poker website makes it very possible that you may have at some point in the past exhibited traits that would conform to the archetype of the poker - know - it - all .
I must admit that I have done so more than once before .
If you have , stop !
This person is not enjoyable at all to play with and his presence only serves to ruin what should be a relaxing game with friends .
So do n’t worry about showing off how much you know , or how much you ’ve made at your respective online poker site .
Just take the opportunity to have fun .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Retail gas prices have risen to an all - time high for the third straight day , according to a survey from motorist group AAA .
The national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose five - tenths of a cent overnight to $ 4.092 , the daily survey showed Wednesday .
That tops the previous day 's record of $ 4.087 a gallon .
Gas prices are now about 3 % higher than last month and 38.5 % higher than year - ago levels .
Alaska has the highest gas prices .
Drivers in the state pay an average of $ 4.649 a gallon for regular gas .
California has the second - highest gas prices , averaging $ 4.578 , followed by Hawaii at $ 4.446 .
The lowest gas prices in the nation can be found in Oklahoma .
The state has an average price of $ 3.878 a gallon .
The survey also showed that the national average price for diesel fuel rose to $ 4.767 from $ 4.762 the day before .
Diesel prices are highest in Hawaii , where the average price is a whopping $ 5.347 a gallon .
Rising gas prices contributed to a sharp decline in June auto sales .
Unadjusted sales fell 18 % , far worse than the 12 % decline forecast by sales tracker Edmunds.com ,
Despite the rising popularity of fuel - efficient cars , sales of fuel sippers fell in June , as many automakers were unable to keep up with rising demand for small cars .
Annoyed by all the mind - games and leaks meant to divert attention from their candidate 's long - anticipated acceptance speech tonight , Barack Obama 's campaign is hitting back this afternoon and accusing their counterparts of playing political games .
" Tonight would be political malpractice , " Obama communications chief Dan Pfeiffer told Politico .
" It 's one more piece of evidence that the McCain campaign is a war room masquerading as a presidential campaign . "
Pfeiffer did , however , call McCain 's bluff .
" If they do it , I will pay all of McCain 's mortgages next month , " he quipped .
McCain , as Pfeiffer well knows , has no mortgages on the numerous properties and he and his wife own .
Brian Rogers , a spokesman for McCain , struck back with a celebrity - flavored tweak of his own .
" The only one guilty of ' political malpractice ' is whomever had Britney Spears ' roadies construct a temple for their candidate 's speech tonight , " he jabbed .
Matt Drudge is teasing a potential 6 p.m. leak of McCain 's choice on the top of his Web page , creating a frenzy of speculation today as most political reporters await Obama 's speech later tonight .
McCain is set to roll out his choice at a rally tomorrow in Dayton , Ohio .

The decision to send the American military , even on a humanitarian mission , deepened the United States ’ commitment to Georgia and America ’s allies in the former Soviet sphere , just as Russia has been determined to reassert its control in the area .

On a day the White House evoked emotional memories of the cold war , a senior Pentagon official said the relief effort was intended “ to show to Russia that we can come to the aid of a European ally , and that we can do it at will , whenever and wherever we want . ”
At a minimum , American forces in Georgia will test Russia ’s pledge to allow relief supplies into the country ; they could also deter further Russian attacks , though at the risk of a potential military confrontation .
“ We expect Russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport , including seaports , airports , roads and airspace , remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ We expect Russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in Georgia , and we expect all Russian forces that entered Georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country . ”
In Georgia , President Mikheil Saakashvili , who has sharply criticized what he called a failure of the West to support his country , declared the relief operation a “ turning point ” in the conflict , which began on Thursday when Georgian forces tried to establish control in the breakaway region of South Ossetia , only to be routed by the Russians .
“ We were unhappy with the initial actions of the American officials , because they were perceived by the Russians as green lines , basically , but this one was very strong , ” he said in a telephone interview after Mr. Bush ’s statement in Washington .

Detroit News
( Many thanks to those of you who continue to share articles from the subscription - only MIRS and Gongwer with me . )
Last week 's Detroit News / WXYZ poll conducted by EPIC - MRA showed some trouble for Congressman Walberg .
I have n't seen all the data yet or the survey questions , but MIRS and Gongwer have a little bit more than the initial Detroit News article .
Some of the data below is incomplete , and the way I 've listed it here is likely different from the way it was asked in the survey .
I 'm giving you everything the , MIRS , and Gongwer have published , as well as data from RealClearPolitics.com ( Margin of error +/- 4.9 % ) Democrats and lean ( D ) independents - 35 % Republicans and lean ( R ) independents - 47 % Independents / Other - 18 % All Independents - 40 % Walberg ( R ) - 51 % Schauer ( D ) - 40 % Walberg ( R ) - 48 % Schauer ( D ) - 49 % Walberg - 82 % Schauer - 9 % Walberg - 83 % Schauer - 15 % Walberg - N / ASchauer - 82 % Walberg - N/ ASchauer - 91 % Walberg - 35 % Schauer - 46 % Walberg - 38 % Schauer - 55 % Walberg - 40 % ( 45 % ) Schauer - 57 % ( Renier 51 % ) Walberg - 38 % Schauer - 59 % Walberg - 58 % ( 48 % ) Schauer - 29 % ( Renier 50 % ) Walberg - 60 % Schauer - 36 % Walberg - 55 % ( 51 % ) Schauer - 36 % ( Renier 46 % ) Walberg - 51 % Schauer - 45 % Walberg - 60 % ( 56 % ) Schauer - 30 % ( Renier 42 % ) Walberg - 46 % Schauer - 46 % Walberg - 46 % ( 47 % ) Schauer - 43 % ( Renier 50 % ) Walberg - 53 % Schauer - 47 % ( Branch , Hillsdale counties were not given in any article . )

And that 's all I 've got for now .
First , for all the reporters out there , the political junkies like me would really appreciate it if , when possible , you posted the complete data in addition to analysis .
I had to look through four articles to piece all of that together , and there are still some gaps .
I 'd love to see the biographical sketches that were read , as well as see any other data from the poll .
I have a few observations , but before I start , I like the introduction to the MIRS article :
If you glance up again , you 'll notice that Walberg 's negatives are at 38 percent , and his positives are only one point higher .
So , Lee Atwater ( Karl Rove 's mentor ) would be bailing on Walberg right about now .
I 'm surprised by how well Walberg does in Eaton County and Washtenaw County , and I really do expect those numbers to drop this summer .
Similarly , while I 'd love for Mark Schauer to be able to win Lenawee County ( my home county and Tim Walberg 's home county ) , I really doubt that it 'll happen .
Still , if Schauer can hit 46 percent in Lenawee County with just a biographical sketch , it 's definitely a place worth campaigning in .
Schauer is strong among independents ( very important ) , and he improves more than Walberg does in every category when the biographical information is read .
Since the poll was commissioned by the (a paper that has never endorsed a Democratic presidential nominee ) , I 'm going to assume the biography was fairly balanced .
I think it 's also worth pointing out that Schauer gets significant support simply for being a Democrat .
The lesson here , I think , is that one should n't run away from the ( D ) after the name this year .
Independents are leaning strongly for Democrats , as was demonstrated in the recent Illinois 14th District special election , where Bill Foster won former House Speaker Dennis Hastert 's seat with ads prominently featuring his party affiliation .
Still , remember that this is still a lean - Republican district , and it wo n't be an easy campaign .
However , when 53 percent of the voters do n't know who the leading Democratic candidate is , these results are pretty good .

Men : A change in thinking may improve your sex life .
Get the details on seven common mistakes guys make with women , and learn how to avoid them .
Mistake 1 : Sex Starts in the Bedroom Men may turn on like a light , but for women , arousal does n’t happen so fast , says sex therapist Ian Kerner , PhD .
Pave the way during the day by hugging , kissing , and holding hands .
Have some fun together , and show you appreciate her .
Feeling safe and secure in the relationship is key for a woman to really let loose during sex , Kerner says .
A long hug can go further than you ’d think .
“ Hugging for 30 seconds stimulates oxytocin , the hormone in women that creates [ a ] sense of connection and trust . ”
Mistake 2 : Assume You Know What She Wants “ Just as many women are faking orgasm today as 20 or 30 years ago , ” Kerner says .
So , if she ’s not enjoying herself , you might not know it .
Do n't be afraid to ask questions like “ How does this feel ? ” or “ Do you want something different ? ”
In other words , ask for directions .
Mistake 3 : Stick to Your Plan
Don't think that " if it worked the first three times , it will work the next three times , " says sex therapist Sari Cooper , LCSW .
What turns her on may depend on her mood , and where she is in her monthly cycle .
“ Perhaps her nipples are more sensitive or her genitals are less tingly , ” Cooper adds .
Pay attention to your partner , says psychologist Lonnie Barbach , PhD .
“ Try different things and see how she responds . ”
When you find something that works , linger on it .
Women often complain that men move on to the next thing just as they really start to enjoy an activity .
No doubt most of gemstones are quite durable but still the require some care .
By following these general rules you can save your gemstones for generations and with the same luster as they were on the day when you bought them .
The first and foremost rule is to keep the gemstones clean .
Usually , in rings soap and dust collect behind the stone and the best way to clean it is soaking it in water and applies a mild soap and a soft toothbrush can also be used in this connection .
The gemstones which are considered the hardest may become vulnerable to breakage if they are included something that makes the crystal structure cracked .
Diamonds are counted as the hardest but still they shatter in to pieces if a well - placed blow is offered .
Rubies and sapphire too are the toughest but they also face the similar fate if the right below at right place is given to them .
Ultrasonic cleaner is not a right choice for your gem and you must consider a lot before putting gems in it .
This can be useful for rubies , diamonds and sapphires but not for many other gems and must leave it whenever you are in doubt .
A large number of diamonds , rubies and sapphires that are single crystal gems can be cleaned with a touch of ammonia in water .
Intensive care is required for opaque gemstones like lapis lazuli , malachite and turquoise and you must avoid ultrasonic cleaner and ammonia or some other chemical solution to apply on them .
You can just use a moist cloth to clean these gems .
As these materials are mostly rocks and that is why these materials need more care than transparent gemstones .
You may have observed when rock is put in water , it begins to absorb water and gets moist but when some gemstone is consisted of a single crystal , it ca n’t absorb water as there is no room in them that allows water to enter in them .
Intensive care is required to keep opals and they are avoided from ultrasonic , ammonia , heat and strong light that may dry out its water .
Many organic gems including pearls , amber , and coral should be cleaned just with a moist cloth .
As these gems have an organic nature , they are prone to absorbing moisture and often are soft .
The gemstone must be kept away from different chemicals that are found hairspray , cosmetics or in perfumes .
You must keep your gemstones in different small pouches separately in the same or different jewelry boxes .
The different items of gold , silver or platinum can scratch the gems and make them spoil .

PETER D. SCHIFF IS AN EXTREME BEAR WHEN IT COMES to investing in the U.S. , and he 's made a name for himself selling his point of view with considerable zeal , often on television but also in print .
Schiff , 43 , has contributed articles to Newsweek International and other publications , and he is the author of the recently published Crash Proof : How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse .
Our own Alan Abelson cited his musings in a recent column .
However , comparing Schiff 's performance with a benchmark is impossible because he does not run a fund ; instead , he recommends stocks for clients ' brokerage accounts .
Schiff , who holds a degree in finance and accounting from the University of California at Berkeley , is president and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital , a brokerage he founded in the mid-1990s that emphasizes international stocks , preferably with dividends .
Not everybody is a fan .
Schiff has been criticized for aggressively courting publicity to tout his doomsday message relating to U.S. equities and the domestic economy .
But he has been right on several key calls , notably the weakening greenback and his emphasis on international stocks , and he has helped his clients make money .
Barron 's caught up with him recently .
" The rest of the world has been selling us goods and hoarding our securities .
They are not going to be doing that anymore . "
– Peter Schiff Brad Trent
Barron's :
When did you turn bearish on the U.S. ?
Schiff :
A long time ago I worked as a retail broker at Shearson Lehman Brothers and I was selling tech stocks , and I was generally bullish .
I had difficulties with some of the problems in our economy , but I was recommending U.S. stocks .
I left Lehman in 1991 .
In the mid-1990s , when I was working for a small broker - dealer in California and then for my own firm , I started getting concerned about the dollar .
So I began getting some clients invested in some foreign stocks -- just to get out of the dollar a bit .
The dollar had a big drop , and then it started to rally in the late - 1990s , in conjunction with the tech bubble .
It was all part of foreigners ' efforts to try to participate in the Nasdaq 's bubble .
What kinds of stocks did you like in those days ?
Traditional value stocks with dividend yields .
I also liked commodities , so I was buying international oil stocks back when oil was under $ 20 a barrel .
The stocks I recommended were n't doing very well in '98 or ' 99 , especially after the Asian crisis , but they started doing better around 2000 .
I turned really , really bearish on the U.S. when I saw what the Federal Reserve was doing to prevent a recession in the early part of this decade , notably pumping a lot of liquidity into the system .
You continue to be very bearish on the U.S.
But have n't there been other times when there was lots of negative sentiment toward the U.S. , only to see another era of prosperity emerge ?
Such as the late 1980s , when there was concern that Japan would take over the U.S. economy .
Look at how that turned out .
Yes , but we have n't been through anything like what we are going through now .
The United States has really been living in a fool 's paradise , or a phony economy , probably for more than 20 years .
But our economy has been growing and getting bigger and bigger .
We have been able to convince the world to lend us money and to provide us with goods that we do n't produce and that we can't afford to pay for with exports .
And it has gotten to the point now where the problem is so big , especially since the real - estate bubble .
We 've now borrowed so much money from abroad .
Our trade deficits are now very big , and our industrial base and our infrastructure have been allowed to decay for so long , that we are now at a point that we can only survive as an economy thanks to the charity of the rest of the world .
They have provided us with all the goods that we can no longer produce because we lack the industrial capacity .
And they have to lend us the money because we do n't have any savings anymore .
What 's your take on oil prices ?
As oil prices are going up in the U.S. , they are not rising nearly as fast in other countries because their currencies are strengthening .
Ultimately , when currencies like the renminbi that are pegged to the dollar are allowed to float , I see the Chinese currency rising five - fold against the dollar .
That would make oil a lot cheaper in China relative to what it would cost in the U.S .
Speaking of China , how do you see things developing there and its impact on the U.S. economy ?
The whole science of economics , as I see it , is how do you satisfy unlimited demand with limited resources ?
China has more than one billion people .
It is not as if Americans are unique in wanting things .
It 's not as if the Chinese do n't want dishwashers .
The reason they do n't have those possessions is because they do n't have the purchasing power .
But they do have that power ; it 's just that their government is taking it away from them and giving it to us .
But it is Americans who can't afford these goods , because we can't produce them .
So if the renminbi is allowed to rise , then Chinese factory workers will be able to afford the products they are producing instead of shipping them over here .
That 's going to be a major , major boon for their economy .
So it sounds as if the U.S. will be relegated to second - or third - tier status .
The U.S. is in trouble .
We are a post - industrial society , which is the same as a pre-industrial society ; our manufacturing base has disintegrated .
It 's not nonexistent ; we still make some things and we are still competitive in some areas .
But on the whole , as a nation we are not competitive .
We are mainly a nation of a service sector and consumers , and that 's going to have to change .
Nor do we have the savings that we need to fund the transition .
What could go wrong with your scenario ?
Somehow , the U.S. could buy itself some additional time .
We could convince the world -- Europe and Asia -- that they need us , and that while propping up the U.S. economy is going to hurt them with more inflation , letting the U.S. collapse is going to be even worse .
Of course , none of that is true .
The truth , in my view , is that the cost of propping us up far exceeds the cost of letting the U.S. economy collapse .
But I think we are already in a pretty severe recession .
But is n't there an argument that once we clean up this housing mess -- along with the credit bubble , whenever that occurs -- the U.S. will be a lot closer to a bottom , where the outlook begins to improve ?
I do n't think that 's true .
The resolution to the housing problem is going to mean housing prices are going to be a lot lower than they are now , and most Americans are not going to have any home equity .
It 's going to mean that trillions of dollars will have been lost by the lenders .
When the home equity is gone , Americans are broke , as they do n't have any savings .
All they had was their home equity .
They were counting on their home equity , without which they will be unable to pay off their credit cards .
But do n't U.S. companies that do business abroad benefit from all of the trends you have outlined ?
Yes , they are going to benefit to the extent that they can generate higher sales abroad .
But ultimately the shareholders are not necessarily benefiting just because a multinational company earns more dollars .
If the dollars have less purchasing power , they are not necessarily better off .
The way I see it , we are just putting our goods on sale to sell more of those goods .
But if you want to look at U.S. corporate earnings in terms of euros , barrels of oil or gold bullion , these companies are not necessarily seeing a real increase in earnings .
Plenty of investors and financial advisers have decreased their allocations to U.S. stocks in recent years .
Why not do that instead of completely writing off the world 's largest economy ?
Individuals can make their own decisions .
I do n't see a way for the U.S. economy to avoid a major retrenchment .
There 's no way that U.S. assets are not going to be marked down relative to foreign assets .
Therefore , I would rather invest in the rest of the world .
There are plenty of people who for the whole decade of the 1990s were investing everywhere but Japan , which is the second biggest economy in the world .
Why were they excluding Japan ?
It was obvious that it was in decline .
I 'm saying the same thing about the United States .
I do n't care if it is the biggest economy in the world ; it is in decline .
There are going to be a lot of losses in the United States , so why do n't I avoid it ?
Worst - case scenario : I miss out on the U.S. market .
But what are the odds that it is going to outperform all the other major markets that I am investing in ?
And I can't see how the dollar is going to be moving up over time .
Why keep your business open here ?
Why not set up shop in Asia ?
Right now my business is helping Americans to preserve their wealth from a collapse of the U.S. dollar .
If I were to go to a different country , obviously I would have to come up with a different business .
I do n't think people in China need to protect their wealth ; they are going to do great .
My business works better here .
I could try to run the business from overseas , say the Cayman Islands or Australia , but I have friends and family here .
I 'm optimistic .
I 've supported political candidates in the U.S. , including Ron Paul , who ran for the Republican presidential nomination this year .
I 'm not writing America off .
But I 'm trying to educate people so that they understand that when this economy does collapse , it is not because of capitalism but that it 's because of too much government .
What kinds of stocks do you look for ?
The dividend is the most overlooked and important component of equity investing .
Capital appreciation is great , but that 's the icing ; the cake is the dividend yield .
I look for good dividend yields , but I want to get them in currencies that are gaining in value so that my clients can maintain their purchasing power here .
These companies are playing into the growing purchasing power of the rest of the world -- not the shrinking purchasing power of the United States .
The rest of the world has been selling us goods and hoarding our Treasuries and mortgage - backed securities .
They are not going to be doing that anymore .
They are going to spend their earnings on themselves .
How about a few stocks that you like ?
One of the mining stocks that I have been buying , although it has pulled back a lot , is Oxiana [ ticker : OXR.
Australia ] .
Oxiana and Ziniflex , another Australian mining company , just merged .
Another holding is an infrastructure play called Road King Infrastructure [ 1098 .
Hong Kong ] , which is listed in Hong Kong .
It 's also pulled back quite a bit .
I also like Singapore Petroleum [ SPC.
Singapore ] .
Those are three names I 've have been buying recently .
One is a play on the growing infrastructure in China , while the other two are ways to invest in resources .
A lot of people look at me and say , " Peter you are gloom and doom . "
I 'm not gloom and doom .
Well , you are pretty gloomy on investing in the U.S .
I 'm very negative on the U.S. economy .
But I 'm very optimistic on a lot of other economies .
A lot of people tell me , ' Peter , this does n't make any sense .
How can you be so dire and gloomy on the U.S. and yet so positive on the rest of the world ? '
That shows you I 'm not just gloom and doom .
I recognize that contrary to popular opinion , the U.S. economy has been a drag on the global economy , and that when the rest of the world stops subsidizing us , growth abroad will actually improve as a result .
Surely you see some light at the end of the tunnel for the U.S. ?
It is a long tunnel and the light is far away .
But , yes , in the end I 'm still optimistic that we can one day dig ourselves out of this hole .
Look at the Germans and Japanese .
They lost World War II , but here they are .
We did n't lose a war , but in many respects we did in that our factories have been destroyed even though they were n't bombed .
What 's a reasonable plan for the U.S. to right the economic ship ?
We are going to have to replenish our savings .
We are going to have to rebuild our industry .
We are going to have to repair our infrastructure .
All of that is possible , though it 's not easy .
It 's going to be very difficult given the current level of government we have , along with the types of taxation and regulations we have .
To really rebuild the economy , we are going to need cooperation from government and the government is going to have to get out of the way and make itself a much smaller burden on society , which means major reductions in government spending , taxes and regulations .
Thanks , Peter .
" George W. Bush brought death and chaos to Iraq on the basis of lies .
Now , as he staggers through the last months of his failed presidency , he is trying one more bit of trickery — forcing the Nuri Al - Maliki government to legitimize a long - term military occupation of Iraq in a treaty , which will make that sovereign country an American colony . " -- from an editorial in the " Arab News , " June 8 , 2008
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
This quote reveals how a huge majority of Arabs and Muslims feel about the Treaty of Permanent Occupation that the Bush administration is trying to cram down the throats of the Iraqi people .
It also fairly accurately describes how most Americans feel , because Bush wo n't even let our elected representatives of Congress know the full content of what is contained in his proposed " agreement " which is clearly a treaty that would require ratification in both houses .
The non-partisan government watchdog group , DownsizeDC , is sick and tired of Bush 's policy of total war , 24/7 , FOREVER .
They have proposed that our government adopt a " Golden Rule " foreign policy .
They want our government to simply " ... treat other people as we would want to be treated . "
The group believes that our politicians have used wrongs committed by others to " justify wrongs of their own . "
They want Americans to ask themselves one simple question :
Would we accept what we are asking the Iraqi people to accept ?
The proposed treaty requires that Iraq . . .
Allow the U.S. to build 58 permanent military bases on their soil
Grant U.S. control of Iraqi airspace up to 30,000 feet
Establish immunity from prosecution for U.S. troops and contractors
Permit the U.S. to determine when Iraq is at war with another country ( Iran for instance )
Agree to a two year notice to cancel the treaty
The administrators at DownsizeDC point out that , " President Bush wants to impose his preferred policy on the next president .
He also asserts that his ' agreement ' with Iraq will be an ' executive accord , ' NOT subject to ratification by the Senate . "
They contend that the President 's policy is not only unconstitutional , it also violates the Golden Rule and is dangerous to Americans .
These treaty proposals , coming in the wake of everything else our government has done -- invasions , renditions , torture , lack of due process -- massively increase the danger of blowback against the American people .
We believe it 's time to downsize the President 's reckless and overreaching foreign policy .
DownsizeDC's plan to accomplish this task is to demand that Congress ask the Iraqi government to hold a " Yes / No public referendum " on the U.S. occupation .
As the organization sees it :
It will be hard for either U.S. or Iraqi politicians to argue against letting the Iraqi people have their say .
Plus . . .
If the Iraqis vote for us to stay , then much of the Islamic world will accept that decision , but . . .
If they ask us to leave , then the moral problem of " we broke it , we own it " will disappear , allowing us to leave with grace .
The group says that George W. Bush should not have the power to tell another country what to do if the people of that country do n't want what he has to give .
They have set up a page for Americans who believe the United States should have a " Golden Rule " foreign policy to send that message to Congress .

One of my listeners sent me a scan of a letter that Dave Sim is sending out for anyone that wishes to correspond .
In the past he has been pretty open about exchanging viewpoints and debating , but this latest piece is just damn weird .
He is requesting that if you want to correspond with him , you must agree that he is not a misogynist .
Read for yourself and make your own opinion .
What do you think , is Dave in the right for limiting who has access to him , or is he furthering his descent into seclussion .
As an added bonus , do n’t forget about our interview with Dave from a couple of months ago , I doubt we would be able to interview him again .
I have heard statements questioning the validity of letter .
It ’s genuine , I have no reason to make up news .
On the other side of the coin , there is an online petition that the Cerebus Yahoo group has started .

Well is n't that a real pain in the ass .

Chelsea and Manchester United , the Premier League 's two representatives in tomorrow 's Champions League final , owe creditors £ 1.5 bn between them .
According to the latest accounts of Chelsea Limited , the company which owns the football club , Chelsea owed £ 736 m to all its creditors .
United 's accounts , also recently filed at Companies House , showed total creditors at £ 764 m .
Those unprecedented figures will fuel concern that at this time of English football 's greatest club triumph its clubs are carrying too much debt .
Covering the year to June 30 2007 , Chelsea 's accounts show that the club 's largest creditor was the owner himself , Roman Abramovich , who had poured £ 578 m into the club , not as a donation but as an interest - free loan .
As stated by the chief executive , Peter Kenyon , in February , Chelsea did not owe " external debt " to any bank .
However , with Abramovich's £ 578 m loan , introduced to sign players and pay wages since he bought the club in 2003 , plus general amounts owed , taxes and some categories listed among creditors for formal accounting purposes , Chelsea 's creditors stood at £ 736 m in total .
Chelsea 's director of communications , Simon Greenberg , confirmed that the £ 578 m , described in the accounts as " Other loan " , is indeed the loan from Abramovich .
Greenberg reiterated that Chelsea has no " external debt " and pointed out that the creditors included season - ticket holders for 2007 - 08 , whose money has technically to be treated as owed until the season is over , " and other normal operating creditors " .
The figure also included £ 36.3 m still owed on a Eurobond taken out by Chelsea 's previous owner , Ken Bates , in 1997 .
That , the last of Chelsea 's " external debt " , was then repaid last December .
Kenyon released headline figures from these accounts in February , highlighting that the club made a record turnover , £ 190.5 m , and that its losses were down from £ 80.2 m in 2005 - 06 to £ 75.8 m last year .
Kenyon said then that the club was in a healthy financial position , still aiming to break even by 2009 - 10 , partly because it did not owe money to outside creditors and retained Abramovich 's support .
" With the company being external debt free and our ownership clearly demonstrating continuing commitment to the long term , " Kenyon said , " I am very confident about the future . "
United 's accounts showed the club 's total creditors at £ 764 m .
United does have " external debt " - £ 666 m owed to financial institutions , including £ 152 m to hedge funds - taken on by the Glazer family when they bought the club in 2005 , then loaded on to United itself .
While United 's loans incurred interest of £ 81 m last year , the loan to Chelsea by Abramovich is interest - free .
Abramovich has funded Chelsea 's extraordinary acquisition of stars and , although transfers showed a profit last year , he continued to allow Chelsea to be run at a substantial loss .
Kenyon 's role is to transform Chelsea into a club which can survive on its own earnings .
In February he acknowledged it was an " ambitious " target to aim to be self - financing by 2009 - 10 but the accounts bear out commercial progress in all areas .
Having finished runners - up in the Premier League , won the FA Cup and League Cup and reached the Champions League semi-final , the club 's sponsorship , match - day and media income all increased to push total turnover 25 % up .
However , there is no doubt that the club remains wholly reliant on Abramovich 's continued funding .
Chelsea 's chairman , Bruce Buck , has stressed that Abramovich " loves football " and will not " walk away " from Chelsea .
If the owner 's enthusiasm were ever to wane , and Abramovich decided he did want his loan back , the accounts show that Chelsea would have 18 months to find the money .

Continuing in its tradition of offering up exactly what we want , Boston . com 's Big Picture blog has a ton of fantastic shots from the fencing action this week in Beijing , with the duelers ' silvery lamé space suits and crazy blinking helmets on full display .
I want one to wear , whether I 'm making toast ( flying crumb protection ) or sequencing dance beats in a giant pyramid ( extra rock action ) .
But why all the fancy lights ?

Basically , the future helmets only get busted out during big time Olympic competitions for , unsurprisingly , the aesthetics .
They simply display the exact same signal that 's been showing up on the scorer 's desk for decades using the same type of electrical system , says Giz fan Michael from fencing supply kings fencing .
net .
A simple open - closed circuit detects a charge from the weapon , and sends a signal to the scorekeeper indicating a hit .
The systems for the individual swords ( foil , epee , saber , etc ) vary slightly in terms of which body parts count , and what constitutes a " hit , " but all use the same basic setup .
The LEDs on the mask help the referee make quicker scoring calls and allow the duelers to know when a hit has been made instantly .
Sort of a shame that they 're are n't actually T1000 - style heads - up displays or something , but hey , they get an important job done better than in the past .

The system used to require tethers snaking back behind the fencers , but now a cigarette - pack sized transmitter handles the whole thing wirelessly .

WASHINGTON – In a shocking blast at Barack Obama that was caught on tape , the Rev. Jesse Jackson said , “ I wanna cut his nuts out . ”
He made the astonishingly vulgar remark as he accused the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of giving moral lectures to African - Americans .
“ See , Barack [ has ] been talking down to black people . . .
I wanna cut his nuts out , ” Jackson said .
His whispered comments – accompanied by his hand - miming a cutting motion – were picked up by a live mike before an interview on health care in Fox News Channel ’s Chicago studio Sunday .
In an effort to blunt the controversy , Jackson apologized publicly at a news conference before the tape aired last night on Bill O’Reilly ’s “ The Factor ” show on Fox News Channel .
“ It was not a public speech or a declaration , ” Jackson said at the news conference , although he admitted his language was “ regretfully crude ” and “ hurtful .
“ For any harm or hurt that this hot - mike conversation may have caused , I apologize , ” Jackson said earlier in a statement .
Jackson told The Associated Press he could n’t recall everything he ’d said , but couched the remarks as part of a discussion about Obama speaking to black churchgoers .
In such settings , Obama has urged greater emphasis on fatherhood , and most recently told students to stick with school and forget about careers as rap stars or pro basketball players .
Jackson said on the “ Fox & Friends ” mike that Obama was hurting his relationship with black voters , “ that the senator was cutting off his you - know - whats with the black people and black churches . ”
Jackson told CNN he called the Obama campaign to apologize , and reiterated his support .
“ My support for Senator Obama ’s campaign is wide , deep and unequivocal , ” he said .
“ I cherish this redemptive and historical moment . ”
O’Reilly said last night he had chosen not to air comments that would have been even more damaging to Jackson .
Obama ’s spokesman Bill Burton said Obama “ of course accepts Reverend Jackson ’s apology . ”
But the Rev. Al Sharpton admonished Jackson and cautioned against dividing black voters .
Obama “ is running for president of all Americans , not just African - Americans , ” he said .
We “ must be careful not to segregate Senator Obama and impose some litmus test that is unfair and unproductive . ”
Even Jesse Jackson Jr. , an Obama supporter and congressman from Chicago , condemned his dad ’s remarks .
“ I ’m deeply outraged and disappointed in Reverend Jackson ’s reckless statements about Senator Barack Obama , ” he said .

From the avalanche of articles and commentaries published by mainstream media outlets in recent weeks , one might easily get the impression that Barack Obama is in trouble with Jewish voters .
THE JEWISH QUESTION : Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama tried to allay concerns about his ability to win over Jewish voters with appearances like a May 22 town - hall meeting at B?nai Torah Congregation of Boca Raton in Florida .
As the Illinois senator — now the Democrats ’ presumptive presidential nominee — turns his attention to November , the national media has closely followed his overtures to the Jewish community , long a bedrock constituency for Democrats .
When Obama headed to South Florida recently , the media narrative that emerged focused on what was characterized as his uphill battle with the state ’s Jewish voters , many of them elderly .
The New York Times , in a front - page story appearing May 21 , catalogued the anxieties — which ranged from Israel and Iran to race and antisemitism — circulating in the Jewish community , along with falsehoods like “ Obama is an Arab ” and “ Al Qaeda is backing him . ”
( Reporting on the Times story , a Croatian Web site , Javno , summed up the situation under the more - than - dubious headline “ Ku Klux Klan Supports Obama , Jews Do Not . ” )
But as the discussion of Jewish ambivalence toward Obama reaches new levels of intensity , some observers are saying that the hand wringing is creating a skewed and potentially damaging picture of American Jewry whose support for Obama is , by several measures , quite strong .
“ Enough , ” wrote M.J. Rosenberg , director of policy analysis for the dovish Israel Policy Forum , in a May 23 column on the Web site Talking Points Memo .
“ The ridiculous focus of the media on the candidates ’ pandering to Jews is bad for Jews . ”
“ Jews have always been more progressive on matters of race than most other whites , ” he added .
“ But that does not mean all of us are .
We have our racists .
So does every other group . ”
The fate of the “ Jewish vote ” has , by now , become a perennial election - year topic , and its general outlines are drawn from undeniably relevant political facts : Except for Jimmy Carter in 1980 , no Democratic presidential candidate has failed to win over a majority of American Jews since at least 1928 .
With a higher - than - average propensity for voting and concentration in such swing states as Florida and Pennsylvania , American Jews have often made a difference in national campaigns .
The GOP , meanwhile , has courted the community aggressively in recent years , with debatable impact : According to a 2006 survey conducted by the American Jewish Committee , 15 % of American Jews now identify as Republican and nearly 30 % consider themselves independent .
President George W. Bush captured 22 % of the Jewish vote nationwide in 2004 , and John McCain — buoyed by his long pro-Israel record and by campaign support from close friend Joe Lieberman — is hoping to capture the highest share of the Jewish vote by any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan , who earned 39 % of the Jewish vote in 1980 .
That said , given that many demographic groups — from soccer moms to Nascar dads to working - class whites — have a way of making a difference in elections , some political observers have wondered whether the recent focus on Florida Jews is contributing to a public misconception about which religious groups are likely to be the most significant swing voters .
William Galston , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the impact of Catholics in recent elections , is among them .
“ I think it is fascinating that there has been so much attention focused on the two religious groups that are part of the base of the two political parties — evangelicals for Republicans and Jews for Democrats , and relatively little attention lavished on the two big swing groups , namely , Catholics and mainstream Protestants , ” said Galston , a former adviser to Bill Clinton , in an interview with the Forward .
“ I can pretty much prove that it was an outpouring of Catholics in Ohio and Florida that pushed [ President George W. Bush ] over the top in 2004 . ”
Statistics show that Jews are one of Obama ’s strongest white constituencies — a key base the Illinois senator is working overtime to shore up , rather than a uniquely problematic weak spot .
While Catholics , for example , have supported Hillary Clinton over Obama to a greater degree than white primary voters overall , Jewish voters have actually been more supportive of Obama than whites in general in seven out of eight primary states with significant Jewish populations — Florida included .
( In New York , Clinton ’s home state , Obama ’s share of the Jewish vote lagged four percentage points behind his performance with white voters . )
Moreover , a Gallup Poll released in May showed that 61 % of Jewish voters nationwide prefer Obama versus 32 % for McCain , compared with a margin in the general population of 45 % to 43 % .
Given this broader picture , some members of Florida ’s Jewish community worry that the focus on Jewish voters in recent weeks had created a false impression that Jewish voters are uniquely critical of the man overwhelmingly likely to be the country ’s first African American presidential nominee , when in reality Obama is reaching out to Jews in order to shore up a cornerstone of his base .
“ The [ May 21 ]
Times story showed a Jewish populace that is uninformed and fearful , ” said Rabbi David Steinhardt , the host of Obama ’s recent visit to B’nai Torah Congregation of Boca Raton , Fla .
“ The majority of my congregants are much more thoughtful and open to the truth than what we saw in that story . ”
Others worry that the media coverage has given the impression that Jewish voters care only about Israel .
“ There are so many of us who care profoundly about Israel and just as much about America , ” wrote Boca Raton resident Myriam Weinstein in a May 22 letter published in the Times .
“ As a 60 - plus Jewish resident of Boca Raton , Fla. , who is deeply committed to Israel , I refuse to be identified and pigeonholed with all the people who fit my demographic profile and whom you quoted in your article about Jewish voters in Florida . ”
Larry Sabato , a professor of politics at the University of Virginia , said the copious coverage of Jewish voters in recent weeks reflects the fact that “ elections are won at the margins ” and that even a relatively small number of Jewish voters could make a difference in swing states like Florida .
But he cautioned against putting too much stock in fears voiced during the waning days of the primary campaign .
“ What happens in May and what happens in November are two different things , ” Sabato wrote in an e-mail to the Forward .
“ Many defectors , Jewish and otherwise , will return to the Democratic fold by November . ”
Being a child in the '60s , one of my favorite toys was Mattel 's Thing Maker .
If you 're too young to have experienced the perilous thrill of creating a collection of plastic bugs by heating a colorful substance the Mattel designers playfully called " Goop " poured into metal molds baked on a potentially skin bubbling electric griddle , the creation process was far more satisfying than the final product .
This dangerous aspect was actually part of the product 's appeal ; if you were n't careful , you could get badly burned .
What also made the Thing Maker so fascinating was its ability to pour different color goop into different bug parts to ultimately create a unique mixture that satisfied an intrinsic inventive need .
While the end product provided passing interest to friends and family , the reward was almost entirely realized during the creative phase .
That sense of joyful wonder , playful construction and even sense of danger was resurrected both literally and metaphorically when I began exploring the learning potential of Bug Labs ' BUG -- an open embedded Linux - based combination of a BUGbase and four BUGmodules .
The BUGbase is a Java - programmable electronic base with various I/O ports : MicroUSB storage slot , 2 - line LCD display , buttons , a 4 - way joypad and four large interfaces ( two each on the top and bottom ) for Bug Labs ' variety of BUGmodules .
BUGmodules are individual modules that supply additional functionality to the BUGbase .
Four BUGmodules currently exist :
A color LCD screen ( BUGview ) .
A combined motion detector / accelerometer ( BUGmotion ) .
A GPS ( BUGlocate ) .
A 2 - megapixel color camera ( BUGcam2 MP ) .
A much needed WiFi module is in the works , but no release date was available at this time .
An active thread of BUGmodule ideas ranging from cell radios to infrared modules can be followed at buglabs.ideascale.com / .
While each of these components can be purchased separately , the best way to experience the BUG is to obtain the combined BUGbundle .
This is the edition I reviewed .
Bug Labs adopted the Apple packaging experience philosophy , as the BUGbundle is boxed in a sturdy , attractive , and innovative geometric design that folds out to reveal a snugly seated BUGbase and four BUGmodules along with a thick 4 - color card stock deck mapping the hardware and prompting new owners to follow the software download and installation steps at www.buglabs.net/start.
You can check out the BUGbundle un - boxing in this video .
Setup instructions are available for each of the the Linux , Mac OS X , and Windows platforms .
This is because the BUG SDK ( appropriately named " Dragonfly " ) is an Eclipse Perspective and , as such , can run within the same operating system environments that can host the Eclipse IDE .
This software distribution decision lets Bug Labs continually iterate on the evolving Dragonfly software without the added expense of stale CD - ROMs and ensures that its customers are obtaining the latest bits to interact with the device .
After considering the different OS platforms to plug the BUGbase into , I opted to use OSX 10.4 as it required the least amount of prep work and , unlike the other platforms , it did n't require any additional software driver installations .
This is not the case on other operating systems , including OSX 10.5 , because of the need to install a USB networking driver to talk to the BUGbase 's private network address of 10.10.10.10 .
Once the USB configuration has been set up , plugging in the BUGbase using the supplied USB cable and telnet'ing or secure shelling to its address verifies that it is ready to accept Dragonfly - constructed applications .
Unpacking , downloading , installing , and configuring application and device dependencies took me about 20 minutes although this setup time may take longer for those who do n't already have the latest Eclipse IDE downloaded and configured on their computer .

It 's one of the most dreaded problems associated with growing older - memory problems .
But dementia and even plain old " senior moments " do n't have to be inevitable with age .
Research is mounting that do - it - yourself strategies like continuing to challenge your brain by learning new things and exercise can help preserve your cognition as you age .
Now scientists have found that a delicious natural drink can actually improve memory in older adults who have already experienced early memory decline .
The brain power booster is n't anything exotic or rare , either - it is Concord grape juice .
A ground - breaking pilot study , led by Robert Krikorian , PhD , of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine , was recently presented at the 38th annual scientific meeting of the American Aging Society in Boulder , Colorado .
Dr. Krikorian and his research team gave 12 adults with early memory decline a total of 15 to 21 ounces of Concord grape juice or placebo daily ( the amount varied depending on body weight ) for 12 weeks .
This was the first placebo - controlled human study to investigate whether regular consumption of a polyphenol - rich food or beverage such as grape juice could positively impact age - related cognitive decline .
Polyphenols are found in a wide variety of phytonutrient - containing food , including grapes , and are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties .
Previous research has linked them to combating oxidative stress and suggested they could hold the key to preventing cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases .
The study participants who drank the Concord grape juice were found to have significant improvements when given learning tests .
The researchers concluded this suggests a measurable improvement in short - term memory retention - so adding Concord grape juice in the diet may provide benefit for older adults with early memory decline .
The evidence that a diet including phytonutrient - rich fruits , vegetables and juices may help slow and possibly even reverse age - related mental declines is especially good news for America 's aging Baby Boomer population .
The number of people 65 years of age and older will double to 70 million by 2030 and cases of age - related cognitive decline as well as dementia from Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and other causes are expected to soar .
In fact , a Duke University study published early this year in theconcluded that 22 percent over age 70 have mild cognitive problems and the National Institutes of Health estimates up to 4.5 million Americans have AD .
" A simple , easy - to - incorporate dietary intervention that could improve or protect memory function , such as drinking Concord grape juice daily , may be beneficial for the aging population .
These results with Concord grape juice are very encouraging and certainly warrant additional study , " Dr. Krikorian stated in a prepared statement for the media .

Holes in the Wall : Homeland Security Wo n’t Explain Why
the Mexican Border Wall Bypasses the Rich and Connected
By Melissa del Bosque — The Texas Observer
Monday 18 February 2008
Texas resident Eloisa Tamez wants to know why her land is getting a border wall , while a nearby golf course and resort remain untouched .
As the U.S. Department of Homeland Security marches down the Texas border serving condemnation lawsuits to frightened landowners , Brownsville resident Eloisa Tamez , 72 , has one simple question .
She would like to know why her land is being targeted for destruction by a border wall , while a nearby golf course and resort remain untouched .
Tamez , a nursing director at the University of Texas at Brownsville , is one of the last of the Spanish land grant heirs in Cameron County .
Her ancestors once owned 12,000 acres .
In the 1930s , the federal government took more than half of her inherited land , without paying a cent , to build flood levees .
Now Homeland Security wants to put an 18 - foot steel and concrete wall through what remains .
While the border wall will go through her backyard and effectively destroy her home , it will stop at the edge of the River Bend Resort and golf course , a popular Winter Texan retreat two miles down the road .
The wall starts up again on the other side of the resort .
“ It has a golf course and all of the amenities , ” Tamez says .
“ There are no plans to build a wall there .
If the wall is so important for security , then why are we skipping parts ? ”
Along the border , preliminary plans for fencing seem to target landowners of modest means and cities and public institutions such as the University of Texas at Brownsville , which rely on the federal government to pay their bills .
A visit to the River Bend Resort in late January reveals row after row of RVs and trailers with license plates from chilly northern U.S. states and Canadian provinces .
At the edge of a lush , green golf course , a Winter Texan from Canada enjoys the mild , South Texas winter and the landscaped ponds , where white egrets pause to contemplate golf carts whizzing past .
The woman , who declines to give her name , recounts that illegal immigrants had crossed the golf course once while she was teeing off .
They were promptly detained by Border Patrol agents , she says , adding that agents often park their SUVs at the edge of the golf course .
River Bend Resort is owned by John Allburg , who incorporated the business in 1983 as River Bend Resort , Inc . Allburg refused to comment for this article .
A scan of the Federal Election Commission and Texas Ethics Commission databases did not find any political contributions linked to Allburg .
Just 69 miles north , Daniel Garza , 76 , faces a similar situation with a neighbor who has political connections that reach the White House .
In the small town of Granjeno , population 313 , Garza points to a field across the street where a segment of the proposed 18 - foot high border wall would abruptly end after passing through his brick home and a small , yellow house he gave his son .
“ All that land over there is owned by the Hunts , ” he says , waving a hand toward the horizon .
“ The wall does n’t go there . ”
In this area everyone knows the Hunts .
Dallas billionaire Ray L. Hunt and his relatives are one of the wealthiest oil and gas dynasties in the world .
Hunt , a close friend of President George W. Bush , recently donated $ 35 million to Southern Methodist University to help build Bush ’s presidential library .
In 2001 , Bush made him a member of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , where Hunt received a security clearance and access to classified intelligence .
Over the years ,
Hunt has transformed his 6,000 - acre property , called the Sharyland Plantation , from acres of onions and vegetables into swathes of exclusive , gated communities where houses sell from $ 650,000 to $ 1 million and residents enjoy golf courses , elementary schools , and a sports park .
The plantation contains an 1,800 - acre business park and Sharyland Utilities , run by Hunt ’s son Hunter , which delivers electricity to plantation residents and Mexican factories .
The development ’s Web site touts its proximity to the international border and the new Anzalduas International Bridge now under construction , built on land Hunt donated .
Hunt has also formed Hunt Mexico with a wealthy Mexican business partner to develop both sides of the border into a lucrative trade corridor the size of Manhattan .
Jeanne Phillips , a spokesperson for Hunt Consolidated Inc. , says that since the company is private , it does n’t have to identify the Mexican partner .
Phillips says , however , that no one from the company has been directly involved in siting the fence .
“ We , like other citizens in the Valley , have waited for the federal government to designate the location of the wall , ” she says .
Garza stands in front of his modest brick home , which he built for his retirement after 50 years as a migrant farmworker .
For the past five months , he has stayed awake nights trying to find a way to stop the gears of bureaucracy from grinding over his home .
A February 8 announcement by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the agency would settle for building the fence atop the levee behind Garza ’s house instead of through it , which has given Garza some hope .
Like Tamez , he wonders why his home and small town were targeted by Homeland Security in the first place .
“ I do n’t see why they have to destroy my home , my land , and let the wall end there . ”
He points across the street to Hunt ’s land .
“ How will that stop illegal immigration ? ”
Most border residents could n’t believe the fence would ever be built through their homes and communities .
They expected it to run along the banks of the Rio Grande , not north of the flood levees – in some cases like Tamez ’s , as far as a mile north of the river .
So it came as a shock last summer when residents were approached by uniformed Border Patrol agents .
They asked people to sign waivers allowing Homeland Security to survey their properties for construction of the wall .
When they declined , Homeland Security filed condemnation suits .
In time , local landowners realized that the fence ’s location had everything to do with politics and private profit , and nothing to do with stopping illegal immigration .
In 2006 , Congress passed the Secure Fence Act , authored by Republican Congressman Peter King from New York .
The legislation mandated that 700 miles of double - fencing be built along the southern border from California to Texas .
The bill detailed where the fencing , or , as many people along the border call it , “ the wall , ” would be built .
After a year of inflamed rhetoric about the plague of illegal immigration and Congress ’s failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform , the bill passed with overwhelming support from Republicans and a few Democrats .
All the Texas border members of the U.S. House of Representatives , except San Antonio Republican Henry Bonilla , voted against it .
Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn voted for the bill .
On August 10 , 2007 , Chertoff announced his agency would scale back the initial 700 miles of fencing to 370 miles , to be built in segments across the southern border .
Chertoff cited budget shortages and technological difficulties as justifications for not complying with the bill .
How did his agency decide where to build the segments ?
Chad Foster , the mayor of Eagle Pass , says he thought it was a simple enough question and that the answer would be based on data and facts .
Foster chairs the Texas Border Coalition .
TBC , as Foster calls it , is a group of border mayors and business leaders who have repeatedly traveled to Washington for the past 18 months to try to get federal officials to listen to them .
Foster says he has never received any logical answers from Homeland Security as to why certain areas in his city had been targeted for fencing over other areas .
“ I puzzled a while over why the fence would bypass the industrial park and go through the city park , ” he says .
Despite terse meetings with Chertoff , Foster and other coalition members say the conversation has been one - sided .
“ I think we have a government within a government , ” Foster says .
“ [ This is ] a tremendous bureaucracy – DHS is just a monster . ”
The Observer called Homeland Security in Washington to find out how it had decided where to build the fence .
The voice mail system sputtered through a dizzying array of acronyms : DOJ , USACE , CBP , and USCIS .
On the second call a media spokesperson with a weary voice directed queries to Michael Friel , the fence spokesman for Customs and Border Protection .
Six calls and two e-mails later , Friel responded with a curt e-mail : “ Got your message .
Working on answers … ” it said .
Days passed , and Friel ’s answers never came .
Since Homeland Security was n’t providing answers , perhaps Congress would .
Phone conversations with congressional offices ranged from “ but they are n’t even building a wall ” to “ I do n’t know .
That ’s a good question . ”
At the sixth congressional office contacted , a GOP staffer who asked not to be identified , but who is familiar with the fence , says the fencing locations stemmed from statistics showing high apprehension and narcotic seizure rates .
This seems questionable , since maps released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers showed the wall going through such properties as the University of Texas at Brownsville – hardly a hotbed for drug smugglers and immigrant trafficking .
Questioned more about where the data came from , the staffer said she would enquire further .
The next day she called back .
“ The border fence is being handled by Greg Giddens at the Secure Border Initiative Office within the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office , ” she said .
Giddens is executive director of the SBI , as it is called , which is in charge of SBInet , a consortium of private contractors led by Boeing Co .
The group received a multibillion dollar contract in 2006 to secure the northern and southern borders with a network of vehicle barriers , fencing , and surveillance systems .
Companies Boeing chose to secure the southern border from terrorists include DRS Technologies Inc. , Kollsman Inc. , L - 3 Communications Inc. , Perot Systems Corp. , and a unit of Unisys Corp .
A February 2007 audit by the U.S. Government Accountability Office cited Homeland Security and the SBInet project for poor fiscal oversight and a lack of demonstrable objectives .
The GAO audit team recommended that Homeland Security place a spending limit on the Boeing contract for SBInet since the company had been awarded an “ indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract for 3 years with three 1 - year options . ”
The agency rejected the auditors ’ recommendation , saying 6,000 miles of border is limitation enough .
In a February 2007 hearing , Congressman Henry Waxman , a California Democrat and the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , had more scathing remarks for Giddens and the SBInet project .
“ As of December , the Department of Homeland Security had hired a staff of 98 to oversee the new SBInet contract .
This may seem like progress until you ask who these overseers are .
More than half are private contractors .
Some of these private contractors even work for companies that are business partners of Boeing , the company they are supposed to be overseeing .
And from what we are now learning from the department , this may be just the tip of the iceberg . ”
Waxman said of SBInet that “ virtually every detail is being outsourced from the government to private contractors .
The government is relying on private contractors to design the programs , build them , and even conduct oversight over them . ”
A phone call to Giddens at SBI is referred to Loren Flossman , who ’s in charge of tactical infrastructure for the office .
Flossman says all data regarding the placement of the fence is classified because “ you do n’t want to tell the very people you ’re trying to keep from coming across the methodology used to deter them . ”
Flossman also calls the University of Texas at Brownsville campus a problem area for illegal immigration .
“ I would n’t assume that these are folks that are n’t intelligent enough that if they dress a certain way , they ’re gonna fit in , ” he says .
Chief John Cardoza , head of the UT - Brownsville police , says the Border Patrol would have to advise his police force of any immigrant smuggling or narcotic seizures that happen on campus .
“ If it ’s happening on my campus , I ’m not being told about it , ” he says .
Cardoza says he has never come across illegal immigrants dressed as students .
Flossman goes on to say that Boeing is n’t building the fence , but is providing steel for it .
Eric Mazzacone , a spokesman for Boeing , refers the Observer to Michael Friel at Customs and Border Protection , and intercedes to get him on the phone .
Friel confirms that Boeing has just finished building a 30 - mile stretch of fence in Arizona , but insists other questions be submitted in writing .
Boeing , a multibillion dollar aero - defense company , is the second - largest defense contractor in the nation .
The company has powerful board members , such as William M. Daley , former U.S. secretary of commerce ; retired Gen. James L. Jones , former supreme allied commander in Europe ; and Kenneth M. Duberstein , a former White House chief of staff .
The corporation is also one of the biggest political contributors in Washington , giving more than $ 9 million to Democratic and Republican members of Congress in the last decade .
In 2006 , the year the Secure Fence Act was passed , Boeing gave more than $ 1.4 million to Democrats and Republicans , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
A majority of this money has gone to legislators such as Congressman Duncan Hunter , the California Republican who championed the Secure Fence Act .
In 2006 , Hunter received at least $ 10,000 from Boeing and more than $ 93,000 from defense companies bidding for the SBInet contract , according to the center .
During his failed bid this year for the White House , Hunter made illegal immigration and building a border fence the major themes of his campaign .
In early February 2008 , Chertoff asked Congress for $ 12 billion for border security .
He included $ 775 million for the SBInet program , despite the fact that congressional leaders still ca n’t get straight answers from Homeland Security about the program .
As recently as January 31 , Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee members sent a letter to Chertoff asking for “ greater clarity on [ the Customs and Border Protection office ’s ] operational objectives for SBInet and the projected milestones and anticipated costs for the project . ”
They have yet to receive a response .
Boeing continues to hire companies for the SBInet project .
And the congressional districts of backers of the border fence continue to benefit .
A recent Long Island Business News article trumpeted the success of Telephonics Corp. , a local business , in Congressman King ’s congressional district that won a $ 14.5 million bid to provide a mobile surveillance system under SBInet to protect the southern border .
While Garza and Tamez wait for answers , they say they are being asked to sacrifice something that ca n’t be replaced by money .
They are giving up their land , their homes , their heritage , and the few remaining acres left to them that they hoped to pass on to their children and grandchildren .
“ I am an old man .
I have colon cancer , and I am 76 years old , ” Garza says , resting against a tree in front of his home .
“ All I do is worry about whether they will take my home .
My wife keeps asking me , ‘ What are we going to do ? ' ”
Besides these personal tragedies , Eagle Pass Mayor Foster says there is another tragedy in store for the American taxpayer .
A 2007 congressional report estimates the cost of maintaining and building the fence could be as much as $ 49 billion over its expected 25 - year life span .
“ They are just going to push this problem on the next administration , and nobody is going to talk about immigration reform , and that ’s the illness , ” Foster says .
“ The wall is a Band - Aid on the problem .
And to blow $ 49 billion and not walk away with a secure border – that ’s a travesty . ”

I 've been using Travis CI fairly extensively since 2013 , when I moved my personal OSS projects from Bitbucket to GitHub .
It 's a great service and a much - appreciated boon to the open - source community .
However , since Travis announced that their .org variant is shutting down soon , I wanted to check out some of the alternatives , and GitHub actions ( GHA ) seemed very interesting .
So this week I 've migrated pycparser and a few of my other OSS projects over to GHA .
This turned out to be very easy !
Here 's a brief recap .
Workflow configuration
To activate GHA for pycparser , all I had to do is create the following YAML file as .github/workflows / ci.yml in the repository : name : pycparser - tests on : push : branches : - master pull_request : branches : - master jobs : build : runs-on : $ {{ matrix .os }} strategy : matrix : python-version : [ 2.7 , 3.6 , 3.7 , 3.8 ] os : [ ubuntu- latest , macos - latest , windows - latest ] steps : - uses : actions / checkout@v2 - name : Set up Python $ {{ matrix .
python-version }} uses : actions / setup - python@v2 with : python-version : $ {{ matrix .
python-version }} - name : Test run : | python tests/all_tests.py
Some notes :
This workflow fires on two kinds of events : pushes to the master branch and PRs to the master branch .
Each PR will have an automatic CI run for each change ( every new commit pushed ) .
It runs in multiple configurations : the cross-product of Python versions and OSes , as specified .
The run : entry is the command the runs the tests .
entry is the command the runs the tests .
While pycparser does n't have any dependencies , it 's easy to have those too by adding pip install $ whatever lines to run : before the actual test execution line .

Gynecomastia : Psychological Issues
Men have great difficulty with this disease and affliction and it is no laughing matter .
It causes great distress , emotional pain , self - consciousness , body and self - image type issues that have to be addressed , seperately , in tandem with and throughout the process or treatment plan .
Although the physcial medical part of the condition can be dealt with , with immediacy , gradual results over time , a deliberate effort has to be made , to deal with the emotional scarring , self - doubt , minority - type complex behaviour , self - acceptance , confidence etc. has to be worked on as well .
Even is weight loss or meds help with getting rid of the breasts , or breast reduction surgery has taken place , the breasts might be gone , but the problems for many has just begun – the medical success will not necessarily ‘ cure ’ what ails the sufferers of gyncomastia .
The medical treatments will not eliminate the underlying and resulting psycholocigal issues at hand and play here .
For all other causes and especially the more permanent ( seemingly ) , lingering conditions , where the tissue has started to harden and the women / female breasts have become more like fixtures , medical intervention and drastic steps , like surgery is the only known physical remedy to get rid of them for good .
Even if the signs , breasts themselves , tissue , excess female features , physical encumbrances are all gone , removed and lifted , many deeper , more layered , psychological scars will still linger and need to be addressed .
Self and body image repair , self - accpetance and confidence need to be restores .
Accepting the body and physical appearance , appreciating it for what it is , forms part of the healing .
You need to put the past , scars and what happened behind you and move on – come to terms with the reality , process that you have undergone and go beyond it , looking towards a healthy , balanced future – as a man with normal breasts again !
Do not allow the emotional impact , self - consciousness , embarrasment , ridicule of others , devastating emotions , feelings of shame , humiliation and such rule or ruin your life .
It is normal and natural to have these feelings – there is nothing wrong with you .
Your masculinity do not lie in your breasts , but in your chest one patient once said – it is about your heart , who you are , not what you look like or the problems that you face physcially with gynecomastia .
Self - hate needs to be dispelled in all areas of your life .
You are not deemed or rendered powerless or a victim by this condition – you can take control and deal effectively with the gynecomastia struggles as well as the accompanying anxiety
Do not subject yourself to taunting , self - consciousness or the fears and uncertainty that breast reduction and surgery might hold for you .
Educate and empower yourself , learning as much as you can about what ails and will help you get through it .
Regain control , reclaim your man-hood and no longer feel emasculated .
Healing is about more than physcial scars .
Allow for some time to deal and cope with all the challenges and effects that gynecomastia might have on your life .
If ye love wealth greater than liberty , the tranquility of servitude greater than the animating contest for freedom , go home from us in peace .
We seek not your counsel nor your arms .
Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you ; and may posterity forget that ye were once our countrymen .
~ Samuel Adams
It had been forty - four years since I last attended a political convention .
I was part of my state ’s delegation to the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco , an experience that helped push me over the threshold in my abandonment of political action .
But last week I found myself headed to Rochester to sit in — as an observer — on the Minnesota Republican State Convention .
My Minnesota daughter and her husband have been very active Ron Paul supporters , with her husband serving as a delegate to this convention .
Perhaps for the same reason that leads people to visit the site of a train - wreck , I decided to attend .
My initial impression of this convention was that the atmosphere was so unlike those in which I had participated decades before .
It was not that the Ron Paul delegates were outvoted by the McCain supporters : that ’s just part of the convention process as it was , in 1964 , when we Goldwater supporters greatly outnumbered the competing Bill Scranton contingent .
But there was a civility and respect for procedural regularities that governed earlier conventions , unlike what I witnessed in Rochester last week .
The contrast could be stated , metaphorically , as the difference between eating in a French restaurant and a twenty - four - hour truck stop .
The carnival began , rudely enough , when Ron Paul was denied access to a convention center room he had reserved for a speech .
At about 7:30 Saturday morning , several hundred Paul supporters — many of them delegates — gathered in a park area next to the convention center to listen to their candidate .
His impassioned and focused appeal to reason and principle was in sharp contrast to the plethora of vacuous and contradictory platitudes to be voiced at the convention by party leaders and their loyalists .
If there was one sentiment that dominated this convention , it was the stark fear , by the party faithful , that Ron Paul ’s message might actually be heard by the delegates .
It was not so much , I think , that the GOP establishment feared the kind of conversion that would lead the convention to select a slate of Paul delegates to attend the national convention in September .
The concern , rather , was that Paul ’s message might remind Republicans of the importance of policies driven by moral principles ; that ideas do have consequences ; and that the party and its officials now languish in a lifeless cesspool .
While it was clear to all that John McCain would become the party ’s nominee , it was also evident that the party regulars did not want to be reminded of just how morally and intellectually bankrupt they had become .
In place of the principled behavior advocated by Ron Paul and his supporters , the GOP regulars offered the flimsy substitute for “ common sense , ” an amorphous standard that can be used to rationalize anything a speaker favors .
Just how far the conventioneers would go to suppress any Paulist sentiment was demonstrated quite early .
The party had enacted a rule requiring anyone who wished to be considered as a potential delegate to the national convention to go to Rochester , before the convention even began , to meet with a nominating committee .
Many of the Paul delegates were not aware of this rule and , as a consequence , did not meet with this committee .
They were thus not allowed to be considered as national delegates .
Someone then noted that neither Governor Tim Pawlenty nor Senator Norm Coleman had met with this committee either , and thus could not be selected as delegates to the national convention .
The GOP hierarchy was thus faced with a situation they dreaded , namely , the “ fair and open process ” that Ron Paul ’s state coordinator had asked for prior to the convention .
Not to worry , the convention delegates voted to suspend this rule for the purpose of allowing McCain supporters Pawlenty and Coleman , by name , to be treated as exceptions .
Thus , while the Democratic Party circumvents the “ smoke - filled - room ” image of politics by allowing establishment favorites to have the power of “ Super - Delegates , ” the Minnesota GOP achieved a similar result through preferential “ exceptionalism ” for its top officials !
The spectacle — in both parties — amounts to a playing out of the Orwellian principle that “ all animals are equal , but some are equal than others . ”
The Republican state chairman , Ron Carey , rationalized the double standard by noting that becoming a delegate to the national convention “ is not an entry - level job .
We looked at people who truly had quality , not just people who raised their hand at the last minute . ”
( Translation : preferences should be given to those preferred by the establishment hierarchy .
Ordinary people need not envision having a meaningful voice within the GOP ( i.e. , Gaggle of Ossified Plutocrats ) . )
In his speech to the convention , Gov. Pawlenty declared that “ ideas and values matter ” — but not , of course , if it is the ideas and values expressed by Ron Paul ! — and that , once the convention was over “ we need to be united . ”
The latter comment could be translated as “ once the convention is over , you Ron Paul people need to go out and work for John McCain . ”
As he finished his talk , the governor apologized for having to leave , because he had “ to go to a troop deployment . ”
I wondered why he failed to mention going to the Red Cross to donate blood !
A GOP party spokesman went further to utter one of the most witless of all comments : “ From our perspective , John McCain is the nominee and Ron Paul lost .
It ’s time to move on and unite as a party . ”
If “ McCain is the nominee , ” then what purpose was served by this convention , or primaries later to be held in other states ?
For that matter , why have a national convention at all , if the nomination of McCain is fait accompli ?
This is doubtless what motivated the befuddled John McCain to propose beginning the McCain - Obama debates now , making the national convention a meaningless ritual which could only lead to mischief ( i.e. , Ron Paul getting to address the convention with alternative ideas that could disrupt the establishment script ) .
“ Ron Paul lost ” ?
In what race was he allowed to compete — whether by the GOP hierarchy or the mainstream media — on the same basis as the candidates with the political establishment ’s seal of approval ?
The Minnesota convention — a microcosm of the charades produced in other states — provided an example of Kurt Vonnegut ’s “ handicapper general . ”
If Tiger Woods was required to wear ten - pound lead weights on each of his arms in a golf tournament , what meaning would attach to the statement “ Tiger Woods lost ” by a tourney winner ?
One after another did convention speakers come to the platform perch to mouth the empty , contradictory , and falsely - premised bromides the majority of the delegates had come to hear .
Despite the well - established fact that individual liberty is diminished by wars , a former army colonel recited the establishment party - line that our freedom was protected by soldiers who fought and died in wars .
Perhaps sensing the gullibility of his audience , he increased the ante by declaring “ your military is winning in Iraq . ”
Boobus swooned .
The outpouring of platitudes continued .
We must “ remain true to our principles , ” one party official chanted while another opined : “ I ’m not interested in asking how we got to where we are . ”
( As to the last comment , I wonder how well that defense might go over if uttered by a drunk driver who had just precipitated a fatal multi-car pileup ? )
While on the subject of drunkenness , I was rather amused by speaker references to a GOP women ’s group known as the “ Pink Elephants . ”
The Republican national committeeman urged his fellows to “ get over the pessimism ” ( i.e. , get beyond reality ) .
Various congressional candidates stated that the GOP was the party that supports life in all its forms ( except , of course , for the hundreds of thousands of foreigners who have n’t the good sense to get out of the way of American bombs and soldiers fighting for our “ freedom ” ) .
One congressional hopeful told his cheering audience that if Iran develops nuclear weapons , “ action should be taken ” ( a comment that elicited strong boos from , presumably , the Ron Paul supporters ) .
The state chairman rose to confirm to one - and - all just how far the GOP had plummeted .
After telling the delegates that his highest priority in life was being a servant to Jesus , he went on to inform them that high oil prices were related to Middle Eastern terrorists .
( Whether the bogeyman “ terrorists ” were also responsible for increased food prices and airline fares , rising unemployment , home foreclosures , the collapse of the dollar , inflation , and other economic dislocations , the man did not say . )
He did add that the government “ must protect its citizens from future terrorism ” — an apparent endorsement of the war crime known as “ pre-emptive war ” — to which , again , Boobus roared his approval .
While I felt a good deal of sympathy for the Ron Paul supporters — who presented the only solid base of decency I saw exhibited — I do think that if these people want to participate in politics , they need to become adept at playing the procedural and tactical games that go with it without , in the process , becoming a part of the problem .
I noticed , for instance , that there were three - floor microphones from which delegates could address the chair .
Around each of these microphones were some ten to twelve apparent McCain supporters not waiting to ask any questions , but to block access by any of the Paulists .
As I watched this , I was reminded of visits I had made to China where I observed how effectively the Chinese were able to get through crowds with a pair of sharp elbows , a tactic the Paul supporters might have adopted .
One of the most dehumanizing sights at this convention — one I trust libertarians would never emulate — occurred when a vote was to be taken .
McCain supporters — with their identifiable red hats — went up and down the aisles holding up signs that read either “ yes ” or “ no ” depending upon their desired outcome .
To treat one ’s own supporters like Pavlovian subjects was disgusting , although I did not see any yummy snacks handed out to the delegates to reinforce their conditioned reflexes .
The GOP paranoia over the Ron Paul contingent got the best of the convention chairman who , even prior to the agenda item “ other business ” being taken up , moved to adjourn the convention !
The fear that the Paulists might use this period to further terrify the delegates with the specter of moral and philosophical integrity was not enough to overcome the concern for practitioners of parliamentary procedure , and the motion to adjourn was withdrawn .
Perhaps my greatest sympathy , however , went out to a man who was n’t even in attendance : Jesus .
I am not a religious person , but I do believe a man like this deserved far better treatment than he got from this crowd .
Speaker after speaker expressed his or her love and devotion to Jesus , at the same time cheering on any and every expression of pro-war sentiment .
When one delegate — presumably of Ron Paul ’s persuasion — made a motion to allow those who opposed the Iraq War to be heard , he was greeted with a thunderous chorus of boos .
I imagined what might have transpired had Jesus been a delegate and asked to address the convention on the essence of his message : love and peace .
After the boos had subsided , I suspect the sergeant - at - arms would have been instructed to go to a hardware store for a box of nails !
It was telling that I did not once hear the word “ peace ” expressed at this convention .
In the course of my numerous trips around the sun , I do n’t know when I have previously witnessed such a collective insistence upon dishonesty , contradiction , and unprincipled direction , all held together by empty rhetoric .
A group of people lusting for nothing greater than a pro-rata share of the power they envisioned trickling down to them was pathetic .
That the convention ended on an address by Karl Rove — one of the principal architects of the catastrophe with which the GOP and the Democrats have infected America — is a testimony to a party in a terminal state .
Various speakers told the delegates “ we must get the Republican message out ! ”
Here is a party that professes love for Jesus and respect for life even as it insists upon present and future wars that have thus far killed more than a million innocents ; that babbles its bromides about “ liberty ” even as it expands police powers , surveillance , imprisonment without trial , and the use of torture ; that speaks of the dangers of runaway government spending while pouring billions of dollars into war machinery and the pockets of corporations supplying it ; and which , at one of its own state conventions , insists upon a disparate application of rules applicable to others in order to give preferential treatment to established officials .
This is the “ Republican message ” — as well as the Democratic one — and the young adults who throng to Ron Paul in search of a different message are evidence that , among a growing number , it is being received and rejected .

OpenSSH 5.1 released
From : Damien Miller < djm-AT-cvs.openbsd.org >
To : lwn - AT-lwn.net Subject : Announce : OpenSSH 5.1 released Date : Mon , 21 Jul 2008 18:11:49 - 0600 ( MDT ) Message -ID : <200807220011.m6M0BnI3026201@cvs.openbsd.org >
OpenSSH 5.1 has just been released .
It will be available from the mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly .
OpenSSH is a 100 % complete SSH protocol version 1.3 , 1.5 and 2.0 implementation and includes sftp client and server support .
We have also recently completed another Internet SSH usage scan , the results of which may be found at http://www.openssh.com/usage.html
Once again , we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued support of the project , especially those who contributed code or patches , reported bugs , tested snapshots or donated to the project .
More information on donations may be found at : http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Changes since OpenSSH 5.0 =========================
Security : * sshd ( 8 ) : Avoid X11 man - in - the - middle attack on HP / UX ( and possibly other platforms ) when X11UseLocalhost=no
When attempting to bind ( 2 ) to a port that has previously been bound with SO_REUSEADDR set , most operating systems check that either the effective user - id matches the previous bind ( common on BSD - derived systems ) or that the bind addresses do not overlap ( Linux and Solaris ) .
Some operating systems , such as HP / UX , do not perform these checks and are vulnerable to an X11 man - in - the - middle attack when the sshd_config ( 5 ) option X11UseLocalhost has been set to " no " - an attacker may establish a more - specific bind , which will be used in preference to sshd 's wildcard listener .
Modern BSD operating systems , Linux , OS X and Solaris implement the above checks and are not vulnerable to this attack , nor are systems where the X11UseLocalhost has been left at the default value of " yes " .
Portable OpenSSH 5.1 avoids this problem for all operating systems by not setting SO_REUSEADDR when X11UseLocalhost is set to no .
This vulnerability was reported by sway2004009 AT hotmail.com .
New features : * Introduce experimental SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualisation to ssh ( 1 ) and ssh - keygen ( 1 ) .
Visual fingerprinnt display is controlled by a new ssh_config ( 5 ) option " VisualHostKey " .
The intent is to render SSH host keys in a visual form that is amenable to easy recall and rejection of changed host keys .
This technique inspired by the graphical hash visualisation schemes known as " random art [ * ] " , and by Dan Kaminsky 's musings at 23C3 in Berlin .
Fingerprint visualisation in is currently disabled by default , as the algorithm used to generate the random art is still subject to change . [*]
" Hash Visualization : a New Technique to improve Real - World Security " , Perrig A. and Song D. , 1999 , International Workshop on Cryptographic Techniques and E - Commerce ( CrypTEC '99 )
http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/va... * sshd_config ( 5 ) now supports CIDR address / masklen matching in " Match address " blocks , with a fallback to classic wildcard matching .
For example : Match address 192.0.2.0/24,3ffe:ffff::/32,!10 .*
PasswordAuthentication yes * sshd ( 8 ) now supports CIDR matching in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys from= " ... " restrictions , also with a fallback to classic wildcard matching .
* Added an extended test mode ( - T ) to sshd ( 8 ) to request that it write its effective configuration to stdout and exit .
Extended test mode also supports the specification of connection parameters ( username , source address and hostname ) to test the application of sshd_config (5 ) Match rules .
* ssh ( 1 ) now prints the number of bytes transferred and the overall connection throughput for SSH protocol 2 sessions when in verbose mode ( previously these statistics were displayed for protocol 1 connections only ) .
* sftp-server ( 8 ) now supports extension methods statvfs@openssh.com and fstatvfs@openssh.com that implement statvfs ( 2 ) - like operations .
( bz # 1399 ) * sftp ( 1 ) now has a " df " command to the sftp client that uses the statvfs@openssh.com to produce a df ( 1 ) - like display of filesystem space and inode utilisation ( requires statvfs@openssh.com support on the server ) * Added a MaxSessions option to sshd_config ( 5 ) to allow control of the number of multiplexed sessions supported over a single TCP connection .
This allows increasing the number of allowed sessions above the previous default of 10 , disabling connection multiplexing ( MaxSessions=1 ) or disallowing login / shell / subsystem sessions entirely ( MaxSessions=0 ) .
* Added a no-more-sessions@openssh.com global request extension that is sent from ssh ( 1 ) to sshd ( 8 ) when the client knows that it will never request another session ( i.e. when session multiplexing is disabled ) .
This allows a server to disallow further session requests and terminate the session in cases where the client has been hijacked .
* ssh - keygen ( 1 ) now supports the use of the -l option in combination with - F to search for a host in ~/.ssh / known_hosts and display its fingerprint .
* ssh - keyscan ( 1 ) now defaults to " rsa " ( protocol 2 ) keys , instead of " rsa1 " .
* Added an AllowAgentForwarding option to sshd_config ( 8 ) to control whether authentication agent forwarding is permitted .
Note that this is a loose control , as a client may install their own unofficial forwarder .
* ssh ( 1 ) and sshd ( 8 ) : avoid unnecessary malloc / copy / free when receiving network data , resulting in a ~ 10 % speedup * ssh ( 1 ) and sshd ( 8 ) will now try additional addresses when connecting to a port forward destination whose DNS name resolves to more than one address .
The previous behaviour was to try the only first address and give up if that failed .
( bz # 383 ) * ssh ( 1 ) and sshd ( 8 ) now support signalling that channels are half - closed for writing , through a channel protocol extension notification " eow@openssh.com " .
This allows propagation of closed file descriptors , so that commands such as : " ssh - 2 localhost od / bin / ls | true " do not send unnecessary data over the wire .
( bz # 85 ) * sshd ( 8 ) : increased the default size of ssh protocol 1 ephemeral keys from 768 to 1024 bits .
* When ssh ( 1 ) has been requested to fork after authentication ( " ssh - f " ) with ExitOnForwardFailure enabled , delay the fork until after replies for any - R forwards have been seen .
Allows for robust detection of - R forward failure when using - f. ( bz # 92 ) * " Match group " blocks in sshd_config ( 5 ) now support negation of groups .
E.g. " Match group staff , !guests " ( bz # 1315 ) * sftp ( 1 ) and sftp - server ( 8 ) now allow chmod - like operations to set set [ ug ] id / sticky bits .
( bz # 1310 ) * The MaxAuthTries option is now permitted in sshd_config ( 5 ) match blocks .
* Multiplexed ssh ( 1 ) sessions now support a subset of the ~ escapes that are available to a primary connection .
( bz # 1331 ) * ssh ( 1 ) connection multiplexing will now fall back to creating a new connection in most error cases .
( bz # 1439 bz #1329 ) * Added some basic interoperability tests against Twisted Conch .
* Documented OpenSSH 's extensions to and deviations from the published SSH protocols ( the PROTOCOL file in the distribution ) * Documented OpenSSH 's ssh-agent protocol ( PROTOCOL.agent ) .
Bug and documentation fixes * Make ssh ( 1 ) deal more gracefully with channel requests that fail .
Previously it would optimistically assume that requests would always succeed , which could cause hangs if they did not ( e.g. when the server runs out of file descriptors ) .
( bz # 1384 ) * ssh ( 1 ) now reports multiplexing errors via the multiplex slave 's stderr where possible ( subject to LogLevel in the mux master ) .
* ssh ( 1 ) and sshd ( 8 ) now send terminate protocol banners with CR+LF for protocol 2 to comply with RFC 4253 .
Previously they were terminated with CR alone .
Protocol 1 banners remain CR terminated .
( bz # 1443 ) * Merged duplicate authentication file checks in sshd ( 8 ) and refuse to read authorised_keys and . shosts from non-regular files .
( bz # 1438 ) * Ensure that sshd ( 8 ) 's umask disallows at least group and world write , even if a more permissive one has been inherited .
( bz # 1433 ) * Suppress the warning message from sshd ( 8 ) when changing to a non-existent user home directory after chrooting .
( bz # 1461 ) * Mention that scp ( 1 ) follows symlinks when performing recursive copies .
( bz # 1466 ) * Prevent sshd ( 8 ) from erroneously applying public key restrictions leaned from ~/.ssh / authorized_keys to other authentication methods when public key authentication subsequently fails .
( bz # 1472 ) * Fix protocol keepalive timeouts - in some cases , keepalive packets were being sent , but the connection was not being closed when the limit for missing replies was exceeded .
( bz # 1465 ) * Fix ssh ( 1 ) sending invalid TTY modes when a TTY was forced ( ssh - tt ) but stdin was not a TTY .
( bz # 1199 ) * ssh ( 1 ) will now exit with a non -zero exit status if ExitOnForwardFailure was set and forwardings were disabled due to a failed host key check .
* Fix MaxAuthTries tests to disallow a free authentication try to clients that skipped the protocol 2 " none " authentication method .

RNC aims at Obama 's elite education
Even as Barack Obama takes eight days off from the campaign trail to vacation in Hawaii , where he lived for much of his youth , the Republican National Committee is again attempting to paint the Democrat as an out - of - touch elitist , this time in a mock “ Barack Obama ’s Hawaii Travel Guide ” tweaking the Democrat for having attended an elite prep school there .
“ Barack Obama ’s Hawaii Travel Guide , ” e-mailed to reporters on Friday , lists four " destinations , " among them the beach locals claim is the one where Obama was photographed in his swim trunks in a shot that ran in People magazine early last year , and " Punahou School , a coeducational college preparatory day school " that Obama attended " from 1971 to 1979 .
The school campus covers 76 acres at the edge of the Manoa Valley . "

Obama , raised by a singe mother , entered the prestigious school at age ten on a scholarship .
“ No one means to demean the academic successes of Barack Obama or the schools he attended , ” said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
“ The RNC and this campaign have sought to simply point out that on his Hawaii travels , there are certain landmarks reporters will likely see and this was a way to put those on the map . ”
Obama 's elite schooling may prove a risky topic for McCain , who attended St. Stephen ’s , an exclusive school in Alexandria , Va. , and then Episcopal High , a private boarding school in the same city , in the 1950s .
The son and grandson of Navy admirals , he ended up at the Naval Academy , where , as he often reminds voters , he finished near the bottom of his graduating class .
“ While John McCain went to private school , he also went to public university , ” said Bounds .
“ The Naval Academy is as public as public gets , ” he added , noting that a four - year military commitment is required following school .
Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt declined to comment on the latest iteration of a subject previously raised by Hawaii Sen .
Daniel Inouye , a Hillary Rodham Clinton backer who attended a public school down the road from Punahou , and who cracked before the state 's primary that the private school “ was not school for the impoverished . ”
Obama reportedly responded that he had attended on scholarship and added , “ Shame on Danny for trying to pull that stunt . "
In this time of financial strain on physicians and the government reimbursement system we once again need to address the question — should doctors unionize ?
Recently , a group of physician picketed Capitol Hill to denounce continue reimbursement cuts .
This results in a temporary stay of a planned 20 % cut for next year .
As many doctors will agree , we are facing difficult times and many physicians are looking at other ways to create income to support their practice and their families .
Unions have been around for a long time .
They typically are based on industry , require a percentage of income to join , and have strong leadership to negotiate salaries and benefits .
Businesses have never liked unions as they increase the cost of work and often lead to such cumbersome rules and restrictions that ultimately may limit productivity .
In the medical profession , unionization could have significant bargaining power among physicians or among specialists .
For example , if we take the example of ophthalmologists who take care of cataracts and do eye surgery , the unionization and collective bargaining could single handedly dictate the terms and types of care that all people in this country receive for eye care .
It could result in basically monopolization and anti-trust issues in the eye care industry .
Without such unionization , ophthalmologists ( and all other physicians ) are at the mercy of the government payer .
If the government wants to decrease reimbursement then we must accept it .
The alternative is for doctors to stop accepting Medicare and to fight back .
For many physicians , this goes against the entire reason that we entered medicine — to take care of people .
Some doctors are doing it , others are trying it out with mixed success .
But one common theme emerges from these doctors — they are happier for doing so .
If doctors start doing this in mass , many patients will be left out on the street with nobody to take care of them .
Are we as a country ready for this ?
Are physicians as a group ready to continue to accept lower payments ?
Should physicians unionize and collectively bargain for better reimbursements ?
Barack Obama accepted the Democratic nomination for president on Thursday as an estimated 38 million viewers watched on television , setting a new record for convention viewership , according to Nielsen Media Research .
Mr. Obama ’s speech — a historic one given his status as the first African American nominee of a major political party — reached significantly more viewers than the comparable addresses in 2004 .
Coverage of John Kerry ’s acceptance speech in 2004 had 24.4 million viewers ; coverage of George W. Bush ’s convention speech that same year drew 27.5 million .
The audience estimate of 38.3 million means that Mr. Obama ’s speech reached more viewers than the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing , the final “ American Idol ” or the Academy Awards this year , the Associated Press notes .
Furthermore , the four - night Democratic convention ranks as the most - watched convention of either party , Democratic or Republican , since Nielsen began measuring conventions in 1960 .
The four nights of “ common coverage ” by networks — 10 to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday — were viewed by an average of 22.4 million households , Nielsen said Friday .
Previously , the highest - rated Democratic convention occurred in 1980 with 20.5 million households watching , and the highest - rated Republican convention occurred in 1976 with 21.9 million households watching .
Comparisons to previous conventions must include a number of important caveats .
For one thing , until the 1980s conventions were shown on just three networks , and they were covered in greater length than they are now .
This year ’s conventions are being shown on at least ten TV channels .
Additionally , consumers have the option to record the convention and play it back later using a digital video recorder , and those viewers wo n’t be counted for weeks .
Perhaps most significantly , this convention is being streamed online on a number of different Web sites , and the Internet audience will be hard , if not impossible , to measure .
By any measurement , this convention was a popular one among viewers .
Early ratings from Nielsen — subject to revision later in the day — suggested that CNN had reached a milestone on Thursday , with more than 8 million viewers during the 10 p.m. hour , more than any of the broadcast networks .
If confirmed by Nielsen this afternoon , the ratings would represent CNN ’s first time topping the broadcast networks .
( Fox News Channel defeated the broadcasters during the Republican convention in 2004 . )
The 38 million figure from Nielsen includes the audience on ten networks : ABC , CBS , NBC , CNN , FOX News Channel , MSNBC , BET , TV One , Univision and Telemundo .
It does not include PBS or C - SPAN , which also carried the address live .
PBS estimated that it averaged 3.5 million viewers between 8 and 11 p.m .

The CBC reports :
A Russian general says the recently negotiated deal to allow the United States to place a missile interceptor base in Poland “ cannot go unpunished . ”
Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy chief of the Russian general staff , made the comment to reporters on Friday .
Nogovitsyn was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Poland was risking attack by agreeing to the deal .
It should be obvious by now the Russians will no longer tolerate the U.S. deploying missile “ defense ” systems on their border and if the neocons continue to do so Russia will attack the NATO ’s client states .
“ The Parties of NATO agreed that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all , ” states the treaty .
In other words , if Russia takes out Poland ’s “ missile defense shield , ” there will be war in Europe .
Not just any old war , mind you , but a nuclear war .
“ President Putin has warned the US that its deployment of a new anti-missile network across Eastern Europe would prompt Russia to point its own missiles at European targets and could trigger nuclear war , ” the Times Online reported last June .
“ We have brought all our heavy weapons beyond the Urals and reduced our military forces by 300,000 .
But what do we have in return ?
we see that Eastern Europe is being filled with new equipment , two positions in Bulgaria and Romania , as well as radar in the Czech Republic , and missile systems in Poland .
What is happening ?
Unilateral disarmament of Russia is happening , ” said Putin .
Poland further angered Russia when president and former childhood actor Lech Kaczyński and his “ Baltic counterparts called for a NATO action plan for Georgia on Wednesday , saying membership is the only way to prevent future ‘ aggression and occupation ’ after the recent Russia - Georgia conflict , ” reports by Monsters and Critics .
As F. William Engdahl writes , the so - called missile defense deal with Poland moves the world closer to nuclear war :
The signing on August 14 of an agreement between the governments of the United States and Poland to deploy on Polish soil US ‘ interceptor missiles ’ is the most dangerous move towards nuclear war the world has seen since the 1962 Cuba Missile crisis .
Far from a defensive move to protect European NATO states from a Russian nuclear attack , as military strategists have pointed out , the US missiles in Poland pose a total existential threat to the future existence of the Russian nation .
The Russian Government has repeatedly warned of this since US plans were first unveiled in early 2007 .
Now , despite repeated diplomatic attempts by Russia to come to an agreement with Washington , the Bush Administration , in the wake of a humiliating US defeat in Georgia , has pressured the Government of Poland to finally sign the pact .
The consequences could be unthinkable for Europe and the planet .
For NATO , however , such a scenario is not unthinkable .
“ The west must be ready to resort to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to try to halt the ‘ imminent ’ spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction , according to a radical manifesto for a new Nato by five of the west ’s most senior military officers and strategists , ” the Guardian reports .
Calling for root - and - branch reform of Nato and a new pact drawing the US , Nato and the European Union together in a “ grand strategy ” to tackle the challenges of an increasingly brutal world , the former armed forces chiefs from the US , Britain , Germany , France and the Netherlands insist that a “ first strike ” nuclear option remains an “ indispensable instrument ” since there is “ simply no realistic prospect of a nuclear - free world ” .
Nogovitsyn said that Russia ’s military doctrine sanctions the use of nuclear weapons “ against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them . ”
According to Nogovitsyn , that would include elements of so - called strategic deterrence systems , reports the Associated Press .
The neocons welcome this nuclear brinkmanship as the “ official return of history , ” as Robert Kagan deemed it on the pages of the Washington Post .
Kagan and the neocons , no doubt , have reserved a place in the bunker .

Obama ad wo n't run at gas stations
The Obama campaign yesterday announced it will run its " National Priorities " spot — an attack on McCain for his ties to the oil industry — on Gas Station TV , which airs at ... gas stations .
Now — in the sort of flap a campaign welcomes —
Obama 's camp says Gas Station TV wo n't air it .
" As Gas Station TV informed the campaign this afternoon , the company will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies , " says a release from the Obama campaign .
The company says it wo n't air political spots , which Obama 's camp disputes .
UPDATE : AdAge has more of the company 's side , in which the CEO says he never approved the spot .
The Obama campaign forwards on its email with the company , after the jump , which includes the assertion that its " owners " have " signed off . "
From Obama campaign :
The following are emails exchanged between the campaign ’s media buyer , Daniel Jester , and a representative for the ad company , confirming that GSTV initially approved the buy .
The representative writes , “ Please note that GSTV has approved the spot , ” and in a separate email , “ the GSTV owners have signed off on this . ”

Reading Mike Whitney ’s account of the harassment of Tom Feeley , the editor and publisher of the Information Clearing House website , I am once again reminded that it is a few minutes before midnight ( see Paul Joseph Watson ’s account as well ) .
As the clock strikes midnight , our brownshirts will rush in like a plague of locusts , or more accurately an invasion of cockroaches .
America will become Nazi Germany , it will become Chile under Pinochet , it will be transformed into a fascist dictatorship .
Most of us , distracted by bread and circuses , numbed by incessant propaganda , do n’t realize how close at hand this reality is .
It is now emerging from the shadows , as Mr. Feeley no doubt understands .
George Grosz : A Writer , Is He? 1934 -35 .
Nazi Germany , of course , is not an exact parallel .
In 1921 Adolf Hitler formed his own private army called Sturm Abteilung , German for Storm Section , and the SA was instructed to disrupt the meetings of political opponents .
In large part the SA was comprised of former members of the Freikorps , reactionary thugs organized into gangs after the First World War .
As Spartacus Educational explains , Freikorps thugs “ had considerable experience in using violence against their rivals ” and were inspired after Hitler ’s speeches to hunt down , brutalize , and even murder their opponents .
Later , select members of the SA would be organized into the Gestapo SS .
Bush ’s neocons are nowhere nearly as organized and vicious as the SA brownshirts , although the demented passion and violence is there , the desire to deal with opponents severely is thinly masked , ready to emerge given the right situation .
Bush , however , is not Hitler , although his grand daddy helped facilitate Hitler ’s crimes .
Unlike Hitler , Bush ’s neocons do not have at their disposal a mass fascist organization and cannot dispatch paramilitary goon squads and knuckle draggers to deal with opponents .
In America , circa 2008 , we have yet to experience organized gangs of neocon thugs attacking antiwar activists and truth movement patriots .
In America , circa 2008 , the intimidation and violence operates in the shadows … for the moment .
It is not clear who exactly threatened and intimidated Tom Feeley and his wife , although a few educated guesses come to mind .
It is a matter of documented history that the FBI and recruited local police , under COINTELPRO , used “ extralegal ” force and violence against opponents of government policies .
Such tactics included break - ins , vandalism , assaults , beatings , and — in the case of the Black Panthers and the American Indian Movement — murder .
“ Many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity , but COINTELPRO went far beyond that , ” reported the Church Committee back in the mid-1970s , “ the Bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of First Amendment rights of speech and association , on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence . ”
In essence , the FBI served as America ’s secret police then and continue to do so now .
It also on occasion served as an assassination team assigned with taking out leaders like Martin Luther King .
Back in the 1960s and early 1970s , there was no such thing as the Patriot Act , nothing approaching the Military Commissions Act , and certainly nothing of the draconian character of PDD51 , basically a plan to declare martial law and implement a dictatorship , provided the right situation or , as in the case of 9/11 , the right “ terrorist event . ”
Nixon ’s declared “ silent majority ” pales when compared to Bush ’s neocon minority , a gaggle of reactionaries hysterically calling not only for nuking Iran but also rounding up the growing opposition , tasering and beating them , and marching them off to freshly constructed concentration camps built under government contract by Halliburton .
But maybe I am biased , as I have personally experienced the insane wrath of these people .
Compared to Mr. Feeley , however , I am fortunate — no thugs showed up uninvited in my kitchen .
Instead , they repeatedly emailed and blogged death threats and made harassing telephone calls to my place of employment .
Unlike Alex Jones , I was not physically attacked , or did a thug block in my car and demand I forget about the First Amendment .
I am fortunate to have only experienced minor harassment .
If you can tell which way the wind is blowing , though , you will realize time is short .
It is eleven fifty eight and twenty seconds .
It is no mistake that candidate Obama calls for a “ National Security Force ” as large and well - funded as the U.S. military , and candidate McCain calls for troops to lock down cities and conduct raids to “ fight crime . ”
REX - 84 was no mistake and the long - standing plans for FEMA detention camps are not happenstance .
Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are not the idle meanderings of pencil - necked geeks at the Pentagon .
Former Gen. Tommy Franks was serious when he said the Constitution will be jettisoned after the next false flag terror attack .
Exercise Vigilant Shield and dozens of other “ exercises ” conducted by U.S. Northcom , the DHS , and local , state and other federal “ responders ” has less to do with natural disasters than gearing up for martial law .
It ’s no mistake the local cops , the National Guard , and Blackwater — under the aegis of FEMA — confiscated firearms in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
Likewise , it was no mistake local cops , the Kansas Highway Patrol , ATF , FEMA , and the National Guard confiscated firearms in the aftermath of a tornado in Greensburg , Kansas .
Both were incubator studies in tyranny .
No , the Nazi SA comparison does not work — not in America , circa 2008 .
Tom Feeley and Alex Jones were not kidnapped in the dead of night and found the next morning executed in typical death squad fashion .
But after martial law is declared — after the next attack , an attack repeatedly promised by no shortage of government officials and experts — the machinery is firmly in place to turn America into a fascist dictatorship that will make the Nazi corollary pale by way of comparison with its scientific precision .
In the meantime , keep your eye on the clock .
