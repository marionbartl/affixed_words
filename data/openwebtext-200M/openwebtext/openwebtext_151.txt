Posted under , ,
Suddenly , during his trip abroad , the Vice President decided that the press corp was forbidden from calling him " Vice President , " and required that he be called by the mysterious name " Senior Administration Official . "
On the Vice President 's page of the White House web site they keep an archive of all speeches / interviews by the Vice President from February 15 , 2001 up to the present day .
Until yesterday , every one of those entries referred to the Vice President as the " Vice President . "
But not yesterday .
This is so bizarre it almost defies description .
The opening section of the transcript is as follows :
Interview of a Senior Administration Official by the Traveling Press
Aboard Air Force Two
En Route Muscat , Oman 3:07 P.M. ( Local ) SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL :
The reason the President wanted me to come , obviously , is because of the continuing threat that exists in this part of the world on both sides of the Afghan - Pakistan border -- a threat to Afghanistan , clearly , in our efforts there , the Taliban , cross - border operations ; a threat to Musharraf and his government .
There were something like seven or eight suicide bombings in the last week or two in Pakistan .
And obviously also , the threat to the homeland from the standpoint of operations and activities of al Qaeda in this part of the world -- for example , you go back to the airliner plot last fall , second generation Pakistani militants living in the U.K. , but with ties back in al Qaeda areas along the Pakistan - Afghan border .
So we 've all got an interest , obviously , in trying to address those issues .
Let me just make one editorial comment here .
I 've seen some press reporting says , " Cheney went in to beat up on them , threaten them . "
That 's not the way I work .
I do n't know who writes that , or maybe somebody gets it from some source who does n't know what I 'm doing , or is n't involved in it .
But the idea that I 'd go in and threaten someone is an invalid misreading of the way I do business .
OK .
Here we have a situation where the Vice President insists that he not be listed as the person being interviewed , and then mentions his own name and refers to himself in the first person in the opening statement .
What on earth is the logic behind this ?
Dan Fromkin at the Washington Post explains :
After nine days of almost completely ignoring the small pool of reporters who diligently followed him around through seven countries , Vice President Cheney yesterday finally agreed to a short group interview .
But only on one condition :
The reporters would have to agree not to tell anyone that the person they talked to was him .
Apparently , Cheney was not happy with the coverage he was getting from the press , so this was his way of dolling out punishment .
Fromkin calls this approach Cheney 's effort to " extort from reporters a ridiculous agreement , " citing it as a sign of the contempt Cheney has for the press .
Fromkin 's article describes how gleefully the press tore Cheney 's anonymity to pieces .
Glenn Greenwald takes Fromkin 's observation one step further :
Cheney 's petty demand that he not be identified -- like a petty tyrant 's demand that his name never pass anyone 's lips -- is just an assertion of secrecy and authoriatarian power for its own sake ( even under the rule of Emperor Hirohito , " commoners were no longer forbidden to speak his name or look at his face " ) .
But unlike Hirohito , Cheney is an elected public servant of American citizens and this attempt to prohibit journalists from attributing his own words to him is just bizarrely megalomaniacal and contemptuous , particularly in light of how he virtually went out of his way in the very first sentence to make clear that it was him .
Mcjoan at DailyKos concurs , drawing attention to Cheney 's cynical attempts to use the press corp to repeat the same , tired argument about leaving Iraq aiding the terrorists .
In fact , as everyone but Cheney seems to be able to see , his visit coincides with the return of the very violent forces that American forces originally put down after September 11 , 2001 , but before the invasion of Iraq .
In other words , Cheney 's visit to the region symbolized that the the dangers in Afghanistan were rapidly approaching the same levels as before the American military actions following September 11 , 2001 .
The occupation of Iraq has not led us down a path to increased global security , but has undone whatever was accomplished initially .
Hence , Cheney hopped on Air Force
Two to have some strong words with leaders in the region -- no doubt to write more American checks and tell people that Democrats wanted to appease terrorists .
Once again , Dick Cheney believes that the problems American soldiers face in the Middle East and Central Asia can be solved by PR campaigns launched against American journalists and against the Democratic Party .
Iraq not going well ?
Attack the Democratic leadership .
Taliban on the rise in Afghanistan ?
Forbid journalists from calling you " Vice President . "
Whole sections of the planet gone to hell in a hand basket because of Dick Cheney 's policies and pig- headed stubbornness ?
Criticize the American public .
Yeah .
That will fix things .
Violence is not the answer to any of these problems , and we should all whole - heartedly condemn whoever was insane enough to launch a suicide bomb attack at the base where the " Senior Administration Official " was staying in Afghanistan .
But the image of local insurgents hurling bombs at a visiting American leader resonates far beyond the lost lives of that event .
It hearkens back to a lost era when other parts of the world cut up into pieces and mismanaged by egotistical and detached rulers .
The Austro - Hungarian Empire on the eve of World War I , for example .
The great danger that the Vice President cannot see right before his eyes is not a single suicide bomb , but the entire region bursting into flames as it rips itself asunder .
Not just Iraq , but the whole of the Middle East and Central Asia .
It is the danger we face .
But not Cheney .
For him , success is just around the corner .
Just a few more weeks of PR and all will be well .

Steny Hoyer 's gotten hold of a wayward " Dear Colleague " letter from GOP Reps .
John Shadegg and Peter Hoekstra that shows a little too much leg ( PDF ) :
We are writing to urge you not to debate the Democratic Iraq resolution on their terms , but rather on ours .
Democrats want to force us to focus on defending the surge , making the case that it will work and explaining why the President 's new Iraq policy is different from prior efforts and therefore justified .
We urge you to instead broaden the debate to the threat posed to Americans , the world , and all " unbelievers " by radical Islamists .
We would further urge you to join us in educating the American people about the views of radical Islamists and the consequences of not defeating radical Islam in Iraq .
The debate should not be about the surge or its details .
This debate should not even be about the Iraq war to date , mistakes that have been made , or whether we can , or cannot , win militarily .
If we let Democrats force us into a debate on the surge or the current situation in Iraq , we lose .
I 've decided to help you find the key nugget , with a little bolding .
Didja catch it ?
If we have an upperdownvote TM on the escalation , Republicans lose .
Because nearly everyone in America opposes it , including a significant number of the Republicans who received this letter .
And if there 's a straight - up vote on it , they lose .
So naturally , the Republican plan is : try to make the vote about something else .
News flash , fellas .
There is nothing else .
The war is everything , and piece by piece we will have our votes , and you will lose them .

Krugman reads the writing on the wall , and comes to the conclusion that I 've been arguing for a few weeks : if Bush is going to attack Iran he 's going to do it through Iraq :
So the administration has always had it in for the Iranian regime .
Now , let ’s do an O. J. Simpson : if you were determined to start a war with Iran , how would you do it ?
First , you ’d set up a special intelligence unit to cook up rationales for war .
A good model would be the Pentagon ’s now - infamous Office of Special Plans , led by Abram Shulsky , that helped sell the Iraq war with false claims about links to Al Qaeda ....
Next , you ’d go for a repeat of the highly successful strategy by which scare stories about the Iraqi threat were disseminated to the public .
This time , however , the assertions would n’t be about W.M.D. ; they ’d be that Iranian actions are endangering U.S. forces in Iraq .
Why ?
Because there ’s no way Congress will approve another war resolution .
But if you can claim that Iran is doing evil in Iraq , you can assert that you do n’t need authorization to attack — that Congress has already empowered the administration to do whatever is necessary to stabilize Iraq .
And by the time the lawyers are finished arguing — well , the war would be in full swing .

Recently , my status message on Facebook was I 'm now convinced microformats are a stupid idea .
Shortly afterwards I got a private message from Scott Beaudreau asking me to clarify my statement .
On reflection , I realize that what I find stupid is when people suggest using microformats and screen scraping techiques instead of utilizing an API when the situation calls for one .
For example , the social network portability proposal on the microformats wiki states
It boggles my mind to see the suggestion that applications should poll HTML pages to do data synchronization instead of utilizing an API .
Instead of calling friends.get , why do n't we just grab the entire friends page then parse out the handful of useful data that we actually need .
There are a number of places microformats are a good fit , especially in situations where the client application has to parse the entire HTML document anyway .
Examples include using hCard to enable features like Live Clipboard or using hReview and hCalendar to help microformat search engines .
However using them as a replacement for an API or an RSS feed is like using boxing gloves instead of oven mitts when baking a pie .
If all you have is a hammer , everything looks like a nail .

Jon makes the obvious point about the Senator Vitter scandal that the media chooses to ignore -- namely , that the story is a story because a ) he is one of the Senate 's most outspoken defenders of " Traditional Marriage " ; and b ) he refuses to resign despite calling upon President Clinton to resign over the Lewinsky scandal .
Is it really that hard to connects the dots on this ?

drdenny at Scholars & Rogues looks at the other aspect of the Vitter story the press refuses to examine .
AMERICAN politicians bash China for its policy of keeping the yuan weak .
France blames a strong euro for its sluggish economy .
The Swiss are worried about a falling franc .
New Zealanders fret that their currency has risen too far .
All these anxieties rest on a belief that exchange rates are out of whack .
Is this justified ?
The Economist 's Big Mac Index , a light - hearted guide to how far currencies are from fair value , provides some answers .
It is based on the theory of purchasing - power parity ( PPP ) , which says that exchange rates should equalise the price of a basket of goods in any two countries .
Our basket contains just a single representative purchase , but one that is available in 120 countries : a Big Mac hamburger .
The implied PPP , our hamburger standard , is the exchange rate that makes the dollar price of a burger the same in each country .
Most currencies are trading a long way from that yardstick .
China 's currency is the cheapest .
A Big Mac in China costs 11 yuan , equivalent to just $ 1.45 at today 's exchange rate , which means China 's currency is undervalued by 58 % .
But before China 's critics start warming up for a fight , they should bear in mind that PPP points to where currencies ought to go in the long run .
The price of a burger depends heavily on local inputs such as rent and wages , which are not easily arbitraged across borders and tend to be lower in poorer countries .
For this reason PPP is a better guide to currency misalignments between countries at a similar stage of development .
The most overvalued currencies are found on the rich fringes of the European Union : in Iceland , Norway and Switzerland .
Indeed , nearly all rich - world currencies are expensive compared with the dollar .
The exception is the yen , undervalued by 33 % .
This anomaly seems to justify fears that speculative carry trades , where funds from low - interest countries such as Japan are used to buy high - yield currencies , have pushed the yen too low .
But broader measures of PPP suggest the yen is close to fair value .
A New Yorker visiting Tokyo would find that although Big Macs were cheap , other goods and services seemed pricey .
A trip to Europe would certainly pinch the pocket of an American tourist : the euro is 22 % above its fair value .
The Swiss franc , like the yen a source of low - yielding funds for foreign - exchange punters , is 53 % overvalued .
The franc 's recent fall is a rare example of carry traders moving a currency towards its burger standard .
That is because it is borrowed and sold to buy high - yielding investments in rich countries such as New Zealand and Britain , whose currencies look dear against their burger benchmarks .
Brazil and Turkey , two emerging economies favoured by speculators , have also been pushed around .
Burgernomics hints that their currencies are a little overcooked .
MIT Professor Ronald L. Rivest , who helped develop one of the world 's most widely used Internet security systems , Â has been named the 2007 Marconi Fellow and prize - winner for his pioneering work in the field of cryptography , computer and network security .
Rivest , the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in MIT 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , will receive the award and accompanying $ 100,000 prize at the annual Marconi Society Award Dinner on Sept. 28 at the Menlo Circus Club in Atherton , Calif .
The Marconi Society , established in 1975 by Gioia Marconi Braga , annually recognizes a living scientist who , like her father Guglielmo Marconi , the inventor of radio , shares the determination that advances in communications and information technology be directed to the social , economic and cultural improvement of all humanity .
" Ron Rivest 's achievements have led to the ability of individuals across the planet -- in large cities and in remote villages -- to conduct and benefit from secure transactions on the Internet , " said Robert Lucky , chairman of the nonprofit Marconi Society .
The group cited Rivest 's advances in public - key cryptography , a technology that allows users to communicate securely and secretly over an insecure channel without having to agree upon a shared secret key beforehand .
" Public key cryptography has flattened the globe by enabling secure communication via e-mail , web browsers , secure shells , virtual private networks , mobile phones and other applications requiring the secure exchange of information , " Lucky said .
A native of Niskayuna , N.Y. , Rivest attended Yale University , where he earned a B.S. in mathematics in 1969 .
After receiving his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford in 1974 , Rivest accepted an offer to join the faculty at MIT .
At MIT he met two colleagues , Leonard Adleman and Adi Shamir , who would become his partners in solving the puzzle of public - key cryptography .
" Ron is a very special person , " said Adleman .
" He has a Renaissance quality .
Â
If tomorrowÂ he discovered an interest in rocketry , then in five years he would be one of the top rocket scientists in the world . "
Fortunately , what captured Rivest 's imagination was the challenge of a public key encryption system .
He managed to enlist Adleman and Shamir in his quest to produce what he called an " e- crypto system . "
It was a challenge ideally suited to Rivest 's mathematical interests , relying on what Adleman calls " some of the oldest and deepest mathematics , going back to antiquity . "
In public key cryptography , there are two keys ; one known to everyone , and one known only to the recipient .
The public and private keys are paired in such a way that only the public key can be used to encrypt messages and only the corresponding private key can be used to decrypt them .
But even if someone knows the public key , it is effectively impossible to deduce the private key .
To design such a system was the challenge .
In effect , it was a mathematical puzzle .
The RSA encryption algorithm that Rivest , Shamir and Adleman developed relies on the challenge of factoring large numbers ( typically 250 or more digits long ) , a problem that has stumped the world 's most prominent mathematicians and computer scientists for centuries .
At one end of the " conversation , " the receiving party 's computer secretly selects two prime numbers and multiplies them to create a " public key " which can be posted on the Internet .
On the other end , the sending party 's computer can take that key , enter it into the RSA algorithm and encrypt a message .
The genius of the scheme is that only the recipient knows the prime factors that went into the creation of the public key -- and that is what is required by the RSA algorithm to decipher the message .
Even though others can see the encrypted message and the public key , they cannot decipher the message because it is impossible to factor the number being used in the public key within a reasonable period of time .
The team developed its system in 1977 and founded RSA Data Security in 1983 .
RSA was acquired in 1996 by Security Dynamics , which in turn was acquired by EMC in 2006 .
Rivest has continued his work in encryption and is the inventor of the symmetric key encryption algorithms RC2 , RC4 , RC5 , and co-inventor of RC6 .
Hidden fingerprints can be now be revealed quickly and reliably thanks to two developments in nanotechnology .
The news is reported in the latest edition of the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Chemical Communications .
The current method for revealing prints involves coating surfaces with a watery suspension of gold nanoparticles and citrate ions .
Under acid conditions , the gold particles stick to the positively charged particles in the print .
The print is then developed using a solution of silver ions , which chemically react to leave an outline of silver along the ridges of the print .
However , the gold solution used in this method is unstable and results are difficult to repeat – so Dr Daniel Mandler , Dr Joseph Almog and their team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel , have developed a more stable solution be adding hydrocarbon chains to the gold nanoparticles and suspending them in petroleum ether .
The prints produced using the new solution are very high quality and are developed after just three minutes immersion time .
The team have also extended their technique for use on non-porous surfaces , using a petrol ether suspension of cadmium selenide / zinc sulphide .
In this case , the chemical reaction makes the prints fluoresce , so no additional developing stage is required .
Antonio Cantu , an expert in forensic science for the United States Secret Service in Washington , said : “ The techniques are revolutionary and are apt to greatly improve the recovery of latent prints on evidence . ”
Dr Claude Roux , director of the Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Technology , Sydney , Australia , said : “ This use of nanotechnology in the fingerprint community can bring novel and practical solutions to develop and enhance latent fingerprints that would otherwise remain undetected .

The IBM 7070
Tom Van Vleck
I had a summer job operating and programming 1401 and 7070 in 1962 and 63 at Universal Oil Products Company in Des Plaines , Illinois .
UOP was in the oil business , although you could n't fill your tank with UOP gas : what they owned and made was patents .
They owned the patent on Fluid Catalytic Cracking , and every drop of gasoline anybody burned had been processed through a refinery embodying a UOP patent .
I got the job through Mr. David M. Boyd , who was chief instrumentation engineer at UOP .
General
The 7070 was an interesting machine .
Because of the nature of its business , UOP had been an early user of computers , and had had an IBM 650 before my time there .
In some senses , the 7070 was a " transistorized 650 . "
There was a 650 simulator available for the 7070 , and some of our production jobs ran under the simulator .
The 7070 had a machine word of ten decimal digits , plus a sign that could be positive , negative , or alphabetic .
Each digit was represented by five bits , coded so that two out of the five were on and three off ; if the machine encountered any digit that did n't have two - out - of - five , it halted immediately .
Instead of the 650's drum memory , the 7070 had core , 10,000 words of it .
Alphabetic information was coded as two decimal digits , so a word could hold five characters .
The front of the programmer 's reference card lists the machine opcodes .
The back lists the character set , the two - out - of - five code , and the special functions of some memory locations .
The 7070 had three accumulators , which you could access with normal load and store operations , and also as addresses 9991 , 9992 , and 9993 .
The program counter was visible as location 9995 .
And the 99 index registers were also locations 0001 through 0099 ; each word had an indexing portion and a limit portion , and the indexing instructions compared the index to the limit and branched in various directions when the limit was hit .
The 7070 had the ability to overlap computation with I/O .
You could start a tape operation and keep computing , and the machine would take an interrupt when the I/O completed .
Data structures called RDWs , Record Definition Words , specified memory extents to be transmitted , and programs could chain these together to perform scatter - gather I/O .
Physically , the machine was imposing .
It filled a large air - conditioned room with six - foot high boxes for the CPU and memory , and we also had six tape drives and an online card reader and card punch .
Printing , card reading , and punching were usually done on the 1401 though , since its unit record equipment was faster .
Tape was 200 or 556 BPI Model 729 tape drives .
The machine operator sat at the 7150 console , a desk with a built - in typewriter and a small panel of lights and switches , and sequenced jobs through the machine .
The machine logic was transistors , all right , mounted on SMS cards ( Standard Modular System ) , with two transistors and a few other components per card , very similar to the flip - flops I was wiring in Mr. Boyd 's basement .
Basic 7070 instructions took 36 microseconds , so that would be about 27 KIPS .
But the machine had some very powerful instructions that took a lot longer than one cycle ; for example , there were table lookup instructions that searched a whole table defined by an RDW .

Stories
UNRECOVERABLE RAMAC ERROR , RERUN JOB
The language of choice for the 7070 was an assembler called .
It had a kind of macros , mostly used for defining tape error handling ( IOCS ) .
( Autocoder macros could n't define other macros , so the assembler was n't Turing - equivalent . )
We also used , Report Program Generator , a file processing language where you specified the input record format , the desired output format , and simple calculations to be done on each record .
Dr. Louis S. Kassel of UOP had also written acompiler which we used for the more heavily scientific calculations .
We also used a preprocessor created by United Gas ( another 7070 user ) that took in decision tables and produced 7070 assembler .
Our machine did n't have any disk , and normal operation was to load programs and data from cards or tape .
There was n't really any operating system : every job had the whole machine to itself .
There was no relocating loader : all compilations and assemblies produced absolute output .
In 1963 we experimented with a monitor called TOPSY , Tape OPerating System , that could actually run a sequence of jobs from tape , regaining control at the end of one job enough to load the next one ; but some programs could n't spare the few hundred locations it took to include TOPSY .
As I mentioned we did n't have disk on our machine .
But some of the jobs we were running really needed random access storage .
So one of the programmers , think it was Ken Johnson , wrote a package called " Son of RAMAC " that simulated disk on three tape drives , by writing in the middle of a tape .
The job would spin tapes madly for about an hour , and if tape drive alignment crept a little , rewritten records would creep over other data and the job would print
Reliability of core was a concern when the machine was first introduced ; that 's the reason for the elaborate two - out - of - five coding .
One summer , our machine began halting with a memory parity check at the same location in the same program .
Everything else ran fine , and the CE diagnostics showed nothing .
The problem was taken very seriously by IBM , who sent out more and more guys in ties and blue suits , until finally the machine designers were sent .
They discovered that one of the power supplies was a little under specification , and that if the machine was reading cards , punching , and running multiple tape drives at the same time , there was n't quite enough power to drive one particular core plane .
Bob Bemer wrote the story of the accidental genesis of the IBM 7070 in his story " Birth of an Unwanted IBM Computer . "

i Phone is a not just a phone it is widescreen iPod with touch controls that lets you enjoy all your content including music , audiobooks , videos , TV shows , and movies on a beautiful 3.5 - inch widescreen display ( BlackBerry Curve only has a 2.5 inch screen ) .
The BlackBerry curve does have a media player , however with all the iPod features and 4 GB / 8 GB space , it makes the iPhone the best music phone .
Visual Voicemail : The iPhone lets you select and listen to voicemail messages in whatever order you want — just like email using a revolutionary new feature called the visual voicemail .
Advanced Safari browser : iPhone lets you see any web page the way it was designed to be seen , then easily zoom in by simply tapping on the multi - touch display with your finger which will change mobile browsing for the good .
Wi -Fi : iPhone is also Wi-Fi enabled and supports Wi - Fi ( 802.11b /g ) which gives you an option to switch to faster Wi-FI networks instead of using EDGE which are n’t that slow but also are n’t very fast .
User Interface : iPhone features the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse .
It ’s an entirely new interface based on a large multi- touch display and innovative new software that lets you control everything using only your fingers .
QWERTY soft keyboard : iPhone ’s full QWERTY soft keyboard lets you easily send and receive SMS messages in multiple sessions .
And the keyboard is predictive , so it prevents and corrects mistakes , making it easier and more efficient to use however only time will tell if it is better than the full Qwerty keyboard thats available on Palm Treo 755p .
Camera : iPhone is expected to have a 2 megapixel camera , and from initial reports it seems like the camera on the iPhone will be quite superior to the low quality camera available on the Palm Treo .
As you can see there are enough positives for each of the smartphones , so get an answer to the question " Which one will it be ? " it is important that you ask yourself which of the features listed above are important to you and that should help you decide if you will buy the Apple iPhone or Palm Treo 755p .

It has been a while since I have posted but this one is too good to pass up .
Every night around 10:30 p.m. , my computer is set up to run a VerifyMyPC scan .
About 11 p.m. the Scan Notifier runs and does the whole balloon pop-up thing .
Normally nothing pops up because there is nothing to report ( i.e. another day at the office - figuratively speaking ) .
When there is something to report , usually a little yellow triangle icon shows up and I say , " Yup , I remember doing that today . "
Or , " Those changes to my system sound about right . "
Tonight , the special analysis mode of the Scan Notifier picked up on unusual behavior and popped up the Red - X icon .
If Microsoft ever wanted to get caught with their pants down , they succeeded .
For most people , the above does n't make a whole lot of sense past the " you might have a virus " part .
VerifyMyPC requires a little extra knowledge about computer systems when dealing with the details .
Google is your friend in these cases .
Running searches for ' wups.dll ' and ' wups2.dll ' turns up something about Automatic Updates .
In particular , those DLLs provide Automatic Update functionality for Windows .
In other words , the Automatic Updates utility automatically updated itself .
Now this might not seem like a big deal but I have automatic updates set to manual ( both download and installation have to be approved by me ) and not the usual ' automatic ' setting found on most user PCs .
In other words , Windows updated itself without my express permission .
Such behavior is right in line with spyware - like activity .
Thus , VerifyMyPC is doing an accurate job in reporting such behavior to me .
I love VerifyMyPC .
It is also interesting to note that Microsoft pushed out an update to Automatic Updates on a day other than the 2nd Tuesday of the month ( also known as " Patch Tuesday " ) .
Edit :
The above image actually indicates that those files were ' added ' .
Drilling down , it shows that they were added to ' C : \WINDOWS\LastGood\system32\ ' .
While ' wups.dll ' and ' wups2.dll ' were NOT modified , other files that are in the real system 32 directory ( 'C:\WINDOWS\system32 ' ) WERE modified .
What follows is a snippet of each file that was added and changed ( files with the same name have been grouped together to help make it obvious that a virus or other piece of malware was n't involved - malware authors would n't bother to copy the files to the " Last Known Good " configuration ) :

So there are plenty of other actual changes to Automatic Updates to back up my claim .
Also , while wups.dll and wups2.dll were not changed , it is pretty apparent that they were included in the update as they were backed up into the last good configuration directory ... as if they were going to be changed .
Also , VerifyMyPC only reports changes to files that have signature ( hash ) changes .
A hash is a one - way cryptographic thumbprint of a file .
If you want to verify the above you will need a tool capable of performing a SHA - 256 hash and a computer you did n't reboot ( last good configurations tend to vanish after a successful boot ) .
You should also keep in mind that there are Windows APIs to alter timestamps of files .
Just because a file says it has n't been modified or accessed since 2004 does n't mean it has n't been .
Update Sept. 14 , 2007 : Microsoft finally responded after some major publications also realized secret Windows Updates were pushed out ... almost three weeks after I posted this .
Here is the : Microsoftresponded after some major publications also realized secret Windows Updates were pushed out ... almost three weeks after I posted this .
Here is the official response
To this I say : " That is a bunch of baloney " .
If Microsoft wants to update Windows Update components , I want the choice to update that .
The " Download and Install Notifications " option implicitly includes all updates .
In my mind , the Windows Update utility itself is part of that ' all ' .
Do n't update my system secretly .
Ever .
And Microsoft still has n't come forward to explain why the WGA servers went down .
My guess is that would still be pretty embarrassed at this point to try to explain that " because they pushed out a secret update to Windows Update , WGA went down " .
While I generally accept updates to Windows , I still want complete control over the entire process .
The biggest problem I see with secretly updating is that it usually entails a reboot .
I rarely reboot and if my system reboots while I 'm in the middle of something , I will potentially lose a lot of work not to mention the time involved in bringing up all 20 - 30 programs I was running before the reboot .
Secret updates might be followed by random shutdowns and reboots .
Did I ever mention that I love VerifyMyPC ?
Oh wait .
Never mind .
I did that already .

Ex -Gonzales no .
2 : Make Fitzgerald Attorney General Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 20 , 2007 Print This Email This
The former top deputy to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales suggested that Special Prosecutor and US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald should be Attorney General of the United States , according to a report in Bloomberg News .
" I think he would make a spectacular attorney general , " former Deputy U.S. Attorney General James Comey told the news service 's Patricia Hurtado and David Voreacos in a Friday article .
" He certainly is one of the very best federal prosecutors in America . "
Comey , who served as Deputy Attorney General from 2003 - 2005 under both Gonzales and John Ashcroft now works in the private sector with the Lockheed Martin Corproation .
He recently re-emerged into public view when the Senate and House Judiciary Committees subpoenaed him to receive testimony about a hospital bed confrontation between Gonzales , then White House Counsel , and Ashcroft over a domestic spying program that Comey refused to certify as legal .
Fitzgerald , US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , gained national prominence when he was appointed Special Counsel in the investigation of the leaking of the identity of covert CIA Agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
He successfully prosecuted Vice President Cheney 's former top aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby for obstruction , perjury , and making false statements before Bush commuted Libby 's 30 month jail sentence .
The profile piece on the Chicago - based prosecutor goes on to note that he does not consider his current position a springboard to higher political office .
In a taped appearance on a jointly - produced National Public Radio and Chicago Public Radio show , Fitzgerald reportedly will say , " I 'm not doing that , " when asked if he will run for public office .
Fitzgerald is slated to appear on the " Wait , wait ... do n't tell me " quiz show .
The Bloomberg article described the humorous questions he was subjected to .
" ' We are so not going to ask you any questions about Scooter Libby , ' NPR news anchor Carl Kasell told Fitzgerald during the taping , " Hurtado and Voreacos report .
" Instead , he was peppered with questions about other scooters : the two - wheeled scooter made by Segway Inc. , Scooter the stagehand from television 's Muppet Show and former New York Yankee Phil Rizzuto , also nicknamed ' The Scooter . ' "
An AP report of the show also detailed a gift that the show 's hosts gave Fitzgerald .
" At the end of the show , Sagal gave Fitzgerald a child 's scooter .
It was engraved with : ' To Patrick Fitzgerald , USA , This one will stay where you put it , ' according to the news wire article .
Improved behaviour tends to lead to better results
New Children 's Secretary Ed Balls wants pupils in all primary and secondary schools to have lessons in social and emotional skills by 2011 .
A programme already running in 60 % of primary schools , which helps children deal with anger , anxiety and conflicts , is being rolled out across the nation .
It has had a major impact on behaviour and attainment , the government says .
The programme will make sure that all children understand the importance of being confident and interacting with other children in a respectful and positive manner
Ed Balls
Children 's Secretary
Send us your comments
The programme focuses on encouraging pupils to understand themselves , manage their feelings and promotes social skills and the understanding of others .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families said such skills aided employability and social mobility by ensuring all children , regardless of background , had confidence in their abilities and understood how to interact with others in a positive way .
The programme is also aimed at promoting positive behaviour and regular school attendance which will have an impact on learning and emotional health .
On top of the £ 7 m already committed to fund the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning ( Seal ) programme , the government is investing an extra £ 13.7 m over four years , officials announced .
Approximately 10,000 schools are already involved in the scheme .
Improved behaviour
It is hoped that by July 2009 all primary schools will have had help in introducing the Seal programme .
The scheme will be rolled out across England 's secondary schools from September .
It is hoped that by 2011 all will have had the opportunity to set up the scheme .
Mr Balls said many of the schools that had implemented the programme had seen a marked improvement in the way their pupils interacted with each other both inside and outside the classroom .
" The programme will make sure that all children understand the importance of being confident and interacting with other children in a respectful and positive manner , " he added .
Research suggests the programme works best when it is embedded across the curriculum - rather than being confined to one lesson .
For example sports lessons are seen as a good opportunity to teach pupils how to be good losers and gracious winners , and English literature offers a chance to examine characters who have overcome difficulties
But Mr Balls was keen to stress that emotional intelligence lessons come hand in hand with the tough new behaviour powers which came into force in April this year .
They aimed to remove any ambiguity over a teacher 's right to confiscate items , such as mobile phones , give detentions and physically remove violent pupils from the classroom .
" These initiatives give teachers some powerful tools to make sure good behaviour and an atmosphere of respect are the norm in all schools , " Mr Balls added .
Teachers are fighting the education secretary , Alan Johnson , over his plans to force teenagers to study classic authors like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens .
Mr Johnson announced 10 days ago that 11 to 14 - year - olds must study the classic writers of English literature as part of a reformed school curriculum .
But teachers ' associations said authors like Dickens and George Eliot were too difficult for the age group and accused Mr Johnson of using the issue to win popularity in middle England .
The National Association for the Teaching of English ( NATE ) pledged to support teachers who put their professional judgment ahead of Mr Johnson 's requirements and refuse to teach these writers .
The director of NATE , Ian McNeilly , said : " Alan Johnson needs to be questioned over whether this is an informed decision .
I suspect it is not .
" It is obviously what he regards as an easy vote - winning initiative to appease middle England , who assume , quite wrongly , that the curriculum is ' dumbed down ' if 11 - year - olds are not ploughing through Jude the Obscure .
" It is a complete fallacy .
Forcing children and teachers to study texts that are inappropriate is deeply counter - productive .
" It puts students off the text , the author and the subject and it does n't do anything for their self - esteem . "
Mr McNeilly said NATE would " always " support teachers who felt Mr Johnson 's list of classic writers were not appropriate for their pupils and refused to teach them .
" Most teachers are decent , law - abiding people who will probably find ways to do what the government tell them to do , " he said .
" But they will rely on their professional judgment and if that means that they feel it 's inappropriate to teach certain texts to certain students then that may not get done . "
The English Association said many of Mr Johnson 's prescribed classic authors were simply too difficult for pupils as young as 11 .
Ian Brinton , chair of the English Association 's secondary committee , told the Times Educational Supplement he would be " stunned if any of these writers are taught " .
" It is a politically correct statement which does not reflect the reality in the classroom , " he said .
Speaking to the Press Association , Mr Brinton went on : " It seems remarkably easy for politicians to give a sense of what should be taught in the classroom .
" But they are not trained teachers and they actually do n't know an awful lot about what is going on .
" The teaching of the classics is in some ways not appropriate . "
Many young pupils will be put off great writers by being forced to study thick novels such as Bleak House or the dense and complex prose style of George Eliot , he said .
" I do wonder how many people who make decisions like that actually read Jane Austen , Charles Dickens and others .
" I wonder how much Alan Johnson reads them .
I just do n't know , " Mr Brinton said .
The Government defended Mr Johnson 's decision to make certain classic writers " untouchable " parts of the school curriculum for 11 to 14 - year - olds .
A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills said : " There are certain untouchable elements of the secondary curriculum that all teenagers should learn for a classic , well - rounded British education .
" For example , it 's vital that teachers instil a love of literature in young people and engage them with the best - loved writers from our history .
" Understanding how language works and being able to express oneself creatively and clearly is crucial in every walk of life .
" The new curriculum will protect our educational heritage while creating a modern curriculum that empowers teachers and interests children . "
Under the new curriculum plans , which were announced for consultation earlier this month , pupils will continue to study Shakespeare plays and sonnets as well as classics by pre-20th century authors including Charles Dickens , Jane Austen and George Eliot .
In this week 's edition of the Road to KDE 4 , we 'll take a look at
the up and coming KWord 2.0 as part of the KOffice project .
KWord 1.6.1 is
already a powerful KDE - integrated word processor , but with KDE 4
technologies , KWord 2.0 promises to be among the most powerful free word
processors available .
Read on for more details .
KWord is part of the KOffice suite of applications which , with a few exceptions such as Kexi , has been visible thus far as a KDE - only application living under the shadow of the much larger OpenOffice.org suite .
But this wo n't always be so , as the new KDE 4 technologies allow KOffice to exist as a native application on other platforms such as Windows and Mac OSX .
Look out for more details on KDE support for these platforms in a future article .
One of the biggest assets of KOffice and KWord is its native support for the OASIS OpenDocument standard , which is shared by many office applications these days ( including OpenOffice.org , Google Docs and others ) .
Expect improved ODF document compatibility for KWord in the future as the developers strive for complete specification support .
Lets take a look at some screenshots from the development version of KWord .
Notice the nice anti-aliasing of every element of the UI .
On my system , it does n't appear noticeably slower than KOffice 1.6.1 .
One of the most improved areas in KWord 2 is the text formatting and layouting , which definitely deserves some more exposure .
It 's not yet complete , but as you can see below , it 's definitely much improved from previous versions .
You really have to experience it yourself to appreciate how smooth moving , resizing and rotating Flake shapes is in this new version .
All manner of objects are being converted to the new Flake library , for instance KFormula elements , so you can insert nicely rendered math into your documents without any trouble .
This support could make KWord as exciting to use for page layouts as KPresenter , as you are no longer restricted to dull , square document shapes .
These changes should enable KWord 2 to behave as a respectable basic desktop publishing application .
Also noticeable in this early preview version is the lack of spell checking support , as this is being reworked for the upcoming Sonnet architecture for spelling and grammar corrections .
( Which word did I misspell in my screenshot ? )
But this is not the only improvement new to KOffice 2 .
Also in the works is scripting support for applications through the new and extensible scripting framework dubbed Kross .
It has received a lot of work and looks to be one of the killer features of KOffice 2 .
The following screenshot shows the new scripts menus in KWord :
Also notice how I moved the tear - off toolbars from the previous screenshot .
I placed them by drag - and - drop , and they automatically tabbed up .
This is all done very smoothly by Qt with no noticeable interface flickering .
Of course , the same scripting and rendering features have made their way into other KOffice apps as well .
KSpread and scripting are a perfect fit , and there is a lot of power exposed to the advanced user .
For people interested in more details about Kross , check out this article on the development and usage of Kross in KSpread .
These are just some of the many improvements in the works for KWord and KOffice when the KDE 4 platform rolls out .
Of course , these screenshots are of the development versions , which are quite unstable at the moment , but jugding by the level of activity today in the developer channels ( like # koffice on irc.freenode.org ) there is a large amount of momentum behind this release .
KOffice has a separate release schedule from KDE 4 , so they may or may not release concurrently .
At a certain point in my young adult life , I reached a crossroads of intense poverty .
Although I was working and going to school , I literally had no extra money to spare with the engines of tuition , supplies , and rent grinding me down .
I lived in a tiny apartment with only running water , a hot plate , and a small number of pans for supplies , and I had reached the point where I was literally looking for money in the streets on my way home from work or class and trading in aluminum cans for their nickel refund .
During one month , I was reduced to only spending $ 10.71 total on food ( I actually raised more than this through aluminum can returns ) , a fact that I recorded studiously in my journal .
Yet I was n’t malnourished , I did not resort to dumpster diving , and I did n’t actually steal anything , although I had to ask for a few free things along the way .
We ’re not talking about a few days until the next paycheck , we ’re talking about the edge of poverty .
How did I do this ?
What follows is a list of twenty suggestions and tips on how to eat well and survive with very little money .
Some of these tips apply in the city and others in rural areas , but many apply to both .
Obviously , using such things as homeless shelters for a warm meal is always an option , but many people have too much pride to do such things , so I ’m excluding anything that is an obvious handout .
1. Cook at home .
Never eat out .
Dining out is so much more expensive than eating at home that the two are incomparable .
Stay at home and make your own food rather than eating at a restaurant .
It ’s often more work , but it ’s also money in your pocket .
2. Stews and soups are miraculous .
A big pot with boiling water and whatever you can scavenge dumped in together is the staple of the poor man ’s diet .
You can dump in whatever you ’ve got , along with those free salt and pepper packets , and turn up with something edible and at least remotely nutritious .
3 . Keep a hen or two .
This seems somewhat silly , but female chickens are very good at producing food .
You can unabashedly feed them whatever scraps you have and they produce eggs very regularly .
If you ’re careful , you can keep them in a small cage in your own apartment ; a friend of mine kept one in a pet porter for several months .
Just be aware of the smell ; you should line their living area with paper and expect to clean it a lot .
You can do this by using scavenged newspapers and rotating them daily , but leave the papers that the chicken scratches together for a nest alone .
4 . Dress as well as you can and keep yourself clean .
If you do n’t do this , you ’ll feel worse and you ’ll also be profiled , both consciously and unconsciously , by those around you .
It ’s much easier to scrape together some food if you bother to keep yourself reasonably clean and presentable .
5 . If you live in an area with a recycling policy , take advantage of it .
Finding four aluminum cans can quickly turn itself into a meal .
Finding twenty or thirty cans can be a bonanza .
States in the United States that offer cash for each returned can include California , Connecticut , Delaware , Hawaii , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , New York , Oregon , and Vermont ; nations with such programs include Austria , Belgium , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Luxembourg , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden , and Switzerland .
6 . Get some exercise .
Do n’t sit at home and bemoan your situation .
Get out and walk around a lot .
See what there is to see within walking distance .
Not only might you find some opportunities for food , but you ’re training your body to process what you do eat more efficiently , and most of all , do n’t worry about the caloric loss , because the efficiency you ’ll gain will over the long run counterbalance the excess calories you ’ll burn .
7 . Grow some of your own vegetables .
Even when I lived in the city , I would fill up large pots with dirt and use them to grow my own vegetables .
Since you ’re on a rather restrained diet , foods with plenty of starch are good ; try growing potatoes , as they ’re heavy in starch and are very easy to grow .
Just cut up a single potato into smaller pieces ( six will work ) and bury them deep in the soil , water them occasionally , and wait .
You can find usable dirt and pots in all sorts of places if you keep your eyes open .
8 . Time your visits to the grocery store for the times when they re-stock the perishable items .
If you time things well and know some people , you can usually get stuff at or near expiration date for free or for a pittance .
They often restock milk at two in the morning on Tuesdays near where I lived , for example , and there was a friendly guy who would look away while I grabbed a gallon or two of near - expired milk .
I was n’t alone in doing this .
9. Join a church .
Quite often , congregations will have a free meal right after church and then another meal on a weeknight , usually Wednesdays .
Even if you ’re not a believer , you can get away with two free meals a week .
If you attend two churches , you can sometimes score as many as four a week ( Sunday breakfast and lunch and two weeknight dinners ) .
I usually felt bad about this , so I would volunteer to do some minor work around the church ( cleaning , etc. ) , but that ’s up to you to decide .
I might also argue the point that spiritual guidance may also help you in other ways , but I ’m advising you on how to eat , not what to believe .
10 .
Do n’t fear the leftovers .
Leftovers are your savior .
Do n’t be afraid to make a large quantity of something and then eat it for three or four days .
Also , do n’t throw away even small amounts of anything if it ’s still edible ; you can quite often add it to a stew the next day .
11 . Have friends over for a potluck dinner .
Make something inexpensive for your dish for the spread .
Most of the time , people will leave their leftovers behind , not wanting to deal with them , and you ’ll have a wide variety of food that will last for days for the cost of only preparing one dish .
12 . Do n’t be afraid to swap some odd jobs for a meal .
This works well in local restaurants , particularly of the truck stop or greasy thumb variety ; it does not work nearly as well at chain restaurants or upscale ones .
Just walk in and ask to speak to the manager , and offer to wash some dishes in exchange for a meal .
This usually works best if you ’re presentable ; just explain that you ’re really hungry and down on your luck this week .
Usually in local restaurants , the manager is related to the owner ( or is the owner ) and , if you look decent , will usually agree to this trade .
I ’ve found that truck stops will regularly do this .
13 .
Ask for leftover bones at a butcher shop .
A good excuse is to claim that they ’re for your dog .
Expect to hear a lot of “ no , ” but boiling these bones for a long time can provide a good deal of protein , particularly from the marrow .
14 . Join some clubs .
This is particularly true if you live near a major university , as they will regularly have meetings where food is provided .
This is particularly true during the first few weeks of classes in a given semester .
There are often civic clubs that do the same thing , but you ’re much less likely to find out about them .
The best way to find out is to go to the local post office and examine the bulletin boards , and ask the person behind the counter there for locations to find civic calendars and postings .
15 . Attend farmer ’s markets .
If you pay attention at a farmer ’s market , you can usually come home with some free food .
There are several methods of doing this :
+ Look for samples .
Often individuals marketing new or unusual items will offer small food samples .
Always try them .
+ Strike up conversation with as many people as possible .
Talk to a seller for a while before even suggesting a purchase .
Find out about them and what they do , but do n’t harass them if they ’re busy with other customers .
Compliment them on the quality of what they ’re selling and express regret that you ca n’t afford any ( it ’s true , so you should n’t feel bad about it ) .
Often , a nice person will slip you an ear of corn or something .
Do n’t forget who did this favor for you , of course , as you might have the opportunity to pay back their generosity .
+ Wait until the end of the market and approach people for things that will perish .
Look for people who have items that will perish quickly , or whose items are near perishing .
Stop by their booth when they ’re packing up and offer to dispose of it for them .
16 . Look in discarded newspapers and circulars for coupons .
There are a lot of coupons out there for free or extremely discounted items if you keep your eyes open .
I ’ve had complete meals for free at fast food restaurants , received small items for free at local grocery stores , and once was able to purchase an enormous box of Kellogg ’s corn flakes for less than ten cents that I was able to eat for a very long time .
17 . Always attend grand openings of stores , as well as any events with free drawings .
Over the years , I ’ve won hundreds of dollars in shopping sprees and have been handed tons of door prizes simply because I ’ve shown up and milled around .
Grand openings are particularly great because quite often the store is giving away a good number of things .
Even if you do n’t get food for free , you might win something else of value that you can sell elsewhere or trade to someone .
18 . Inspect your local grocery store very carefully for prices .
Look at their prepackaged soups , such as their ramen noodles .
Examine the prices on their canned vegetables and fruits .
Learn when there are sales , and buy those things when you know it ’s a bargain .
19 .
When you have to go to the grocery store , use a shopping list and stick to it .
Stores are designed to psychologically convince you to buy unnecessary things to increase their profit margin .
To combat these psychological techniques , prepare a shopping list before you go and know exactly what you need to get , then when you go to the store , only get what is on your list .
Even if you want it badly , buying anything else is throwing money away .
20 .
Get free stuff at fast food restaurants .
If you ’re going to be eating dirt cheap , it ’s not going to be flavorful .
Get free condiments where you can , and occasionally you may get some free food out of the deal .
Some recommendations :
Taco Bell or Taco John ’s : hot sauce in a variety of flavors .
Many Taco
John ’s have switched to not distributing their sauces in packets , however , making this somewhat more difficult .
McDonalds : ketchup , mustard , salt , and pepper .
This also works at Burger King , Jack in the Box , and so forth
Long John Silvers : mayonnaise and tartar sauce
Fazoli’s :
Enter the restaurant , sit down at a table , and wait , and someone will eventually give you breadsticks .
I remember the hardness of the days when I had to do these things in order to be able to continue to pay the rent and afford to educate myself at the local university .
It was n’t an easy time , and at times I had to resort to dumpster diving .
If it was n’t for the things I learned myself or heard from others , I simply would not have made it ; something would have given and I would have had to put my education on hold or else starved myself .
Poverty is n’t a game .
I hope that at least one of these ideas will help you through the poor moments .
The feds at the US Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) have this week called in some self - described " deviant " consultants to aid them in the battle against terrorists , illegal immigrants , smugglers et al .
The deviants in question are a group of science fiction writers , namely Jerry Pournelle , Arlan Andrews , Greg Bear , Larry Niven , Yoji Kondo and Sage Walker .
" We need to look everywhere for ideas , and science - fiction writers clearly inform the debate , " Christopher Kelly , spokesman for Homeland Security 's Science and Technology division , told USA Today .
The writers are members of Sigma , a " think tank of patriotic science fiction writers " founded to advise government officials by Arlan Andrews when he worked in the White House Science Office in the early 1990s .
He recruited only authors with advanced technical or medical degrees , in order to pass the " laugh test . "
" If you do n't read science fiction , you 're not qualified to talk about the future , " he told the St Louis Post - Dispatch .
" We 're well - qualified nuts , " added Jerry Pournelle , co-author with Larry Niven of the bestsellers Footfall ( alien invasion ) and Lucifer 's Hammer ( comet strike apocalypse ) .
The educated scribes were invited to attend the Homeland Security Science and Technology Stakeholders Conference as guests of the DHS .
The writers were n't paid , and like scribblers everywhere seem to have been reluctant to give out their best ideas for free .
According to the Post - Dispatch , all they offered up was :
" material that becomes armor when struck by a bullet ; an antibiotic that cures martyrdom ; a satellite that beams solar energy to earth . "
Oh , and " mind - reading helmets for bomb - sniffing dogs , " apparently .
The armour material is old hat , so to speak .
So is the solar - power satellite , which Pournelle for one has been advocating for decades .
The sci - fi scribes might not have given of their best and freshest at the conference , but it 's certainly true that science fiction has sometimes predicted the course of technology a long time in advance .
Robert Heinlein for instance , author of Starship Troopers among many others , was writing about recognizable cellphones in 1948 .
( In Space Cadet . )
He also has a passage in Friday ( 1982 ) in which he gives a fairly prescient idea of how computer networks could operate in looking for information - years ahead even of Gibson 's cyberpunk works , let alone the consumer web .
( Though not , quite , ahead of Lexis - Nexis . )
Still , Heinlein also predicted nuclear - powered rocket ships , household robots which could " put dishes away after the dishwasher was through " , human colonies throughout the solar system and beyond , " Beanstalk " orbital elevators etc etc .
Not to mention a dystopian future for America in which a crazed religious zealot would establish a theocratic dictatorship .
The all - American hero in that book joins a successful secret rebellion against the US government .
Not something that the feds at the DHS are likely to smile on .
But the Sigma writers are patriotic as well as qualified , and mostly have n't written anything off - message like that .
They 've produced some imaginative stuff nonetheless , and could well offer the DHS some pointers .
There will always be a stiff laugh test to pass when government takes advice from novelists .
Nonetheless , the feds may have history on their side here .
The DHS was formed as a response to the outrages of 9/11 , after all - events fairly similar to the suicide - 747 attack on the US Capitol at the end of Tom Clancy 's bestselling 1994 airport doorstopper Debt of Honor .
Scoffers beware .®
Aug. 3 , 2007LOS ANGELESAt a public event in Long Beach Friday morning , police officers accompanying Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa scuffled with reporters asking about the mayor and his girlfriend , Mirthala Salina , who was disciplined Thursday as a result of ethics violations at KVEA - TV , the Telemundo local station in Los Angeles .
One of the officers , a port policeman acting as a bodyguard , pushed a female reporter against a shipping container ; other reporters at the scene turned to the bodyguard and demanded his name .
The reporter who was pushed said she was not injured but claimed she had been mistreated by police .
NO MATTER how many members of Congress lose confidence in Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , President Bush is unlikely to let him go .
If Gonzales resigns , the vacancy must be filled by a new presidential nominee , and the last thing the White House wants is a confirmation hearing .
Already , the Senate is outlining conditions for confirming a Gonzales successor .
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , has said that his panel would not hold confirmation hearings unless Karl Rove and other White House aides testify about the firing of U.S. attorneys to clarify whether “ the White House has interfered with prosecution . ”
All this is reminiscent of the Watergate scandal .
In 1973 , as the coverup was unraveling , the Senate imposed a condition on the confirmation of President Nixon ’s nominee for attorney general , Elliot Richardson .
Richardson ’s predecessor had resigned because of Watergate troubles .
Concerned that the Justice Department would not get at the truth , the Senate insisted that Richardson would name a special prosecutor to investigate Watergate .
Richardson duly appointed Archibald Cox .
The rest is history .
Cox ’s aggressive investigations led to the prosecution of top administration officials and the naming of Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator in the coverup .
When Cox sought White House tapes of Nixon ’s conversations with his staff , the president had him fired , unleashing a firestorm of protests .
Americans demanded that a previously reluctant Congress start impeachment proceedings against Nixon .
Congress complied ; the House Judiciary Committee , of which I was a member , voted for impeachment , and Nixon resigned .

Aspects of this history could easily repeat themselves .
The Senate could demand , as it did in 1973 , that a new attorney general appoint a special prosecutor , and this could again have dire consequences for the White House .
A new special prosecutor would have many questions to investigate .
For starters , were any of the firings of U.S. attorneys federal crimes -- such as obstruction of justice , designed to stymie investigations or to retaliate for prosecutions of Republicans ?
If so , who is responsible and how high up does that responsibility go ?
Did Deputy Atty . Gen. Paul J. McNulty , who gave inaccurate testimony to Congress about the firings , commit any crime in doing so ?
Were those who briefed him for that testimony complicit ?
And what happened to the missing e-mail messages from Rove and others ?
Did these apparent violations of the Presidential Records Act -- failure to keep copies of the exchanges -- constitute federal crimes ?

So there is ample work for a special prosecutor .
The Senate could call for appointing one without waiting for Gonzales to resign .
But in that case , Gonzales or McNulty would be making the appointment , and the integrity of the choice would be highly questionable .
That leaves Senate confirmation hearings of a new attorney general nominee as the main leverage for Congress to secure an independent criminal investigation of the U.S. attorney firings .
Moreover , the Senate might use such hearings to do more than secure testimony from White House aides about the firings , as Leahy indicated .
It also might use the opportunity to probe the Justice Department ’s role in mistreatment of detainees , four years of flouting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other serious matters .
Rather than face such scrutiny , the White House may prefer keeping a drastically weakened Gonzales in place .
But doing so exacts a high price for the Justice Department and the nation .
It damages department morale and credibility , undermines its ability to recruit and could affect perceptions of federal prosecutors , jeopardizing important cases .
By retaining Gonzales to preempt Senate action , the president has signaled that this is a price he is willing to make the nation pay .
For a woman apparently ill - suited to anything more taxing than standing around nightclubs in a pair of really enormous sunglasses , Paris Hilton is quite the polymath .
In recent years , the hotel heiress has variously revealed herself to be a TV star , a perfumier , a jewellery designer , a nightclub owner , a model , an actor and an author ( albeit one whose book , Confessions of an Heiress , was described by a disgruntled Amazon customer as " a huge blow to the medium of literature as a whole " ) .
You read her CV and boggle at what wildly improbable occupation she might turn her hand to next .
Spot - welding ?
Cognitive neuropsychology ?
Alas , no : it 's singing .
Lest one carp , Hilton has been quick to point out that singing is a vocation for which she is eminently skilled .
" I know music , " she reassured the Sunday Times children 's section .
" I hear it every single day . "
While this obviously gives Hilton a massive advantage over those who have never heard any music and thus believe it to be a variety of cheese , there remains the nagging suspicion that this might not represent sufficient qualification for a career as a singer , in much the same way as knowing what a child is does not fully equip you for a career as a consultant paediatrician .
Nevertheless , you have to admire her pluck .
Putting your name to a ghostwritten book , appearing on reality TV shows and launching your own perfume collectively represent the sine qua non of 21st - century celebrity : they all do it .
But for some reason , a public only too willing to watch celebrities on TV , read their books and douse themselves in their branded scents balks when asked to listen to them sing .
Jordan could n't win A Song for Europe .
The minute Kelly Osbourne starts singing , audiences rise as one in order to throw things at her .
Understandably , those behind Hilton 's debut album have left little to chance , employing a vast team of crack producers and songwriters .
Some decisions regarding membership of said team seem a little baffling - when Hilton 's record label decided a reggae track " would be a really good fit " , they naturally called songwriter Shep Solomon , famed for mashing up Kingston dancehalls with militant Rastafarian collective S Club 7 and ragga 's Queen of Slackness Natalie Imbruglia - but you can't argue with its hit - making pedigree .
We should perhaps draw a veil over Kara DioGuardi , whose penchant for collaborating with Celine Dion and Pop Idol 's Darius makes her less a songwriter than a public nuisance , and instead focus on Scott Storch - producer to urban royalty from Busta Rhymes to Beyoncé - and Billy Steinberg .
The latter 's songwriting CV reads like the track listing of a CD with a steering wheel on the cover and sleeve notes by Jeremy Clarkson : Eternal Flame , Alone ( by Heart ) , I Drove All Night and the Divinyls ' I Touch Myself .
It would be churlish to deny they have done their job .
The songs are uniformly well - turned .
There is decaf R&B , Strokes - esque new wave pastiches , pop house , and lyrics that hint at Hilton 's private life : Jealousy takes aim at her skeletal nemesis Nicole Richie , while Screwed vaguely references the porn tape marketed by her oily ex-boyfriend .
But as Turn It Up cranks into life , you realise why Hilton felt it necessary to confirm to the Sunday Times that she knew what music was .
She sings like a woman who has heard of something called singing , can't be sure of exactly what it might entail , but is fairly certain you do something a bit like this .
She sounds both distracted and bored stiff , as if making an album is keeping her from the more serious business of standing around a nightclub in a pair of really enormous sunglasses .
On Stars Are Blind , the combination of tinny cod-reggae and your - call - is - being - held - in - a - queue vocal technique results in something so plasticky , it 's perversely enjoyable .
Elsewhere , Hilton 's audible lack of interest torpedoes her own chances .
Someone has encouraged her to make erotically charged squeals of affirmation and panting noises , with deleterious results .
" Yah !
Uh - huh - huh !
Yah ! " she huffs , like a Sloane Ranger having an asthma attack .
Listening to her sing Rod Stewart 's Do Ya Think I'm Sexy , you are gripped by the fear that civilisation as we know it is doomed and that brimstone is going to start raining from the sky any minute .
It does n't , but a sense of terrible foreboding is further stoked by the sleeve notes , which make reference to " all my albums to come " .
You might call that another example of the sheer force of will that has got Hilton so far in so many improbable careers , but on the basis of the 11 tracks here , it sounds more like a threat .
The chart above is from a 1995 Reason Magazine article " The Good Old Days Are Now , " by W. Michael Cox , senior vice president and chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .
Forget what you 've heard in the media about " working harder and getting further behind . "
Most Americans today have both more leisure and better goods than they did even 10 or 20 years ago , and most of us certainly live at a much higher standard of living than our grandparents or great - grandparents , despite the fact that many people today mistakenly think their standard of living is declining .
Exhibit A : Look at the evidence in the chart above , and consider that further improvements have been made since 1990 .
We now live longer , start to work later in life and work much less annually ( 1,562 hours annually in 1990 vs. 3,069 hours in 1870 ) , spend 30 % less time working around the home vs. 100 years ago , retire earlier , have an increasing number of years in retirement ( expected time in retirement was 0 years through all of human history until the last quarter century or so ) , experience 3X as much waking leisure now compared to our ancestors in the 1800s , etc. etc .
According to Dr. Cox , " Being distracted by the myth of declining living standards is n't getting us anywhere .
The evidence is overwhelming .
On average , Americans are better off than ever before . "
Just ask yourself : would you be willing to trade the life you lead today , with your current income and with all of the modern conveniences , all of the new and improved products like computers and cell phones , all of the medical advances , for the life of your great - grandparents ?
I sure would n't , and I think the people who would trade their standard of living today for their grandparents ' would be the rare exception .
With distributed computing , many software components of one working system may be separated geographically .
The need for these components to communicate is obvious , and this need drives many software design decisions .
For instance , you might choose to use CORBA , SOAP , or message - oriented middleware for intercomponent communication .
SOAP - based web - service development continues to grow , and uses XML and HTTP to remove the implementation details from remote procedure calls .
But while SOAP has broken new ground in distributed computing , message - oriented middleware such as the Java Message Service ( JMS ) is still my tool of choice when reliability , performance , and security are top priorities .
JMS is a specification ( java.sun.com / products /jms ) that describes the properties and behavior of an information pipe for Java software .
It also describes how Java client applications interact with the information pipe .
In this article , I examine messaging concepts and implement a JMS application .
What Is Messaging ?
The concept of messaging begins with the goal of delivering data .
Enterprise messaging forms the basis for an infrastructure dedicated to communication between disparate components in distributed software systems .
The important components in messaging systems producers , consumers , and the messages themselves are abstracted via interfaces .
The result is a set of loosely coupled components that are part of a cohesive software system .
Components that are loosely coupled have as few direct interactions with one another as possible .
This isolation leads to more robust software , as changes to one part of the system do not ripple through to other parts .
A good messaging system does this by abstracting the components from one another in the system .
( For more information , see my book Java Messaging , Delmar - Thomson Learning Inc. , 2006 . )
Every messaging system consists of a broker component that is responsible for delivering messages to and from the various components interacting with the messaging system .
Messaging brokers generally treat messages as opaque , meaning they tend to ignore the content within the message .
In fact , the broker does not need to know the purpose or content of a message to deliver it .
In turn , the software components that send / receive the messages do n't need to know how the messages are delivered , or which components sent them .
The important part is that they are sent and received reliably .
Monks at China 's Shaolin Temple are vociferously demanding an apology from an anonymous Japanese internet user who suggested that a single ninja had once whupped the asses of the kung fu masters at the martial art 's spiritual home .
Specifically , " Five Minutes Every Day " last week posted a comment in an online forum claiming that " a Japanese ninja came to Shaolin , asked for a fight and many monks failed to beat him " .
He added : " The facts that the monks could not defeat a Japanese ninja showed that they were named as kung fu masters in vain . "
Well , this did n't go down too well at all .
According to Reuters , the Shaolin monks rapidly engaged a lawyer , who issued a notice declaring : " The so - called defeat is purely fabricated , and we demand the internet user to apologise to the whole nation for the wrongs he or she did . "
The monks further told the Beijing News : " It is not only extremely irresponsible behaviour with respect to the Shaolin temple and its monks , but also to the whole martial art and Chinese nation . "
We 'd like to suggest that before this gets out of hand the kung fu monks could settle the matter out of court by simply challenging Japan 's top ninja to 15 rounds in a pay - per - view WWF - style " Battle of the Titans " .
The last Oriental standing could then go on to challenge aikido death machine Steven Seagal for the coveted " Hardest Man Alive " crown . ®
A grandmother targeted by the RIAA for file - sharing is striking back at the controversial music industry association , arguing that it has knowingly engaged in " one or more overt acts of unlawful private investigation " to further its case .
Ms. Crain , the defendant in an eight - month - old P2P lawsuit , had her fill of hot air when she escaped Hurricane Rita .
When Mother Nature was bested by yet another " RIAA vs. Grandma " lawsuit , she decided it was time to strike back .
Crain says that she 'd never even heard of file sharing before she was named in the suit , so when the RIAA came looking for a $ 4,500 payout , Ms. Crain lawyeredup and filed a counterclaim against the RIAA .
The whole ball of wax is Sony vs. Crain , filed in Texas .
It has now come to light that the case is taking a new turn , as Ms. Crain 's attorney has filed a motion to amend their counterclaims to include new allegations against the RIAA and its investigative partners .
According to court documents , Ms. Crain " has become aware upon information and belief that [ the RIAA ] have illegally employed unlicensed investigators in the State of Texas and used the information thereby obtained to file this and other similar actions across the country . "
At the heart of the issue is a Texas law which says that investigations companies must be licensed in order to collect evidence that can be used in a court .
According to court documents , Ms. Crain says that MediaSentry — the company carrying out the investigations for the RIAA — was aware of this requirement , both in Texas and in several other states , and ignored it .
The counterclaims even suggest that the RIAA encouraged this arrangement .
" [ The RIAA and MediaSentry ] agreed between themselves and understood that unlicensed and unlawful investigations would take place in order to provide evidence for this lawsuit , as well as thousands of others as part of a mass litigation campaign , " reads the motion .
Ms. Crain 's attorney argues that such actions constitute " civil conspiracy " under Texas law and led to her suffering much undue distress .
MediaSentry , the investigative company at the center of the allegations , is used by the RIAA , MPAA , and a handful of other groups to track and identify P2P users believed to be infringing copyrights .
Should Ms. Crain prevail in her counterclaims , it could jeopardize the evidence collected by MediaSentry not just in Texas , but in other states where similar licensing provisions exist .
Earlier this month Tanya Andersen prevailed in her battle with the RIAA : a battle which also focused on issues of evidence .
That victory came at the same time that we learned of another defendant suing the RIAA for fraud , conspiracy , and extortion .

The deepest and most universal geek impulse is to screw the back off a piece of equipment and poke about , to understand how it works , and to work out how it can work better for you .
It ’s an impulse celebrated in the work at places like Make , but also more than that , in every good classroom and university in the country .
Phreaking is a fascinating expression of that impulse : the use of geek knowledge and understanding to spoof the phone system , a huge international web of engineering , and fool it into working for you , by reverse engineering the signals that are sent between systems , and devising ways of transmitting counterfeits of those signals .
It ’s barely possible to do any more in the UK ( it ’s also spectacularly illegal , so do n’t even try ) .
But in any case , phreaking was never about getting free phone calls , or at least , not much : it ’s about the same impulse that drives people to the occult , the desire to peek behind the curtain , to get into the fabric of the universe , and rework it to your own will .
Now that electronics and computers define our vision of the world , and create the fabric which most of us take for granted , people who can understand , dismantle and remodel that world are witchier than any witch ever was , because they can really do stuff .
This is evidence based mischief .
Nerd piracy .
What I ’m trying to tell you , once again , is that being a geek is a good thing .
If you live in the UK , and you never knew the fun that could be had with a 13 mm hex wrench , then at least you can read this , featuring Joe Engressia , the original Phone Phreak , from 1971 .
There ’s more recent UK oriented stuff to be found on Google , but again , I really do n’t recommend getting involved in mucking about with the phone system ( it ’s illegal , it ’s dangerous , it ’s basically wrong , and I strongly suspect it ’s not even possible any more ) : what ’s exciting , to me , is that just as disease states can reveal to us how the human body works , so this kind of tinkering can generate an interest and understanding in how these huge infrastructures work , when previously we all just took them for granted .
And hurrah to that .

If you happen to be in a library and come across a collection of Esquire magazines , the October 1971 issue is the first issue printed in the smaller format .
The story begins on page 116 with a picture of a blue box .
– One Farad Cap , Atlantic Anarchist Guild
The Blue Box Is Introduced : Its Qualities Are Remarked
I am in the expensively furnished living room of Al Gilbertson ( His real name has been changed . ) , the creator of the “ blue box . ”
Gilbertson is holding one of his shiny black - and - silver “ blue boxes ” comfortably in the palm of his hand , pointing out the thirteen little red push buttons sticking up from the console .
He is dancing his fingers over the buttons , tapping out discordant beeping electronic jingles .
He is trying to explain to me how his little blue box does nothing less than place the entire telephone system of the world , satellites , cables and all , at the service of the blue - box operator , free of charge .
“ That ’s what it does .
Essentially it gives you the power of a super operator .
You seize a tandem with this top button , ” he presses the top button with his index finger and the blue box emits a high - pitched cheep , “ and like that ” — cheep goes the blue box again — “ you control the phone company ’s long - distance switching systems from your cute little Princes phone or any old pay phone .
And you ’ve got anonymity .
An operator has to operate from a definite location :
the phone company knows where she is and what she ’s doing .
But with your beeper box , once you hop onto a trunk , say from a Holiday Inn 800 ( toll - free ) number , they do n’t know where you are , or where you ’re coming from , they do n’t know how you slipped into their lines and popped up in that 800 number .
They do n’t even know anything illegal is going on .
And you can obscure your origins through as many levels as you like .
You can call next door by way of White Plains , then over to Liverpool by cable , and then back here by satellite .
You can call yourself from one pay phone all the way around the world to a pay phone next to you .
And you get your dime back too . ”
“ And they ca n’t trace the calls ?
They ca n’t charge you ? ”
“ Not if you do it the right way .
But you ’ll find that the free - call thing is n’t really as exciting at first as the feeling of power you get from having one of these babies in your hand .
I ’ve watched people when they first get hold of one of these things and start using it , and discover they can make connections , set up crisscross and zigzag switching patterns back and forth across the world .
They hardly talk to the people they finally reach .
They say hello and start thinking of what kind of call to make next .
They go a little crazy . ”
He looks down at the neat little package in his palm .
His fingers are still dancing , tapping out beeper patterns .
“ I think it ’s something to do with how small my models are .
There are lots of blue boxes around , but mine are the smallest and most sophisticated electronically .
I wish I could show you the prototype we made for our big syndicate order . ”
He sighs .
“ We had this order for a thousand beeper boxes from a syndicate front man in Las Vegas .
They use them to place bets coast to coast , keep lines open for hours , all of which can get expensive if you have to pay .
The deal was a thousand blue boxes for $ 300 apiece .
Before then we retailed them for $ 1500 apiece , but $ 300,000 in one lump was hard to turn down .
We had a manufacturing deal worked out in the Philippines .
Everything ready to go .
Anyway , the model I had ready for limited mass production was small enough to fit inside a flip - top Marlboro box .
It had flush touch panels for a keyboard , rather than these unsightly buttons , sticking out .
Looked just like a tiny portable radio .
In fact , I had designed it with a tiny transistor receiver to get one AM channel , so in case the law became suspicious the owner could switch on the radio part , start snapping his fingers , and no one could tell anything illegal was going on .
I thought of everything for this model — I had it lined with a band of thermite which could be ignited by radio signal from a tiny button transmitter on your belt , so it could be burned to ashes instantly in case of a bust .
It was beautiful .
A beautiful little machine .
You should have seen the faces on these syndicate guys when they came back after trying it out .
They ’d hold it in their palm like they never wanted to let it go , and they ’d say , ‘ I ca n’t believe it .
I ca n’t believe it . ’
You probably wo n’t believe it until you try it . ”
The Blue Box Is Tested : Certain Connections Are Made
About eleven o’clock two nights later Fraser Lucey has a blue box in the palm of his left hand and a phone in the palm of his right .
He is standing inside a phone booth next to an isolated shut - down motel off Highway 1 .
I am standing outside the phone booth .
Fraser likes to show off his blue box for people .
Until a few weeks ago when Pacific Telephone made a few arrests in his city , Fraser Lucey liked to bring his blue box ( This particular blue box , like most blue boxes , is not blue .
Blue boxes have come to be called “ blue boxes ” either because 1 ) The first blue box ever confiscated by phone - company security men happened to be blue , or 2 ) To distinguish them from “ black boxes . ”
Black boxes are devices , usually a resistor in series , which , when attached to home phones , allow all incoming calls to be made without charge to one ’s caller . ) to parties .
It never failed : a few cheeps from his device and Fraser became the center of attention at the very hippest of gatherings , playing phone tricks and doing request numbers for hours .
He began to take orders for his manufacturer in Mexico .
He became a dealer .
Fraser is cautious now about where he shows off his blue box .
But he never gets tired of playing with it .
“ It ’s like the first time every time , ” he tells me .
Fraser puts a dime in the slot .
He listens for a tone and holds the receiver up to my ear .
I hear the tone .
Fraser begins describing , with a certain practiced air , what he does while he does it .
“ I ’m dialing an 800 number now .
Any 800 number will do .
It ’s toll free .
Tonight I think I ’ll use the — – ( he names a well - know rent - a - car company ) 800 number .
Listen ,
It ’s ringing .
Here , you hear it ?
Now watch . ”
He places the blue box over the mouthpiece of the phone so that the one silver and twelve black push buttons are facing up toward me .
He presses the silver button — the one at the top — and I hear that high - pitched beep .
“ That ’s 2600 cycles per second to be exact , ” says Lucey .
“ Now , quick .
listen . ”
He shoves the earpiece at me .
The ringing has vanished .
The line gives a slight hiccough , there is a sharp buzz , and then nothing but soft white noise .
“ We ’re home free now , ” Lucey tells me , taking back the phone and applying the blue box to its mouthpiece once again .
“ We ’re up on a tandem , into a long - lines trunk .
Once you ’re up on a tandem , you can send yourself anywhere you want to go . ”
He decides to check out London first .
He chooses a certain pay phone located in Waterloo Station .
This particular pay phone is popular with the phone - phreaks network because there are usually people walking by at all hours who will pick it up and talk for a while .
of the box .
“ That ’s Key Pulse .
It tells the tandem we ’re ready to give it instructions .
First I ’ll punch out KP 182 START , which will slide us into the overseas sender in White Plains . ”
I hear a neat clunk - cheep .
“ I think we ’ll head over to England by satellite .
Cable is actually faster and the connection is somewhat better , but I like going by satellite .
So I just punch out KP Zero 44 .
The Zero is supposed to guarantee a satellite connection and 44 is the country code for England .
Okay … we ’re there .
In Liverpool actually .
Now all I have to do is punch out the London area code which is 1 , and dial up the pay phone .
Here , listen , I ’ve got a ring now . ”
I hear the soft quick purr-purr of a London ring .
Then someone picks up the phone .
“ Hello , ” says the London voice .
“ Hello .
Who ’s this ? ”
Fraser asks .
“ Hello .
There ’s actually nobody here .
I just picked this up while I was passing by .
This is a public phone .
There ’s no one here to answer actually . ”
“ Hello .
Do n’t hang up .
I ’m calling from the United States . ” ,
“ Oh .
What is the purpose of the call ?
This is a public phone you know . ”
“ Oh .
You know .
To check out , uh , to find out what ’s going on in London .
How is it there ? ”
“ Its five o’clock in the morning .
It ’s raining now . ”
“ Oh . Who are you ? ”
The London passerby turns out to be an R.A.F. enlistee on his way back to the base in Lincolnshire , with a terrible hangover after a thirty - six - hour pass .
He and Fraser talk about the rain .
They agree that it ’s nicer when it ’s not raining .
They say good - bye and Fraser hangs up .
His dime returns with a nice clink .
“ Is n’t that far out , ” he says grinning at me .
“ London , like that . ”
Fraser squeezes the little blue box affectionately in his palm .
“ I told ya this thing is for real .
Listen , if you do n’t mind I ’m gonna try this girl I know in Paris .
I usually give her a call around this time .
It freaks her out .
This time I ’ll use the — — ( a different rent - a - car company ) 800 number and we ’ll go by overseas cable , 133 ; 33 is the country code for France , the 1 sends you by cable .
Okay , here we go … .
Oh damn .
Busy .
Who could she be talking to at this time ? ”
A state police car cruises slowly by the motel .
The car does not stop , but Fraser gets nervous .
We hop back into his car and drive ten miles in the opposite direction until we reach a Texaco station locked up for the night .
We pull up to a phone booth by the tire pump .
Fraser dashes inside and tries the Paris number .
It is busy again .
“ I do n’t understand who she could be talking to .
The circuits may be busy .
It ’s too bad I have n’t learned how to tap into lines overseas with this thing yet . ”
Fraser begins to phreak around , as the phone phreaks say .
He dials a leading nationwide charge card ’s 800 number and punches out the tones that bring him the time recording in Sydney , Australia .
He beeps up the weather recording in Rome , in Italian of course .
He calls a friend in Boston and talks about a certain over - the - counter stock they are into heavily .
He finds the Paris number busy again .
He calls up “ Dial a Disc ” in London , and we listen to Double Barrel by David and Ansil Collins , the number - one hit of the week in London .
He calls up a dealer of another sort and talks in code .
He calls up Joe Engressia , the original blind phone - phreak genius , and pays his respects .
There are other calls .
Finally Fraser gets through to his young lady in Paris .
They both agree the circuits must have been busy , and criticize the Paris telephone system .
At two - thirty in the morning Fraser hangs up , pockets his dime , and drives off , steering with one hand , holding what he calls his “ lovely little blue box ” in the other .
You Can Call Long Distance For Less Than You Think
“ You see , a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake , ” Gilbertson explains two days later in his apartment .
“ They were careless enough to let some technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all their multi- frequency tones .
Just a theoretical article some Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer was doing about switching theory , and he listed the tones in passing .
At — – ( a well - known technical school ) I had been fooling around with phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in the engineering library .
I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours from the time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box .
It was bigger and clumsier than this little baby , but it worked . ”
It ’s all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly by Bell Lab people for other telephone engineers .
Or at least it was public .
“ Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering - school library now .
Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation , ” Gilbertson tells me .
“ But it ’s too late .
It ’s all public now .
And once they became public the technology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range of any twelve - year - old kid , any twelve - year - old blind kid as a matter of fact .
And he can do it in less than the twelve hours it took us .
Blind kids do it all the time .
They ca n’t build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box , but theirs can do anything mine can do . ”
“ How ? ”
“ Okay .
About twenty years ago A.T.&T. made a multi-billion - dollar decision to operate its entire long - distance switching system on twelve electronically generated combinations of twelve master tones .
Those are the tones you sometimes hear in the background after you ’ve dialed a long - distance number .
They decided to use some very simple tones — the tone for each number is just two fixed single - frequency tones played simultaneously to create a certain beat frequency .
Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second played together give you the tone for digit 5 .
Now , what some of these phone phreaks have done is get themselves access to an electric organ .
Any cheap family home - entertainment organ .
Since the frequencies are public knowledge now — one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of the talking books for the blind — they just have to find the musical notes on the organ which correspond to the phone tones .
Then they tape them .
For instance , to get Ma Bell ’s tone for the number 1 , you press down organ keys FD5 and AD5 ( 900 and 700 cycles per second ) at the same time .
To produce the tone for 2 it ’s FD5 and CD6 ( 1100 and 700 c.p.s ) .
The phone phreaks circulate the whole list of notes so there ’s no trial and error anymore . ”
He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organ keys that produce them .
“ Actually , you have to record these notes at 3 3/ 4 inches - per - second tape speed and double it to 7 1/ 2 inches - per - second when you play them back , to get the proper tones , ” he adds .
“ So once you have all the tones recorded , how do you plug them into the phone system ? ”
“ Well , they take their organ and their cassette recorder , and start banging out entire phone numbers in tones on the organ , including country codes , routing instructions , ‘ KP ’ and ‘ Start ’ tones .
Or , if they do n’t have an organ , someone in the phone - phreak network sends them a cassette with all the tones recorded , with a voice saying ‘ Number one , ’ then you have the tone , ‘ Number two , ’ then the tone and so on .
So with two cassette recorders they can put together a series of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number .
Any idiot in the country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free calls he wants . ”
“ You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up the mouthpiece and switch in a series of beeps you ’ve recorded ?
The phone thinks that anything that makes these tones must be its own equipment ? ”
“ Right .
As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second of the phone company ’s tones , the phone equipment thinks it hears its own voice talking to it .
The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid with perfect pitch , Joe Engressia , who used to whistle into the phone .
An operator could tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company ’s electronic tone generator , but the phone company ’s switching circuit can’t tell them apart .
The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from human operators it gets , the more vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phone phreaking . ”
A Guide for the Perplexed
“ But wait a minute , ” I stop Gilbertson .
“ If everything you do sounds like phone - company equipment , why does n’t the phone company charge you for the call the way it charges its own equipment ? ”
“ Okay .
That ’s where the 2600 - cycle tone comes in .
I better start from the beginning . ”
The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of the continent as thousands of webs , of long - line trunks radiating from each of the hundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices .
Each toll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of long - distance tandems constantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far - off toll switching offices .
The tandem is the key to the whole system .
Each tandem is a line with some relays wih the capability of signalling any other tandem in any other toll switching office on the continent , either directly one - to - one or by programming a roundabout route through several other tandems if all the direct routes are busy .
For instance , if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles and traffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the two cities , your tandem in New York is programmed to try the next best route , which may send you down to a tandem in New Orleans , then up to San Francisco , or down to a New Orleans tandem , back to an Atlanta tandem , over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally up to Los Angeles .
When a tandem is not being used , when it ’s sitting there waiting for someone to make a long - distance call , it whistles .
One side of the tandem , the side “ facing ” your home phone , whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all the home phones serviced by the exchange , telling them it is at their service , should they be interested in making a long - distance call .
The other side of the tandem is whistling 2600 c.p.s. into one or more long - distance trunk lines , telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving a call through that trunk at the moment , that it has no use for that trunk at the moment .
“ When you dial a long - distance number the first thing that happens is that you are hooked into a tandem .
A register comes up to the side of the tandem facing away from you and presents that side with the number you dialed .
This sending side of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its trunk line .
When a tandem stops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk , the trunk is said to be “ seized , ” and is now ready to carry the number you have dialed — converted into multi- frequency beep tones — to a tandem in the area code and central office you want .
Now when a blue - box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New York he starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which might happen to have its headquarters in Los Angeles .
The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stops sending 2600 out over the trunk to the central office in Los Angeles , thereby seizing the trunk .
Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to a tandem it has discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles .
The receiving end of that L.A. tandem is seized , stops whistling 2600 , listens to the beep tones which tell it which L.A. phone to ring , and starts ringing the 800 number .
Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting tape notes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in L.A. has been initiated and gives the call a code number .
Everything is routine so far .
But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes the over the line again and assumes that New Orleans has hung up because the trunk is whistling as if idle .
The L.A. tandem immediately ceases ringing the L.A. 800 number .
But as soon as the phreak takes his finger off the 2600 button , the L.A. tandem assumes the trunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone , so it listens for a new series of digit tones – to find out where it must send the call .
Thus the blue - box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in L.A. which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do next .
The blue - box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tell the L.A. tandem to relay a call to New York City .
Which it promptly does .
As soon as your party picks up the phone in New York , the side of the New Orleans tandem facing you stops sending 2600 cycles to you and stars carrying his voice to you by way of the L.A. tandem .
A notation is made on the accounting tape that the connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated and noted earlier .
When you stop talking to New York a notation is made that the 800 call has ended .
At three the next morning , when the phone company ’s accounting computer starts reading back over the master accounting tape for the past day , it records that a call of a certain length of time was made from your New Orleans home to an L.A. 800 number and , of course , the accounting computer has been trained to ignore those toll - free 800 calls when compiling your monthly bill .
“ All they can prove is that you made an 800 toll - free call , ” Gilbertson the inventor concludes .
“ Of course , if you ’re foolish enough to talk for two hours on an 800 call , and they ’ve installed one of their special anti-fraud computer programs to watch out for such things , they may spot you and ask why you took two hours talking to Army Recruiting ’s 800 number when you ’re 4 - F .
But if you do it from a pay phone , they may discover something peculiar the next day — if they ’ve got a blue - box hunting program in their computer — but you ’ll be a long time gone from the pay phone by then .
Using a pay phone is almost guaranteed safe . ”
“ What about the recent series of blue - box arrests all across the country — New York , Cleveland , and so on ? ” I asked .
“ How were they caught so easily ? ” “ From what I can tell , they made one big mistake : they were seizing trunks using an area code plus 555 - 1212 instead of an 800 number .
Using 555 is easy to detect because when you send multi- frequency beep tones of 555 you get a charge for it on your tape and the accounting computer knows there ’s something wrong when it tries to bill you for a two - hour call to Akron , Ohio , information , and it drops a trouble card which goes right into the hands of the security agent if they ’re looking for blue - box user .
“ Whoever sold those guys their blue boxes did n’t tell them how to use them properly , which is fairly irresponsible .
And they were fairly stupid to use them at home all the time .
“ But what those arrests really mean is than an awful lot of blue boxes are flooding into the country and that people are finding them so easy to make that they know how to make them before they know how to use them .
Ma Bell is in trouble . ”
And if a blue - box operator or a cassette - recorder phone phreak sticks to pay phones and 800 numbers , the phone company ca n’t stop them ?
“ Not unless they change their entire nationwide long - lines technology , which will take them a few billion dollars and twenty years .
Right now they ca n’t do a thing .
They ’re screwed . ”
Captain Crunch Demonstrates
His Famous Unit
There is an underground telephone network in this country .
Gilbertson discovered it the very day news of his activities hit the papers .
That evening his phone began ringing .
Phone phreaks from Seattle , from Florida , from New York , from San Jose , and from Los Angeles began calling him and telling him about the phone - phreak network .
He ’d get a call from a phone phreak who ’d say nothing but , “ Hang up and call this number . ”
When he dialed the number he ’d find himself tied into a conference of a dozen phone phreaks arranged through a quirky switching station in British Columbia .
They identified themselves as phone phreaks , they demonstrated their homemade blue boxes which they called “ M - Fers ” ( for “ multi - frequency , ” among other things ) for him , they talked shop about phone - phreak devices .
They let him in on their secrets on the theory that if the phone company was after him he must be trustworthy .
And , Gilbertson recalls , they stunned him with their technical sophistication .
I ask him how to get in touch with the phone - phreak network .
He digs around through a file of old schematics and comes up with about a dozen numbers in three widely separated area codes .
“ Those are the centers , ” he tells me .
Alongside some of the numbers he writes in first names or nicknames : names like Captain Crunch , Dr. No , Frank Carson ( also a code word for a free call ) , Marty Freeman ( code word for M - F device ) , Peter Perpendicular Pimple , Alefnull , and The Cheshire Cat .
He makes checks alongside the names of those among these top twelve who are blind .
There are five checks .
I ask him who this Captain Crunch person is .
“ Oh . The Captain .
He ’s probably the most legendary phone phreak .
He calls himself Captain Crunch after the notorious Cap ’n Crunch 2600 whistle . ”
( Several years ago , Gilbertson explains , the makers of Cap ’n Crunch breakfast cereal offered a toy - whistle prize in every box as a treat for the Cap ’n Crunch set .
Somehow a phone phreak discovered that the toy whistle just happened to produce a perfect 2600 - cycle tone .
When the man who calls himself Captain Crunch was transferred overseas to England with his Air Force unit , he would receive scores of calls from his friends and “ mute ” them — make them free of charge to them — by blowing his Cap ’n Crunch whistle into his end . )
“ Captain Crunch is one of the older phone phreaks , ” Gilbertson tells me .
“ He ’s an engineer who once got in a little trouble for fooling around with the phone , but he ca n’t stop .
Well , they guy drives across country in a Volkswagen van with an entire switchboard and a computerized super - sophisticated M - F - er in the back .
He ’ll pull up to a phone booth on a lonely highway somewhere , snake a cable out of his bus , hook it onto the phone and sit for hours , days sometimes , sending calls zipping back and forth across the country , all over the world … . ”
Back at my motel , I dialed the number he gave me for “ Captain Crunch ” and asked for G — - T —– , his real name , or at least the name he uses when he ’s not dashing into a phone booth beeping out M- F tones faster than a speeding bullet and zipping phantomlike through the phone company ’s long - distance lines .
When G — - T — – answered the phone and I told him I was preparing a story for Esquire about phone phreaks , he became very indignant .
“ I do n’t do that .
I do n’t do that anymore at all .
And if I do it , I do it for one reason and one reason only .
I ’m learning about a system .
The phone company is a System .
A computer is a System , do you understand ?
If I do what I do , it is only to explore a system .
Computers , systems , that ’s my bag .
The phone company is nothing but a computer . ”
A tone of tightly restrained excitement enters the Captain ’s voice when he starts talking about systems .
He begins to pronounce each syllable with the hushed deliberation of an obscene caller .
“ Ma Bell is a system I want to explore .
It ’s a beautiful system , you know , but Ma Bell screwed up .
It ’s terrible because Ma Bell is such a beautiful system , but she screwed up .
I learned how she screwed up from a couple of blind kids who wanted me to build a device .
A certain device .
They said it could make free calls .
I was n’t interested in free calls .
But when these blind kids told me I could make calls into a computer , my eyes lit up .
I wanted to learn about computers .
I wanted to learn about Ma Bell ’s computers .
So I build the little device , but I built it wrong and Ma Bell found out .
Ma Bell can detect things like that .
Ma Bell knows .
So I ’m strictly rid of it now .
I do n’t do it .
Except for learning purposes . ”
He pauses .
“ So you want to write an article .
Are you paying for this call ?
Hang up and call this number . ”
He gives me a number in a area code a thousand miles away of his own .
I dial the number .
“ Hello again .
This is Captain Crunch .
You are speaking to me on a toll - free loop - around in Portland , Oregon .
Do you know what a toll - free loop around is ?
I ’ll tell you .
He explains to me that almost every exchange in the country has open test numbers which allow other exchanges to test their connections with it .
Most of these numbers occur in consecutive pairs , such as 302 956-0041 and 302 956-0042 .
Well , certain phone phreaks discovered that if two people from anywhere in the country dial the two consecutive numbers they can talk together just as if one had called the other ’s number , with no charge to either of them , of course .
“ Now our voice is looping around in a 4A switching machine up there in Canada , zipping back down to me , ” the Captain tells me .
“ My voice is looping around up there and back down to you .
And it ca n’t ever cost anyone money .
The phone phreaks and I have compiled a list of many many of these numbers .
You would be surprised if you saw the list .
I could show it to you .
But I wo n’t .
I ’m out of that now .
I ’m not out to screw Ma Bell .
I know better .
If I do anything it ’s for the pure knowledge of the System .
You can learn to do fantastic things .
Have you ever heard eight tandems stacked up ?
Do you know the sound of tandems stacking and unstacking ?
Give me your phone number .
Okay .
Hang up now and wait a minute . ”
Slightly less than a minute later the phone rang and the Captain was on the line , his voice sounding far more excited , almost aroused .
“ I wanted to show you what it ’s like to stack up tandems .
To stack up tandems . ”
( Whenever the Captain says “ stack up ” it sounds as if he is licking his lips . )
“ How do you like the connection you ’re on now ? ” the Captain asks me .
“ It ’s a raw tandem .
A raw tandem .
Ain’t nothin ’ up to it but a tandem .
Now I ’m going to show you what it ’s like to stack up .
Blow off .
Land in a far away place .
To stack that tandem up , whip back and forth across the country a few times , then shoot on up to Moscow .
“ Listen , ” Captain Crunch continues .
“ Listen .
I ’ve got line tie on my switchboard here , and I ’m gonna let you hear me stack and unstack tandems .
Listen to this .
It ’s gonna blow your mind . ”
First I hear a super rapid - fire pulsing of the flutelike phone tones , then a pause , then another popping burst of tones , then another , then another .
Each burst is followed by a beep - kachink sound .
“ We have now stacked up four tandems , ” said Captain Crunch , sounding somewhat remote .
“ That ’s four tandems stacked up .
Do you know what that means ?
That means I ’m whipping back and forth , back and forth twice , across the country , before coming to you .
I ’ve been known to stack up twenty tandems at a time .
Now , just like I said , I ’m going to shoot up to Moscow . ”
There is a new , longer series of beeper pulses over the line , a brief silence , then a ring .
“ Hello , ” answers a far - off voice .
“ Hello .
Is this the American Embassy Moscow ? ”
Moscow ? ”
“ Okay ? ”
“ Well , yes , how are things there ? ”
“ Oh .
Well , everything okay , I guess . ”
“ Okay .
Thank you . ”
They hang up , leaving a confused series of beep - kachink sounds hanging in mid-ether in the wake of the call before dissolving away .
The Captain is pleased .
“ You believe me now , do n’t you ?
Do you know what I ’d like to do ?
I ’d just like to call up your editor at Esquire and show him just what it sounds like to stack and unstack tandems .
I ’ll give him a show that will blow his mind .
What ’s his number ?
I ask the Captain what kind of device he was using to accomplish all his feats .
The Captain is pleased at the question .
“ You could tell it was special , could n’t you ? ”
Ten pulses per second .
That ’s faster than the phone company ’s equipment .
Believe me , this unit is the most famous unit in the country .
There is no other unit like it .
Believe me . ”
“ Yes , I ’ve heard about it .
Some other phone phreaks have told me about it . ”
“ They have been referring to my , ahem , unit ?
What is it they said ?
Just out of curiosity , did they tell you it was a highly sophisticated computer - operated unit , with acoustical coupling for receiving outputs and a switch - board with multiple - line - tie capability ?
Did they tell you that the frequency tolerance is guaranteed to be not more than .05 percent ?
The amplitude tolerance less than .01 decibel ?
Those pulses you heard were perfect .
They just come faster than the phone company .
Those were high - precision op - amps .
Op-amps are instrumentation amplifiers designed for ultra-stable amplification , super - low distortion and accurate frequency response .
Did they tell you it can operate in temperatures from - 55 degrees C to +125 degrees C ? ”
I admit that they did not tell me all that .
“ I built it myself , ” the Captain goes on .
“ If you were to go out and buy the components from an industrial wholesaler it would cost you at least $ 1500 .
I once worked for a semiconductor company and all this did n’t cost me a cent .
Do you know what I mean ?
Did they tell you about how I put a call completely around the world ?
I ’ll tell you how I did it .
I M-Fed Tokyo inward , who connected me to India , India connected me to Greece , Greece connected me to Pretoria , South Africa , South Africa connected me to South America , I went from South America to London , I had a London operator connect me to a New York operator , I had New York connect me to a California operator who rang the phone next to me .
Needless to say I had to shout to hear myself .
But the echo was far out .
Fantastic .
Delayed .
It was delayed twenty seconds , but I could hear myself talk to myself . ”
“ You mean you were speaking into the mouthpiece of one phone sending your voice around the world into your ear through a phone on the other side of your head ? ” I asked the Captain .
I had a vision of something vaguely autoerotic going on , in a complex electronic way .
“ That ’s right , ” said the Captain .
“ I ’ve also sent my voice around the world one way , going east on one phone , and going west on the other , going through cable one way , satellite the other , coming back together at the same time , ringing the two phones simultaneously and picking them up and whipping my voice both ways around the world back to me .
Wow .
That was a mind blower . ”
“ You mean you sit there with both phones on your ear and talk to yourself around the world , ” I said incredulously .
“ Yeah .
Um hum .
That ’s what I do .
I connect the phone together and sit there and talk . ”
“ What do you say ?
What do you say to yourself when you ’re connected ? ”
“ Oh , you know .
Hello test one two three , ” he says in a low - pitched voice .
“ Hello test one two three , ” he replied to himself in a high - pitched voice .
“ Hello test one two three , ” he repeats again , low - pitched .
“ Hello test one two three , ” he replies , high - pitched .
“ I sometimes do this : Hello Hello Hello Hello , Hello , hello , ” he trails off and breaks into laughter .
Why Captain Crunch Hardly Ever Taps Phones Anymore
Using internal phone - company codes , phone phreaks have learned a simple method for tapping phones .
Phone - company operators have in front of them a board that holds verification jacks .
It allows them to plug into conversations in case of emergency , to listen in to a line to determine if the line is busy or the circuits are busy .
Phone phreaks have learned to beep out the codes which lead them to a verification operator , tell the verification operator they are switchmen from some other area code testing out verification trunks .
Once the operator hooks them into the verification trunk , they disappear into the board for all practical purposes , slip unnoticed into any one of the 10,000 to 100,000 numbers in that central office without the verification operator knowing what they ’re doing , and of course without the two parties to the connection knowing there is a phantom listener present on their line .
Toward the end of my hour - long first conversation with him , I asked the Captain if he ever tapped phones .
“ Oh no .
I do n’t do that .
I do n’t think it ’s right , ” he told me firmly .
“ I have the power to do it but I do n’t …
Well one time , just one time , I have to admit that I did .
There was this girl , Linda , and I wanted to find out … you know .
I tried to call her up for a date .
I had a date with her the last weekend and I thought she liked me .
I called her up , man , and her line was busy , and I kept calling and it was still busy .
Well , I had just learned about this system of jumping into lines and I said to myself , ‘ Hmmm .
Why not just see if it works .
It ’ll surprise her if all of a sudden I should pop up on her line .
It ’ll impress her , if anything . ’
So I went ahead and did it .
I M- Fed into the line .
My M -F-er is powerful enough when patched directly into the mouthpiece to trigger a verification trunk without using an operator the way the other phone phreaks have to .
“ I slipped into the line and there she was talking to another boyfriend .
Making sweet talk to him .
I did n’t make a sound because I was so disgusted .
So I waited there for her to hang up , listening to her making sweet talk to the other guy .
You know .
So as soon as she hung up I instantly M - F - ed her up and all I said was , ‘ Linda , we ’re through . ’
And I hung up .
And it blew her head off .
She could n’t figure out what the hell happened .
“ But that was the only time .
I did it thinking I would surprise her , impress her .
Those were all my intentions were , and well , it really kind of hurt me pretty badly , and … and ever since then I do n’t go into verification trunks . ”
Moments later my first conversation with the Captain comes to a close .
“ Listen , ” he says , his spirits somewhat cheered , “ listen .
What you are going to hear when I hang up is the sound of tandems unstacking .
Layer after layer of tandems unstacking until there ’s nothing left of the stack , until it melts away into nothing .
Cheep , cheep , cheep , cheep , ” he concludes , his voice descending to a whisper with each cheep .
He hangs up .
The phone suddenly goes into four spasms : kachink cheep .
Kachink cheep kachink cheep kachink cheep , and the complex connection has wiped itself out like the Cheshire cat ’s smile .
The MF Boogie Blues
The next number I choose from the select list of phone - phreak alumni , prepared for me by the blue - box inventor , is a Memphis number .
It is the number of Joe Engressia , the first and still perhaps the most accomplished blind phone phreak .
Three years ago Engressia was a nine - day wonder in newspapers and magazines all over America because he had been discovered whistling free long - distance connections for fellow students at the University of South Florida .
Engressia was born with perfect pitch : he could whistle phone tones better than the phone - company ’s equipment .
Engressia might have gone on whistling in the dark for a few friends for the rest of his life if the phone company had n’t decided to expose him .
He was warned , disciplined by the college , and the whole case became public .
In the months following media reports of his talent , Engressia began receiving strange calls .
There were calls from a group of kids in Los Angeles who could do some very strange things with the quirky General Telephone and Electronics circuitry in L.A. suburbs .
There were calls from a group of mostly blind kids in —-, California , who had been doing some interesting experiments with Cap ’n Crunch whistles and test loops .
There was a group in Seattle , a group in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a few from New York , a few scattered across the country .
Some of them had already equipped themselves with cassette and electronic M - F devices .
For some of these groups , it was the first time they knew of the others .
The exposure of Engressia was the catalyst that linked the separate phone - phreak centers together .
They all called Engressia .
They talked to him about what he was doing and what they were doing .
And then he told them — the scattered regional centers and lonely independent phone phreakers — about each other , gave them each other ’s numbers to call , and within a year the scattered phone - phreak centers had grown into a nationwide underground .
Joe Engressia is only twenty - two years old now , but along the phone - phreak network he is “ the old man , ” accorded by phone phreaks something of the reverence the phone company bestows on Alexander Graham Bell .
He seldom needs to make calls anymore .
The phone phreaks all call him and let him know what new tricks , new codes , new techniques they have learned .
Every night he sits like a sightless spider in his little apartment receiving messages from every tendril of his web .
It is almost a point of pride with Joe that they call him .
But when I reached him in his Memphis apartment that night , Joe Engressia was lonely , jumpy and upset .
“ God , I ’m glad somebody called .
I do n’t know why tonight of all nights I do n’t get any calls .
This guy around here got drunk again tonight and propositioned me again .
I keep telling him we ’ll never see eye to eye on this subject , if you know what I mean .
I try to make light of it , you know , but he does n’t get it .
I can head him out there getting drunker and I do n’t know what he ’ll do next .
It ’s just that I ’m really all alone here , just moved to Memphis , it ’s the first time I ’m living on my own , and I ’d hate for it to all collapse now .
But I wo n’t go to bed with him .
I ’m just not very interested in sex and even if I ca n’t see him I know he ’s ugly .
“ Did you hear that ?
That ’s him banging a bottle against the wall outside .
He ’s nice .
Well forget about it .
You ’re doing a story on phone phreaks ?
Listen to this .
It ’s the MF Boogie Blues .
Sure enough , a jumpy version of Muskrat Ramble boogies its way over the line , each note one of those long - distance phone tones .
The music stops .
A huge roaring voice blasts the phone off my ear : “ AND THE QUESTION IS … ” roars the voice , “ CAN A BLIND PERSON HOOK UP AN AMPLIFIER ON HIS OWN ? ”
The roar ceases .
A high - pitched operator - type voice replaces it .
“ This is Southern Braille Tel. & Tel .
Have tone , will phone . ”
This is succeeded by a quick series of M - F tones , a swift “ kachink ” and a deep reassuring voice : “ If you need home care , call the visiting - nurses association .
First National time in Honolulu is 4:32 p.m. ”
Joe back in his Joe voice again : “ Are we seeing eye to eye ?
‘ Si , si , ’ said the blind Mexican .
Ahem .
Yes .
Would you like to know the weather in Tokyo ? ”
This swift manic sequence of phone - phreak vaudeville stunts and blind - boy jokes manages to keep Joe ’s mind off his tormentor only as long as it lasts .
“ The reason I ’m in Memphis , the reason I have to depend on that homosexual guy , is that this is the first time I ’ve been able to live on my own and make phone trips on my own .
I ’ve been banned from all central offices around home in Florida , they knew me too well , and at the University some of my fellow scholars were always harassing me because I was on the dorm pay phone all the time and making fun of me because of my fat ass , which of course I do have , it ’s my physical fatness program , but I do n’t like to hear it every day , and if I ca n’t phone trip and I can’t phone phreak , I ca n’t imagine what I ’d do , I ’ve been devoting three quarters of my life to it .
“ I moved to Memphis because I wanted to be on my own as well as because it has a Number 5 crossbar switching system and some interesting little independent phone - company districts nearby and so far they do n’t seem to know who I am so I can go on phone tripping , and for me phone tripping is just as important as phone phreaking . ”
Phone tripping , Joe explains , begins with calling up a central - office switch room .
He tells the switchman in a polite earnest voice that he ’s a blind college student interested in telephones , and could he perhaps have a guided tour of the switching station ?
Each step of the tour Joe likes to touch and feel relays , caress switching circuits , switchboards , crossbar arrangements .
So when Joe Engressia phone phreaks he feels his way through the circuitry of the country garden of forking paths , he feels switches shift , relays shunt , crossbars swivel , tandems engage and disengage even as he hears — with perfect pitch — his M- F pulses make the entire Bell system dance to his tune .
Just one month ago Joe took all his savings out of his bank and left home , over the emotional protests of his mother .
“ I ran away from home almost , ” he likes to say .
Joe found a small apartment house on Union Avenue and began making phone trips .
He ’d take a bus a hundred miles south in Mississippi to see some old - fashioned Bell equipment still in use in several states , which had been puzzling .
He ’d take a bus three hundred miles to Charlotte , North Carolina , to look at some brand - new experimental equipment .
He hired a taxi to drive him twelve miles to a suburb to tour the office of a small phone company with some interesting idiosyncrasies in its routing system .
He was having the time of his life , he said , the most freedom and pleasure he had known .
In that month he had done very little long - distance phone phreaking from his own phone .
He had begun to apply for a job with the phone company , he told me , and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal .
“ Any kind of job will do , anything as menial as the most lowly operator .
That ’s probably all they ’d give me because I ’m blind .
Even though I probably know more than most switchmen .
But that ’s okay .
I want to work for Ma Bell .
I do n’t hate Ma Bell the way Gilbertson and some phone phreaks do .
I do n’t want to screw Ma Bell .
With me it ’s the pleasure of pure knowledge .
There ’s something beautiful about the system when you know it intimately the way I do .
But I do n’t know how much they know about me here .
I have a very intuitive feel for the condition of the line I ’m on , and I think they ’re monitoring me off and on lately , but I have n’t been doing much illegal .
I have to make a few calls to switchmen once in a while which are n’t strictly legal , and once I took an acid trip and was having these auditory hallucinations as if I were trapped and these planes were dive - bombing me , and all of sudden I had to phone phreak out of there .
For some reason I had to call Kansas City , but that ’s all . ”
A Warning Is Delivered
At this point — one o’clock in my time zone — a loud knock on my motel - room door interrupts our conversation .
Outside the door I find a uniformed security guard who informs me that there has been an “ emergency phone call ” for me while I have been on the line and that the front desk has sent him up to let me know .
Two seconds after I say good - bye to Joe and hang up , the phone rings .
“ Who were you talking to ? ” the agitated voice demands .
The voice belongs to Captain Crunch .
“ I called because I decided to warn you of something .
I decided to warn you to be careful .
I do n’t want this information you get to get to the radical underground .
I do n’t want it to get into the wrong hands .
What would you say if I told you it ’s possible for three phone phreaks to saturate the phone system of the nation .
Saturate it .
Busy it out .
All of it .
I know how to do this .
I ’m not gonna tell .
A friend of mine has already saturated the trunks between Seattle and New York .
He did it with a computerized M - F - er hitched into a special Manitoba exchange .
But there are other , easier ways to do it . ”
Just three people ?
I ask .
How is that possible ?
“ Have you ever heard of the long - lines guard frequency ?
Do you know about stacking tandems with 17 and 2600 ?
Well , I ’d advise you to find out about it .
I ’m not gonna tell you .
But whatever you do , do n’t let this get into the hands of the radical underground . ”
( Later Gilbertson , the inventor , confessed that while he had always been skeptical about the Captain ’s claim of the sabotage potential of trunk - tying phone phreaks , he had recently heard certain demonstrations which convinced him the Captain was not speaking idly .
“ I think it might take more than three people , depending on how many machines like Captain Crunch ’s were available .
But even though the Captain sounds a little weird , he generally turns out to know what he ’s talking about . ” )
“ You know , ” Captain Crunch continues in his admonitory tone , “ you know the younger phone phreaks call Moscow all the time .
Suppose everybody were to call Moscow .
I ’m no right - winger .
But I value my life .
I do n’t want the Commies coming over and dropping a bomb on my head .
That ’s why I say you ’ve got to be careful about who gets this information . ”
The Captain suddenly shifts into a diatribe against those phone phreaks who do n’t like the phone company .
“ They do n’t understand , but Ma Bell knows everything they do .
Ma Bell knows .
Listen , is this line hot ?
I just heard someone tap in .
I ’m not paranoid , but I can detect things like that .
Well , even if it is , they know that I know that they know that I have a bulk eraser .
I ’m very clean . ”
The Captain pauses , evidently torn between wanting to prove to the phone - company monitors that he does nothing illegal , and the desire to impress Ma Bell with his prowess .
“ Ma Bell knows how good I am .
And I am quite good .
I can detect reversals , tandem switching , everything that goes on on a line .
I have relative pitch now .
Do you know what that means ?
My ears are a $ 20,000 piece of equipment .
With my ears I can detect things they can’t hear with their equipment .
I ’ve had employment problems .
I ’ve lost jobs .
But I want to show Ma Bell how good I am .
I do n’t want to screw her , I want to work for her .
I want to do good for her .
I want to help her get rid of her flaws and become perfect .
That ’s my number - one goal in life now . ”
The Captain concludes his warnings and tells me he has to be going .
“ I ’ve got a little action lined up for tonight , ” he explains and hangs up .
Before I hang up for the night , I call Joe Engressia back .
He reports that his tormentor has finally gone to sleep —
“ He ’s not blind drunk , that ’s the way I get , ahem , yes ; but you might say he ’s in a drunken stupor . ”
I make a date to visit Joe in Memphis in two days .
A Phone Phreak Call Takes Care of Business
The next morning I attend a gathering of four phone phreaks in — – ( a California suburb ) .
The gathering takes place in a comfortable split - level home in an upper - middle - class subdivision .
Heaped on the kitchen table are the portable cassette recorders , M- F cassettes , phone patches , and line ties of the four phone phreaks present .
On the kitchen counter next to the telephone is a shoe - box - size blue box with thirteen large toggle switches for the tones .
The parents of the host phone phreak , Ralph , who is blind , stay in the living room with their sighted children .
They are not sure exactly what Ralph and his friends do with the phone or if it ’s strictly legal , but he is blind and they are pleased he has a hobby which keeps him busy .
The group has been working at reestablishing the historic “ 2111 ” conference , reopening some toll - free loops , and trying to discover the dimensions of what seem to be new initiatives against phone phreaks by phone - company security agents .
It is not long before I get a chance to see , to hear , Randy at work .
Randy is known among the phone phreaks as perhaps the finest con man in the game .
Randy is blind .
He is pale , soft and pear - shaped , he wears baggy pants and a wrinkly nylon white sport shirt , pushes his head forward from hunched shoulders somewhat like a turtle inching out of its shell .
His eyes wander , crossing and recrossing , and his forehead is somewhat pimply .
He is only sixteen years old .
But when Randy starts speaking into a telephone mouthpiece his voice becomes so stunningly authoritative it is necessary to look again to convince yourself it comes from a chubby adolescent Randy .
Imagine the voice of a crack oil - rig foreman , a tough , sharp , weather - beaten Marlboro man of forty .
Imagine the voice of a brilliant performance - fund gunslinger explaining how he beats the Dow Jones by thirty percent .
Then imagine a voice that could make those two He is speaking to a switchman in Detroit .
The phone company in Detroit had closed up two toll - free loop pairs for no apparent reason , although heavy use by phone phreaks all over the country may have been detected .
Randy is telling the switchman how to open up the loop and make it free again :
“ How are you , buddy .
Yeah .
I ’m on the board in here in Tulsa , Oklahoma , and we ’ve been trying to run some tests on your loop - arounds and we find ’em busied out on both sides … .
Yeah , we ’ve been getting a ‘ BY ’ on them , what d’ya say , can you drop cards on ’em ?
Do you have 08 on your number group ?
Oh that ’s okay , we ’ve had this trouble before , we may have to go after the circuit .
Here lemme give ’em to you : your frame is 05 , vertical group 03 , horizontal 5 , vertical file 3 .
Yeah , we ’ll hang on here … .
Okay , found it ?
Good .
Right , yeah , we ’d like to clear that busy out .
Right .
All you have to do is look for your key on the mounting plate , it ’s in your miscellaneous trunk frame .
Okay ?
Right .
Now pull your key from NOR over the LCT .
Yeah .
I do n’t know why that happened , but we ’ve been having trouble with that one .
Okay .
Thanks a lot fella .
Be seein ’ ya . ”
Randy hangs up , reports that the switchman was a little inexperienced with the loop - around circuits on the miscellaneous trunk frame , but that the loop has been returned to its free - call status .
Delighted , phone phreak
Ed returns the pair of numbers to the active - status column in his directory .
Ed is a superb and painstaking researcher .
With almost Talmudic thoroughness he will trace tendrils of hints through soft - wired mazes of intervening phone - company circuitry back through complex linkages of switching relays to find the location and identity of just one toll - free loop .
He spends hours and hours , every day , doing this sort of thing .
He has somehow compiled a directory of eight hundred “ Band - six in - WATS numbers ” located in over forty states .
Band - six in -WATS numbers are the big 800 numbers — the ones that can be dialed into free from anywhere in the country .
Ed the researcher , a nineteen - year - old engineering student , is also a superb technician .
He put together his own working blue box from scratch at age seventeen .
( He is sighted . )
This evening after distributing the latest issue of his in - WATS directory ( which has been typed into Braille for the blind phone phreaks ) , he announces he has made a major new breakthrough :
“ I finally tested it and it works , perfectly .
I ’ve got this switching matrix which converts any touch - tone phone into an M - F - er . ”
The tones you hear in touch - tone phones are not the M- F tones that operate the long - distance switching system .
Phone phreaks believe A.T.&T. had deliberately equipped touch tones with a different set of frequencies to avoid putting the six master M- F tones in the hands of every touch - tone owner .
Ed ’s complex switching matrix puts the six master tones , in effect put a blue box , in the hands of every touch - tone owner .
Ed shows me pages of schematics , specifications and parts lists .
“ It ’s not easy to build , but everything here is in the Heathkit catalog . ”
Ed asks Ralph what progress he has made in his attempts to reestablish a long - term open conference line for phone phreaks .
The last big conference — the historic “ 2111 ” conference — had been arranged through an unused Telex test - board trunk somewhere in the innards of a 4A switching machine in Vancouver , Canada .
For months phone phreaks could M- F their way into Vancouver , beep out 604 ( the Vancouver area code ) and then beep out 2111 ( the internal phone - company code for Telex testing ) , and find themselves at any time , day or night , on an open wire talking with an array of phone phreaks from coast to coast , operators from Bermuda , Tokyo and London who are phone - phreak sympathizers , and miscellaneous guests and technical experts .
The conference was a massive exchange of information .
Phone phreaks picked each other ’s brains clean , then developed new ways to pick the phone company ’s brains clean .
Ralph gave M F Boogies concerts with his home - entertainment - type electric organ , Captain Crunch demonstrated his round - the - world prowess with his notorious computerized unit and dropped leering hints of the “ action ” he was getting with his girl friends .
( The Captain lives out or pretends to live out several kinds of fantasies to the gossipy delight of the blind phone phreaks who urge him on to further triumphs on behalf of all of them . )
The somewhat rowdy Northwest phone - phreak crowd let their bitter internal feud spill over into the peaceable conference line , escalating shortly into guerrilla warfare ; Carl the East Coast international tone relations expert demonstrated newly opened direct M- F routes to central offices on the island of Bahrein in the Persian Gulf , introduced a new phone - phreak friend of his in Pretoria , and explained the technical operation of the new Oakland - to Vietnam linkages .
( Many phone phreaks pick up spending money by M - F-ing calls from relatives to Vietnam G.I. ’s , charging $ 5 for a whole hour of trans - Pacific conversation . )
Day and night the conference line was never dead .
Blind phone phreaks all over the country , lonely and isolated in homes filled with active sighted brothers and sisters , or trapped with slow and unimaginative blind kids in straitjacket schools for the blind , knew that no matter how late it got they could dial up the conference and find instant electronic communion with two or three other blind kids awake over on the other side of America .
Talking together on a phone hookup , the blind phone phreaks say , is not much different from being there together .
Physically , there was nothing more than a two - inch - square wafer of titanium inside a vast machine on Vancouver Island .
For the blind kids there meant an exhilarating feeling of being in touch , through a kind of skill and magic which was peculiarly their own .
Last April 1 , however , the long Vancouver Conference was shut off .
The phone phreaks knew it was coming .
Vancouver was in the process of converting from a step - by - step system to a 4A machine and the 2111 Telex circuit was to be wiped out in the process .
The phone phreaks learned the actual day on which the conference would be erased about a week ahead of time over the phone company ’s internal - news - and - shop - talk recording .
For the next frantic seven days every phone phreak in America was on and off the 2111 conference twenty - four hours a day .
Phone phreaks who were just learning the game or did n’t have M- F capability were boosted up to the conference by more experienced phreaks so they could get a glimpse of what it was like before it disappeared .
Top phone phreaks searched distant area codes for new conference possibilities without success .
Finally in the early morning of April 1 , the end came .
“ I could feel it coming a couple hours before midnight , ” Ralph remembers .
“ You could feel something going on in the lines .
Some static began showing up , then some whistling wheezing sound .
Then there were breaks .
Some people got cut off and called right back in , but after a while some people were finding they were cut off and could n’t get back in at all .
It was terrible .
I lost it about one a.m. , but managed to slip in again and stay on until the thing died …
I think it was about four in the morning .
There were four of us still hanging on when the conference disappeared into nowhere for good .
We all tried to M - F up to it again of course , but we got silent termination .
There was nothing there . ”
The Legendary Mark Bernay Turns Out To Be “ The Midnight Skulker ”
Mark Bernay .
I had come across that name before .
It was on Gilbertson ’s select list of phone phreaks .
The California phone phreaks had spoken of a mysterious Mark Bernay as perhaps the first and oldest phone phreak on the West Coast .
And in fact almost every phone phreak in the West can trace his origins either directly to Mark Bernay or to a disciple of Mark Bernay .
It seems that five years ago this Mark Bernay ( a pseudonym he chose for himself ) began traveling up and down the West Coast pasting tiny stickers in phone books all along his way .
The stickers read something like “ Want to hear an interesting tape recording ?
Call these numbers . ”
The numbers that followed were toll - free loop - around pairs .
When one of the curious called one of the numbers he would hear a tape recording pre-hooked into the loop by Bernay which explained the use of loop - around pairs , gave the numbers of several more , and ended by telling the caller , “ At six o’clock tonight this recording will stop and you and your friends can try it out .
Have fun . ”
“ I was disappointed by the response at first , ” Bernay told me , when I finally reached him at one of his many numbers and he had dispensed with the usual “ I never do anything illegal ” formalities which experienced phone phreaks open most conversations .
“ I went all over the coast with these stickers not only on pay phones , but I ’d throw them in front of high schools in the middle of the night , I ’d leave them unobtrusively in candy stores , scatter them on main streets of small towns .
At first hardly anyone bothered to try it out .
I would listen in for hours and hours after six o’clock and no one came on .
I could n’t figure out why people would n’t be interested .
Finally these two girls in Oregon tried it out and told all their friends and suddenly it began to spread . ”
Before his Johny Appleseed trip Bernay had already gathered a sizable group of early pre-blue - box phone phreaks together on loop - arounds in Los Angeles .
Bernay does not claim credit for the original discovery of the loop - around numbers .
He attributes the discovery to an eighteen - year - old reform school kid in Long Beach whose name he forgets and who , he says , “ just disappeared one day . ”
When Bernay himself discovered loop - arounds independently , from clues in his readings in old issues of the Automatic Electric Technical Journal , he found dozens of the reform - school kid ’s friends already using them .
However , it was one of Bernay ’s disciples in Seattle that introduced phone phreaking to blind kids .
The Seattle kid who learned about loops through Bernay ’s recording told a blind friend , the blind kid taught the secret to his friends at a winter camp for blind kids in Los Angeles .
When the camp session was over these kids took the secret back to towns all over the West .
This is how the original blind kids became phone phreaks .
For them , for most phone phreaks in general , it was the discovery of the possibilities of loop - arounds which led them on to far more serious and sophisticated phone - phreak methods , and which gave them a medium for sharing their discoveries .
A year later a blind kid who moved back east brought the technique to a blind kids ’ summer camp in Vermont , which spread it along the East Coast .
All from a Mark Bernay sticker .
Bernay , who is nearly thirty years old now , got his start when he was fifteen and his family moved into an L.A. suburb serviced by General Telephone and Electronics equipment .
He became fascinated with the differences between Bell and G.T.&E. equipment .
He learned he could make interesting things happen by carefully timed clicks with the disengage button .
He learned to interpret subtle differences in the array of clicks , whirrs and kachinks he could hear on his lines .
He learned he could shift himself around the switching relays of the L.A. area code in a not - too - predictable fashion by interspersing his own hook - switch clicks with the clicks within the line .
( Independent phone companies — there are nineteen hundred of them still left , most of them tiny island principalities in Ma Bell ’s vast empire — have always been favorites with phone phreaks , first as learning tools , then as Archimedes platforms from which to manipulate the huge Bell system .
A phone phreak in Bell territory will often M- F himself into an independent ’s switching system , with switching idiosyncrasies which can give him marvelous leverage over the Bell System .
“ I have a real affection for Automatic Electric Equipment , ” Bernay told me .
“ There are a lot of things you can play with .
Things break down in interesting ways . ”
Shortly after Bernay graduated from college ( with a double major in chemistry and philosophy ) , he graduated from phreaking around with G.T.&E. to the Bell System itself , and made his legendary sticker - pasting journey north along the coast , settling finally in Northwest Pacific Bell territory .
He discovered that if Bell does not break down as interestingly as G.T.&E. , it nevertheless offers a lot of “ things to play with . ”
Bernay learned to play with blue boxes .
He established his own personal switchboard and phone - phreak research laboratory complex .
He continued his phone - phreak evangelism with ongoing sticker campaigns .
He set up two recording numbers , one with instructions for beginning phone phreaks , the other with latest news and technical developments ( along with some advanced instruction ) gathered from sources all over the country .
These days , Bernay told me , he had gone beyond phone - phreaking itself .
“ Lately I ’ve been enjoying playing with computers more than playing with phones .
My personal thing in computers is just like with phones , I guess — the kick is in finding out how to beat the system , how to get at things I ’m not supposed to know about , how to do things with the system that I ’m not supposed to be able to do . ”
As a matter of fact , Bernay told me , he had just been fired from his computer - programming job for doing things he was not supposed to be able to do .
he had been working with a huge time - sharing computer owned by a large corporation but shared by many others .
Access to the computer was limited to those programmers and corporations that had been assigned certain passwords .
And each password restricted its user to access to only the one section of the computer cordoned off from its own information storager .
The password system prevented companies and individuals from stealing each other ’s information .
“ I figured out how to write a program that would let me read everyone else ’s password , ” Bernay reports .
“ I began playing around with passwords .
I began letting the people who used the computer know , in subtle ways , that I knew their passwords .
I began dropping notes to the computer supervisors with hints that I knew what I know .
I signed them ‘ The Midnight Skulker . ’
I kept getting cleverer and cleverer with my messages and devising ways of showing them what I could do .
I ’m sure they could n’t imagine I could do the things I was showing them .
But they never responded to me .
Every once in a while they ’d change the passwords , but I found out how to discover what the new ones were , and I let them know .
But they never responded directly to the Midnight Skulker .
I even finally designed a program which they could use to prevent my program from finding out what it did .
In effect I told them how to wipe me out , The Midnight Skulker .
It was a very clever program .
I started leaving clues about myself .
I wanted them to try and use it and then try to come up with something to get around that and reappear again .
But they would n’t play .
I wanted to get caught .
I mean I did n’t want to get caught personally , but I wanted them to notice me and admit that they noticed me .
I wanted them to attempt to respond , maybe in some interesting way . ”
Finally the computer managers became concerned enough about the threat of information - stealing to respond .
However , instead of using The Midnight Skulker ’s own elegant self - destruct program , they called in their security personnel , interrogated everyone , found an informer to identify Bernay as The Midnight Skulker , and fired him .
“ At first the security people advised the company to hire me full - time to search out other flaws and discover other computer freaks .
I might have liked that .
But I probably would have turned into a double double agent rather than the double agent they wanted .
I might have resurrected The Midnight Skulker and tried to catch myself .
Who knows ?
Anyway , the higher - ups turned the whole idea down . ”
You Can Tap the F.B.I. ’s Crime Control Computer in the Comfort of Your Own Home , Perhaps
Computer freaking may be the wave of the future .
It suits the phone - phreak sensibility perfectly .
Gilbertson , the blue - box inventor and a lifelong phone phreak , has also gone on from phone - phreaking to computer - freaking .
Before he got into the blue - box business Gilbertson , who is a highly skilled programmer , devised programs for international currency arbitrage .
But he began playing with computers in earnest when he learned he could use his blue box in tandem with the computer terminal installed in his apartment by the instrumentation firm he worked for .
The print - out terminal and keyboard was equipped with acoustical coupling , so that by coupling his little ivory Princess phone to the terminal and then coupling his blue box on that , he could M - F his way into other computers with complete anonymity , and without charge ; program and re-program them at will ; feed them false or misleading information ; tap and steal from them .
He explained to me that he taps computers by busying out all the lines , then going into a verification trunk , listening into the passwords and instructions one of the time sharers uses , and them M - F-ing in and imitating them .
He believes it would not be impossible to creep into the F.B.I ’s crime control computer through a local police computer terminal and phreak around with the F.B.I. ’s memory banks .
He claims he has succeeded in re-programming a certain huge institutional computer in such a way that it has cordoned off an entire section of its circuitry for his personal use , and at the same time conceals that arrangement from anyone else ’s notice .
I have been unable to verify this claim .
Like Captain Crunch , like Alexander Graham Bell ( pseudonym of a disgruntled - looking East Coast engineer who claims to have invented the black box and now sells black and blue boxes to gamblers and radical heavies ) , like most phone phreaks , Gilbertson began his career trying to rip off pay phones as a teenager .
Figure them out , then rip them off .
Getting his dime back from the pay phone is the phone phreak ’s first thrilling rite of passage .
After learning the usual eighteen different ways of getting his dime back , Gilbertson learned how to make master keys to coin - phone cash boxes , and get everyone else ’s dimes back .
He stole some phone - company equipment and put together his own home switchboard with it .
He learned to make a simple “ bread - box ” device , of the kind used by bookies in the Thirties ( bookie gives a number to his betting clients ; the phone with that number is installed in some widow lady ’s apartment , but is rigged to ring in the bookie ’s shop across town , cops trace big betting number and find nothing but the widow ) .
Not long after that afternoon in 1968 when , deep in the stacks of an engineering library , he came across a technical journal with the phone tone frequencies and rushed off to make his first blue box , not long after that Gilbertson abandoned a very promising career in physical chemistry and began selling blue boxes for $ 1,500 apiece .
“ I had to leave physical chemistry .
I just ran out of interesting things to learn , ” he told me one evening .
We had been talking in the apartment of the man who served as the link between Gilbertson and the syndicate in arranging the big $ 300,000 blue - box deal which fell through because of legal trouble .
There has been some smoking .
“ No more interesting things to learn , ” he continues .
“ Physical chemistry turns out to be a sick subject when you take it to its highest level .
I do n’t know .
I do n’t think I could explain to you how it ’s sick .
You have to be there .
But you get , I do n’t know , a false feeling of omnipotence .
I suppose it ’s like phone - phreaking that way .
This huge thing is there .
This whole system .
And there are holes in it and you slip into them like Alice and you ’re pretending you ’re doing something you ’re actually not , or at least it ’s no longer you that ’s doing what you thought you were doing .
It ’s all Lewis Carroll .
Physical chemistry and phone - phreaking .
That ’s why you have these phone - phreak pseudonyms like The Cheshire Cat , the Red King , and The Snark .
But there ’s something about phone - phreaking that you do n’t find in physical chemistry . ”
He looks up at me :
“ Did you ever steal anything ? ”
“ Then you know !
You know the rush you get .
It ’s not just knowledge , like physical chemistry .
It ’s forbidden knowledge .
You know .
You can learn about anything under the sun and be bored to death with it .
But the idea that it ’s illegal .
Look : you can be small and mobile and smart and you ’re ripping off somebody large and powerful and very dangerous .
People like Gilbertson and Alexander Graham Bell are always talking about ripping off the phone company and screwing Ma Bell .
But if they were shown a single button and told that by pushing it they could turn the entire circuitry of A.T.&T. into molten puddles , they probably would n’t push it .
The disgruntled - inventor phone phreak needs the phone system the way the lapsed Catholic needs the Church , the way Satan needs a God , the way The Midnight Skulker needed , more than anything else , response .
Later that evening Gilbertson finished telling me how delighted he was at the flood of blue boxes spreading throughout the country , how delighted he was to know that “ this time they ’re really screwed . ”
He suddenly shifted gears .
“ Of course .
I do have this love / hate thing about Ma Bell .
In a way I almost like the phone company .
I guess I ’d be very sad if they were to disintegrate .
In a way it ’s just that after having been so good they turn out to have these things wrong with them .
It ’s those flaws that allow me to get in and mess with them , but I do n’t know .
There ’s something about it that gets to you and makes you want to get to it , you know . ”
I ask him what happens when he runs out of interesting , forbidden things to learn about the phone system .
“ I do n’t know , maybe I ’d go to work for them for a while . ”
“ In security even ? ”
“ I ’d do it , sure .
I just as soon play — I ’d just as soon work on either side . ”
“ Even figuring out how to trap phone phreaks ?
I said , recalling Mark Bernay ’s game . ”
“ Yes , that might be interesting .
Yes , I could figure out how to outwit the phone phreaks .
Of course if I got too good at it , it might become boring again .
Then I ’d have to hope the phone phreaks got much better and outsmarted me for a while .
That would move the quality of the game up one level .
I might even have to help them out , you know , ‘ Well , kids , I would n’t want this to get around but did you ever think of — ? ’
I could keep it going at higher and higher levels forever . ”
The dealer speaks up for the first time .
He has been staring at the soft blinking patterns of light and colors on the translucent tiled wall facing him .
( Actually there are no patterns : the color and illumination of every tile is determined by a computerized random - number generator designed by Gilbertson which insures that there can be no meaning to any sequence of events in the tiles . )
“ Those are nice games you ’re talking about , ” says the dealer to his friend .
“ But I would n’t mind seeing them screwed .
A telephone is n’t private anymore .
You ca n’t say anything you really want to say on a telephone or you have to go through that paranoid bullshit .
‘ Is it cool to talk on the phone ? ’
I mean , even if it is cool , if you have to ask ‘ Is it cool , ’ then it is n’t cool .
You know .
‘ Is it cool , ’ then it is n’t cool .
You know .
Like those blind kids , people are going to start putting together their own private telephone companies if they want to really talk .
And you know what else .
You do n’t hear silences on the phone anymore .
They ’ve got this time - sharing thing on long - distance lines where you make a pause and they snip out that piece of time and use it to carry part of somebody else ’s conversation .
Instead of a pause , where somebody ’s maybe breathing or sighing , you get this blank hole and you only start hearing again when someone says a word and even the beginning of the word is clipped off .
Silences do n’t count — you ’re paying for them , but they take them away from you .
It ’s not cool to talk and you ca n’t hear someone when they do n’t talk .
What the hell good is the phone ?
I would n’t mind seeing them totally screwed . ”
The Big Memphis Bust
Joe Engressia never wanted to screw Ma Bell .
His dream had always been to work for her .
The day I visited Joe in his small apartment on Union Avenue in Memphis , he was upset about another setback in his application for a telephone job .
“ They ’re stalling on it .
I got a letter today telling me they ’d have to postpone the interview I requested again .
My landlord read it for me .
They gave me some runaround about wanting papers on my rehabilitation status but I think there ’s something else going on . ”
When I switched on the 40 - watt bulb in Joe ’s room — he sometimes forgets when he has guests — it looked as if there was enough telephone hardware to start a small phone company of his own .
There is one phone on top of his desk , one phone sitting in an open drawer beneath the desk top .
Next to the desk - top phone is a cigar - box - size M- F device with big toggle switches , and next to that is some kind of switching and coupling device with jacks and alligator plugs hanging loose .
Next to that is a Braille typewriter .
On the floor next to the desk , lying upside down like a dead tortoise , is the half - gutted body of an old black standard phone .
Across the room on a torn and dusty couch are two more phones , one of them a touch - tone model ; two tape recorders ; a heap of phone patches and cassettes , and a life - size toy telephone .
Our conversation is interrupted every ten minutes by phone phreaks from all over the country ringing Joe on just about every piece of equipment but the toy phone and the Braille typewriter .
One fourteen - year - old blind kid from Connecticut calls up and tells Joe he ’s got a girl friend .
He wants to talk to Joe about girl friends .
Joe says they ’ll talk later in the evening when they can be alone on the line .
Joe draws a deep breath , whistles him off the air with an earsplitting 2600 - cycle whistle .
Joe is pleased to get the calls but he looked worried and preoccupied that evening , his brow constantly furrowed over his dark wandering eyes .
In addition to the phone - company stall , he has just learned that his apartment house is due to be demolished in sixty days for urban renewal .
For all its shabbiness , the Union Avenue apartment house has been Joe ’s first home - of - his - own and he ’s worried that he may not find another before this one is demolished .
But what really bothers
Joe is that switchmen have n’t been listening to him .
“ I ’ve been doing some checking on 800 numbers lately , and I ’ve discovered that certain 800 numbers in New Hampshire could n’t be reached from Missouri and Kansas .
Now it may sound like a small thing , but I do n’t like to see sloppy work ; it makes me feel bad about the lines .
So I ’ve been calling up switching offices and reporting it , but they have n’t corrected it .
I called them up for the third time today and instead of checking they just got mad .
Well , that gets me mad .
I mean , I do try to help them .
There ’s something about them I can’t understand — you want to help them and they just try to say you ’re defrauding them . ”
It is Sunday evening and Joe invites me to join him for dinner at a Holiday Inn .
Frequently on Sunday evening Joe takes some of his welfare money , calls a cab , and treats himself to a steak dinner at one of Memphis ’ thirteen Holiday Inns .
( Memphis is the headquarters of Holiday Inn. Holiday Inns have been a favorite for Joe ever since he made his first solo phone trip to a Bell switching office in Jacksonville , Florida , and stayed in the Holiday Inn there .
He likes to stay at Holiday Inns , he explains , because they represent freedom to him and because the rooms are arranged the same all over the country so he knows that any Holiday Inn room is familiar territory to him .
Just like any telephone . )
Over steaks in the Pinnacle Restaurant of the Holiday Inn Medical Center on Madison Avenue in Memphis , Joe tells me the highlights of his life as a phone phreak .
At age seven , Joe learned his first phone trick .
A mean baby - sitter , tired of listening to little Joe play with the phone as he always did , constantly , put a lock on the phone dial .
“ I got so mad .
When there ’s a phone sitting there and I ca n’t use it … so I started getting mad and banging the receiver up and down .
I noticed I banged it once and it dialed one .
Well , then I tried banging it twice …. ”
In a few minutes Joe learned how to dial by pressing the hook switch at the right time .
“ I was so excited I remember going ‘ whoo whoo ’ and beat a box down on the floor . ”
At age eight Joe learned about whistling .
“ I was listening to some intercept non working - number recording in L.A. - I was calling L.A. as far back as that , but I ’d mainly dial non working numbers because there was no charge , and I ’d listen to these recordings all day .
Well , I was whistling ’ cause listening to these recordings can be boring after a while even if they are from L.A. , and all of a sudden , in the middle of whistling , the recording clicked off .
I fiddled around whistling some more , and the same thing happened .
So I called up the switch room and said , ‘ I ’m Joe .
I ’m eight years old and I want to know why when I whistle this tune the line clicks off . ’
He tried to explain it to me , but it was a little too technical at the time .
I went on learning .
That was a thing nobody was going to stop me from doing .
The phones were my life , and I was going to pay any price to keep on learning .
I knew I could go to jail .
But I had to do what I had to do to keep on learning . ”
The phone is ringing when we walk back into Joe ’s apartment on Union Avenue .
It is Captain Crunch .
The Captain has been following me around by phone , calling up everywhere I go with additional bits of advice and explanation for me and whatever phone phreak I happen to be visiting .
This time the Captain reports he is calling from what he describes as “ my hideaway high up in the Sierra Nevada . ”
He pulses out lusty salvos of M-F and tells Joe he is about to “ go out and get a little action tonight .
Do some phreaking of another kind , if you know what I mean . ”
Joe chuckles .
The Captain then tells me to make sure I understand that what he told me about tying up the nation ’s phone lines was true , but that he and the phone phreaks he knew never used the technique for sabotage .
They only learned the technique to help the phone company .
“ We do a lot of troubleshooting for them .
Like this New Hampshire / Missouri WATS - line flaw I ’ve been screaming about .
We help them more than they know . ”
After we say good - bye to the Captain and Joe whistles him off the line , Joe tells me about a disturbing dream he had the night before : “ I had been caught and they were taking me to a prison .
It was a long trip .
They were taking me to a prison a long long way away .
And we stopped at a Holiday Inn and it was my last night ever using the phone and I was crying and crying , and the lady at the Holiday Inn said , ‘ Gosh , honey , you should never be sad at a Holiday Inn .
You should always be happy here .
Especially since it ’s your last night . ’
And that just made it worse and I was sobbing so much I could n’t stand it . ”
Two weeks after I left Joe Engressia ’s apartment , phone - company security agents and Memphis police broke into it .
Armed with a warrant , which they left pinned to a wall , they confiscated every piece of equipment in the room , including his toy telephone .
Joe was placed under arrest and taken to the city jail where he was forced to spend the night since he had no money and knew no one in Memphis to call .
It is not clear who told Joe what that night , but someone told him that the phone company had an open - and - shut case against him because of revelations of illegal activity he had made to a phone - company undercover agent .
By morning Joe had become convinced that the reporter from Esquire , with whom he had spoken two weeks ago , was the undercover agent .
He probably had ugly thoughts about someone he could n’t see gaining his confidence , listening to him talk about his personal obsessions and dreams , while planning all the while to lock him up .
“ I really thought he was a reporter , ” Engressia told the Memphis Press - Seminar .
“ I told him everything …. ”
Feeling betrayed , Joe proceeded to confess everything to the press and police .
As it turns out , the phone company did use an undercover agent to trap Joe , although it was not the Esquire reporter .
Ironically , security agents were alerted and began to compile a case against Joe because of one of his acts of love for the system :
Joe had called an internal service department to report that he had located a group of defective long - distance trunks , and to complain again about the New Hampshire / Missouri WATS problem .
Joe always liked Ma Bell ’s lines to be clean and responsive .
A suspicious switchman reported Joe to the security agents who discovered that Joe had never had a long - distance call charged to his name .
Then the security agents learned that Joe was planning one of his phone trips to a local switching office .
The security people planted one of their agents in the switching office .
He posed as a student switchman and followed Joe around on a tour .
He was extremely friendly and helpful to Joe , leading him around the office by the arm .
When the tour was over he offered Joe a ride back to his apartment house .
On the way he asked Joe — one tech man to another — about “ those blue boxers ” he ’d heard about .
Joe talked about them freely , talked about his blue box freely , and about all the other things he could do with the phones .
The next day the phone - company security agents slapped a monitoring tape on Joe ’s line , which eventually picked up an illegal call .
Then they applied for the search warrant and broke in .
In court Joe pleaded not guilty to possession of a blue box and theft of service .
A sympathetic judge reduced the charges to malicious mischief and found him guilty on that count , sentenced him to two thirty - day sentences to be served concurrently and then suspended the sentence on condition that Joe promise never to play with phones again .
Joe promised , but the phone company refused to restore his service .
For two weeks after the trial Joe could not be reached except through the pay phone at his apartment house , and the landlord screened all calls for him .
Phone - phreak Carl managed to get through to Joe after the trial , and reported that Joe sounded crushed by the whole affair .
“ What I ’m worried about , ” Carl told me , “ is that Joe means it this time .
The promise .
That he ’ll never phone - phreak again .
That ’s what he told me , that he ’s given up phone - phreaking for good .
I mean his entire life .
He says he knows they ’re going to be watching him so closely for the rest of his life he ’ll never be able to make a move without going straight to jail .
He sounded very broken up by the whole experience of being in jail .
It was awful to hear him talk that way .
I do n’t know .
I hope maybe he had to sound that way .
Over the phone , you know . ”
Nach den Auseinandersetzungen mit Musik - Tauschbörsen wie Napster oder Grokster geht die Musikindustrie nun auch gegen Musiker vor , die im Internet Notenblätter und Songtexte frei zugänglich anbieten , berichtet die New York Times ( NYT ) .
Vertreter der Music Publishers Association ( MPA ) hatten diesen Schritt bereits im vergangenen Jahr angekündigt , da nach ihrer Ansicht auch die Verbreitung von Noten - Vorlagen und Gitarren - Tabs illegal ist .
Gitarren - Tabs erlauben es , Musik auch ohne Kenntnis von Noten zu spielen .
Anders als bei den Verfahren gegen die Filesharing - Dienste geht es hier um Websites oder Newsgroups wie " alt.guitar.tab " , in denen Hobby - Musiker abgeschriebene oder aus Notenbüchern kopierte Notenblätter oder Gitarren - Tabs tauschen .
Nach Ansicht von Lauren Keiser , Vorsitzender der MPA , verletzen selbst diese teilweise falsch nachgeschriebenen Notenblätter die Rechte der Songschreiber , weshalb die MPA und ihr nationaler Ableger NMPA einige Websites bereits abschalten ließ oder deren Betreiber unter Androhung rechtlicher Schritte aufforderte , die Notenvorlagen und Gitarren - Tabs von den Seiten zu entfernen .
Die meisten Betroffenen reagierten mit Unverständnis , schließlich würden die Seiten meist privat betrieben und Texte oder Tabs nicht kommerziell vertrieben .
Die MPA macht indes geltend , dass die Verkäufe von Notenblättern populärer Musikstücke seit Anfang der 90er - Jahre von rund 25.000 Stück pro Song auf lediglich 5.000 gesunken seien .
Die Maßnahmen von MPA und Verlegern seien " reine Raffgier " , zitiert die NYT Mike Happoldt , ehemaliges Mitglied der Ska - Punk - Band Sublime und Besitzer des Plattenlabels Skunk Records .
Zwar verliere auch er mit solchen Angeboten Geld , doch als Musiker betrachtet er sie mehr als Service .
Websites wie Ultimate - Guitar.com sind von diesen Maßnahmen bislang verschont geblieben , da sich deren Firmensitz im Ausland befindet .
Zahlreiche Nutzer der nun geschlossenen Angebote sollen bereits auf ausländische Dienste ausgewichen sein .

If you asked most MySpace - haters what 's their problem with the service , they 'd probably say : it 's ugly .
Meanwhile , people tell us they are switching from Twitter to Pownce because it 's prettier and easier to use .
For those who prize beauty above all else , we brought together 10 of the prettiest social networks .
Virb - generally known as the designer 's MySpace , Virb lives up to the hype by offering sleek and easy - to - customize profile design .
The details on various features , for example music and video player , are quite polished - even the ads look nice .
If blinking images , huge sigs that mess up the formatting and colorful backgrounds make you insane , Virb is the right place for you .
Trig -
Trig is a sweet sight for the sore eyes of a web designer / hipster who spent too many days wailing about horrid MySpace profiles .
It 's quite similar to Virb but in our opinion looks even nicer , with black and 20 shades of gray being the dominant colors .
Trig is mostly music - oriented , so if you have a band that 's simply too artsy to have a MySpace profile , you know what to do .
Purevolume - neat and tidy are the words that first come to mind when you first look at Purevolume .
The site is purely music - oriented and the profiles are divided between artists and listeners .
The actual profiles , while beautiful , have the problem of looking all pretty much the same ; we like the black / white / gray look , but more customization options would n't hurt .
my.9rules - 9rules is a blogging community which always put a lot of emphasis on quality design , so it 's no wonder that their social network , my.9rules , looks very neat , too .
Just like on Purevolume , though , the profiles on 9rules are visually very similar , which keeps the look of the site consistent but it also makes the whole experience slightly dull .
Pownce - Pownce has been categorized as everything : from web - based IM to a forum , so we guess that simply calling it a social network is n't that far off .
Taking the Twitter recipe and perfecting it , Pownce added some of its own flavor to the mix , and one of the features we really like about it are skins .
Do n't get us wrong , Pownce looks nice to begin with , but having the option to change the skins is a big plus .
Currently , the only beef we have with this feature is the fact that the available amount of skins is so small : only four .
Give us more !
Flickr - yes , we like the Flickr look .
It probably has to do with the fact that the site is full of beautiful photos , but Flickr 's easy - on - the - eyes aesthetics are carefully thought out and make the site really enjoyable to use .
Threadless - one of the first really successful sites that harness the power of community for commercial purposes , Threadless enables users to submit their own T - Shirt designs ; the community votes for the very best , which then become a part of Threadless ' official catalog .
The designs are really great , and Threadless has been the favorite place to buy t- shirts for many a design student for quite some time .
The site itself has a laid - back design that might not appeal to everyone , but you have to give it credit for originality .
Shelfari - Shelfari is a community of book lovers which you can browse by user , by interest groups or by books themselves .
It 's all packed in a neat visual package which might not stand out with extraordinary design , but it will make it really easy to find your way around the site .
The inclusion of actual front pages of individual books is a nice touch , too .
Beautiful Society - ok , this one was a no - brainer .
With a name like that , one would expect beautiful design and Beautiful Society delivers .
The site revolves around the concept of " favorite things " - users get to pick things they like , which become separate entities that get more votes and rise the rank of popularity as more and more users add them to the list .
All this is wrapped in a nice orange / blue design with a lot of rounded corners and nothing to upset our sensitive eyes .
Humble Voice - we 've saved the best for last .
HumbleVoice is yet another community for designers , artists and musicians , and it looks gorgeous .
Page real estate is used generously , with most images on the site being really large , and all of the content is wrapped up in neat little boxes .
As sometimes happens with art - related sites , some of the fonts are too tiny to read if you do n't have 20 / 20 vision , but we 're ready to forgive Humble Space this small blunder .
After all , it 's artists we 're talking about here .
What ?
You want us pundits to stop complaining about what a mess the Bush administration has made in Iraq , and say something constructive for a change ?
But sniping is so easy !
Did you know that a leaked draft report by the Government Accountability Office concludes that the Iraqi government has met only three of the 18 political and military benchmarks mandated by Congress ?
All right , all right -- I ’ll stop .
OK , what exactly should we do in Iraq ?

We keep doing what we ’re already doing -- the White House approach .
Theme song : “ Give War a Chance . ”
This is not a viable option .
Albert Einstein defined insanity as “ doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . ”
But you do n’t have to be an Einstein to see that the White House approach has n’t worked , is n’t working and wo n’t work .
Even if we wanted to maintain our current troop levels and strategy , we can ’t .
Troops do n’t grow on trees , and neither do “ up - armored ” Humvees or Bradley fighting vehicles .
As Marine Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , reportedly plans to warn Bush , we risk degrading U.S. military readiness and jeopardizing our own national security interests if we do n’t substantially decrease troop levels in Iraq .
Option Two :
We do something different .
Instead of calling up the last few idle reservists -- the middle - school boys and girls in Junior ROTC , maybe -- we withdraw troops .
( Go ahead , call it “ redeployment ” if it makes you feel better ) .

Want nitty - gritty details on who / what / where / when / how ?
For those who like to dig their teeth into think tank reports , I recommend “ How to Redeploy : Implementing a Responsible Drawdown of U.S. Forces from Iraq . ”
Released this week by the Center for American Progress , the report ’s lead author is Lawrence Korb , a guy who knows his stuff .
Korb , who served during the Reagan administration as assistant secretary of Defense for manpower , reserve affairs , installations and logistics , recommends redeploying U.S. troops over a period of 10 to 12 months .
That time frame allows for the removal of weaponry and sensitive equipment , without the expense and exposure of more extended drawdown periods -- and it gives local and national Iraqi authorities a reasonable opportunity to prepare for our absence .
As troops rotate out at the end of their tours , they would not be replaced ; remaining troops would be repositioned from more stable peripheral regions of Iraq and consolidated in Baghdad until only a small number of Marines remain to protect civilian personnel at a downsized U.S. Embassy .
Two brigades would also remain for a year in the Kurdish region .
The U.S. would continue to have a strong regional military presence through a carrier battle group and Marine expeditionary force in the Persian Gulf , and through existing U.S. bases in neighboring states .

Fine , you say , Option
Two sounds like it works reasonably well for the U.S. , but what about the Iraqis ?
Are we just going to abandon them to a world of endless conflict ?
Bye , thanks for all the kebabs , and good luck getting that U.S. visa .
The honest ( though not very satisfying ) answer is that no one really knows what will happen in Iraq after the United States leaves .
Interestingly , a poll in March found that a majority of Iraqis thought the security situation would improve immediately after a U.S. withdrawal .
But things could also get worse -- and anyone who claims to have a crystal ball is lying .
We long ago squandered any capacity to guarantee a happy ending for the Iraqis .
But , as several other recent Center for American Progress reports suggest , there are still steps we can take to minimize the chance that a U.S. withdrawal will make things worse for them .
First , accompany a U.S. troop drawdown with strong support for a robust U.N. presence in Iraq , a move that even Shiite militia leader Muqtada Sadr has indicated he would welcome .

Then , get serious about engaging Iran , Syria and other regional powers in stabilizing Iraq .
All have plenty to lose if Iraq falls apart entirely .
Next , recognize that Iraq ’s fate -- and the continued rise of Islamic extremism and anti-Americanism -- is linked to ongoing Arab - Israeli tensions , and redouble efforts to resolve that long - running conflict .
Finally , welcome fleeing Iraqis into the United States .
Stingy quotas and idiotic restrictions on where Iraqis can apply for U.S. visas have meant that only about 200 Iraqis have been resettled in the U.S. over the last 10 months .
We need to make refugee resettlement easier , fast .
Still do n’t like any of my proposals ?

Fine .
Say we stick with the current White House approach .
Iraqis are now fleeing their country at the rate of 50,000 a month .
If that keeps up , Iraq will be entirely depopulated in 45 years .
That ’s one way to make the Iraq problem go away .

Believe it or not , there is one thing that scares many men more than hell –
that is approaching a beautiful woman .
Why is that the case ?
What can a beautiful woman possibly do to a man ?
Rip his head off ?
Not likely .
But I understand it .
I once was there myself .
It is a fundamental fear of rejection that dominates here .
An attractive woman has lots of power .
Everybody is polite to her , wants to get her drinks , wants to be with her .
She is a status symbol … an indication of personal power .
And she knows that .
But the power she has over you is only the power that you give her .
QUIZ : How long will it take to get over your Ex ?
One Month Six Months Over One Year I Have No Idea ... Continue Quiz ...
Besides the fear of rejection , what frustrates most men as well , is also an inhibitory approach anxiety .
What is approach anxiety ?
It is a fear that society implanted in you .
Scientific research proves that the only thing a newborn baby is afraid of , are loud noises and free falling .
Everything else is induced by the outside world .
The environment .
It 's important to realize that .
The fear has no foundation .
Approach anxiety is a fear society implanted in you .
The bad news is , there is nothing you can read or resolve in your mind , that would make the fear of rejection disappear .
Like most fears that are blocking you , there is only one way to overcome them – by repeatedly facing what you fear .
Repeating over and over again what you fear , and realizing that there is , in fact , nothing to fear , is the only way to make that fear go away .
I know .
You do n't like that .
I did n't myself .
The good news is , it takes only 25 approaches to conquer this fear .
So I suggest that you start right away !
Since you now know how to get what you wish for , I 'd like to give you some insights on how to get this issue done right from the beginning .
Ok , so let 's start with the 5 secrets to moving closer to a beautiful woman :
1 . Make three fast approaches for warm - up
Look for three girls that you like , and are comfortable with , and ask them something .
No matter what .
Ask for the way , the time , a place to go out since you 're new in town , the next cool bar , etc .
Be creative !
You do n't have to get into a conversation , but if it happens , do n't fight it .
The goal is to get into an “ approaching mood , ” and most important , to get comfortable with the idea of talking to women .
You will learn that it's ok and that nothing terrible will happen .
This will remove a lot of tension from you and believe me ; your next attempts will be much , much easier .
2. Detach yourself completely from the outcome
This is very important .
In order to make progress and get beyond your fears , I want you to have no expectations whatsoever .
No matter what she says or does , I want your life to go on the same way .
Do n't have expectations !
See it as a game .
Be playful .
You 're there to learn , and the only thing you want to get out of this is experience .
If you get a number or email in the end , that 's great .
But do n't expect anything .
Should you get rejected , so what ?
No big deal .
Just move on .
3 . Pay attention to your body language
Would you believe me when I say , that your body language is affecting the outcome of your performance itself ?
That means , even before you reach the woman , she might have already decided whether she will reject you or not .
Watch your body posture .
This subconsciously sends a signal of confidence and shows that you know what you 're doing .
This also increases your attractiveness many times over .
keep your head high , slightly above the horizontal line
imagine an invisible string tied to your chest , lifting you straight up
always lead from your hips when you are walking
during the conversation , never lean physically in , always lean back
sit and always stand in the most comfortable position … as if you were at home .
Lean on a wall , put a leg on the chair , use a chair like a sofa , etc .
watch your hands .
Do n't hang on to your glass .
Put one hand into your pocket , and leave the other one free
do n't try to look cool , ( if you are , you will anyway ) .
Have a slight smile – always .
This is pure gold .
4. Forget all pick - up lines you 've ever heard
Trust me , they wo n't work .
You do n't need them .
The truth is , what you say only matters less than 6 % to the outcome .
You communicate the rest through other ways .
Like the tone of your voice , and mainly through your body language .
The truth is , what you say only matters less than 6 % to the outcome .
Maintain strong eye contact during the approach , watch your body language , put on your biggest smile and just say “ hi . ”
Later on , when you have more experience , you can do more sophisticated things .
I 'll cover this another time .
5 . Have a story prepared
Let the conversation flow naturally .
Talk to the girl like you talk to your best friend .
The more natural you are , the better .
Do n't compliment her too much , again , be playful and cocky .
Speak slowly , and keep your voice tone low .
What happens very often to newbies , is that they begin having trouble maintaining the conversation .
They get stuck since they can not remember any topic to speak about .
Or they ask too many questions , which is also not helpful to getting the conversation going .
It helps to have some story prepared .
If nothing exciting has ever happened to you , you can make something up .
Tell how your best friend almost died on your last mountain hiking tour , or how you saved your cat from being washed in the washing machine .
It really does n't matter what the story is about .
What matters is how you are telling it .
It has to be told in an interesting and dramatic way .
She has to be sucked into that story , watching your lips , like she ca n’t wait to see how it ends .
Can you do that ?
I bet you can .
If not , practice !
From here on , you have several options :
You can ask for her number / email , change the location with her , or simply move on .
The point is , to collect as much experience as you can with women .
You must get comfortable with it .
If you are , then there is nothing that can hold you back anymore .
The world is yours .
Your friend ,

The perks of being a member of Team Bush
I really , really want to be a member of the Bush administration .
I wish I 'd realized what a cool job it was earlier , but there 's still time .
Let 's look at the perks .
For one thing , I could get a nickname .
I 've never had a nickname .
It could be Jon-Boy or Mr. Toasty or Smallfoot -- the president does not have a flair for nicknames , only a penchant -- but quality is not really the issue .
I mean , Scooter is a dopey nickname , and yet Scooter Libby still got to be the assistant to the Eater of Worlds .
He would still hold that job had he not been caught lying .
That 's another thing I could do as a member of the Bush administration : I could lie .
I could lie to Congress and the FBI and pretty much everybody , knowing the president had my back .
If I ever got caught ( not likely ) , brought to trial ( less likely ) and convicted ( heh ! ) , I 'd just have to wait until after the sentencing and get a pardon or a commutation or a surgical extraction from a minimum - security prison .
And , if all that fails , I 'd still have the Supreme Court on my side .
Scalia could write an opinion explaining that it was never the intention of the framers of the Constitution for me to go to jail .
Heck , they did n't even know me .
If I were a lawyer , I might worry that a felony conviction would hamper my ability to practice law .
But then I would remember : I have n't practiced law in 30 years .
I could become a lobbyist and hang out with my friends , or I could just retire with my ill - gotten gains .
Another advantage of being a member of the Bush administration : ill - gotten gains .
And suppose I were to invite a pig to a meeting of my top aides .
If some disaffected ex-employee mentioned my habit of bringing pigs into the room , I could say that I have no recollection of any pig in the room .
When faced with evidence to the contrary , I could say that , although I have no memory of a pig being in the room , I now accept that there was a pig in the room .
All I remember about the meeting was the cookies in the center of the table .
Apparently , the pig also remembered the cookies .
Eventually , I might have to resign to spend more time with my family .
But I like spending time with my family .
It 's pretty much a win - win for me .
The best part of being a member of the Bush administration is that I could do anything I wanted .
Suppose I want to dig a gold mine in Colorado .
( I like gold . )
Congress might pass the No Digging for Gold in Colorado Act , but then the president would issue a secret signing statement saying that the administration reserved the right to dig for gold in Colorado if it were an issue of national security .
Then I would subcontract the actual digging part to a private enterprise , which would charge twice what it actually cost , but I would not care because the government would be paying for it .
This is an important part of being part of the Bush administration : remembering that I hate the government , even though I am part of the government .
The thing I really hate is taxes .
I want taxes to be so low that they cover only the costs of whatever war my administration wants to fight , plus pay my mining people .
The rest of it :
Hey , is n't that why we have faith - based private organizations ?
They take up the slack .
They fill the need .
The government does n't fill the need ; it just digs the holes .
If things got really hot for me , I just could declare that I was a separate branch of government .
The Department of Gold and Wars , which I head , is not really part of the executive branch because my duties include " laying down the law " to insubordinate underlings , which clearly falls within the purview of the legislative branch .
So , actually , no laws at all apply to me at any time , ever , and I am free to kill any celebrities who annoy me .
Finally , I would get to appoint my friends to stuff .
Are you my friend ?
Would you like to be a federal prosecutor ?
How about an inspector of mines ?
Plenty of positions open at the Park Service .
Want to wear a cute hat and point at squirrels ?
We could get a special secret appropriation for your salary ( whaddya think ?
$ 300 K ?
Sound about right ? ) , and you could live in a brown building surrounded by lonely young men and women .
Maybe I 'll just appoint myself to that job .
The gold mine does not seem to be yielding , you know , gold .
Also , and this would be optional , I could wear one of those cool earpieces with the curly wires going down into my coat .
And I could talk into my wrist .
No microphone necessary ; just my wrist .
Many of Bolivia 's cities , including La Paz , are at high altitude
Fifa said the decision was made because of concerns over players ' health and possible distortion of competition .
The ruling was greeted with dismay in Latin America , notably in Ecuador , Peru and Bolivia , where games in La Paz are played at 3,600 m ( 11,811ft ) .
Bolivia 's President , Evo Morales , vowed to lead a campaign against the ban .
Speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting , Mr Morales said the ruling amounted to discrimination .
" This is not only a ban on Bolivia , it 's a ban on the universality of sports , " he told reporters .
To play at above that altitude is not healthy or fair
Sepp Blatter
Fifa president
Mr Morales also said he would send a high - level delegation to Fifa 's headquarters in Zurich and called on other countries to join his campaign .
" We cannot allow discrimination in soccer , we cannot allow ... exclusion in the world of sports , " he added .
Many of Bolivia 's major cities , including Sucre and Potosi , are at high altitude .
' Discrimination '
Local commentators in Peru , which was hoping to stage upcoming World Cup qualifiers in Cuzco at 3,400 m ( 11,154ft ) , suggested Fifa made the decision after pressure from South America 's two major football powers , Brazil and Argentina .
Both nations have struggled in recent years while playing at altitude , where the thin air hands an advantage to those acclimatised to the conditions .
Playing sport in conditions of high altitude places heavy demands on the body , forcing the heart to work harder .
CITIES AT ALTITUDE Bolivia : La Paz - 3,600 m ( 11,811ft ) Ecuador : Quito - 2,800 m ( 9,186ft ) Colombia : Bogota : 2640 m ( 8,661ft )
Earlier in 2007 , Brazilian club Flamengo said they would not play again at altitude after several of their players needed oxygen during a game against Bolivian team Real Potosi , held at nearly 4,000 m ( 13,120ft ) .
The ban will also affect Ecuador whose national side has qualified for the last two World Cups , winning through on the basis of strong performances in Quito , at 2,800m .
Mexico City , where the 1970 and 1986 World Cup Final was played , just beats the Fifa limit , having an altitude of 2,240 m ( 7349ft ) .
Fifa 's president , Sepp Blatter , said the organisation had expected protests from Latin America .
" The executive committee have listened to a proposal from the medical committee and have decided to act because to play at above that altitude is not healthy or fair , " he said .
Testosterone helps to build muscle
A study of 800 men over 50 found that those with low levels had a 33 % increased risk of death over an 18 - year period than those with higher levels .
At a Toronto meeting of The Endocrine Society , researchers said they did not recommend taking supplements .
Experts warn there could be side effects and say men should keep active to help maintain testosterone levels .
The study participants , who were aged between 50 and 91 , have been taking part in a chronic disease study in California since the 1970s .
Levels of testosterone were classified as low if they were at the lower limit of the normal range for young adult men .
Testosterone gives you a zing , if you have low testosterone it tends to make you less active
Professor Richard Sharpe
Testosterone levels decline with age but there is wide variation .
In the study , 29 % of the men had low levels of the hormone .
The higher risk of death in men with low testosterone levels could not be explained by smoking , drinking , physical activity level or pre-existing diseases such as diabetes or heart disease .
Metabolic syndrome
However , the researchers did note that men with lower testosterone levels were three times more likely to have a cluster of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes .
Collectively known as " metabolic syndrome " , the risk factors include waist measurement over 40in , high levels of cholesterol , high blood pressure and high blood sugar .
Study author Dr Gail Laughlin , assistant professor in the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California , San Diego , said : " Our study strongly suggests that the association between testosterone levels and death is not simply due to some acute illness " .
She added that lifestyle may determine testosterone levels and that it may be possible to alter levels by lowering obesity .
Co-author Professor Elizabeth Barrett - Connor said it was not being recommended that men should go out and buy testosterone supplements .
" Maybe the decline in testosterone is healthy and comes with older age , " she said .
" Maybe the decline is bad and associated with chronic diseases of ageing . "
' Keep active '
Professor Richard Sharpe , from the MRC Human Reproductive Sciences Unit in Edinburgh , said the results were particularly important because studies had shown levels of testosterone in men of all ages were falling .
" The other important thing about this study is the association with metabolic syndrome .
Being obese lowers the available testosterone and that makes you more obese so it's a vicious cycle .
" Testosterone gives you a zing , if you have low testosterone it tends to make you less active . "
He said the use of testosterone supplements was a very contentious theory because of potential side effects .
" Instead you should adapt your lifestyle , to keep your body in shape and make the best of your testosterone .
" Men assume they 're just getting older when they get a gut but keeping a good body shape will help maintain your testosterone levels . "
An innocuous gene - bearing virus injected into the midbrains of a dozen patients suffering from Parkinson 's disease improved the subjects ' motor function while causing no adverse effects , says a new study .
This is the first time gene therapy has been tested to fight Parkinson's , which affects an estimated 500,000 Americans .
The promising findings , published this week in The Lancet , opens the door to a new treatment option for the neurodegenerative disease .
" The safety and effectiveness clearly indicate that this is something worth pursuing , " says lead study author Michael Kaplitt , a neurological surgeon and director of movement disorders at New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center .
" We 're not finished , clearly ; we still need to do a larger , more definitive study to prove this for sure . "
Parkinson 's disease , a disorder that typically strikes people in their 60s , is characterized by tremors , stiffness , loss of speech and difficulty with motor function .
Neuroscientists have tracked its biological cause to the loss of neurons , or nerve cells , in a midbrain region called the substantia nigra , which produces the neurotransmitter dopamine ( that helps maintain proper movement control ) .
When dopamine levels are low the subthalamic nucleus , a sliver of neurons just above the substantia nigra , overproduces glutamate , which is the brain 's primary excitatory chemical messenger .
When hyped up it overstimulates downstream neurons , triggering a strong inhibitory response that results in disrupted movement .
Kaplitt and senior study author Matthew During , a senior research associate at Weill Cornell , focused on trying to calm down the overactive subthalamic nucleus .
They used a harmless virus called an adeno - associated virus to transport a gene that codes for the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) into the neurons of the subthalamic nucleus .
The gene prompted these subthalamic cells to produce gamma- aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , the brain 's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter , which made them settle down and restored normal motor function .
Because of federal regulations , the team could only inject the virus into one hemisphere of each person 's brain .
" This allowed us to compare the two sides of the brain , " Kaplitt says , which enabled researchers to judge the effectiveness of their treatment .
Researchers monitored the 12 subjects over the next year and discovered that motor function improved from 25 percent to 65 percent .
They also found that the treated sides of the brain showed normalized brain activity in key regions downstream from the subthalamic nucleus : the thalamus , also implicated in motor function , and parts of the cerebral cortex involved in movement .
Most encouraging to the scientists was that the improvement persisted even when the patients were on their Parkinson 's medications meaning that , as Kaplitt describes , " the therapy was causing additional improvement to the medicines . "
Kaplitt and During had a number of safety concerns at the study 's inception :
The viral packages could damage target cells by provoking the immune system ; there was a chance of overinhibition of the neurons in the subthalamic nucleus ; and there were worries about unknown side effects that the researchers had not anticipated .
But Kaplitt reports their fears were unfounded — there were no incidents of infection , immune response or toxicity .
In an editorial accompanying The Lancet article , Jon Stoessl , a professor of neurology at Pacific Parkinson 's Research Center in Vancouver , calls the new work a " provocative approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative disease . "
He questions , however , whether this is a better treatment option than deep - brain stimulation , the most effective current therapy , which involves implanting a brain " pacemaker " to electrically stimulate either the thalamus or subthalamic nucleus
Kaplitt , who hopes to have a full - scale clinical trial for the gene therapy approach underway by year - end , says there are several " inherent advantages " to this new option .
Most notably , there are no wires or batteries in the body that could cause infection , it avoids the risks of putting a new electrical source in the brain , and the pacemaker has to be tuned frequently , whereas the gene , according to animal studies , should remain effective for several years .
" If I had these two therapies side by side , " Kaplitt says , " I and most of my patients would choose the gene therapy approach . "
The thesis is simple , and almost everyone disagrees with it upon first hearing .
The symmetry thesis : A given person likes ( loves ) you as much as you like ( love ) him or her .
I have encountered many apparent refutations of the symmetry thesis ,
but with time most have turned out to be spurious .
I find the symmetry
thesis a surprisingly strong predictor of human behavior and
inclination .
Do I want to know how much you like me ?
It is simple .
I imagine
how much I like you .
( If you do the same , are we circular ?
Or does
some kind of fixed point theorem apply ? )
Let me rule out or explain some obvious " counterexamples . "
If a guy
stalks you , and you ca n’t stand him , the reality is that he is probably
more hostile to you than loving .
The thesis fits .
Break - ups are tricky and they provide the best counterexamples .
But
who really left whom is not always obvious ; it can take several years
to figure out what was going on .
Often the leaving party is the one
who first develops a narrative of how things might be different ; this
is distinct from liking or loving the other person less .
Other people
leave pre-emptively .
Unilateral crushes are possible and indeed common , although with
repeated contact they usually collapse into symmetry , one way or the
other .
I can imagine several ( non-exclusive ) mechanisms in support of the
symmetry thesis .
Perhaps " having a connection " — which is mutual by
nature — is the key to true liking and attraction .
That is my favored
view .
Note that it creates a possible exception for people who can
like or love others without having any real connection with them .
I
tend to think of such likes as delusional .
Alternatively , perhaps at least one person is a " fraidy cat , " and
wo n’t let himself or herself fall for the other , or even like the
other , without witnessing signs of reciprocity .
The two people then
lead each other down the pathway of like , in a kind of low - key
intertemporal seduction , sans the sex .
Or with it .
Perhaps we like other people for their intrinsic qualities less than
we pretend .
Mostly we like people for liking ( loving ) us .
Yes I know that most of you do n’t believe it , and have plenty of
counterexamples to offer .
But keep it in the back of your mind , and
see if it proves useful over the next few years .
We know that one of the most important words we can use in blogging is you , so our copy should be squarely focused on the reader .
And we also know we need to identify just who exactly our prospective readers actually are .
Would n’t it be a shame to go through all of that and end up not speaking to those people after all ?
It sounds crazy , but speaking to the wrong “ you ” is a common problem throughout business communications , and blogging makes it an incredibly easy mistake to make .
The Danger of the Wrong “ You ”
Even when people know exactly who they are supposed to be speaking to , they often fail to tailor the message to match the audience .
A great example comes from the book Presenting to Win by presentation coach Jerry Weissman .
Weissman tells the story of working with Reed Hastings , CEO of Netflix , just before the company IPO .
Hastings ’ road show presentation outlined all the great benefits of subscribing to Netflix , which was all fine and good , except that a road show is designed to sell investors , not subscribers .
Weissman reoriented the presentation to focus on the benefits of investing in Netflix , such as how large the market opportunity was , rather than the benefits of the service itself .
The Netflix IPO in 2002 ended up a smashing success .
Having the Wrong Conversation
Blogging provides all too many opportunities to get off track with your own audience .
The problem arises by chasing the conversation with other bloggers .
While it ’s essential to get involved in cross - blog dialogue in order to gain links and mindshare in your niche , you need to make sure you tie it all back into the needs of your prospects .
When the conversation is not one that is of interest to your actual readers , however , you ’ve got a problem .
Here are a few of examples .
Do the prospective customers of a Realtor want to read endless debate about Zillow and other threats to the traditional role of the real estate agent , or do they want actionable tips on buying and selling a home ?
Does a small business person care about you hashing out the vagaries of the social media press release with your industry colleagues , or might they benefit more from a few practical publicity tips that demonstrate that you are a savvy and confident PR practitioner ?
Does the average car accident victim care about the novel procedural ruling that just came out of the Federal District Court , or do they care about information that demonstrates that you ’re an attorney who will take care of them and fight the insurance company ?
All three of the above are examples of bloggers talking shop .
It ’s all too easy to get caught up trying to look good in front of your peers , which leads you to drop the ball with the people who matter most — your prospective clients and customers .
Have the best of both worlds .
Engage in blog conversation , but never miss the opportunity to clearly explain ( without jargon ) to your readers why it matters to them .
If you ca n’t find a compelling reason why it actually does matter , maybe you need to find another conversation .
Every post is an opportunity to demonstrate why you ’re the solution to the needs of a prospect .
Do n’t squander that opportunity by leaving your target audience out .
They ’ll happily wander away and listen to someone more interesting to them given half a chance .
The Bear is highly manoeuvrable
The Battlefield Extraction Assist Robot ( BEAR ) can scoop up even the heaviest of casualties and transport them over long distances over rough terrain .
New Scientist magazine reports that the " friendly appearance " of the robot is designed to put the wounded at ease .
It is expected to be ready for testing within five years .
While it is important to get medical attention for injured soldiers as soon as possible , it is often difficult and dangerous for their comrades to reach them and carry them back .
The 6ft tall Bear can cross bumpy ground without toppling thanks to a combination of gyroscopes and computer controlled motors to maintain balance .
BEAR FACTS 1 .
Teddy bear face designed to be reassuring 2 . Hydraulic upper body carries up to 227kgs ( 500lbs ) 3 .
When kneeling tracked " legs " travel over rubble .
Switches to wheels on smooth surfaces 4 . Dynamic Balance Behaviour ( DBB ) technology allows the robot to stand and carry loads upright on its ankles , knees or hips for nearly an hour
It is also narrow enough to squeeze through doorways , but can lift 135 kg with its hydraulic arms in a single smooth movement , to avoid causing pain to wounded soldiers .
While the existing prototype slides its arms under its burden like a forklift , future versions will be fitted with manoeuvrable hands to gently scoop up casualties .
The Bear is controlled remotely and has cameras and microphones through which an operator sees and hears .
It can even tackle stairs while carrying a human - sized dummy .
Daniel Theobald , the president of Vecna Technologies , which is developing the robot for the US Army , said : " We saw a need for a robot that can essentially go where a human can .
The robot will be an integral part of a military team . "
Gary Gilbert , from the US Army 's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Centre in Frederick , Maryland , said that the teddy bear appearance was deliberate .
" A really important thing when you 're dealing with casualties is trying to maintain that human touch . "
Vecna is working on other potential applications for the robot technology - including helping move heavy patients in hospital .
3.7 Predefined Macros
Several object - like macros are predefined ; you use them without supplying their definitions .
They fall into three classes : standard , common , and system - specific .
In C++ , there is a fourth category , the named operators .
They act like predefined macros , but you cannot undefine them .
Increasing prosperity and economic growth has paradoxically led to record levels of personal debt .
Modern life offers a bewildering array of possibilities for getting into debt — financial institutions make it as easy as possible .
But , when you face a mountain of debt , do n’t expect much help from them in overcoming the situation .
Debt can bring anxiety , stress and unhappiness ; but , by being aware of your financial situation you can enjoy life without permanently battling against the problem of debt .
To avoid suffering from serious debt problems consider these suggestions :
1 . Buy what you need
It ’s easy to buy things we actually do n’t need or very rarely use .
Look in your wardrobe and count the number of clothes that you rarely wear .
Before buying a good , try to evaluate its usefulness to yourself ; give it a mark out of 10 .
If you give items an honest score , you will think twice before spending $ 100 on your 7th pair of designer shoes .
If you ’re an impulsive buyer , try waiting a day before buying something .
If you really want and need it you can come back the next day .
2 . The $ 70 dollar test
If you have a real problem with excess spending , try this test .
For a week , give yourself $ 70 cash , and put away all credit cards .
This forces you to live on $ 10 a day .
When you are faced with a strict income , it forces you to be very careful in what you spend .
It will make you realise what is really indispensable and which spending is mere extravagance .
This will also force you to be inventive .
For example , rather than spending $ 15 on a take away lunch , you may make your own .
Quite often , by taking these steps we realize our previous spending habits were not at all essential to our happiness .
3. How Much do you Spend ?
It is easy to forget how much we spend .
For example , with credit cards we do n’t see the money leave our wallet so it , somehow , seems less real .
Most people in debt live in denial at how much they spend on certain items ; when faced with their true expenditure it can often be a shock .
For example , maybe you get two takeaway coffees per day and one pastry .
This can easily add upto $ 15 a day , which is nearly $ 100 a week – that ’s $ 5000 a year !
We may be reluctant to spend $ 2000 on a computer because it is a big outlay .
But , at the start of the year , would we be so keen to put aside a lump sum of $ 5000 just for the purchase of coffee and pastries ?
4. Tear up Credit Cards .
Credit cards can be useful if you never miss a payment , and pay the balance in full .
If you are able to do this then credit cards are working for you .
However , if you find credit cards only encourage you to spend beyond your means , consider getting rid of all credit cards , at least for a time .
This makes sure that you only spend what you have available .
5. Financial Education
In school we get taught about ancient history , chemistry , and how to differentiate a complex equation ; in fact we can learn anything apart from what is important in the real world .
If you struggle to grasp the meaning of APR , debt settlements , compound interest , spend some time to learn about the workings of financial issues .
At a very basic level , make sure you are aware of how much interest you are being charged and the penalties for a late payment .
6. Manage Debt
If you do have a moderate amount of debt , this need not be a problem .
The important thing is that it is managed in a careful way .
Make sure you move the debt to the lowest interest paying account possible .
For example , if you have debt on a credit card , you could be paying the standard variable rate of upto 18{54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} .
Other credit cards may enable you to switch the balance at 0{54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} interest for 6 - 12 months .
By keeping interest payments as low as possible , it enables you to pay money to reducing the amount of debt , rather than just paying interest .
7. Spending does not equal happiness
A growing phenomena amongst shoppers is the idea of “ retail therapy ” Basically , we get satisfaction from spending money , even if the goods we buy are rarely used .
If you rely on spending money to gain happiness , you need to think very carefully about whether this is a good way to get satisfaction in life .
This is not to say shopping is always bad ; the point is that spending money does not equate to real happiness .

We learned yesterday that the Bush administration has created a database of every single prescription drug user / patient in the country ( that would pretty much be all of us ) .
The database was created pursuant to a 2005 law that was intended to prevent the abuse of prescription drugs .
Funny that this massive new database of your private medical information is now being ( ab) used for a purpose that was n't intended in or approved by the law .
The federal database of your private medical information is now being used by federal law enforcement to investigate crimes that have nothing to do with prescription drug abuse .
We know this because yesterday ABC News disclosed that the feds checked the database to see what prescription meds the Virginia Tech shooter might have been on .
How does the mass murder of students and faculty at Virginia Tech have anything to do with prescription drug abuse ?
It does n't .
The Bush administration has created a massive database of your private medical records and they 're now abusing it .
Gee , what a surprise - the Bush administration secretly prying into our private lives in violation of the law .
If they wanted this power , they could have sought it from Congress .
They did n't .
So they took it anyway , even though the law does n't allow it .
Your privacy is gone , and it's not terribly clear that anyone in Washington cares .
They have been blamed for putting up the price of everything from bicycles to garden fences .
Now the Chinese have been dubbed " milk snatchers " by German consumers for buying so much milk that prices of dairy products in Germany are expected to soar by 50 % .
The Germans are being made to feel the effect of China 's new - found taste for milk , sparked by a remark by China 's prime minister Wen Jiabao : " I have a dream - a dream to be able to provide all Chinese , especially our children , with half a litre of milk a day . "
The result has been a huge increase in milk consumption in China and demand is growing at a rate of around 25 % a year .
Because China has no tradition of dairy farming , there is a shortage of home - produced milk .
A third of all the milk produced worldwide is now being transported to China , much of it from the EU and a significant amount from Germany , which produces 27bn litres a year .
EU dairy farmers would like to increase production to cope with a current shortfall , but are prevented from doing so by EU milk quotas , imposed in 1984 and in force until 2015 .
Instead German dairy farmers have taken the obvious step of putting up their prices , which they have long claimed were artificially low .
Blaming the Chinese has helped to deflect criticism from the farmers .
A litre of milk in Germany , currently around 64 cents ( 40 p ) , is due to go up by 50 % in the next few weeks .
Other products , such as butter , quark and yoghurt , are expected to rise accordingly .
Across Europe the prices of dairy products are rising for the same reasons , but not so dramatically as in Germany , where cheap groceries are seen as a basic right .
Thanks to the lobbying power of Germany 's huge number of discount supermarkets , groceries cost around 63 % less than in Iceland and 15 % less than in Britain .
Now outraged consumer groups and politicians have called for the government to raise unemployment benefit to cover the rise .
Yesterday supermarkets across the country reported that shoppers were panic buying dairy products in an attempt to beat the price increase .
The only effective way to increase global milk yields without breaking the milk quotas , according to experts , is to encourage the breeding of cows outside the EU .
German dairy farmers have duly been selling their best high - performance milk cows to Chinese farmers , who are receiving government subsidies if they switch to dairy farming .

Kuala Lumpur
A tribunal to try UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George Bush for war crimes will be convened on Wednesday .
The anti-war demo was convened in Kuala Lumpur
It is no surprise that neither man will be attending the proceedings - they may not even be aware that it is taking place .
But start it will , at a conference in Kuala Lumpur called as part of the former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad 's campaign to criminalise war .
Dr Mahathir is not expected to sit on the tribunal .
He could n't quite be characterised as impartial .
Dr Mahathir said : " What is Blair if not the co-murderer of 500,000 Iraqi children and the liar who told the British that Saddam had WMD ( Weapons of Mass Destruction ) which could be launched against Britain within 45 minutes ?
" History should remember Blair and Bush as the ' killers of children ' . "
Although the aim of the conference - entitled Expose War Crimes , Criminalise War - is to outlaw war itself , for many Malaysians who 've turned up that means one thing .
" They 're giving an open mind to people who know what kind of war crime that the US do to our communities in the world , " was one man 's assessment .
It seemed to be that of most people .
" It is the converted preaching to the converted , " said Gwynne Dyer , a journalist and Oscar - nominated documentary maker who addressed the conference .
" But I think this [ conference ] has potential , " he said .
" It actually has a goal beyond cheering people up and allowing them to vent . "
And there 's a lot of venting going on here .
Specifically it seems to be to vilify Tony Blair and George Bush .
' Vast conspiracy '
The meeting has attracted a curious range of speakers .
The former UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Iraq Hans Von Sponeck shares a platform with author Alfred Lambremont Webre .
Some question Dr Mahathir 's human rights credentials
Mr Webre claims to have uncovered a vast conspiracy to profit from wars .
He 's also keenly interested in intelligent extra-terrestrial life .
The message is made quite clear by an exhibition staged in parallel with the conference .
Its style is Madame Tussauds on a shoestring , and it features tableaux illustrating the carnage of the world wars , the Palestinian problem , Vietnam and of course Iraq .
There 's a section comprising a cage and a couple of dummies wired up to electrodes with the song Rivers of Babylon pumping away in the background .
A helpful notice tells us that the " cheerful " music of Boney M was used as an instrument of torture in the Iraq prison at Abu Ghraib .
Dr Mahathir is busy signing autographs .
A woman passes him a copy of her programme to sign .
" Oh Dr Mahathir " , she coos , " you 're more handsome in person than you are in photographs . "
The 81 - year - old statesman takes it in his stride .
His admirer persists .
" I 'm honoured , I 'm standing in front of you , I 'm shaking I feel like I 'm in love for the first time , " she says .
" Shameless flattery , " I suggested to Dr Mahathir .
" Yes , it 's flattery , " he said with a grave smile .
Resignation calls
But there 's no flattery when I ask him if he has anything to add about Mr Blair .
" What do I have to say about him ?
I think it 's about time he resigns .
Do n't wait too long , people are impatient .
It 's time he resigns .
He 's been telling lies . "
The demo featured some anti-war exhibitions
Not everyone is convinced that Dr Mahathir is a suitable figurehead for a new human rights movement .
After all , his record during 22 years in power was far from unblemished .
He detained political opponents without trial and had scant regard for the freedom of the press .
His administration was accused of turning a blind eye to torture .
I put this to Dr Dyer .
" If you know someone who has a claim to the moral high ground I 'd like to meet him , " he said .
" Nelson Mandela , " I ventured .
" Alright , there 's one , name a second , " he challenged me .
" Desmond Tutu , " I suggested knowing , I still had the Dalai Lama up my sleeve .
" Oh damn , " said Dr Dyer .
" But you know nobody comes to this with clean hands and if you wait until you have perfect people to do it you 're not going to get it done are you ? "
Meanwhile a Downing Street spokesman responded simply : " We believe the invasion of Iraq was lawful , and we believe that the UN confirmed with resolution 1723 that the presence of the multi-national force remains legal . "
And never the twain shall meet .
Almost 50 % of all people using BitTorrent at any given point in time do this to download TV - series , while only 10 % of the available torrents are TV related .
People who download TV - shows also have one of the best share ratios , only Anime fanatics beat them .
The statistics presented here are gathered by SumoTorrent , and based on a sample of more than 400.000 . torrent files collected from several public BitTorrent sites .
From now on these statistics will be published on a monthly basis , so we can keep an eye on changes in the download and sharing preferences of the average BitTorrent user .
What is Hot ?
TV - series are by far the most shared files on BitTorrent .
Nearly 50 % of all the people who use BitTorrent at any given point in time do this to download a TV - show , even though the number of available torrents are much lower than for Music or Video .
The second most popular torrent category based on the number of downloaders and uploaders is Video ( 15.7 % ) , followed by Games ( 8.6 % ) , Music ( 7.8 ) and of course XXX ( 6.0 % ) .
As we will see later on , these figures are quite different from the number of . torrents that are available .
The statistics are calculated based on the info from the trackers , this means that someone who ’s downloading 2 music albums at the same time is counted twice .
However , we do n’t expect any significant differences between the categories , so the percentages should be pretty accurate .
What type of torrents are offered ?
Music ( 25.9 % ) and Video ( 24.2 % ) , followed by Applications ( 13.3 % ) , are in the lead if we look at the number of available torrents .
Games ( 7.8 % ) , XXX ( 5.1 % ) and Anime ( 4.3 % ) are less popular .
Even though 50 % of the people use BitTorrent to download TV - series , only 10 % of the available . torrents on public trackers are TV related .
This means that on average the swarms ( seeds + peers ) are greater for TV - torrents , not a big surprise because an average episode of a popular TV - show like Lost is downloaded by more than 500.000 people in a week .
Share Ratios ?
Sharing is one of key features of BitTorrent etiquette .
The more people that are sharing a file , the faster other people are able to download it .
If we take a look at the sharing ratios of the categories we see that Anime fans have an impressive share ratio of 2.5 , and are sharing the most .
Anime fans are followed by people who download Music ( ratio 1.9 ) and Applications ( ratio 1.5 ) respectively .
XXX downloaders are probably looking for a quick fix , and are more the “ hit - and - run ” type ( ratio 0.38 ) .
The category Video has the lowest share ratio , a disappointing 0.27 , let ’s hope we see some improvement there next month when we publish more statistics and perhaps even some emerging trends .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Brian May , the lead guitarist from rock band Queen , is close to earning his doctorate in astrophysics -- more than 35 years after quitting his studies to become a rock star .

May arrived on the island of La Palma in Spain ’s Canary Islands several days ago to conduct astronomical observations in support of his thesis , according to a statement by the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands .
His thesis , “ Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud , ” is the last component of his PhD studies , and May expected to complete his work on Wednesday .
“ Maybe you ’d like to see the Telescope we are working in , ” May , 60 , wrote on his Web site on Wednesday .
“ Galileo ... Galileo ... how full of coincidences life is , ” he added , referring to the lyrics in Queen ’s hit song “ Bohemian Rhapsody . ”
After submitting his thesis at Imperial College , London , he will have to wait until university assessors approve his work to be granted his PhD next year .
May was studying astrophysics at Imperial College when he formed Queen with singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor in 1970 .
He dropped his doctorate research into interstellar dust as the band met with increasing success .
After Mercury ’s AIDS - related death in 1991 , May recorded several solo albums and set up the Brian May Band .
But his interest in astronomy continued , and he co-wrote “ Bang !
The Complete History of the Universe ” with Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott , which was published last year .
Earlier this month , the writer of such Queen hits as “ We Will Rock You ” and “ Fat Bottomed Girls ” was granted an honorary doctorate from Exeter University in Devon , England .
They 've been campaigning for a century to make the spelling of the English language easier and recently picketed a spelling bee in the US to make their point .
Welcome to the Simplified Spelling Society .
Masha Bell , a member of the society and author of Understanding English Spelling , believes that reform of the spelling of the English language could help children learn to read and make life easier for some adults too .
SIMPLIFIED GLOSSARY Learn - lern Slow - slo Beautiful - butiful
Full glossary Prof Vivian Cook , a linguist , expert in second language learning and author of Accomodating Brocolli in the Cemetary , believes changing spellings would be unnecessary , expensive and could harm children 's ability to read .
We pitched the two , spelling reformer and spelling traditionalist , into a battle to persuade the other .
Here they debate the merits of spelling systems , in the form of short e-mails .
Some of Ms Bell 's entries are partly - written in simplified spelling .
MASHA BELL : The Simplified Spelling Society believes that the spelling of English needs simplifying so children 's literacy can improve .
The US spelling bee 's winner summed up the problem neatly : " Spelling is just a bunch of memorization . "
VIVIAN COOK : Obviously anything that can help children become literate in English is worth considering .
MB : If u hav a por memmory yor chances of becumming a good speller ar lo .
But wors stil , yor chances of lerning to read ar not good either , because of phonnic nonsens like " cow - crow , dream - dreamt , friend - fiend " and hundreds mor like them .
The problem for the SSS is that most peeple ar not aware of the educational disadvantages which stem from spelling inconsistencies or how they came about .
VC : Do n't forget English has many other aspects that are a problem for children and adult learners .
Our " standard " pronunciation is very hard for many people ; our vocabulary is vast and drawn from virtually every language in the world ; our grammar is a mystery ( try explaining to a speaker of any other language when you say " I have been to Warsaw " rather than " I went to Warsaw " ) .
This makes it like any other human language , full of features that seem illogical but add up to a whole that works for human beings .
MB : Yes , as a language , English is exceptionally easy to lern .
Compared with the six uther European languages which I hav studied ( Lithuanian , Russian , German , French , Spanish and Italian ) , it has almost no grammatical difficulties whatsoever .
I did not begin to lern English until the age of 14 , and the onely linguistic aspects I found tricky wer idiomatic expressions like " get off , back up , turn up " .
- " I have been " and " I went " wer easy .
The difference between them is consistent and logical .
VC : English is a great success story , used by hundreds of millions of natives and being used and learnt by a billion non-natives : it is so efficient that there are problems about it wiping out other languages .
I cannot agree that it is absolutely easier or more difficult than any other language : it depends on what first language you start from and many other circumstances of learning .
MB : But the alphabetic unreliability of English spelling is a huge problem .
Foreign lerners can never be sure how to pronounce an English word without hearing it first [ sun - sugar , and - ask , on - once ] .
That 's why onely English dictionaries have pronunciation guides and why I regularly annotated the words I was lerning : woman [ wooman ] , women [ wimmen ] .
VC : A problem for what ?
When reading simple words I do n't turn letters into words but words into meanings : " the " is not " t+h+e " but a whole symbol " the " like " @ " .
Perhaps you could explain how any changes to spelling would affect the issue of English globally and how you would change spelling in a way that would help children and not hinder the rest of the English - using world ?
MB :
The most serious disadvantage of English spelling lies in making literacy acquisition for Anglophone children exceptionally slo and difficult - roughly three times sloer than the European average , acording to the most recent reserch ( Seymour , 2003 ) .
In English , even practised newsreaders occasionally still mispronounce words .
( I hav herd Anna Ford struggle with " counterfeited " or " reneging " ) .
That 's why moast English speakers stick to a fairly simple vocabulary .
VC : Well I think this brings us to the crunch of the problems with spelling reform : the mistaken idea that spelling exists for reading aloud and the belief that the human mind works better with a few rules rather than with lots of individual items .
MB : Children certainly learn to read and write much faster with a logically consistent spelling system than with an irregular one .
When in 1963 - 4 the London Institute of Education together with the National Foundation for Education Research compared children 's literacy acquisition using the Initial Teaching Alphabet ( ITA ) and normal English spelling , they found that the ITA users learned roughly three times as fast .
ITA also left far fewer children making the sort of really poor progress that invariably occurs with normal English spelling .
VC : There are two broad types of writing system in the world : those that link written forms primarily to meaning like Chinese and those that relate written forms chiefly to spoken sounds like Italian .
English has aspects of both ; we treat the 20 most frequent words like " the " and " for " as single signs that relate to meanings , just like " % " and " £ " - it does not really matter how eccentric their spellings are as they are recognised as wholes .
The rest we link to sounds via a complex system of rules that relate the letter " a " to particular sounds in " at " , " tart " , " date " , " away " etc and that sometimes rely on so - called silent letters like " e " and " u " to show the different spellings of " mat/ mate " and " guest / gesture " .
MB : Unlike Chinese pictograms , the spellings of English words give us no clue to their meaning .
And much of the irregularity is down to history .
There is no advantage in spelling the most often used words unalphabetically .
Quite the opposite : the irregular spellings of common words like " to , you , your , very , many " are particularly noxious because they keep undermining the basic English spelling system and so make it harder for children to learn it .
If they obeyed the basic English code too [ tu , u , yor , verry , menny ] they would help them to grasp the whole system much faster .
Children cope with the regular complex spellings , such as " mat - mate , guest - gesture , dine - dinner " , easily enough .
Their reading and spelling difficulties are all caused by random irregular spellings : laid , paid - said ; our , sour - your ; chat , chart - character ; fatter , latter , late , latent - lateral .
VC : The human mind can deal with a vast number of individual signs ; a Chinese dictionary has about 30,000 ; Japanese children have to learn 1,945 in primary school .
Cutting down on the number of individual words , we need to know as wholes is no particular advantage .
If Chinese can manage to learn so many symbols so can English children .
By the way most Chinese characters are no more pictures than are English letters - turn a capital " A " upside down and you will see the animal it once pictured , as remote from its origins as most Chinese characters .
MB : A few minds can deal with a vast number of individual signs or spellings with relative ease , but the vast majority can't .
Many rural Chinese are reportedly still completely illiterate .
Literacy acquisition is certainly very difficult in both Chinese and Japanese .
Children learn to read and write with an easy phonetic system first and then gradually acquire the more difficult traditional orthographies .
VC : Yet some researchers claim that Japanese children do not have dyslexia .
The problem is that spelling reform and indeed much school teaching expects all of English to link spellings and sounds rather than whole symbols .
Only a few of us need to read aloud seriously , such as the handful of trained and highly selected newsreaders ; otherwise we read aloud rarely , except perhaps to children .
MB : Worldwide , English spelling wastes zillions , not onely in terms of time and effort , but in real munny too : for remedial education and to suport functionally illiterate adults .
The latter ar also mor likely to becum yung singl parents , end up in jail , be adicted tu drugs and alcohol and hav poor helth .
Spellings that make learning to read , and therefor getting a footing onto the road to educational success , exeptionally difficult ar particularly nasty .
Having to waste time on memorising thousands of quirky spellings wun by wun is of no bennefit tu ennywun either .
I can sugest a cupl of simpl mesures for reducing this lerning burden verry substantially too .
VC : The danger is that if children are encouraged to think of reading as turning letters into sounds and we change spelling to make this easier , they will forever be reading only as fast as they can speak rather than at the reading speed two or three times greater than speech that fluent readers reach .
We want children to be able to read and understand what they read , not just to read it aloud .
MB : Sweden and Denmark show most clearly what spelling reform can do .
The two languages are very similar and children in those two countries are also educated in similar ways .
Sweden has gradually given itself a fairly sound spelling system .
Denmark has been far more indifferent to the consistency of its orthography .
In international comparisons of literacy standards , the Swedes invariably come near the top .
The Danes are usually nearer the bottom , along with English - speaking countries .
VC : How can spelling reform help silent reading and reading for understanding ?
MB : Logically highly consistent spellings like Finnish or Korean do not hinder silent reading or understanding .
Regular spelling systems merely make getting to this stage much easier and faster .
What spelling reform would do is drastically reduce the time it takes children to learn to read and write , thereby cutting teaching costs and freeing up time for other .
More importantly still , it would reduce our high rate of functional illiteracy which has persisted at around 20 % for at least a century and keeps entailing enormous costs .
In Finland it is just 4 % , in Sweden 8 % and in Germany 10 % .
VC :
The languages that people cite as having simple , desirable spellings are almost invariably those that had their writing system standardised very recently , like the Scandinavian languages in the 19th Century .
As languages grow old their spelling systems apparently drift away from a straight sound - to - letter relationship .
MB : If we could bring ourselves to improve the spellings of just 200 of the most frequently used words that have silly spellings , like " once , only , said " , we would completely transform yung children 's lives and educational progress .
Even just shedding the surplus letters from 100 of them , as in " friend - frend , beautiful - butiful , slow - slo , have - hav " would make initial phonics teaching much easier and mor succesful than it is now .
And a brief look at those words makes it clear that regional differences in pronunciation ar not a barrier to this , and there ar not menny such difrences ennyway .
VC : It is precisely the most frequent words that we do n't need to reform because they can be remembered as wholes .
Surely most pre-reading children can recognise large numbers of such whole , say McDonald 's and Coke signs ?
Learning the 200 words as wholes would equip children to read probably most of the running words in any ordinary sentence ; treating " say " and " does " as weird exception rather than as unique symbols is what may do the damage .
MB : In the 17th Century hundreds of English words wer shorn of their surplus letters [ eg atte - at , worde - word , shoppe - shop} .
We could easily resume such culling again .
But this will not happen until mor people understand how English spelling impedes educational progress , or the costs which this entails .
VC : Spelling reform for English based on links between sounds and letters has to relate to a single accent [ witness the difficulty with Middle English texts spelled in many dialects ] .
This disadvantages once again children with non-standard accents , say those who would naturally spell " bath " as " barf " .
It also cuts accents of English off from each other ; a Londoner would not be able to read Geordie , a person from Sydney a letter from someone in Ottawa .
The cost of any change would be astronomical .
Imagine the number of books in English that would need to be changed .
If they were not changed the children taught by the new system would be effectively cut off from their written heritage .
Imagine the conversion of every computer , every programme written in English .
Here is a selection of your comments .
Making the english language even simpler is a big mistake .
I managed to learn it in half a year while living in America .
But her idea is already happening in internet chatrooms where making words shorter is top priority .
English pronunciation is tough but I would not be helped by saying ennywun .
Also as a high speed reader this would definetly slow me down .
And it doesnt make children more literate it just makes them put speech on paper .
Look at this classic Shakespeare qoute :
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .
Translates to : Som r born grate{or greight ?} , Som achiv gratenes , and som hav greightnes thrust upon tem .
Poetic no ?
Felix Schott , Berlin , Germany Re : " Dumbing down to the lowest common denominator , how awful ! "
Reforms make life easier and that 's not dumbing down it 's smart .
The US adopted decimal dollars hundreds of years ago and the UK clung to pounds - shillings - pence - farthings until 1976 ( ? )
Hardly anyone but older Britons can even imagine how to divide a bill for 7 Pounds , 5 Shillings and five Pence among three diners , or the painful calculations involved .
The system was absurd , and adoption of decimal currency was good for the " lowest common denominator " and everyone else .
There are fast learners and " lowest common denominators " , but it is best if all who can possibly learn to read , do .
We have 20 % functional illiterates , Sweden 8 % .
Which is better for society ?
Iconic systems of writing take years to master .
Alphabetic writing is a brilliant invention that takes about two weeks -- in those languages that respect the principles .
We have allowed English to degenerate so far that we must waste years on it , just like the Egyptians of 2000 BC .
We have wrecked a wonderful tool and should be ashamed .
And fix it .
Alan Mole , Boulder Colorado USA Ms. Bell 's reasoning definitely shows that she has not taken into consideration the universality of the English language .
In a country like Uganda , where I come from and where English is the official language , the word " becoming " can be rendered pronunciations like : " bikaming " , " bekkaming " and " bikaamingi " depending on the tribal and linguistic background of the speaker .
Does that mean that we should have a pronunciation that makes learning easier for every English speaking child , whether native or non-native ?
English has already gone through the evolution of American and British spellings , let that be enough .
English is a universal language and we should let it preserve its common denominator , i.e. its universal spelling .

During a recent holiday in the UK I found myself behind a coach full of teens .
As with all teens , they must have amused themselves writing graffiti on the sooty back of the coach .
Irrespective of the nature of the comments ( we had a good laugh over most of them ) my partner and I were mortified to notice that not a single graffiti had been spelled correctly .
Having learnt English from my father and from reading books ( raised abroad ) , I wondered if the British education system is failing its pupils or whether the pupils are simply not trying hard enough .
It 's not rocket science , for crying out loud , it 's just spelling !
Sandy , Antwerp , Belgium I was one of the unfortunate one 's who was initially taught to read using the ITA spelling system that MB mentions .
I was a prolific reader - and very , very quickly consumed all available books at school and at the public library .
I can still remember my frustration when I could n't read the " normal " children¿s books ( or my Dad¿s Glasgow Herald ! ) .
Such relief when we moved on to real spelling !
I assume this is what it would feel like for someone taught " simplified " English whenever they attempt to read " old English " .
The existence of different dialects makes this suggestion a complete nonsense ¿ though I ¿m sure it could produce a good joke or two ¿
Did you hear about the Scotsman , Englishman and Irishman at the spelling bee ?
It also must be remembered that English has become the most widely adopted language in the world - we can't randomly change it now - what chaos worldwide !
Stephen , Cambridge
We 've been here before with ITA have n't we look what happened to that .
Once you reached 7 or 8 you had to learn the entire English language again this time correctly .
If that was the great success Ms Bell says it was would it not still be in use now ?
Why should we dumb down our language , has n't that happened enough ?

When I first learned about the ' spelling ' class , I was very curious , for we have no such thing in the Japanese education system .
Since Japanese language is always written as it is pronounced , we do not have to master the orders of letters in words , which are often irregular and illogical .
But I feel as if by learning spelling , we are acquiring a special and important ability - an ability to recognise words visually thus almost instantaneously .
Perhaps it is equivalent to the complicated Kanji ( Chinese characters ) system in Japanese .

We teach children how to read , write and add - up , but we do n't teach them how to learn or remember .
There are simple and powerful techniques that could be taught in schools .
The problem is not our language but the Victorian methods we still use to teach it .

Don't forget either that when Germany decided to change some of the spelling rules , it turned out to be catastrophic , some people refused to use them , most of the others did n't really understand when and what they were supposed to change in the original spelling ... and German is a language where spelling and pronunciation are closely linked .
Yann Seal , Marseilles , France I agree that the way many English words are spelt does n't give you any clue to how they should be pronounced ( e.g. tomb ) , which is sometimes bewildering .
Nevertheless I 'm more convinced by Vivian Cook .
And then , if foreign students can cope with it , why should it be a problem for natives ?
Natasha , Moscow , Russia Still not sure how Ms Bells has managed to turn " only " into " onely " , which I kept reading as " won-lee " .
Would n't " ownly " be a better spelling ?
But of course , as soon as you start trying to change things like spelling , you need to have agreement on the new , and who is going to arbitrate ?

I notice that the example you gave , anyone -> ennywun implicitly assumes that we all speak with a southern accent .
Ennywun from the north knows that it should be spelled ennywon .
This highlights the fundamental problem with spelling words phonetically - we all speak differently .
And how exactly does making spelling easier make children ' more literate ' .
Chris , Lyon , France Unsure how changing ' becoming ' to ' becumming ' cannot do anything except cause confusion , cause derision , and provide food from which cruder comedians could feast .
Shall we just leave this one as ' becoming ' ?
paul donnelly , Cambridge Presumably we would have to have different spellings depending on where in the UK you live .
Barth ( south ) or Bath ( north ) , Grasss ( north ) , Grarss ( south ) etc .
Not very sensible .
English is fun like what she is .

Why is it that we always have fall to the lowest common denominator ?
Why can't we have a push to improve standards instead of always catering for those who are too idle to learn the language ?
Some things simply have to be memorised and it would be much better if the education system simply recognised this instead of constantly inventing new ways to ' help ' children learn .
John , Bracknell I found it difficult to understand what Masha Bell was trying to say .
Surely I can't be the only one .
Daniel Smith , London , UK For God 's sake - can't we just raise the standard of education ?
I was the thickie in English classes but I still know how to spell better than anyone under thirty .
Stop the dumbing down !

Text speak and the ' language ' of hip hop music are bad enough .
By Ms Bells reckoning we should actually all be learning Inglish .
Brendan Taggart , Chippenham UK
As others have said , devising a spelling system based on pronunciation is fraught with difficulty and would invariably benefit only those who speak standard English .
As a Sheffielder , the spelling ' poor ' makes much more sense than Ms Bell 's preferred ' por ' ( which to me is a skin feature ) , although spelling the former ' pooer ' would be even better .

What are these ?
Satellites hovering above Egypt have zoomed in on a 1,600 - year - old metropolis , archaeologists say .
Images captured from space pinpoint telltale signs of previous habitation in the swatch of land 200 miles south of Cairo , which digging recently confirmed as an ancient settlement dating from about 400 A.D .
The find is part of a larger project aiming to map as much of ancient Egypt 's archaeological sites , or " tells , " as possible before they are destroyed or covered by modern development .
" It is the biggest site discovered so far , " said project leader Sarah Parcak of the University of Alabama at Birmingham .
" Based on the coins and pottery we found , it appears to be a massive regional center that traded with Greece , Turkey and Libya . "
Another large city dating to 600 B.C. and a monastery from 400 A.D. are some of the four hundred or so sites that Parcak has located during her work with the satellites .
The oldest dates back over 5,000 years .
Egypt contains a wealth of already identified archaeological tells like these , but even they represent only about 0.01 percent of what is out there still uncovered , Parcak said .
Most of the ancient settlements still buried are at risk of being lost to looting and urban sprawl .
Residential sites , where the Egyptian empire 's millions of citizens lived during its heyday , are especially vulnerable , archaeologists say .
" There are thousands of settlements that Egyptians do n't even know are there , " Parcak told LiveScience .
" Nothing will ever destroy the Pyramids or the Temple of Luxor , but these huge settlement sites where we get a lot of information are being threatened .
And that 's how we find out how people lived . "
The satellite technology lets archaeologists such as Parcak — the first to use space imagery in Egypt— identify points of interest on a large scale .
" Basically , I 'm trying to distinguish the ancient remains from the modern landscape , " she said .
" A site is going to appear very differently from space . "
Archaeological sites absorb moisture in a different way , she explained , and tend to be covered with specific types of soil and vegetation .
The subtle differences would take much longer to identify on the ground , said Parcak , so Egypt 's government uses her catalog to identify sites and excavate there before development takes over and destroys the site for good .

FOR intriguing evidence of the way Japan 's 127 m people are greying faster than any others on earth , look at the boom in pokkuri dera .
Pokkuri is an onomatopoeic word for a sudden bursting , while a tera or dera is a Buddhist temple .
Pokkuri dera , then , are shrines where many of Japan 's older people go to pray not only for the long life that they are increasingly coming to expect , but also for a quick and painless death at the end of it .
Their visits have revived the fortunes of old - established temples , notably in the ancient capitals of Kyoto and Nara , while temples elsewhere have reinvented themselves as pokkuri dera with the financial blessings in mind .
More dramatic evidence of the ageing effect may come with nationwide elections on July 29th .
Japan 's older voters have the ability , for probably the first time in democratic history , to humiliate and even bring down a government , that of Shinzo Abe , prime minister since September 2006 .
The elections are for half the seats in the upper house of the Diet ( parliament ) , and are ordinarily something of a political sideshow : after all , it is the lower house that chooses the prime minister .
A general election in 2005 gave the ruling coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) an easy majority .
Yet these elections , in which the coalition may lose its upper - house majority , have become a vote of confidence in Mr Abe , whose poll ratings have slithered since almost the moment he came to office .
While the prime minister 's priorities are patriotic ones — instilling a sense of national pride in schoolchildren and pushing for a revision of Japan 's pacifist constitution — those of ordinary Japanese lie with bread - and - butter issues .
The economy is now into its fifth year of recovery after a decade - long slump , but decent jobs are still short .
As for pensions , everyone knows that a shrinking workforce supporting an ever higher number of retired people adds to an already strained budget .
In this context , a fiasco that was uncovered in May at the government agency that handles pensions could not have come at a worse time for Mr Abe .
The agency , which appears never to have come to terms with the digital age , is unable to match 50 m computerised pension records to people who have paid into public schemes .
A further 14 m records , it seems , never made it into the computer system at all .
If disgruntled voters punish the ruling coalition on July 29th with a heavy loss of seats , then the LDP may seek a new leader .
If Mr Abe survives as prime minister , he will be under pressure to form a government of a different hue , one that brings livelihood issues to the fore .
Either way , grey power will have established itself as a force to be reckoned with .
Certainly Japan is greying at an astonishing rate .
Shortly after the second world war the proportion of Japanese over 65 was around 5 % of the population , easily below that in Britain , France or America .
Today the elderly account for one - fifth of the population , and average lifespans have grown remarkably .
Life expectancy today is 82 , up from a little over 50 in 1947 .
By 2015 the proportion of elderly will have risen to one in four of the population , or more than 30 m .
This is thanks mainly to an unusually large baby - boom generation passing into the ranks of the old .
Between 1947 and 1949 , 2.7 m children a year on average were born to surviving Japanese soldiers who returned from war , married and settled down — about a third more than in previous years .
This year , the baby - boom generation began to retire ( at present , 60 is the mandatory retirement age at most companies ) .
The size of their pensions obligations has funding implications both for companies and for government .
But there is another dimension to the baby - boomers ' retirement : these workers drove Japan 's economic transformation of the 1970s and 1980s .
They are a reservoir of technical and managerial skills .
Who to pass these on to ?
Japan 's birth rate fell below the replacement rate of 2.1 in the early 1970s .
It slid to a low of 1.26 in 2005 , before inching up last year to 1.32 — nobody calls it a recovery .
In 2005 Japan 's population began to fall in absolute terms , despite increasing life expectancy .
It is about to shrink at a pace unprecedented for any nation in peacetime .
The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research estimates a total population of 95 m by 2050 , with the elderly accounting by then for two - fifths of the total .
The disappearing young
A shrinking population already has implications for the workforce .
Currently , some 16 m Japanese are in their 20s .
This number will shrink by 3 m over just the next decade .
This spring , during the annual job - recruitment round , new university graduates found themselves in record demand , and not just because of the recovering economy : over the coming years , companies will have fewer young graduates to choose from .
That is nice for young job - seekers , except for one thing : as Japan ages and shrinks , workers must support an ever larger proportion of retirees .
By 2030 , demographers say , Japan will have just two working - age people for each retired one ; by mid-century , short of a rapid and unlikely return to fecundity , the ratio will rise to three for every two retirees .
Can a working population support such a number of future retirees ?
Today 's younger workers appear not to think so .
Two - fifths of them are not paying contributions towards the fixed portion of their state pension scheme ( current contributions fund present , not future retirees ) , suggesting they do n't believe that the scheme will be viable when they retire .
And they may be right .
It is in the countryside that demographic changes hit particularly hard .
There the population has been falling for years , as younger villagers head for the city in search of work and play .
Today , those over 65 account for two out of five people in rural communities , and three - fifths of all farmers .
The future of farming in such places is in doubt .
Growing rice , the staple crop , requires communal efforts in irrigation , flood control and the like .
Mutual obligations in communities run even to organising funerals .
So when young villagers leave for the city , everyone feels the loss .
An earthquake on July 16th in Niigata prefecture brought the problem home ; the 3,000 evacuees still living in shelters are predominantly elderly , unable to fend for themselves in their damaged houses .
The tiny hamlet of Ogama , in Ishikawa prefecture near the Sea of Japan , is responding most radically to population decline .
( The community has three men and six women between the ages of 62 and over 90 , down from a population of 50 a generation ago . )
The survivors of this remote and stunning valley have canvassed an industrial - waste company from Tokyo and , if the prefecture approves , the valley — paddy fields , vegetable plots and cedarwood plantations — will disappear under 150 metres ( 500 feet ) of industrial ash .
The villagers plan to use the money from the sale to build new houses in the nearby township , to where the ancestral shrine has already been moved .
For years , the regions have brought their problems to the capital .
On any working day in Tokyo , the corridors of the transport and infrastructure ministry are thronged with supplicants from the provinces clutching maps of the latest scheme for a road into the forest or an unnecessary dam .
Yet the days of lavish spending on public works are nearly over , while the central government has slashed tax remittances to localities .
With pinched resources and the prospect of steep falls in the population , local governments are being forced into the most radical reorganisation in half a century .
A couple of much - publicised municipal bankruptcies have helped sharpen minds .
Yubari , a former mining town on the northern island of Hokkaido , has seen its population fall from 100,000 in the 1950s to 13,000 today .
Costly promotions to raise the town 's profile — including a film festival and the marketing of Japan 's priciest melons — have saddled the town with a crippling ¥ 63 billion ( $ 519 m ) in debts .
Last year Yubari was declared insolvent .
No nearby municipalities particularly want to be Yubari 's friend , but elsewhere the central government is urging villages and towns to merge in order to pool resources and gain a more secure tax base .
Yamanashi prefecture south - west of Tokyo , a place of peach orchards and factories making industrial robots , exemplifies the trend .
In 1888 Yamanashi had 342 administrative units ; today , it has shrunk to 28 municipalities and is still declining .
The pace has quickened greatly since 2003 .
But municipal mergers are unlikely to be the end of the matter .
Prefectural leaders and central government are talking about a radical rehaul of local government in which prefectures merge to form larger blocks — states , in essence .
Before this dance has begun , prefectures are already eyeing up the most attractive partners .
To shrink a city
Elsewhere , administrators are starting to think about the implications of population decline , among other things , on running bigger cities .
Aomori , a city of 300,000 at the very top of Honshu , Japan 's main island , has a policy of actively stemming the urban sprawl that blights so much of Japan .
Aomori has a proportion of elderly and single households somewhat above the national average .
It also has huge quantities of winter snow , thanks to the moisture that Siberian winds pick up across the Sea of Japan : ten metres can fall in a season .
In a bad year snow - clearing can cost ¥3 billion : a sum which Takeshi Nakamura of the city government says could build two new schools .
In response , the municipal government set about trying to shrink the city .
A limiting arc was drawn around its south side ( the north is bounded by a wide bay ) , and some of the city 's main institutions — the library , city market , hospitals and museums — were moved back to the middle of town .
Public transport was improved , and snow was cleared from main arteries as well as pedestrian streets to allow people to move easily about the centre .
The improvements , in turn , have encouraged new apartment blocks to be built near the centre , says Mr Nakamura , and plenty of older people tired of shovelling snow are moving into them .
Aomori's ideas about a “ compact city ” have been driven by the problems of snow .
All the same , says Takatoshi Ito of Tokyo University , who sits on Mr Abe 's Council for Economic and Fiscal Policy , the central government should be urging other cities to think along similar lines .
Population decline does not mean there is no urban sprawl .
Mariko Fujiwara of the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living points out that the number of one - person households will overtake all other types this year , while the total number of households is still rising in Japan , to almost 50m .
Kaisha care
Still , the greatest response to demographic change in Japan needs to come from companies .
Despite wrenching change over the past 15 years or so , the Japanese company , or kaisha , still plays a more paternal part in employees ' lives than in any other well - off society , shaping not just their work but also their social life .
Indeed , with long hours in the office as well as punishing sessions in bars with colleagues afterwards , the two are often indistinguishable .
Atsushi Seike , a labour economist at Keio University , argues that Japan 's problem is less that demography is changing too fast , than that employment and retirement systems designed for an earlier age are not changing fast enough .
In particular , these systems have not kept pace with greatly longer lives .
True , the government has begun to raise the age at which people are eligible for employee pensions , which are made up of fixed and earnings - related parts .
Eligibility for the fixed part has been raised to 62 , and will climb to 65 by 2014 ; eligibility for the bigger , earnings - related part rises to 65 by 2026 .
This is too little , too slow .
Mr Seike argues that the state minimum pensionable age should be raised swiftly to 70 .
Meanwhile , companies are also adjusting too slowly .
Most firms have a mandatory retirement age of just 60 .
A recent law requires them either to raise their mandatory retirement age over time , or to provide retraining and re-employment programmes to keep on employees .
Most have opted for the latter ; since most companies have formal pay scales that reward seniority over merit , raising the mandatory retirement age would be expensive .
However , one big company , Kawasaki Heavy Industries , has broken new ground : in 2009 , it will raise mandatory retirement to 63 while slashing pay .
Getting rid of mandatory retirement altogether would hasten the end of seniority - based pay , allowing older workers ( who in Japan are eager to work for longer ) to fill jobs for which they are best suited .
A system based more on merit would give able younger workers a leg - up too .
Raising the retirement age to 70 would roughly halve the rate of decline in the workforce .
Raising the participation rate of women — at 63 % of working - age women , below Britain or America ( around 68 % ) — would do much to slow it further .
A number of factors militate against working women .
A higher proportion of women than men find jobs only on temporary contracts , which pay on average 60 % less than regular work .
Male chauvinism still dominates in the office : many jobs are advertised as available only to younger women , while fewer than 10 % of professional managers are women , against 46 % in America .
Meanwhile , companies ' long hours ( often a substitute for productivity ) make things hard for working mothers .
So too does a shortage of child care : just a third of children over three and under school age go to kindergarten , compared with an OECD average of three - quarters .
Huge numbers of women drop out of the workforce entirely once they have children .
In Japan , says Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo , women have to choose between work and family .
Meanwhile , the OECD notes a positive correlation between fertility and female employment : the easier it is made for women to do rewarding work , the more likely they are to consider having children .
So policymakers in Japan are now starting to grapple with the effect of Japanese work habits on the low birth rate .
Hideki Yamada , director for policy on ageing and fertility in the Cabinet Office , says surveys suggest that nine - tenths of Japanese aged 18 - 34 not only want to get married , but often want to have two children .
With Japanese precision , policymakers have calculated that without impediments to marriage and child - raising , Japan 's birth rate would jump to 1.75 .
Policy , says Mr Yamada , should be directed towards making that leap .
Attempts began under Mr Abe 's predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , with the introduction of financial support for families with young children and expansion of child - care facilities .
Now a novel concept is creeping into government documents , “ the work - life balance ” , for which , tellingly , there is no common Japanese expression .
In late July , business and union leaders met Mr Abe and other ministers to discuss how to reach such a balance .
“ It 's embarrassing to say this , ” admits Mr Yamada , “ but after a first child is born , the husband often does n't do his bit helping out at home , and that engenders anxiety in the wife about having a second child . ”
That is partly cultural habit .
Boys are pampered at home by their mothers and expect the same treatment — no nappy - changing , no washing up — later from their wives .
But it is also because of the long working hours companies expect .
So , says Kuniko Inoguchi , minister for gender issues and social affairs under Mr Koizumi , policy needs not only to be directed towards encouraging more women to work , with more nursing care for elderly relatives , better child care , more flexible working arrangements and so on .
It also needs to make life better for working men .
A better work - life balance is good for companies , which can thereby attract better talent .
It is also good for working men , says Mrs Inoguchi .
They can enjoy a proper private life , spending more time at home — always assuming , and it is no foregone conclusion , that Japanese wives are prepared to tolerate them there .

Like many Americans , we have put off that conclusion , waiting for a sign that President Bush was seriously trying to dig the United States out of the disaster he created by invading Iraq without sufficient cause , in the face of global opposition , and without a plan to stabilize the country afterward .
At first , we believed that after destroying Iraq ’s government , army , police and economic structures , the United States was obliged to try to accomplish some of the goals Mr. Bush claimed to be pursuing , chiefly building a stable , unified Iraq .
When it became clear that the president had neither the vision nor the means to do that , we argued against setting a withdrawal date while there was still some chance to mitigate the chaos that would most likely follow .
While Mr. Bush scorns deadlines , he kept promising breakthroughs — after elections , after a constitution , after sending in thousands more troops .
But those milestones came and went without any progress toward a stable , democratic Iraq or a path for withdrawal .
It is frighteningly clear that Mr. Bush ’s plan is to stay the course as long as he is president and dump the mess on his successor .
Whatever his cause was , it is lost .
When Mike Gravel , former Senator from Alaska was on the stage in South Carolina this week , he said some amazing things .

But as Mike Gravel said , their lives were lost in vain , and the soldiers in Iraq are also dying in vain .
What does it take for people to understand that Mike Gravel is telling the truth and that he is the ONLY one that is telling the truth !
What does it take for the American public to learn to think for themselves and not let people on the television tell them how to think ?
When will people learn to stand up and say that they liked what Senator Gravel had to say and that he should not be trivialized and laughed at , because he is the only one telling the truth ?

Is it because he dares to tell the American public what nobody else has told them because they are afraid to speak the truth ?
Are you going to ignore this man because he hit the nail right on the head because he dared to talk back to the media and more than that , to talk back to this government ?
Is he â€œfunnyâ€ because he said that everything in this country is being run by the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about in his farewell speech when he left office in 1954 ?

Well the fact is my fellow Americans , these powers have control of this country and Mike Gravel was not being â€œfunnyâ€ , he was telling us the truth .
He told us the truth last week and it scared America so badly that they had to write it off as â€œfunnyâ€ .
The truth is that if you think about what he said , and actually look at what has happened to this once good and loving nation , it isnâ€™t funny at all .
In fact , itâ€™s enough to make you cry .
Itâ€™s enough to make you cry and fill you with rage at the same time .
This man doesnâ€™t need to be out on the campaign trail in his later years giving speeches and riding on buses .
He could be home playing with his grandchildren and taking it easy , but instead heâ€™s on a stage telling us the truth and these witless bastards on television think heâ€™s â€œfunnyâ€ .
I suppose that the estimates of 600,000 dead in Iraq and over 35,000 badly injured men and women from our armed forces is â€œfunnyâ€ too .
All I have to say is that Mike Gravel isnâ€™t â€œfunnyâ€ at all .
If you listen , really listen to him , you will cry .
If you donâ€™t , you donâ€™t realize what is happening to this country .
If you think that heâ€™s just a â€œfunnyâ€ man , you had better look inside of your heart and take a really good inventory , because something is wrong with you , and thatâ€™s not funny .

Syria hosts the largest number of Iraqi refugees
But it insisted the solution to the problem lay in their return home and that the Iraqi government was directly responsible for its displaced citizens .
The UN refugee agency , UNHCR , said some 50,000 more Iraqis were escaping the violence in their homeland each month .
Most are ending up in Jordan and Syria , which want help to ease the burden .
The UNHCR said the wave of displacement sparked by the war in Iraq was the biggest in the Middle East since 1948 , when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the newly created Israel .
A final statement at the end of the conference , which was attended by Iraq 's neighbours , as well as the UN , US and UK , called on the international community to provide all possible support to the Iraqi people .
It also insisted countries hosting refugees were given assistance " so that they can continue to provide an adequate level of services to Iraqi nationals " , particularly in health and education .
The host countries should have the authority to regulate the entry and residence of Iraqi nationals " in line with their law and considerations " , the statement added .
But the conference stopped short of addressing calls by Jordan and Syria earlier in the day for rich western nations to take in greater numbers of refugees .
The Iraqi government said it would make available a promised $ 25 m for those straining under the load of the burgeoning numbers of refugees .
' Real humanitarian crisis '
Earlier , the secretary - general of the Iraqi foreign ministry , Muhammad Hajj Hamoud , said the refugee problem should not be underestimated .
We have lost [ our ] house , we are lost , my daughter is lost , my son [ is ] lost ... help this family please
Najla Abda Karim Saleh
Iraqi refugee in Jordan
He added that efforts to stem the flow of refugees by Iraq 's neighbours - who now impose tougher entry restrictions - resulted in cases of mistreatment at border crossings .
One refugee in Jordan , Najla Abda Karim Saleh , fled with her son and daughter .
Another daughter was killed in sectarian violence .
She told the BBC she wanted help from the UN to bring her four grandchildren to safety in Amman , the Jordanian capital .
" We have lost [ our ] house , we are lost , my daughter is lost , my son [ is ] lost ... help this family please , " she wept .
Violence forces thousands of Iraqis to flee their homes every month
The secretary - general of the Jordanian interior ministry , Mukhaimar Abu Jamous , told the summit that western countries had " relinquished their responsibility in shouldering the Iraqi refugee burden " and urged them to resettle the largest number possible .
The Syrian ambassador to Jordan , Milad Attiya , said the international community " must be involved , especially the United States because its policy led to the plight the Iraqis are currently in and it bears responsibility " .
Although the US government announced earlier in the year that it would allow 7,000 Iraqis into the US by the end of September , it has allowed in just 133 over the past nine months because of stringent security measures .
Craig Johnstone , the UN deputy high commissioner for refugees , called for international assistance , since Syria and Jordan had few resources to cope with the influx .
" The international community , I think , has neglected the plight of the refugees from Iraq so far , but they are beginning to act , " he told the BBC .
UNHCR says it hopes to find a permanent home for a total of 20,000 Iraqi exiles by the end of the year .
That pimply faced teenage fry cook at McDonald ’s will soon be serving up more than a greasy treat .
The oil that clogs your arteries and sizzles your fries will soon be used to power McDonald ’s trucks .
The fast food giant has decided to start powering its trucks on biodiesel made from its own waste oil .
Do n’t expect to smell the sweet smell of french fries heading down the highway just yet , McDonaldâ€™s plans on running 155 of it ’s delivery trucks on biodiesel made from its own cooking oil , but only in the UK .
The red and yellow bloater of waste lines , currently runs its UK trucks on B5 ( 95 % diesel and 5 % biodiesel ) , will initially use a blend of 85 per cent biodiesel and 15 per cent rapeseed oil .
The move is most likely a result of the pounding groups like Greenpeace have been giving the company over the years .
A year ago , after a sustained campaign by Greenpeace , McDonaldâ€™s agreed to stop using soya from newly deforested land in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil .
This year , it started selling coffee certified by the Rainforest Alliance in its UK restaurants , a move that it says boosted sales by 10 per cent .
Just goes to show you , give the customer what they want and your profits will go up .
Matthew Howe , manager of McDonaldâ€™s UK supply chain , said the cost of using biodiesel was expected to be the same as the restaurant groupâ€™s diesel costs in the long term .
â€ œIn the short term , we think it will cost a little bit more , â€  he said , adding this extra cost could amount to â€œa couple of pennies a litreâ€ .
It ’s a pretty good idea from a logistics standpoint , they currently throw out about 6 million liters of cooking oil every year , and use about 6.1 million liters of diesel in their trucks every year .
I wonder why they did n’t make this mental leap sooner .
The home of the scary clown will collect oil from 900 of its 1,200 UK outlets each week , take it to a separation tank in East Anglia , and then on to a biodiesel conversion plant in central England .
McDonaldâ€™s said the net effect of the scheme would be a 78 % reduction in its carbon emissions .
The smell of McDonald ’s delivery trucks pumping out the rather hard to ignore smell of french fries will also most likely result in an increase in McDonald ’s fry sales .
So a double bonus for the company .
Francesca DeBiase , McDonaldâ€™s chief supply chain officer said the groupâ€™s European operation was an â€œearly warning systemâ€ for the US .
We might be soon seeing biodiesel McDonald ’s trucks scooting around the streets of America .
Let ’s hope so .
The proportion of babies with at least one parent born overseas rose from a fifth to a quarter between July 2001 and 2006 , according to the Office for National Statistics office ( ONS ) .
A spokesman said : " We have figures for the contribution of mothers and fathers born abroad , and that has risen slightly , from under 20 % in 2001 to slightly over 25 % now .
" That reflects the cumulative effect of immigration over the last 40 years . "
The overall population rose by 349,000 ( 0.6 % ) to 60,587,000 between mid-2005 and mid-2006 , the figures indicated .
This was slightly smaller than the 393,000 increase the previous year .
The overall number of births in the year to mid-2006 was 734,000 , up from 718,000 the previous year .
This latest figure was 71,000 more than in 2001 .
The ONS attributed the rise to an increase in births to both UK - and foreign - born mothers .
The evidence suggested the trend would continue , the spokesman added .
The flow of migrants into the UK in the year to mid-2006 was 574,000 , 25,000 lower than in the previous year .
But a record 385,000 people migrated from the UK last year - the highest number since current counting methods were introduced in 1991 and 49,000 more people than in the previous year .
The statistics also showed the proportion of older people in the UK continuing to rise .
Record numbers of people were aged over 85 after a 6 % increase to 1,243,000 .
The number of people of retirement age also rose by 1 % to 11,344,000 .
The five local authorities in England and Wales that experienced the greatest increase in population between 2001 and 2006 were Westminster and Camden , in London , South Northamptonshire , Forest Heath and Rutland .
They all saw their populations swell by at least 11 % over the period .
I’VE always enjoyed filling our home with family guests , but when a special event brought together our extended clan recently , a new wrinkle emerged .
“ Do you mind , ” one in - law asked , as I rounded up bedding and fretted over having enough milk in the fridge to fill 12 cereal bowls in the morning , “ if I just pop onto the computer and check my e-mail ? ”
“ Oh , yeah , ” remarked another .
“ Maybe I could just track my son ’s flight from D.C. ”
“ Ooh , perhaps you could print something out for me ... ”
That was my first inkling of how the vastly expanded electronic and informational needs of houseguests would flavor our time together .
Soon guests were positioning themselves to get dibs on one of the three computers in our Long Island house the way they would otherwise line up to jump in the shower .
This article presents the algorithm that solves the Byzantine General ’s Problem , as first described by Lamport , Pease , and Shostak in 1982 [ 1 ] .
While Lamport ’s algorithm is not particularly complex , programmers who are n’t used to working on distributed computation might find it difficult to implement .
To accompany the explanation of the algorithm , I have included a C++ program designed for experimentation with the solution .
Introduction
The Byzantine General ’s Problem is one of many in the field of agreement protocols .
In 1982 , Leslie Lamport described this problem in a paper written with Marshall Pease and Robert Shostak .
Lamport framed his paper around a story problem after observing what he felt was an inordinate amount of attention received by Dijkstra ’s Dining Philosophers problem [ 2 ] .
This problem is built around an imaginary General who makes a decision to attack or retreat , and must communicate the decision to his lieutenants .
A given number of these actors are traitors ( possibly including the General . )
Traitors cannot be relied upon to properly communicate orders ; worse yet , they may actively alter messages in an attempt to subvert the process .
When we ’re not dwelling in storybook land , the generals are collectively known as processes , the general who initiates the order is the source process , and the orders sent to the other processes are messages .
Traitorous generals and lieutenants are faulty processes , and loyal generals and lieutenants are correct processes .
The order to retreat or attack is a message with a single bit of information : a one or a zero .
In general , a solution to an agreement problem must pass three tests : termination , agreement , and validity .
As applied to the Byzantine General ’s problem , these three tests are :
A solution has to guarantee that all correct processes eventually reach a decision regarding the value of the order they have been given .
All correct processes have to decide on the same value of the order they have been given .
If the source process is a correct process , all processes have to decide on the value that was original given by the source process .
Note that one interesting side effect of this is that if the source process is faulty , all other processes still have to agree on the same value .
It does n’t matter what value they agree on , they simply all have to agree .
So if the General is subversive , all lieutenants still have to come to a common , unanimous decision .
Difficulties
This agreement problem does n’t lend itself to an easy naive solution .
Imagine , for example , that the source process is the only faulty process .
It tells half the processes that the value of their order is zero , and the other half that their value is one .
After receiving the order from the source process , the remaining processes have to agree on a value that they will all decide on .
The processes could quickly poll one another to see what value they received from the source process .
In this scenario , imagine the decision algorithm of a process which receives an initial message of zero from the source process , but sees that one of the other processes says that the correct value is one .
Given the conflict , the process knows that either the source process is faulty , having given different values to two different peers , or the peer is faulty , and is lying about the value it received from the source process .
It ’s fine to reach the conclusion that someone is lying , but making a final decision on who is the traitor seems to be an insurmountable problem .
And in fact it can be proven that it is impossible to decide in some cases .
The classic example used to show this is when there are only three processes : one source process and two peer processes .
In the two configurations shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 , the peer processes attempt to reach consensus by sending each other their proposed value after receiving it from the source process .
In Figure 1 , the source process ( P 1 ) is faulty , sending two different values to the peers .
In Figure 2 , P 3 is faulty , sending an incorrect value to the peer .
You can see the difficulty P 2 faces in this situation .
Regardless of which configuration it is in , the incoming data is the same .
He has no way to distinguish between the two configurations , and no way to know which of the two other processes to trust .
Figure 1
The case in which the source process is faulty
Figure 2
The case in which P 3 is faulty
This situation does n’t necessarily get better just by throwing more non-faulty processes at the problem .
A naive algorithm as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 might have each process tell every other process what it received from P 1 .
A process would then decide on the correct value by taking a simple majority of the values in its incoming messages .
Under the rules of this approach , it is easy to show that regardless of how many processes are in the system , a subversive source process with one collaborator can cause half the processes to choose to attack , while half the processes elect to retreat , leading to maximum confusion .
The Lamport , Pease and Shostak Algorithm
In 1982 , Lamport , Pease , and Shostak published a fairly simple solution to this problem .
The algorithm assumes that there are n processes , with m faulty processes , where n > 3 m .
Thus , for a scenario such as that in Figure 1 and 2 with 1 faulty process , there would have to be a minimum of 4 processes in the system to come to agreement .
( For the rest of this article , n will always refer to the count of processes , and m will always refer to the number of faulty processes . )
The definition of the algorithm in the original paper is short and succinct , but at least in my experience , is somewhat confusing for programmers without a lot of experience in distributed algorithms .
Lamport ’s algorithm is a recursive definition , with a base case for m=0 , and a recursive step for m > 0 :
Algorithm OM(0 )
The general sends his value to every lieutenant .
Each lieutenant uses the value he receives from the general .
Algorithm OM ( m ) , m > 0
The general sends his value to each lieutenant .
For each i , let v i be the value lieutenant i receives from the general .
Lieutenant i acts as the general in Algorithm OM ( m - 1 ) to send the value v i to each of the n - 2 other lieutenants .
For each i , and each j≠i , let v i be the value lieutenant i received from lieutenant j in step 2 ( using Algorithm ( m - 1 ) ) .
Lieutenant i uses the value majority ( v 1 , v 2 , … v n ) .<>
Lamport 's Algorithm Definition
To most programmers , this is going to look like a conventional recursive function definition , but it does n’t quite fit into the mold you learned when studying the example of factorial ( n ) .
Lamport ’s algorithm actually works in two stages .
In the first step , the processes iterate through m+1 rounds of sending and receiving messages .
In the second stage of the algorithm , each process takes all the information it has been given and uses it to come up with its decision .
I found this to be non-obvious without quite a bit of study , which is the reason for this article .
The First Stage
The first stage of the algorithm is simply one of data gathering .
The algorithm defines m+1 rounds of messaging between all the processes .
In round 0 , the General sends the order to all of its lieutenants .
Having completed his work , the General now retires and stands by idly waiting for the remaining work to complete .
Nobody sends any additional messages to the General , and the General wo n’t send any more messages .
In each of the remaining rounds , each lieutenant composes a batch of messages , each of which is a tuple containing a value and a path .
The value is simply a 1 or a 0 .
The path is a string of process ids , < ID 1 , ID 2 , … ID n >.
What the path means in this context is that in Round N , PID N is saying that was told in round N - 1 that P IDN - 1 was told by P ID1 that the command value was v.
( This is very much like the classic party game in which a message is whispered from ear to ear through a chain of players , becoming slightly mangled along the way . )
No path can contain a cycle .
In other words , if ID1 is 1 , no other ID in the string of process IDs will be a 1 .
The message definition is easy in round 1 .
Each process broadcasts a message to all the other processes , including itself , but excluding the General , with the value it received from the General and its own process ID .
In subsequent rounds , things get more complicated .
Each process takes all the messages it received from the previous round , appends its process ID where allowed , and sends those messages to all other processes , including itself .
( The “ where allowed ” just means that the process skips any messages where adding its process ID to the list would create a cycle in the string of process IDs . )
For example , let ’s suppose that in Round 0 that P 1 , a faulty general told P 2 , P 3 , and P 4 that the command value was 0 , and told P 5 , P 6 , and P 7 that the command value was 1 .
In round 1 , the following messages would be sent :
Sender=P 2 Sender=P 3 Sender=P 4 Sender=P 5 Sender=P 6 Sender=P 7 Dest Msg Dest Msg Dest Msg Dest Msg Dest Msg Dest Msg P 2 { 0,12} P 2 { 0,13} P 2 { 0,14} P 2 { 1,15} P 2 { 1,16} P 2 { 1,17} P 3 { 0,12} P 3 { 0,13} P 3 { 0,14} P 3 { 1,15} P 3 { 1,16} P 3 { 1,17} P 4 { 0,12} P 4 { 0,13} P 4 { 0,14} P 4 { 1,15} P 4 { 1,16} P 4 { 1,17} P 5 { 0,12} P 5 { 0,13} P 5 { 0,14} P 5 { 1,15} P 5 { 1,16} P 5 { 1,17} P 6 { 0,12} P 6 { 0,13} P 6 { 0,14} P 6 { 1,15} P 6 { 1,16} P 6 { 1,17} P 7 { 0,12} P 7 { 0,13} P 7 { 0,14} P 7 { 1,15} P 7 { 1,16} P 7 { 1,17} Table 1 — Messages sent by all six lieutenant processes in round 1
The number of messages goes up in in the second round .
From the previous iteration , we know that each process now has six values that it received in the previous round — one message from each of the six other non-source processes — and it needs to send each of those messages to all of the other processes , which might mean each process would send 36 messages out .
In the previous table I showed the messages being sent to all six processes , which is fairly redundant , since the same messages are broadcast to all processes .
For round 2 , I ’ll just show you the set of messages that each process sends to all of its neighbors .
Sender=P 2 Sender=P 3 Sender=P 4 Sender=P 5 Sender=P 6 Sender=P 7 { 0,132}
{ 0,142}
{ 1,152}
{ 1,162}
{ 1,172} { 0,123}
{ 0,143}
{ 1,153}
{ 1,163}
{ 1,173} { 0,124}
{ 0,134}
{ 1,154}
{ 1,164}
{ 1,174} { 0,125}
{ 0,135}
{ 0,145}
{ 1,165}
{ 1,175} { 0,126}
{ 0,136}
{ 0,146}
{ 1,156}
{ 1,176} { 0,127}
{ 0,137}
{ 0,147}
{ 1,157}
{ 1,167} Table 2 — Messages sent by all six processes in round 2
The six messages that P 2 received in round 1 were { 0,12} , { 0,13} , { 0,14} , { 1,15} , { 1,16} , and { 1,17} .
According to the earlier definition , P 2 will append its process ID to the path and forward each resulting message to all other processes .
The possible messages it could broadcast in round 2 are { 0,122} , { 0,132} , { 0,142} , { 1,152} , { 1,162} , and { 1,172} .
The first message , { 0,122} contains a cycle in the path value of the tuple , so it is tossed out , leaving five messages to be sent to all processes .
The first message that P 2 is sending in round 2 , { 0,132} , is equivalent to saying “ P 2 is telling you that in round 1 P 3 told it that in round 0 that P 1 ( the General ) told it that the value was 0 ” .
The five messages shown in P 2 ’s column in the table are sent to all six lieutenant processes , include itself .
It ’s easy to see that as the number of processes increases , the number of messages being exchanged starts to go up rapidly .
If there are N processes , each process sends N - 1 messages in round 1 , then ( N - 1 ) · ( N - 2 ) in round 2 , ( N - 1 ) · ( N - 2 ) · ( N - 3 ) in round 3 .
That can add up to a lot of messages in a big system .
The Second Stage
While sending messages in each round , processes are also accumulating incoming messages .
The messages are stored in a tree format , with each round of messages occupying one rank of the tree .
Figure 3 shows the layout of the tree for a simple configuration with six processes , one of which can be faulty .
Since m=1 , there are just two rounds of messaging : the first , in which the general sends a value to each lieutenant process , and a second , in which each process broadcasts its value to all the other processes .
Two rounds of messaging are equivalent to two ranks in the tree .
Each node in the tree has three elements : an input value , a path , and an output value .
The input value and path are defined in the first stage of the algorithm - they are simply the messages received from the peer processes .
The output value is left undetermined until the second stage of the algorithm , which I am defining here .
Note that in the figure below , the output values are initially set to ‘?’ , indicating that they are presently unknown .
Figure 3 — The Tree Layout for 5 processes with 1 faulty process
In Figure 3 , there are six processes , and the General ( P 1 ) is faulty — sending a 1 to the first three lieutenants and 0 to the last two .
The subsequent round of messaging results in P 2 having an information tree that looks just like that shown in Figure 3 .
( Because only the General is faulty , in this case all other processes will have an identical tree . )
Once a process has completed building its tree , it is ready to decide on a value .
It does this by working its way up from the leaves of the tree , calculating the majority value at each rank and assigning it to the rank above it .
The output value at each level is the third item in the data structure attached to each node , and those values are all undefined during the information gathering stage .
Calculating the output values is a three step process :
Each leaf node in the tree ( all values at rank m ) copies its input value to the output value .
Starting at rank m - 1 and working down to 0 , the output value of each internal node is set to be the majority of the output values of all its children .
In the event of a tie , an arbitrary tie - breaker is used to assign a default value .
The same default value must be used by all processes .
When complete , the process has a decision value in the output of the sole node at rank 0 .
In Figure 3 , step 1 of the process assigns the initial values to the leaf nodes .
In the next step , the majority value of { 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 } is evaluated and returns a value of 1 , which is assigned to the output value in rank 0 .
Because that is the top rank , the process is done , and P 1 decides on a value of 1 .
Every lieutenant value in a given exercise will have the same paths for all its nodes , and in this case , since only the General is faulty , we know that all lieutenants will have the same input values on all its leaves .
As a result , all processes will agree on the same value , 1 , which fulfills the agreement property .
A More Complicated Example
Getting a good understanding of the algorithm really requires walking through an example that has at least three ranks .
( Examples on the web , mostly extracted from lecture notes , nearly always have the simple two - rank example . )
For this example , consider an example with n=7 and m=2 .
We ’ll continue with the convention that the General is P 1 , and instead of having a faulty general , we ’ll have P 6 and P 7 be faulty processes .
After the initial three rounds of information exchange , we have the three - ranked tree shown in Figure 4 :
Figure 4 — A tree with n=7 , m=2 , and faulty processes P 6 and P 7
The important thing to note in these trees is that I ’ve inserted the value ‘ X ’ for the input values of any input value that comes from the two faulty processes .
We do n’t know what P 6 and P 7 might send in any given round , so in general , we ’ll try to work through the algorithm without constricting their incorrect messages to any specific values .
You ’ll see that at rank 1 , the values from path 17 and 16 are both set to X .
In the first round the two faulty processes communicated possibly false values to all other processes , and may have arbitrarily changed the values sent to different processes in order to skew the results .
As a result of those bad values in rank 1 , we see their frequent occurrence in rank 2 .
The incorrect values show up not only in direct messages from the faulty processes , but also in any message from a correct process that includes a faulty process earlier in its path .
All in all , at the leaf nodes , we have 18 deceptive values at the leaf nodes , and only 12 accurate messages that trace their way all the way back to the general through nothing but correct processes .
Obviously , if we just voted on the majority of the messages we had received , we would be susceptible to falling for the wrong value .
Fortunately , the layout of the tree guarantees that we will actually get a correct value .
In Figure 4 , the roll up of the output values has n’t occurred yet , so every node has a question mark in the output value .
In Figure 5 , the output values are shown .
The leaf rank has the output values set to the input values , with X used to indicate unknown values from faulty processes .
When the leaf rank is rolled up to the second rank , the nodes with paths 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 all have clear majority values of 0 for their output values , with 16 and 17 set to X , as their values are uncertain .
The final roll up to the top rank successfully sets the output value to 0 , as four of the inputs are set to 0 and only 2 are set to X. Mission accomplished .
And because of the way this was calculated , we know that the correct result will be achieved regardless of what deceptive values are sent by the two faulty processes .
Figure 5 — The tree after calculating the output values
The Sample Code
I ’ve included a simple C++ program that implements this algorithm , with extensive internal documentation .
It has a Process class that is used to send and receive messages , as well as to roll up the decision tree .
A Traits class is used to define the number of processes , the number of faulty processes , the source process , and what values the faulty processes send in various rounds .
To help with visualization , the program will output the tree for a given process in the format used by dot , part of the free Graphviz program .
You can then use dot to create a nice picture of the output graph — all the figures in this article were created that way .
I find that using the SVG format for the output produces very readable results .
As supplied , the program is set for values of n=7 and m=2 .
Good exercises to perform while experimenting with it include :
Attempt to invalidate the program or the algorithm by getting incorrect results with some particular combination of faulty messages .
Add a third faulty process and show that it is relatively easy to get invalid output when n=7 and m=2 .
and .
Reduce n to 6 and show that it is relatively easy to get invalid output with two faulty processes .
to 6 and show that it is relatively easy to get invalid output with two faulty processes .
Move up to m=3 and n=10 .
Experiment with various combinations of faulty Generals and lieutenants and see if you can create incorrect results .
Note
Most implementations of this algorithm include logic designed to deal with the case in which a faulty process fails to send a message .
This is equivalent to simply having the faulty process send an arbitrary value , so I do n’t treat it as a separate case .

Feingold : Censure Bush , Cheney for ' their repeated assaults on the rule of law ' David Edwards
Published : Sunday July 22 , 2007 Print This Email This Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , is calling on Congress to censure President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other administration officials for " misconduct relating to the war in Iraq and for their repeated assaults on the rule of law . "
" Censure is about holding the administration accountable ,  Feingold said in a press release sent to RAW STORY .
" Congress needs to formally condemn the President and members of the administration for misconduct before and during the Iraq war , and for undermining the rule of law at home .
Censure is not a cure for the devastating toll this administrations actions have taken on this country .
But when future generations look back at the terrible misconduct of this administration , they need to see that a co-equal branch of government stood up and held to account those who violated the principles on which this nation was founded . "
Feingold announced his intention to censure Bush and Cheney on Sunday 's edition of Meet the Press , and in a diary posted at the popular Daily Kos community blog .
" While I still am not convinced that Congress should pursue impeachment , you made some great points about how important it is to hold this administration accountable for its terrible misconduct , " Feingold wrote to the Daily Kos community .
" That includes tough oversight by Congress , but we should do more than that .
The history books should show that Congress formally condemned this President , and others in the administration who have so brazenly misled the American people and undercut the rule of law . "
On Meet the Press , Tim Russert asked Feingold , " Do you think the American people will look on this saying , ' Here go the Democrats , just trying to create something sensational by censuring the president rather than trying to solve the problem of Iraq ? ' "
" Well , there 's a lot of sentiment in the country , even the polls show it , for actually impeaching the president and the vice president , " Russert said .
" I think that they have committed impeachable offenses with regard to this terrorist surveillance program and making up their own program . "
Feingold added , " What I am proposing is a moderate course -- not tying up the Senate and the House with an impeachment trial but simply passing resolution that makes sure that the historical record shows the way they have weakened our country , weakened our country militarily and against al Qaeda and weakened our country 's fundamental document , the Constitution .
I think that 's a reasonable course and does not get in the way of our normal work .
But the American people are outraged at the way they 've been treated .
They are outraged at the dishonesty that they have been subjected to .
The American people -- we deserve better than the way we 've been treated , and somehow this has to be reflected . "
Excerpts from Feingold 's diary : # So , as I announced a little while ago on Meet the Press , I plan to introduce two censure resolutions in the Senate in the coming weeks .
These will be broad resolutions , one of which will address the war in Iraq , including the administration 's efforts to mislead the nation into , and during , the war , mismanagement of the war , and its attempts to justify this Iraq mistake by distorting the situation on the ground in Iraq .
The other condemns the administration 's abuse of the rule of law .
Because , of all this administration 's outrageous misconduct , those are truly the worst of the worst .
As you know , over a year ago I introduced a resolution to censure the President for his illegal wiretapping program , and for the way he misled Congress and the public before and after the programs disclosure about whether his administration was following the law .
I appreciated the strong support I got from all of you for that effort .
You really helped galvanize support for that push for accountability , and encouraged people all over the country to recognize how damaging the President 's actions were to our basic freedoms .
This time I am taking a broader approach because the list of administration wrongdoing , misleading statements , and out and out lies , just keeps getting longer .
Congress should censure the President not only for the illegal wiretapping program , but for the administration 's phony reasons for going to war in Iraq , for trashing habeas corpus , for giving the green light to torture , and the list goes on and on .
I want Congress to condemn what the administration has done , both for the American people , and for history .
We all know what a disaster this administration is , and generations to come should know it too , so they can avoid a repeat of the misconduct we have witnessed over the past six and a half years .
I know some of you may not believe these resolutions are enough , and I understand that .
I am as frustrated as you are about this administrations actions and I hope the proposal I made today is something youll consider helping me with ( in addition to other efforts you may support ) .
Together we will hold this administration accountable for its many abuses .
The history books will show we were vocal in condemning the Presidents abuses of power .
I want you to know how much your honest opinions influenced my thinking on this , and how much I value what all of you have to say .
This conversation is n't over by a long shot , in part because these resolutions are n't written yet .
I 'll be working to put them together , and I welcome your input .
So let 's keep talking .

The following video is from NBC's Meet the Press broadcast on July 22 .
Transcript of Feingold on NBC's Meet the Press : # MR. RUSSERT : And we 're back -- Senator Russ Feingold , welcome back to " Meet the Press . "
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Good morning .
MR .
RUSSERT : Democrats took control of both houses of Congress in November of 2006 , many of them running , pledging to end the war in Iraq .
Is there any sense that Congress will be capable of ending the war ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Well , I think we will .
This has been a slow , very painful process .
Sometimes I 've been very pleased with the progress we 've made ; sometimes I 'm not .
But I 'll tell you , what happened this week , the majority of the United States Senate including four Republicans , voted for a binding deadline to end the war by the early part of next year .
And , you know , this is a proposal that I made a long time ago which , at the time , people thought was sort of extreme .
Now it is a mainstream view .
We need to do more of the unity that the Democrats are showing is causing more Republicans to come on board , which I think will lead to our being able to pass something in the not - too - distant future .
MR .
RUSSERT : This fall ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : I believe so .
I 'm hoping that can happen either on the Department of Defense authorization bill .
I also think we have to look -- as Senator Reid and I have talked about -- at using the power of the purse -- our ability to cut off the funding after the troops are safely redeployed as a way to actually enforce this kind of a binding deadline .
MR .
RUSSERT : You use the word " redeployed . "
John Burns , the bureau chief in Baghdad for The New York Times , who has lived there for some time , offered these words this week , " It seems to me incontrovertible that the most likely outcome of American withdrawal anytime soon would be cataclysmic violence , and I find that to be widely agreed among Iraqis , including Iraqis who strongly oppose the invasion . "
Are you concerned that we leave behind violence , catastrophe , genocide ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Let 's be clear what we have now -- we now have cataclysmic violence .
That 's the status quo .
It is possible that things would get worse if we left ; it is possible that things would get better , but this is what I believe -- right now we 're holding the bag in Iraq .
The other countries in the region -- Iran , Syria , Jordan , Kuwait -- they have an interest in stability in Iraq .
Because if what you say will happen , it will cause great instability , and their country is in danger from that .
The only way we get them engaged , the only way they put up the money and the resources to stabilize this situation is if we stop what they consider to be an occupation of Iraq .
So I think the only way to avoid the situation getting worse is for us to orderly redeploy our troops and get these other countries engaged in what is in their own interest , which is a stable Iraq .
MR .
RUSSERT : So if the country explodes , you think you get the attention of people in the region ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : I 'm saying it would not necessarily get worse if we took the step of redeploying .
I 've heard a number of experts on the Foreign Relations Committee come in and say , in fact , it 's just the opposite .
It is our occupation , as it's perceived , that leads to so much of this free - floating violence throughout the country .
Not through any fault of ours , but it creates an environment that leads to more and more violence , more and more possible genocide , more and more tribal tension .
Our getting out in an orderly way , at least gives the opportunity for a new start in Iraq , and that 's what it 's time for us to do .
MR .
RUSSERT : President Bush is determined to continue the war in Iraq .
He 's made that very , very clear .
Is there anything the Democrats can do to get him to pay attention or to hold him accountable in their minds ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Well , I 'm shocked by the administration and , in particular , the president 's response to the November election .
Usually , when presidents are repudiated in an election , they say , " Well , maybe I ought to reassess . "
Instead , he did just the opposite .
He did this surge , which when contrary to the will of the American people .
I think we need to do something serious in terms of accountability , and that 's why I will be shortly introducing a censure resolution of the president and the administration .
One , on their getting us into the war in Iraq , and their failure to adequately prepare our military , and the misleading statements that have continued throughout the war in Iraq .
And a second on this administration 's outrageous attack on the rule of law all the way from the illegal surveillance program , their attitude about torture , which we heard a little bit about today on this show .
This administration has assaulted the Constitution .
We need to have on the historical record some kind of indication that was has happened here is , in the words of Director McConnell , as you just quoted him , " disastrous . "
Somehow we have to address that , and I think it 's a good time to begin that process .
MR .
RUSSERT : A censure resolution against the president ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Correct .
MR .
RUSSERT : Anybody else ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Potentially , yes .
I think when it comes to Iraq , obviously , the vice president , Vice President Cheney , has been one of the worst actors in American history in this situation .
There may be others .
On the rule of law issue , on the attack on the Constitution , the attorney general has had one of the worst records of not being honest with the judiciary committee , of being intentionally misleading , and of not taking responsibility for everything from the disastrous consequences of the Patriot Act to the U.S. attorney 's debacle .
So , yes , potentially others but , of course , the president -- the buck stops with the president .
That is the number one .
MR .
RUSSERT : Last year you introduced a resolution to censure the president regarding the wiretapping of Americans within the U.S. under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
You got three other Democrats to join with you -- just four Democrats .
Is n't this the futile effort that will be described simply as politics ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Well , let 's see what actually happened , Tim .
What happened was after I introduced the censure resolution there was a lot of talk and it did n't mean anything .
But what did the administration do ?
They stopped this TSP program .
They brought it within the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , and they saw that there was sentiment in this country and almost every legal scholar saying that their idea that they could just make up their own laws was wrong .
They brought it within the program .
So I think it had a very positive impact , and it sets the stage for setting the historical record here , which is that this administration has done the greatest assault on our Constitution perhaps in American history .
MR .
RUSSERT : Do you think the American people will look on this saying , " Here go the Democrats , just trying to create something sensational by censuring the president rather than trying to solve the problem of Iraq ? "
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Well , there 's a lot of sentiment in the country , even the polls show it , for actually impeaching the president and the vice president .
I think that they have committed impeachable offenses with regard to this terrorist surveillance program and making up their own program .
What I am proposing is a moderate course -- not tying up the Senate and the House with an impeachment trial but simply passing resolution that makes sure that the historical record shows the way they have weakened our country , weakened our country militarily and against al Qaeda and weakened our country 's fundamental document , the Constitution .
I think that 's a reasonable course and does not get in the way of our normal work .
But the American people are outraged at the way they 've been treated .
They are outraged at the dishonesty that they have been subjected to .
The American people -- we deserve better than the way we 've been treated , and somehow this has to be reflected .
MR .
RUSSERT : Have you talked to the Senate Democratic leadership about this ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : I have .
MR .
RUSSERT : And will they be supportive ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : We have n't drafted it yet .
We 're going to work cooperatively with whoever wants to work with me .
I 've talked to the majority leader , I 've talked to Senator Leahy , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , and we will be working together to see what kind of a thing we should come up with but , yes , I have talked to them .
MR .
RUSSERT : Will it get any Republican support ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : We 'll find out .
You know , I think this might be an opportunity for some Republicans who may be uncomfortable with taking steps such as impeachment to say , you know , somehow we have to reflect the fact that so much of this has gone wrong .
Take , for example , Gordon Smith , who actually said on the floor of the Senate that this Iraq situation may have criminal elements -- he actually said the word " criminal . "
This is an opportunity for people to say let 's at least reflect on the record the fact that something terrible has happened here .
This administration has weakened America in a way that is frightful .
One of the most important times when we need to be strong and we , as a Congress , have to reflect this tragedy .
MR .
RUSSERT : What is the legal impact or effect of a censure ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : It does not have legal impact .
It is a resolution that has been done before , both with regard to members of Congress and also the president , and it does not have legal consequences , to my knowledge .
MR .
RUSSERT : You 'll be introducing this when ?
SEN .
FEINGOLD : Shortly , in a few days .
MR .
RUSSERT : Senator Russ Feingold , Democrat of Wisconsin , we thank you for coming here and sharing your views .
SEN .
FEINGOLD : My pleasure . #
ドキュメントを読まない輩
結論 : ぐぐるな。ドキュメントに書いてあるとわかっているのになぜ google に頼る ?
巷間でよく見られる、しかし Apache の配布アーカイブ一式に含まれているドキュメントをちゃんと読んでいれば起きないはずの設定ミスや、ミスではないがふしぎな設定について。
< Limit > : セキュリティ上のリスクがあるのですみやかに確認・修正されたし
AddDefaultCharset : 穴ではないが修正が必要
LanguagePriority : ほとんどのサイトでは無意味
ScriptAlias : 管理者でなくエンドユーザがハマるのはしかたないけれど
SetEnvIf : どこも間違ってはいないのだが…
Apache のドキュメントは日本語未訳なところが一部残っているけれど、全体として非常によくまとまった情報源である。少なくとも、「このディレクティブをどう設定するとどう動くか」についてはこれに勝るドキュメントはない。しかし、ドキュメントに正しい方法が書いてあるのは確実なのに、あえて google あたりで腐った知識を仕入れてきたあげくに、それをそのまま自分の
Web サイトに写して誤解の拡大再生産に努める人がいる。なんで?
< Limit > の危険
ぐぐってみると以下のような設定をしよう、と書かれていることが多い。
AuthType Basic AuthName ... AuthUserFile ... AuthGroupFile / dev/null < Limit GET > require valid- user </ Limit >
require のかわりに order / allow / deny になってることもあるが、これも同様 。
だが、特に理由がなければ、< Limit > を使う必要はない。うかつに使うと、アクセス制限したつもりですり抜けてしまう危険性がある。具体的にどんな問題があるかについてはこちらを参照のこと。
ドキュメントから抜粋。
< Limit > アクセス制御は、通常 全ての アクセスメソッドに対して 影響し、普通はこれが望ましい挙動です。 そうしたことから、大部分の場合にはアクセス制御に関わるディレクティブを
< Limit > セクション内に 書くべきではありません。 普通は < Limit > なしが望ましい挙動であり、< Limit > の中にアクセス制御を書くべきではない。
Require このようにして適用されたアクセス制御は、 全ての メソッドに 対して行なわれます。 通常は、これが望ましい動作です。 もし、特定のメソッドに対してのみアクセスの制御を適用し、 他のメソッドは制限しない場合には、 < Limit > セクション内に Require を 指定してください。 繰り返すが、通常は < Limit > なしが望ましい動作である。
mod_access 一般的には、アクセス制限ディレクティブはすべてのアクセスメソッド ( GET , PUT , POST など ) に適用されます。そして、ほとんどの場合これが望ましい動作です。 しかし、 < Limit > セクションの中にディレクティブを書くことで、
一部のメソッドにのみ制限をかけることもできます。
しつこいようだが、ほとんどの場合 < Limit > なしが望ましい動作である。
何度でも書くが、自分が何をしようとしているか理解していなければ<Limit>の中にアクセス制限設定を書いてはいけない。さもなくば、せっかくのアクセス制限が無意味になりかねない。<Limit> を使っていいのは NCSA HTTPd または Apache 0.8 未満をいまだに使っている場合だけである。
おまけ。認証に関しては、< Limit > とは直接の関係はないが、AuthName も間違った意味で解説されることが多いディレクティブである。これはあくまで認証の領域(realm)を指示するものであって、「ブラウザの認証ダイアログに表示させる文字列」というのは副次的な効果である。日本語を使いたいとか、途中で改行したいとか、はては
HTML タグを使いたいなんて質問をたまに見ることがあるが、ナンセンスである。
AddDefaultCharset none の謎
誰ですか。こんなあやしげな charset を広めたのは 。
Apache をインストールしたときのまま の httpd.conf では日本語で書かれたページが化けるというのはよく知られた話である。これは
AddDefaultCharset ディレクティブの値がそう設定されている(デフォルト値ではない。サンプルでインストールされる httpd.conf でデフォルトと異なる値を与えている(*1) )からで、解決するにはこれをいじってやればよい。だが、いじるというのは正しいのだが、どういうわけか、これを none に変えろというウソを書いたサイトがある。たとえばITmedia エンタープライズ ：Linux Tips - Apache2.0でページが文字化けしてしまう(いつのまにか修正されたようだが)。ほかにもぐぐってみるとこんなにたくさん。検索対象を日本語ページに限定してもたいして数が減らないので、日本でだけ蔓延してる現象らしい(が、一部輸出もされている模様)。信じられないことに、iso-8858-1 を指定する( 8859 ではなく ) などという荒技もあるようだ。
もっとわけわかんないのが、
AddDefaultCharset shift_jis AddDefaultCharset EUC-JP AddDefaultCharset noneの３つを追加。
じゃあ none じゃなくてどう設定するのが正しいのか。啓蒙の意図もこめて、ここでは正解は書かない。公式ドキュメントへのリンクを張るだけ。
いちおう補足として 、AddDefaultCharset none を指定したときにどんな現象が起きるのかを以下に示す。このキーワードで google の上位にヒットしたページのうち、いかにも自宅サーバっぽいところに実際に接続して
HTTP のレスポンスヘッダを見てみた 。
% w3 m - dump_head http://武士の情けで伏せる.no-ip.com/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date : Mon , 18 Oct 2004 03:55:02 GMT
Server : Apache / 2.0.40 ( Red Hat Linux ) Accept - Ranges : bytes X - Powered - By : PHP / 4.2.2 Connection : close Content - Type : text / html ; charset=none
ところで、経済の世界で履行しなくちゃいけない債務を履行しないことをデフォルトというように、本来 default とは欠席とか棄権とかを意味する単語である。in default of ... = 〜がない場合には。つまり 、AddDefaultCharset というのは、 「 他の場所で特に設定されていないとき」に付加される文字コードである。要するに、AddDefaultCharset をいじるのではなく「他の場所」で設定することも可能である。すなわち、
AddType " text / html ; charset=EUC-JP " .html
Options + MultiViews
( *1 ) Apache 2.0.53 から " setting a site - wide default does more harm than good " という理由によ り httpd-std.conf から削除され た( CHANGES ) 。
LanguagePriority の意味
文字化けの件で AddDefaultCharset について記述されているサイトの多くであわせて言及されているのが、LanguagePriority で ja を先頭にもってこい、ということ 。
主に日本語のコンテンツを提供するサーバにおいて、この設定は間違ってはいない。間違ってはいないが、*文字化け解消を目的とするのであれば*、まったく無関係である。無意味である。ドキュメントを読んでもそんな記述はない。このディレクティブはそれとは異なる意図で使われるものだからだ。
主に日本語のコンテンツを提供するが、日本語以外のコンテンツも同時に提供するサーバなのであればこの設定も意味があろう。しかしそうでもなければ放っておいてもいいディレクティブである。このディレクティブを提供するモジュールの機能を考えれば無意味さもわかるというものだ。どんなときに使われるかは以下を参照のこと。
多くのサイトであたかも文字化け解消には必須のように
AddDefaultCharset と LanguagePriority をセットで解説しているのは、やはりドキュメントを読まず、よそのサイトをなんとなく写してるだけなのではないかと思われる。コンテンツが日本語であることを明示したいのならば、LanguagePriority ではなく DefaultLanguage 、AddLanguage ディレクティブを使うのが適切だろう(ただし、文字化けとはやはり無関係)。もし万が一 LanguagePriority の設定をしたために文字化けがなおった、あるいは設定が間違っていたために文字化けしたという例があれば教えてほしい。文字化けではなく言語化けならありうるだろうが。
影の薄い ScriptAlias
Q. /cgi-bin / 以下に HTML や画像ファイルを置いたのですが、アクセスしてもエラーになります。なぜでしょうか？
A. ScriptAlias の効いた場所に CGI 以外のファイルを置こうという発想自体が間違いです。
httpd.conf を見ないエンドユーザがこれにひっかかるのはしかたない気もする。が、自分で
Apache を設定する人がこれでハマるのならば不見識もはなはだしい。自分で設定しなくてもはじめからそうなっているわけだが、おかしいと思ったら httpd.conf を眺めれば怪しそうな部分はすぐ見つかるし、それを頼りにドキュメントを読めば対処方法もすぐにわかるはずだ。google
で検索するとこの症状はいろいろひっかかるが、ScriptAlias にまで言及されているところはほとんどなく、このディレクティブの影の薄さには涙を誘われる。
なぜ表示できないかというと、CGI
としての実行に失敗しているからである。つまり、実行できるものならば動く。これは特に
Windows で動いている Apache ではセキュリティ上の問題を招く可能性がある 。
実例を挙げると、imgboard という画像アップロード CGI は、アップロードされたファイルを cgi-bin 以下のディレクトリに保存することを前提に作られているので、この問題が発生しやすい。ScriptInterpreterSource
Registry の設定で、かつ 「 画像が表示できない 」状態の imgboard に画像をアップロードしてやると、それをダウンロードすることでサーバ上で画像ファイルの拡張子に関連づけられたビューワが起動する(らしい)ので、大量にアクセスしてやれば
DoS になる。また ScriptInterpreterSource Script の設 定( デフォルト ) だと拡張子ではなく #!
を解釈するので、悪意ある CGI を .jpg などの拡張子で偽装してアップロードしてやると、それをダウンロードすることでサーバをクラックできる(だろう)。ドキュメントには前者の場合の危険性は警告されているが、後者の例には触れられていないので注意のこと。わしは
Windows で Apache をいじることはしないので確認してないけどドキュメントを信ずれば(
そういう態度もどうかと思うが:-))
そのように動作するはず。なお、UNIX はレジストリがないので ScriptInterpreterSource Script 相当だが、通常アップロードしただけでは実行パーミッションがないのでこのような攻撃はできない。
SetEnvIf ... Lilith の不思議
間違っているわけではないのだが、よそのサイトの設定をそのままコピーしてるだけと思われる例をもうひとつ。
HTTP のリクエストヘッダによってアクセス制限をかける場合( 典型例としては
Referer による参照元制限 ) 、( 1) SetEnvIf で適当な環境変数をセットし、( 2)その環境変数がセットされていればアクセス拒否する、という2段構えの設定になる。それは正しいのだが、そのセットする環境変数の名前が、なぜか
Lilith とされることが多い。
環境変数名は任意のものでいいので間違ってはいないし、ちゃんと望んだとおりに動作する。だが、いったいどこから
Lilith という文字列が出てきたのか。この用途で誰もが自然に思い浮かぶ単語ではないと思うのだが。
参考までに 、Apache の配布ドキュメントの例では local_referal という環境変数名になっている 。
なお 、Referer はそもそも偽造がかんたんにできるし、プライバシーなどの理由からわざと送出しないようにしたり書き換えたりすることもあるので、これによるアクセス制限は完全ではない(それどころか副作用になることもある)のだが、まあ、その是非についてはここでは深く触れない。
ところで、この SetEnvIf によるアクセス制限を Accept - Language ヘッダに対しておこない、クライアントの言語チェックをするということもよくおこなわれているようだ。しかし、403
Forbidden を返してしまうこの方法よりも、言語ネゴシエーションの機能を使って
406 Not Acceptable を返すが適切だろう。具体的には、httpd.conf か .htaccess で
Options + MultiViews # Apache 2 では以下も追加 # ForceLanguagePriority Prefer # または None ( Fallback を含まないようにする ) # 以下は任意で # ErrorDocument 406 ...
google などの検索エンジンなどにより、間違った設定の拡大再生産がおこなわれているとしか思えない。また、誤解をまねきやすい説明がついていたり、ある特定の目的でのみ正しい設定だったりと、かならずしも間違いではない設定も、検索エンジンを介した伝言ゲームを繰り返すうちに明白に間違った設定に変化していってるのではないだろうか。
google に頼るばかりじゃなくて、付属のドキュメントをちゃんと読もう。あるかどうかわからないものを google で探すよりも、あるとわかっているものを付属ドキュメントから探す方がずっとラクだと思うんだけど。「 マニュアル人間 」
「マニュアル世代」のようなネガティブイメージの言葉もあるけど、この言葉で問題にされているのはマニュアルに書いてあることしかできないこと、応用力のないことである。マニュアルを読みさえしないのは「マニュアル人間」にすら及ばない。
なお、このページ自体も、google にひっかかる真偽の定かでないあやしげなページのひとつである。ここに書かれていることを鵜呑みにせず、自分でドキュメントを調べなおしてほしい。

A time - exposure photograph of the Milky Way over the New Mexico desert .
The word “ galaxy ” comes from the Greek for milk .
CHRIS COOK / PHOTO RESEARCHERS
In 1610 , Galileo Galilei published a small book describing astronomical observations that he had made of the skies above Padua .
His homemade telescopes had less magnifying and resolving power than most beginners ’ telescopes sold today , yet with them he made astonishing discoveries : that the moon has mountains and other topographical features ; that Jupiter is orbited by satellites , which he called planets ; and that the Milky Way is made up of individual stars .
It may seem strange that this last observation could have surprised anyone , but in Galileo ’s time people assumed that the Milky Way must be some kind of continuous substance .
It truly resembled a streak of spilled liquid — our word “ galaxy ” comes from the Greek for milk — and it was so bright that it cast shadows on the ground ( as did Jupiter and Venus ) .
Today , by contrast , most Americans are unable to see the Milky Way in the sky above the place where they live , and those who can see it are sometimes baffled by its name .
The stars have not become dimmer ; rather , the Earth has become vastly brighter , so that celestial objects are harder to see .
Air pollution has made the atmosphere less transparent and more reflective , and high levels of terrestrial illumination have washed out the stars overhead — a phenomenon called “ sky glow . ”
Anyone who has flown across the country on a clear night has seen the landscape ablaze with artificial lights , especially in urban areas .
Today , a person standing on the observation deck of the Empire State Building on a cloudless night would be unable to discern much more than the moon , the brighter planets , and a handful of very bright stars — less than one per cent of what Galileo would have been able to see without a telescope .
Amateur astronomers sometimes classify nighttime darkness on the Bortle Dark - Sky Scale , which is based on a number of criteria , among them “ limiting magnitude , ” or the brightness of the faintest celestial objects that are visible without magnification .
The scale , composed of nine points , was devised in 2001 by John E. Bortle , a retired Westchester County fire chief and a monthly columnist for Sky & Telescope .
“ One of the problems I was addressing was that younger amateur astronomers , especially east of the Mississippi , had never seen a dark sky at all , ” he told me recently .
“ People will sometimes come up from the city and call me and say , ‘ John , I ’ve found this fabulous dark site , it ’s totally black , you ca n’t imagine how good it is . ’
So I ’ll go and have a look , but it ’s always poor .
They have no comparison to work against . ”
In Galileo ’s time , nighttime skies all over the world would have merited the darkest Bortle ranking , Class 1 .
Today , the sky above New York City is Class 9 , at the other extreme of the scale , and American suburban skies are typically Class 5 , 6 , or 7 .
The very darkest places in the continental United States today are almost never darker than Class 2 , and are increasingly threatened .
For someone standing on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon on a moonless night , the brightest feature of the sky is not the Milky Way but the glow of Las Vegas , a hundred and seventy - five miles away .
To see skies truly comparable to those which Galileo knew , you would have to travel to such places as the Australian outback and the mountains of Peru .
And civilization ’s assault on the stars has consequences far beyond its impact on astronomers .
Excessive , poorly designed outdoor lighting wastes electricity , imperils human health and safety , disturbs natural habitats , and , increasingly , deprives many of us of a direct relationship with the nighttime sky , which throughout human history has been a powerful source of reflection , inspiration , discovery , and plain old jaw - dropping wonder .
David L. Crawford earned his Ph.D. in astronomy in 1958 and spent nearly all his professional life at Kitt Peak National Observatory , on a mountaintop fifty - six miles southwest of Tucson , Arizona .
By 1970 , he had noticed , with alarm , a significant decrease in astronomical visibility .
Tucson was growing rapidly , and so was its sky glow .
With a colleague , he persuaded the city to adopt an ordinance governing exterior lighting , and later they persuaded other Arizona cities and counties to pass similar regulations .
In 1988 , Crawford and another friend formed a nonprofit organization called the International Dark - Sky Association .
“ We ’re sort of a nighttime Sierra Club , ” he told me , during a recent visit to Tucson .
He retired from Kitt Peak in 1995 and has worked full time for the I.D.A. ever since , often putting in sixty - hour workweeks .
He has the complexion of a man who does n’t spend a lot of time outdoors during daylight , and speaks in the modulated tones of someone accustomed to talking while others are asleep .
“ We ’re on a mission to change the world at night , ” he said .
The I.D.A. ’s headquarters is a warren of small offices , accommodating a dozen or so staff members and a shifting group of volunteers and researchers , around the corner from a ( non-related ) store that sells light fixtures .
Crawford and his staff devote much of their time to proselytizing for dark - sky regulations and working with manufacturers to improve lighting products .
Hanging on a wall in a conference room is a map that shows the geographical distribution of the organization ’s eleven thousand members .
The states with the highest representation are California ( fifteen hundred and thirty ) , Arizona ( six hundred and seventy ) , New York ( five hundred and one ) , and Massachusetts ( four hundred and eighty - two ) .
The I.D.A. also has members in seventy - eight foreign countries , including Iraq and Iran , where astronomy is a popular hobby , especially among girls and young women .
Authorities in Sa’adat - shahr , about four hundred miles south of Tehran , periodically cut off all electric power in the town in order to improve visibility at nighttime “ star parties ” conducted by a local teacher .
When the I.D.A. began , Crawford ’s interest in outdoor lighting was limited to its impact on observatories ; today , the organization ’s brief covers everything from advising law - enforcement officers to assessing the effects of artificial lighting on wildlife .
On the evening of my visit , while Crawford and I waited for the sky to grow darker , we went to dinner at a relatively new shopping mall on Tucson ’s outskirts .
As we drove up , Crawford explained that the mall had been of particular interest to the I.D.A. : “ The original lighting system for this mall was put in by somebody from out of town , and it did n’t meet the Tucson code , so the developer had to call in a consultant and change it all .
Now it ’s one of the best in town , and we actually gave them an award a few years ago . ”
The mall ’s large parking lot was fully illuminated — as we walked from the car to the restaurant , I had no trouble reading notes that I had scribbled in my notebook — but it was free of what dark - sky advocates call “ glare bombs ” : fixtures that cast much of their light sideways , into the eyes of passersby , or upward , into the sky .
Tucson ’s code limits the brightness of exterior fixtures and requires most of them to be of a type usually known as “ full cutoff ” or “ fully shielded , ” meaning that they cast no light above the horizontal plane and employ a light source that can not be seen by someone standing to the side .
These are not necessarily more difficult or expensive to manufacture than traditional lights , and they typically cost less to operate .
Calgary , Alberta , recently cut its electricity expenditures by more than two million dollars a year , by switching to full - cutoff , reduced - wattage street lights .
Dr. Atiyya , on his part , published a retraction and apologized , saying that the fatwa was no more than a personal interpretation of a certain hadith , and furthermore , that the hadith in question relates a particular incident that occurred under specific constraints , and has no general applicability .
However , Al - Azhar refused to accept his apology .
In response , Al - Azhar University formed a special committee to debate the fatwa , and on the recommendation of this committee , Dr. Atiyya was suspended .
The Egyptian information minister ordered the removal from sellers ' shelves of the issue of the government weekly Al - Watani Al - Yawm in which the fatwa had been published .
The fatwa sparked a storm of protest in the Egyptian public arena , especially within the religious establishment .
It was harshly criticized by Muslim Brotherhood MPs , who even brought it up for discussion in parliament , as well as by Egyptian intellectuals and columnists .
The head of the Hadith Department in Al - Azhar University , Dr. Izzat Atiyya , recently issued a controversial fatwa dealing with breastfeeding of adults .
The fatwa stated that a woman who is required to work in private with a man not of her immediate family – a situation that is forbidden by Islamic law – can resolve the problem by breastfeeding the man , which , according to shari'a , turns him into a member of her immediate family .
Head of the Al - Azhar Hadith Department : Breastfeeding Allows a Woman to Be With a Man in Private
Dr. Izzat Atiyya explained his fatwa in an interview with Al - Watani Al - Yawm , the weekly of Egypt 's ruling National Democratic Front party .
He said : " The religious ruling that appears in the Prophet 's conduct [ Sunna ] confirms that breastfeeding allows a man and a woman to be together in private , even if they are not family and if the woman did not nurse the man in his infancy , before he was weaned – providing that their being together serves some purpose , religious or secular ...
" Being together in private means being in a room with the door closed , so that nobody can see them ...
A man and a woman who are not family members are not permitted [ to do this ] , because it raises suspicions and doubts .
A man and a woman who are alone together are not [ necessarily ] having sex , but this possibility exists , and breastfeeding provides a solution to this problem ...
I also insist that the breastfeeding relationship be officially documented in writing ...
The contract will state that this woman has suckled this man ...
After this , the woman may remove her hijab and expose her hair in the man 's [ presence ] ...
Dr. Atiyya further explained that the breastfeeding does not necessarily have to be done by the woman herself .
" The important point , " he said , " is that the man and the woman must be related through breastfeeding .
[ This can also be achieved ] by means of the man 's mother or sister suckling the woman , or by means of the woman 's mother or sister suckling the man , since [ all of these solutions legally ] turn them into brother and sister ...
" The logic behind [ the concept ] of breastfeeding an adult is to transform the bestial relationship between [ two people ] into a religious relationship based on [ religious ] duties ...
Since [ this ] breastfeeding takes place between [ two ] adults , the man is still permitted to marry the woman [ who breastfed him ] , whereas [ a woman ] who nursed [ a man ] in his infancy is not permitted to marry him ...
" The adult must suckle directly from the [ woman 's ] breast ...
[ This according to a hadith attributed to Aisha , wife of the Prophet 's Muhammad ] , which tells of Salem [ the adopted son of Abu Hudheifa ] who was breastfed by Abu - Hudheifa 's wife when he was already a grown man with a beard , by the Prophet 's order ...
Other methods , such as [ transferring ] the milk to a container , are [ less desirable ] ...
" [ As for the possibility of using a breast - pump , which ] increases the production of the milk glands ... that is a matter for doctors and religious scholars who must determine if the milk [ thus produced ] is real milk , i.e. , if its composition is identical to that of the [ woman 's ] original milk .
If it is , this method is permissible ...
Dr. Atiyya also said : " The fact that the hadith regarding the breastfeeding of an adult is inconceivable to the mind does not make it invalid .
This is a reliable hadith , and rejecting it is tantamount to rejecting Allah 's Messenger and questioning the Prophet 's tradition . " [ 1 ]
Al - Azhar Examines the Fatwa , Suspends Dr. Atiyya
In response to the uproar caused by the fatwa , Al - Azhar university formed a committee of several experts on hadiths to investigate the matter .
According to a senior Al - Azhar source , the university president also ordered Dr. Atiyya to publish an apology , and the latter complied and retracted his fatwa , [ 2 ] explaining : " My statements on the issue of breastfeeding an adult were based on the imams Ibn Hazm , Ibn Taymiyya , Ibn Al - Qayyim , Al - Shawkani and Amin Khattab [ Al - Subki ] , and on conclusions I drew from the statements of Ibn Hajar [ Al - Askalani ] .
However , I hold that only the breastfeeding of an infant creates a family relationship [ that prohibits marriage between the parties and allows them to be together ] , as the Four Imams [ i.e. , the founders of the four Sunni legal schools ] said , while the [ act of ] breastfeeding a grown man [ mentioned in the hadith ] was a [ specific ] incident that came to serve a [ specific ] purpose , and the fatwa I issued was based solely on my personal interpretation .
Based on what I have learned with my brothers the religious scholars , I apologize for my earlier [ statements ] and retract my opinion , which contradicts [ the norms accepted ] by the public . " [ 3 ]
However , the Al - Azhar Supreme Council , headed by Al - Azhar Sheikh Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi , refused to accept Dr. Atiyya 's apology , saying , " We must not be too lax in matters of religion , especially when the matter at hand is a fatwa that significantly affects people 's actual lives , inclinations , and views – because it speaks to their natural emotions which [ lead them to ] embrace what is permitted and shun prohibitions . "
Tantawi said , " Society cannot tolerate [ a fatwa ] that undermines its religious stability .
There is enough chaos with all the unsupervised fatwas [ published ] on some satellite channels .
We will never permit this chaos to spread to the religious establishment and to Al - Azhar . "
By the recommendation of the special committee formed to examine the fatwa , Al - Azhar decided to suspend Dr. Atiyya pending further investigation of his case . [ 4 ]
Egyptian Minister of Religious Endowments Dr. Muhammad Hamdi Zaqzouq likewise criticized the fatwa , saying : " Fatwas like these harm Islam , serve our enemies and push the public towards backwardness and ignorance . " [ 5 ]
* PUBLIC UPROAR OVER DR .
ATIYYA'S FATWA
Muslim Brotherhood MPs : This is an Erroneous Fatwa
The issue of breastfeeding adults was brought up for debate in the Egyptian parliament .
Sabri Khalaf Allah from Muslim Brotherhood bloc in the parliament told the Al - Arabiyya TV website that some 50 MPs had discussed the issue , had expressed concern over the fact that the fatwa had been published in the media , but had refrained from submitting a parliamentary question in order to avoid creating too big an uproar .
Dr. Sayyid Askar , a Muslim Brotherhood MP and former member of the Academy of Islamic Studies , said that the hadith on which the fatwa is based is indeed authentic and valid , but that the accepted view among Muslim scholars is that it refers to a specific case and cannot be applied to other cases .
Therefore , he concluded , Dr. Attiya 's fatwa is an erroneous fatwa that goes against the consensus .
" In our modern society , " he added , " it makes no sense to talk of breastfeeding adults . " [ 6 ]
Intellectuals Object : The Koran Forbids the Breastfeeding of Adults
Dr. Abd Al - Fatah Asaker , who studies Muslim tradition , denied the validity of the hadith on which the fatwa is based , claiming it is nonsense and criticized the publication of Abd Al - Qadir 's book which regarded it as valid . [ 7 ]
In an interview with Al - Watani Al - Yawm , he said : " Would Dr. Abd Al - Mahdi [ Abd Al - Qadr ] agree [ to let ] his wife , daughter , sister or even his mother breastfeed a grown man – whether a stranger or a family member ?
Would the Muslim scholars [ want people ] to say that their wives breastfeed any man who comes along ?
Asaker argued that the hadiths of Muslim tradition , even those that appear [ in reliable compilations like those of ]
Al - Bukhari and Muslim , are invalid if they contradict what is said in the Koran , which states : " Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years ; [ that is ] for those who wish to complete the [ full period of ] suckling [ Koran 2:233 ] . "
Asaker argued that after this period ends , breastfeeding is forbidden , and added that the story of Salem is a legend spread by the enemies of Islam with the aim of discrediting Aisha , to whom the hadith is attributed .
" It is inconceivable , " he concluded , " that Islam , which commands the believing [ men and women ] to lower their eyes [ in modesty ] , should permit a strange man to place his mouth on the breast of a married woman and suckle from [ it ] . " [ 8 ]
Liberal Muslim thinker Gamal Al - Banna argued that , in ancient times , the issue of breastfeeding adults was not sensitive , but today times and perceptions have changed .
He added , " We always call [ to distinguish ] within Islamic tradition [ between ] hadiths which were published in [ certain ] circumstances that have changed [ and hadiths that remain valid ] ... " [ 9 ]
Egyptian Columnist : The Fatwa Reflects Intellectual Petrifaction
Al - Sayyid Abd Al - Rauf , former editor of the Egyptian religious government weekly Aqidati , wrote in his regular column : " Strange and bizarre fatwas [ like the one published by Dr. Atiyya ] … sometimes stem from a desire to gain publicity by unusual means that lie outside the consensus , and [ sometimes stem ] from failure to understand the [ current ] reality of the Islamic nation .
The reality of the modern world , with all its struggles and changes , requires new outlooks that acknowledge the Islamic legal tradition and maintain its principles , [ but at the same time ] deal with the changes in [ this tradition ] – in accordance with the principle that fatwas must change with time and place .
" In some instances , fatwas like this also reflect a frozen outlook , a petrified point of view , and an insistence on drawing conclusions from an incident that occurred to specific individuals in specific circumstances , applying them to a different reality , and [ then ] publicizing [ this ] ruling …
" Some clerics are dragging the nation back [ into the past ] or are spreading opinions that provoke conflicts and struggles .
Some do it to satisfy the rulers , whether in quest for power , publicity and money or out of belief in ancient opinions , and without exercising their own minds … " [ 10 ]
Uproar in Ruling Party Weekly over Publication of Fatwa
The interview with Dr. Atiyya published in Al - Watani Al - Yawm , the weekly of the ruling National Democratic Party , caused an uproar among party members , and the Egyptian information minister ordered that the issue with the interview be removed from sellers ' shelves . [ 11 ] Dr. Ali Al - Din Hilal , member of the party 's general secretariat , said : " Al - Watani Al - Yawm is the newspaper of the party , which expresses its ideas and opinions . "
Hilal decried the publication of Dr. Atiyya 's opinions , saying that " they are damaging to all of us , especially since we bring them into our homes , and our children read them . "
Many party members sent faxes to the party secretariat in which they expressed their opposition to the articles on the fatwa in Al - Watani Al - Yawm .
They claimed that these articles were damaging to the newspaper and to party members , especially during the elections campaign , when there are more people looking out for the party 's mistakes . " [ 12 ]
In response , Al - Watani Al - Yawm published a clarification : " We emphasize that we are opposed to the fatwa .
When we published it ... our aim was to direct attention to the existence of such ideas in Al - Azhar , [ and to the fact that these ideas ] are to be studied in Al - Azhar in the coming year …
We emphasize that our aim in publishing [ the interview ] was not to endorse the fatwa ; rather , it was an attempt to bring [ the fatwa ] to the attention of the senior Al - Azhar scholars , so that they would investigate its author , especially since he is head of the Hadith Department in the Faculty of Theology , and the alumni [ of this faculty ] are thousands of preachers who occupy the pulpits of the mosques , and spread [ the opinions ] that they have learned to the public in Egypt and in the [ rest of the ] world .
We hoped that Al - Azhar would speedily intervene and clarify the truth to the public …

We 're a nation of inventors in garages and corporate labs , creating new gadgets and services that delight us and occasionally drive us crazy .
USA TODAY chose inventions that changed our lives since 1982 .
1 Cellphones Car phones were around in the 1970s , but it was n't until 1983 that Motorola introduced the first widely available handheld cellphone .
The DynaTAC 8000 x weighed almost 2 pounds , but it still cost $ 3,995 .
2 Laptop computers
It was about as portable as a sewing machine .
But the 28 - pound Compaq Portable – Compaq Computer 's very first product – was the first portable IBM - compatible PC on the market .
More than 53,000 sold in the year after its 1983 launch , despite a price usually topping $ 3,000 .
3 BlackBerries
An obscure Canadian pager company , Research In Motion , shortened attention spans around the world with the launch of the BlackBerry mobile e-mail device in 1999 .
4 Debit cards Ka-ching !
Who needs cash when you 've got a debit card ?
They took off after Visa launched its check card in 1995 .
Before then , less than 2 % of Americans used debit cards .
Ten years later , debit card transactions exceeded those on credit cards .
5 Caller ID Bill collectors and your annoying Uncle Ned are easy to ignore with this invention introduced by BellSouth in 1984 in Orlando .
Caller ID followed voice mail , an invention created a decade before to make up for declining secretarial employment .
6 DVDs Americans traded all those hours rewinding video cassettes for hours watching directors kibitz about behind - the - scenes antics with the introduction of digital video discs in 1995 .
Consumers spent $ 7.4 billion on DVD rentals last year , up 10 % .
VHS rentals plummeted 74 % , to $ 281 million .
7 Lithium rechargeable batteries
How many AAs does it take to power a laptop ?
Almost no one knows , thanks to the durable rechargeable battery Sony brought to market in 1991 .
It made its debut in a Sony camcorder – and has provided juice for laptops , cellphones , digital cameras and other portable electronics ever since .
8 iPods Walking down the sidewalk has n't been the same since November 2001 , when Apple introduced its iconic portable digital music player .
It was n't the first player , but fans declared it the coolest and easiest to use by snapping up more than 100 million of them .

Pay at the pump
Filling up the tank became even more self - serve when a gas station chain in Abilene , Texas , invented technology that turned the pump into a quasi-ATM .
10 Lettuce in a bag Americans discovered there 's more to salad than iceberg lettuce drowning in bottled dressing after the rollout of mixed lettuce greens in a bag .
Fresh Express in Salinas , Calif. , made that possible by inventing a high - tech plastic bag introduced nationwide in 1989 .
That helped ignite a whole consumer category of portion - controlled foods , such as bagged baby carrots .
11 Digital cameras Kodak unveiled a digital camera for professionals in 1986 , when consumers were still getting millions of rolls of film processed in labs .
Apple followed with the first consumer version eight years later .
But it was n't until this century that cameras got affordable , driving consumers to buy a forecast 30 million this year .
12 Doppler radar
We became a nation of weather fans as Doppler radar brought up - to - the - minute images to TV starting in 1990 , a dozen years after the Weather Channel 's launch turned forecasters such as Jim Cantore into celebrities .
13 Flat - panel TVs RCA pioneered flat - panel technology in the late 1960s .
But it took nearly four decades before consumers got the idea .
This year , 68 % of all digital TVs sold are forecast to come with flat panels .
14 Electronic tolls
Throwing quarters in a tollbooth bin became a thing of the past when the North Texas Tollway Authority started its TollTag system in the Dallas area in 1989 .
Now , millions of commuters prepay tolls and rely on electronic gadgets attached to their cars to zip through toll plazas .
15 PowerPoint Lecturers from CEOs to sixth - graders display topic headings and charts with the click of a mouse .
PowerPoint was invented by Forethought .
Microsoft bought Forethought in 1987 , unveiled its Windows version in 1990 and changed public speaking forever .
16 Microwavable popcorn
We can credit – and blame – food scientists for simultaneously making possible lunch - in - a - hurry and that terrible burnt smell wafting from the office microwave oven .
General Mills paved the way with the launch of Act II non-refrigerated microwaveable popcorn in 1984 .
17 High - tech footwear Plain canvas sneakers got tossed to the back of the closet when Nike launched Air Jordans in 1985 , followed by Reebok 's The Pump in 1989 , giving rise to the performance - footwear industry .
18 Online stock trading Investors jettisoned pricey stockbrokers after an Ameritrade predecessor offered online stock trading in 1994 .
During the market runup that followed , CNBC's Maria Bartiromo became a household name , and PCs morphed into slot machines for a new breed of investor : day traders .
19 Big Bertha golf clubs A World War I cannon inspired one of the biggest golf innovations when Ely Callaway created the oversize , wide - bodied stainless steel wood he dubbed Big Bertha in 1991 .
Callaway Golf followed up with the Great Big Bertha , Biggest Big Bertha , Great Big Bertha II , Big Bertha 454 and today 's Big Bertha 460 ..
20 Disposable contacts
A scream followed by , " No one move ! " once routinely signaled that someone had dropped a pricey contact lens .
Daily disposables – contacts worn for just a day before they 're tossed – arrived in the USA in 1995 .
21 StairMaster Arnold Schwarzenegger 's breakout performance in Pumping Iron was n't enough to get Americans pouring into gyms .
Technology led the way with the StairMaster , one of the first machines to turn gyms into modern exercise arenas after it was introduced in Tulsa in 1986 .
22 TiVo
The gadget is now a verb , with 4.4 million subscribers TiVo-ing their favorite TV shows .
The digital device changed TV - viewing habits after the first TiVo was shipped in 1999 .
23 Purell Germs trembled , and parents rejoiced ( " What in the world is that on your hands ? ! " ) when Gojo in Akron , Ohio , created Purell hand sanitizer .
The market for packaged handwipes and towlettes took off amid health scares over avian flu and post - 9/11 threats .
24 Home satellite TV
The dishes that receive signals were once so big and pricey , they 'd pull down your house if you tried strapping them to the chimney .
But the 1994 launch of service from DirecTV led to today 's supercompact dishes and lower prices , beaming tonight 's Dancing with the Stars to the USA 's more remote places .
25 Karaoke
What makes you sound so very good singing Stairway to Heaven ?
Two stiff drinks get you on stage in front of amused and horrified co-workers .
But it 's the karaoke machine invented in 1983 that really did the trick .
The most popular karaoke song today ?
Patsy Cline 's Crazy , says Karaoka.com .

The mission of the Mozilla Foundation is to preserve choice and innovation on the Internet .
Open standards and protocols are a big part of that , and the main focus of our work on that area is with Firefox , and things like the WHAT - WG .
However , I also think we need to be aware of current attempts to make email closed and proprietary .
What am I talking about , I hear you ask ?
No -one ’s resurrected the idea of a spam - free email walled garden recently .
Companies who tout their own secure mail protocols come and go and no - one notes their passing .
The volume of legitimate email sent continues to grow .
What ’s the worry ?
I ’m talking about the messaging systems built into sites like Facebook and LinkedIn .
On several occasions recently , friends have chosen to get back in touch with me via one of these rather than by email .
Another friend recently finished a conversation with a third party by saying “ Facebook me ” ; when I asked her why she did n’t just use email , she said “ Oh , Facebook is so much easier ” .
And she ’s right .
There ’s no spam , no risk of viruses or phishing , and you have a ready - made address book that you do n’t have to maintain .
You can even do common mass email types like “ Everyone , come to this event ” using a much richer interface .
Or other people can see what you say if you “ write on their wall ” .
In that light , the facts that the compose interface sucks even more than normal webmail , and that you do n’t have export access to a store of your own messages , do n’t seem quite so important .
But this is , nevertheless , a bad trend .
It would be terrible if email were to descend into something like the multiple incompatible domains that afflict instant messaging – the heroic efforts of gateway providers and multi-protocol clients notwithstanding .
Will we one day need accounts on every social website in order to stay in touch ?
Will someone need to write a Facebook / MySpace mail gateway ?
What can be done ?
For these sites , keeping control of the communication is a win , due to increased page views and application lock - in .
( This is one reason why they might be reluctant to support hCard , because it allows people to more easily take communication to another medium . )
Have you noticed that email addresses on Facebook are n’t hyperlinked as “ mailto ”s ?
I wonder why that is ?
So we should n’t look for help from there .
Making real email easier to use is a first step .
The fact that Thunderbird 2 has built - in support for accessing Gmail accounts is a good start ; this should be extended to other email providers .
Thunderbird could do with a Firefox - like UI simplification – several steps have been made in that area with QuickSearch and starring items .
We need to improve search speed and quality to make single - folder operation more workable .
There are some good points here too .
And we need to solve the spam problem , although I ’m not visionary enough to know how .
EPA
SINCE prices peaked in July last year , and drifted steadily back down , analysts and consumers alike have been hoping that the painful days are behind them .
No such luck .
Late in January the cost of a barrel of crude fell to $ 50 or so , as an unusually warm winter allowed inventories to build .
In the past couple of months , however , it has been steadily creeping higher .
On Tuesday March 27th prices shot up by more than $ 5 , touching $ 68.09 , as escalating tension between the West and Iran over the kidnapping of 15 British sailors sparked fears of a military clash in the Gulf .
The spike was temporary , but prices remain at a three - month high of about $ 63 ( see chart below ) .
A war with Iran is not particularly likely , but even the faintest possibility is unsettling .
Disruptions to Iran 's big oil fields , and possibly to Iraq 's , would be bad enough .
But threats to close the Strait of Hormuz , through which roughly a quarter of the world 's oil supplies passes , send shivers through oil markets .
Oil traders already have reason to feel nervous .
Big producers in the Middle East and elsewhere are plagued by security woes .
The bigger concern with Iran is how to tackle its nuclear programme , the source of long - term tension .
Iraq looks as unstable as ever , and America 's Congress is trying to fix a deadline for the withdrawal of American soldiers .
PDVSA , Venezuela 's state - run oil company , announced a sharp fall in 2006 profits on Tuesday , perhaps a sign that a lack of investment in the industry may be eroding the country 's productive capacity .
And there are anxiety - inducing predictions for this year 's hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico .
The impact of the bad news has been exacerbated because supplies were already tightening .
OPEC producers , whose governments have grown reliant on high prices to shore up their domestic political support , have been keen to keep the cost of a barrel of oil above $ 50 .
And demand in the 30 - odd developed nations that make up the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has been unexpectedly strong .
The latest report from the International Energy Agency , which monitors stockpiles , suggests that OECD inventories fell by 8.6 m barrels in January , as eager consumers drew down the supplies amassed during the warm days of early winter .
As inventories are cut , the effect of bad news is likely to be felt more quickly .
It is unclear how well the world economy will hold up if prices get back to levels , as much as $ 78 a barrel , seen last year .
During the appreciation that saw the oil price roughly triple between 2004 and 2006 , economists waited with bated breath for an oil - induced crash .
That never came .
Now , in some ways , the world economy is better braced to absorb high prices .
Europe 's big economies show every sign of finally generating some domestic demand , as does Japan , which seems to have pulled out of its decade - long slump .
But in contrast the engine of global economic growth for the past five years , America , is now flirting with a housing - induced recession .
If petroleum prices rise further , the world economy will need Europe and Japan to drive growth , as gas - guzzling America is looking vulnerable .
Yet domestic demand in places like Germany and Japan needs to pick up quite a bit more yet , if America 's overstretched consumers trim back .
More scary is if there is a sudden spike in prices .
The 2004 - 2006 appreciation was rapid , but relatively smooth .
Shocks like the Tuesday 's after - hours surge will have a more disturbing impact , as buyers suddenly slash their spending , as happened in America after hurricane Katrina disrupted supplies .
The threats in Iraq , Iran , and elsewhere , have arguable grown worse since last year .
It may be time to put away the Hummer catalogue and to start looking at the price of ultra-economy cars .

Here ’s a passage from page 517 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows :
( Ron ’s brother Bill is warning Harry against trusting a goblin Griphook . )
“ You do n’t understand , Harry , nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins .
To a goblin , the rightful and true master of any object is the maker , not the purchaser .
All goblin - made objects are , in goblin eyes , rightfully theirs . ”
“ But if it was bought – ”
“- then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money .
They have , however , great difficulty with the idea of goblin - made objects passing from wizard to wizard . [… ]
They consider our habit of keeping goblin - made objects , passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment , little more than theft . ”
Event overview :
Why do we fall in love ?
Can humans really experience love at first sight ?
Why do we prefer one person over another ?
Anthropologist and author Helen Fisher will address these age - old questions and more as she shares her insight into how the brain shapes how we love .
In her work , Dr. Fisher distinguishes three primary drives that evolved for reproduction : the sex drive , romantic love , and long - term attachment .
She will discuss how these three brain networks interact to shape our mating and reproductive strategies .
Then using anthropological data and the results of brain scanning studies of men and women who are happily in love and rejected in love , she will reveal the basic traits of romantic love , frustration attraction , abandonment rage , the despair response , addiction to love , and other phenomena associated with romantic passion .
Her talk will conclude with global trends that are shaping patterns of sexual behavior , romance , and marriage .
Helen Fisher earned her Ph.D. at the University of Colorado .
She has conducted extensive research on the evolution of human sex , love , and marriage and gender differences in the brain .
She is the author of Why We Love : The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love and Anatomy of Love : The Natural History of Mating , Marriage , and Why We Stray .
Her work has been featured in Time and The New York Times .

HST is a space - based great observatory that observes at ultraviolet through near infrared wavelengths .
High resolution imaging and wide - ranging spectroscopic capabilities enable forefront research across all domains of astrophysics .
Time on HST is awarded through an open peer - reviewed competition .
The Hubble Space Telescope 's launch in 1990 sped humanity to one of its greatest advances in that journey .
Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth .
Its position above the atmosphere gives it a view of the universe that typically far surpasses that of ground - based telescopes .
Thirty years since launch , the Hubble Space Telescope continues its role at the forefront of astronomy , ranging from our own Solar System to the high - redshift universe .
Through the middle of the next decade , HST will remain the only space - based telescope providing spectroscopy and high - resolution imaging at UV , optical , and near - infrared wavelengths .
With the launch of JWST in 2021 , the bold science questions pursued with HST will be bolstered by the complementary capabilities of the two observatories .
NGC 3627 , part of the Hubble Space Telescope 's Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey ( LEGUS ) , the sharpest , most comprehensive ultraviolet - light survey of star - forming galaxies in the nearby universe .
The images are a blend of ultraviolet light and visible light from Hubble 's Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys .

Former U.S. vice - president Al Gore said Tuesday that some of the world 's largest energy companies , including Exxon Mobil Corp. , are funding research aimed at disputing the scientific consensus on global warming as part of a campaign to mislead the public .
ExxonMobil , the world 's largest publicly traded oil company , rejected the allegation .
" There has been an organized campaign , financed to the tune of about $ 10 million a year from some of the largest carbon polluters , to create the impression that there is disagreement in the scientific community " about global warming , Gore said at a forum in Singapore .
" In actuality , there is very little disagreement .
" This is one of the strongest of scientific consensus views in the history of science .
We live in a world where what used to be called propaganda now has a major role to play in shaping public opinion . "
Gore likened the campaign to that of the millions of dollars spent by U.S. tobacco companies years ago on creating the appearance of uncertainty and debate within the scientific community on the harmful effects of smoking cigarettes .
" Some of the tobacco companies spent millions of dollars to create the appearance that there was disagreement on the science .
And some of the large coal and utility companies and the largest oil company , ExxonMobil , have been involved in doing that exact same thing for the last several years , " Gore said .
After the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , made up of the world 's top climate scientists , released a report in February that warned the cause of global warming is " very likely " man-made , " the deniers offered a bounty of $ 10,000 for each article disputing the consensus that people could crank out and get published somewhere , " Gore said .
" They 're trying to manipulate opinion and they are taking us for fools , " he said .
Funding does n't equal influence : Exxon
On Tuesday , ExxonMobil spokesman Gantt Walton said the company 's financial support for scientific reports did not mean it influenced the outcome of those studies .
ExxonMobil believes the risk that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change warrants taking action to limit them , he said .
" The recycling of this type of discredited conspiracy theory diverts attention from the real challenge at hand : how to provide the energy needed to improve global living standards while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions , " he said .
Gore said that with growing awareness of climate change , the world will see an acceleration in efforts to fight the problem and urged businesses to recognize that reducing carbon emissions is in their long - term interest .
But while Washington should lead by example , he said developing nations also have to play a part .
" Countries like China , just to give an example , which will next year be the largest emitter in the world , can't be excluded just because it 's technically a developing country , " Gore said .
" When you look at the absolute amount of CO2 each year and going forward , China will soon surpass the U.S. "
Just yesterday , we covered an article titled , “ Can Ya Spare A Job Brother ? ” which covered the job losses on a national level , but today , AZFamily is bringing it down to a more local level here in the Valley of the Sun .
Foreclosures , financial troubles and even layoffs ; the housing bubble has begun to burst and now mortgage companies are feeling all the pain .
Usually when we see an industry grow really fast , whether it ’s the stock market or the housing market experts tell us around the corner there ’s an adjustment to that , a crash or a leveling out .
It ’s the ebb and flow of business , but it has hit many in the Valley hard .
Amy Eagen should know because after two and half years with The Mortgage Investor Group in Scottsdale she ’s out of a job .
“ It hurt a little bit , because they were there two weeks ago and they said we will stay open , we will make it through this hard time , ” she said .
Just yesterday , her company closed the Scottsdale branch , the California and Oregon branch leaving this seven month pregnant woman wondering about heath insurance for a baby on the way .
She ’s not alone , this week First National Bank of Arizona laid off 350 mortgage related staff positions and last week Tucson based mortgage lender First Magnus gave the pink slips to five thousand people .
“ This is one of the biggest problems we ’ve seen in a decade or two , whether it ’ll be a long or short , do n’t really know , ” Creg Ostler said .
Managing partner Ostler said the problem is widespread , pointing to the fact that Countrywide Financial , the nation ’s number one mortgage lender had to tap an $ 11 billion line of credit and is toughening underwriting standards on home loans .
He said we ’re going back to the way , home loans were created decades ago .
He adds that right now the debt markets are n’t functioning really well , the federal reserve is having to pump money in , and lower interest rates .

In the meantime that leaves folks like Amy , having to make other arrangements to afford her baby on board .
Amy spent her first day without a job applying for health insurance .

Activist Arrested In Dispute Over Hot-Button Sales At Public Market
By Matt Zapotosky
Washington Post Staff Writer
The 74 - year - old retired mathematician who is fighting Kensington officials over his right to sell buttons urging President Bush ’s impeachment was arrested yesterday at a farmers market and charged with trespassing .
Alan McConnell , who had been selling his “ Impeach Him ” buttons at the Howard Avenue market for about a half - hour without a permit , lay down on the pavement after Montgomery County police asked him to come with them .
After McConnell failed to respond to a request that he “ please stand up , ” four officers each grabbed one of his limbs and carried him to the front seat of a squad car .

INTERNAL HARDWARE
Energy innovations
To ensure the laptop is robust and can be maintained as easily as possible it omits all moving parts .
It has no hard drive , CD or DVD drive .
As it also packs a low power processor it has no cooling fans .
Storage : Instead of a large hard drive the laptop has 1GB of flash memory , similar to that used in some digital cameras .
The memory can be expanded using an SD memory card slot underneath the screen or by plugging in peripheral devices through the USB ports .
Files can also be backed up on to a " school server " - a larger computer installed in a classroom - or via an online system provided by search giant Google .
HARDWARE OVERVIEW Processor : AMD 433 MHz Memory : 256MB SDRAM Storage : 1GB Flash
Processor :
The chip , made by AMD , is much slower than most in today 's PCs , operating at a speed of just 433M Hz .
In comparison , some of today 's high performance machines have multiple chips with speeds of up to 3GHz .
The off - the - shelf processor is designed to be energy efficient .
Unlike a standard chip , which remains active even when nothing changes on screen , the AMD processor is able to shut itself down , only waking when it is needed .
It has an inbuilt graphics card .
Wi-fi :
To conserve as much battery power as possible the wi-fi adapter can operate even when the main processor is switched off or asleep .
It is able to do this by having its own in - built low power chip .
The adapter supports standard wireless protocols used in most homes and offices .
SOFTWARE
Different programs appear in the doughnut icon as they are opened
The laptop has a bespoke Linux operating system ( OS ) developed by leading open source software company Red Hat .
In contrast to sometimes costly proprietary software , open source software is free and allows users to access and alter the code .
OLPC hopes some children will tinker with the code to develop new programs .
In comparison to standard operating systems ( OS ) , it is very small when compressed , taking up just 130 MB of space .
By comparison , Windows XP takes up around ten times that amount , requiring 1.5 GB of hard drive space .
Its user interface is known as Sugar .
At the centre of the screen is a customised icon surrounded by a white circle known as the " doughnut " .
As different programs are opened icons appear in the doughnut .
Different programs take up different amounts of space on the ring depending on their size and system requirements .
Because of the machine 's limited memory , when the doughnut is full , no more programs can be opened .
It includes standard programs such as a web browser based on Firefox ; a word processor able to handle most common document types , including Microsoft formats ; a PDF reader and media player .
In addition , it comes with games , a music creation tool and drawing programs .
WI-FI
The wi-fi antennas are also known as rabbit ears
One of the most recognisable features of the laptop is the dual wi-fi antennas , known affectionately as " rabbit ears " .
These boost the range of the wireless connection by between two - and three - times the normal range .
A test done in the outback of Australia under ideal conditions showed that two laptops could communicate more than 2 km ( 1.2 miles ) apart .
In reality , the range will be much shorter than this .
Using standard wireless protocols , the laptops are automatically able to form a " mesh network " where each machine acts as both laptop and router , able to pass information between computers .
If one laptop is switched on in range of an internet connection ( usually at a local school ) all other laptops on the network can share the access .
Those computers furthest from the connection will have the lowest internet speeds .
If there is no internet access , the laptops can still share data , video and information through the mesh .
It does not have an Ethernet port for use with wired internet connections .
SCREEN
The laptop has a low power dual - mode display , allowing children to toggle between colour and black - and - white screens .
Designed for use in outdoor classrooms , the full - colour transmissive mode is similar to any other Liquid Crystal Display ( LCD ) , but in ultra low - power black - and - white mode the screen is readable in direct sunlight .
Many companies are interested in using the technology in standard laptop displays .
SCREEN OVERVIEW 19 cm ( 7.5 inches ) LCD display Colour mode : Resolution 800x600 ( 133dpi ) ; power consumption 1 watt Black and white mode : Resolution 1200x900 ( 200d pi ) ; power consumption 0.2 watt ; sunlight readable
The screen can also swivel around to convert the laptop into an e-book or a games console .
It is also easily maintained .
For example , a faulty backlight - a common complaint on aging laptops - can be replaced by undoing two screws .
POWER SUPPLY
A range of power supplies are available to countries buying the laptop .
Two choices of rechargeable battery are offered with different chemistries .
Both cost $ 10 ( £ 5 ) to replace and hold their charge for at least four - times the amount of time as a normal laptop battery , according to OLPC .
For areas with an electricity supply , the computer can be used with an 18W power adapter .
In areas without access to the grid , various contraptions have been designed to plug directly into the laptop including a solar panel , a hand crank ( similar to those used on wind - up radios ) , a foot pedal and a pull - string recharger , similar to a starter cord on a lawnmower .
The pull - string gives 10 minutes of charge for every minute of pulling .
Group recharging stations can also be bought for schools where multiple batteries can be hooked up to solar panels or car batteries .
KEYBOARD
The sealed rubber keyboard is child - sized and waterproof
The sealed green rubber keyboard is waterproof and its size is designed for a child 's hands .
As well as being offered in a standard QWERTY layout it has various configurations for different languages such as Thai , Arabic , Spanish , and Urdu .
In addition , the keyboard does away with low - use keys such as Caps Lock .
In their place are new buttons such as the " geek key " or " view source " , which allows children to quickly see the underlying code used to write the program running on screen .
A " grab " key allows children to pan and scroll around the screen while a slider key on the top left - hand - side of the keyboard allows users to quickly see who else is part of the mesh network , who they are working with on collaborative projects and which of their friends are online .
Keys either side of the screen below the inbuilt speakers are used for gaming and reading e-books .
A touchpad allows children to control the cursor and can be used as a drawing tablet using a stylus or the back of a pen .
PLASTIC CASE
The hard - wearing plastic case is waterproof and dustproof
The hard - wearing green and white plastic case is designed to be as waterproof and dustproof as possible for children walking to and from school .
When it is closed the wi-fi antennas lock the laptop and cover the only external openings , the data ports .
The laptop has been dropped from 1.6 m ( 5 ft ) , with the antennas up , with no breakages .
According to OLPC , the laptop keyboard has also been dunked in water for 10 minutes with no effect .
The entire package is approximately half the weight and size of a standard laptop .
Holes either side of the carry handle allow children to tie a scarf or string to the laptop so it can be carried over the shoulder .
It also features a coloured XO on the back cover .
There are 400 different colour combinations so that children can easily distinguish their laptop .
In the future , the plastic case may be swapped for durable rubber .
VIDEO CAMERA
Laptop on Click Situated on the right hand side of the screen , the still and motion capture camera allows video chat across the mesh network and the internet .
With a resolution of 640x480 , the colour camera can also be used to take photographs or as a light meter for school projects .
DATA PORTS
The rabbit ears cover the usb ports when the case is closed
Three USB ports will make it possible to connect a variety of peripherals including a mouse or larger keyboard .
A microphone input and a line output will allow children to play music through external speakers and record sounds .
All of the ports are covered by the wi-fi antennas when the laptop is closed , preventing water and dust getting inside .
An SD memory card slot , underneath the screen can be used to expand the memory capacity or to load new software .
I was going to have Richard phoning 555- 2368 in the last pane but I was informed this was way too obscure a reference .
No body photos from anybody yet .
Ghost Bruce Perens was planned whether I had bodies or not , so that ’s ok .
ELER t- shirts are in the pipeline .
They ’ll be black , with big cartoony text that will read “ EVERYBODY LOVES ERIC RAYMOND ” on the front with “ ( except me ) ” in smaller text underneath .
They ’ll probably cost around £ 10 or so , and I ’ll donate some money from each to the FSF .
That ’s about 15 Euros , and about 827 dollars .
If you ’d be interested please drop me a quick line at eler@geekz.co.uk with what size you ’d go for .
Do n’t send me credit card numbers or scanned - in money just yet , nothing is guaranteed .

Myth : Intelligent people tend to be more religious .
Fact : Intelligent people tend to be more secular .
Summary
The broad consensus of research shows that people with higher IQs tend to be less religious , not more so .
Argument
Is it more logical to be a Christian ?
Is religion the natural choice of a smart person familiar with more of the evidence ?
Not according to a broad consensus of studies on IQ and religiosity .
These studies have consistently found that the lower the IQ score , the more likely a person is to be religious .
To place these studies in perspective , it is helpful to know the general religious attitudes of Americans today .
According to a February 1995 Gallup poll , 96 percent of all Americans believe in God , and 88 percent affirm the importance of religion .
However , the degree of religiosity within this group varies considerably .
Only 35 percent can be classified as " religious , " using a definition that requires them to consider religion important and attend religious services at least once a week .
And a March 1994 Gallup poll found that only 20 percent of all Americans belong to that politically active group known as " Christian conservatives . "
The following is a review of several studies of IQ and religiosity , paraphrased and summarized from Burnham Beckwith 's article , " The Effect of Intelligence on Religious Faith , " Free Inquiry , Spring 1986 : ( 1 )
STUDIES OF STUDENTS
1. Thomas Howells , 1927
Study of 461 students showed religiously conservative students " are , in general , relatively inferior in intellectual ability . "
2. Hilding Carlsojn , 1933
Study of 215 students showed that " there is a tendency for the more intelligent undergraduate to be sympathetic toward atheism . "
3. Abraham Franzblau , 1934
Confirming Howells and Carlson , tested 354 Jewish children , aged 10 - 16 .
Found a negative correlation between religiosity and IQ as measured by the Terman intelligence test .
4. Thomas Symington , 1935
Tested 400 young people in colleges and church groups .
He reported , " There is a constant positive relation in all the groups between liberal religious thinking and mental ability
There is also a constant positive relation between liberal scores and intelligence "
5. Vernon Jones , 1938
Tested 381 students , concluding " a slight tendency for intelligence and liberal attitudes to go together . "
6. A. R. Gilliland , 1940
At variance with all other studies , found " little or no relationship between intelligence and attitude toward god . "
7. Donald Gragg , 1942
Reported an inverse correlation between 100 ACE freshman test scores and Thurstone " reality of god " scores .
8. Brown and Love , 1951
At the University of Denver , tested 613 male and female students .
The mean test scores of non-believers was 119 points , and for believers it was 100 .
The non-believers ranked in the 80th percentile , and believers in the 50th .
Their findings " strongly corroborate those of Howells . "
9. Michael Argyle , 1958
Concluded that " although intelligent children grasp religious concepts earlier , they are also the first to doubt the truth of religion , and intelligent students are much less likely to accept orthodox beliefs . "
10 . Jeffrey Hadden , 1963
Found no correlation between intelligence and grades .
This was an anomalous finding , since GPA corresponds closely with intelligence .
Other factors may have influenced the results at the University of Wisconsin .
11 . Young , Dustin and Holtzman , 1966
Average religiosity decreased as GPA rose .
12 . James Trent , 1967
Polled 1400 college seniors .
Found little difference , but high - ability students in his sample group were over - represented .
13 . C. Plant and E. Minium , 1967
The more intelligent students were less religious , both before entering college and after 2 years of college .
14 . Robert Wuthnow , 1978
Of 532 students , 37 percent of Christians , 58 percent of apostates , and 53 percent of non-religious scored above average on SATs .
15 . Hastings and Hoge , 1967 , 1974
Polled 200 college students and found no significant correlations .
16 . Norman Poythress , 1975
Mean SATs for strongly antireligious ( 1148 ) , moderately anti-religious ( 1119 ) , slightly antireligious ( 1108 ) , and religious ( 1022 ) .
17 . Wiebe and Fleck , 1980
Studied 158 male and female Canadian university students .
They reported " nonreligious S's tended to be strongly intelligent " and " more intelligent than religious S's . "
STUDENT BODY COMPARISONS
1. Rose Goldsen , 1952
Percentage of students who believe in a divine god : Harvard 30 ; UCLA 32 ; Dartmouth 35 ; Yale 36 ; Cornell 42 ; Wayne 43 ; Weslyan 43 ; Michigan 45 ; Fisk 60 ; Texas 62 ; North Carolina 68 .
2. National Review Study , 1970
Percentage of students who believe in a Spirit or Divine God : Reed 15 ; Brandeis 25 ; Sarah Lawrence 28 ; Williams 36 ; Stanford 41 ; Boston U. 41 ; Yale 42 ; Howard 47 ; Indiana 57 ; Davidson 59 ; S. Carolina 65 ; Marquette 77 .
3. Caplovitz and Sherrow , 1977
Apostasy rates rose continuously from 5 percent in " low " ranked schools to 17 percent in " high " ranked schools .
4. Niemi , Ross , and Alexander , 1978
In elite schools , organized religion was judged important by only 26 percent of their students , compared with 44 percent of all students .
STUDIES OF VERY - HIGH IQ GROUPS
1. Terman , 1959
Studied group with IQ 's over 140 .
Of men , 10 percent held strong religious belief , of women 18 percent .
Sixty - two percent of men and 57 percent of women claimed " little religious inclination " while 28 percent of the men and 23 percent of the women claimed it was " not at all important . "
2. Warren and Heist , 1960
Found no differences among National Merit Scholars .
Results may have been effected by the fact that NM scholars are not selected on the basis of intelligence or grades alone , but also on " leadership " and such like .
3. Southern and Plant , 1968
Studied 42 male and 30 female members of Mensa .
Mensa members were much less religious in belief than the typical American college alumnus or adult .
STUDIES Of SCIENTISTS
1. William S. Ament , 1927
C. C. Little , president of the University of Michigan , checked persons listed in Who 's Who in America : " Unitarians , Episcopalians , Congregationalists , Universalists , and Presbyterians [ who are less religious ] are far more numerous in Who 's
Who than would be expected on the basis of the population which they form .
Baptists , Methodists , and Catholics are distinctly less numerous . "
Ament confirmed Little 's conclusion .
He noted that Unitarians , the least religious , were more than 40 times as numerous in Who 's Who as in the U.S. population .
2. Lehman and Witty , 1931
Identified 1189 scientists found in both Who 's Who ( 1927 ) and American Men of Science ( 1927 ) .
Only 25 percent of those listed in the latter and 50 percent of those in the former reported their religious denomination , despite the specific request to do so , under the heading of " religious denomination ( if any ) . "
Well over 90 percent of the general population claims religious affiliation .
The figure of 25 percent suggests far less religiosity among scientists .
Unitarians were 81.4 times as numerous among eminent scientists as non-Unitarians .
3. Kelley and Fisk , 1951
Found a negative ( -.39 ) correlation between the strength of religious values and research competence .
[ How these were measured is unknown . ]
4. Ann Roe , 1953
Interviewed 64 " eminent scientists , nearly all members of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences or the American Philosophical Society .
She reported that , while nearly all of them had religious parents and had attended Sunday school , ' now only three of these men are seriously active in church .
A few others attend upon occasion , or even give some financial support to a church which they do not attend
All the others have long since dismissed religion as any guide to them , and the church plays no part in their lives A few are militantly atheistic , but most are just not interested . ' "
5. Francis Bello , 1954
Interviewed or questionnaired 107 nonindustrial scientists under the age of 40 judged by senior colleagues to be outstanding .
Of the 87 responses , 45 percent claimed to be " agnostic or atheistic " and an additional 22 percent claimed no religious affiliation .
For 20 most eminent , " the proportion who are now a-religious is considerably higher than in the entire survey group . "
6. Jack Chambers , 1964
Questionnaired 740 US psychologists and chemists .
He reported , " The highly creative men significantly more often show either no preference for a particular religion or little or no interest in religion . "
Found that the most eminent psychologists showed 40 percent no preference , 16 percent for the most eminent chemists .
7. Vaughan , Smith , and Sjoberg , 1965
Polled 850 US physicists , zoologists , chemical engineers , and geologists listed in American Men of Science ( 1955 ) on church membership , and attendance patterns , and belief in afterlife .
Of the 642 replies , 38.5 percent did not believe in an afterlife , whereas 31.8 percent did .
Belief in immortality was less common among major university staff than among those employed by business , government , or minor universities .
The Gallup poll taken about this time showed that two - thirds of the U.S. population believed in an afterlife , so scientists were far less religious than the typical adult .
Conclusion
The consensus here is clear : more intelligent people tend not to believe in religion .
And this observation is given added force when you consider that the above studies span a broad range of time , subjects and methodologies , and yet arrive at the same conclusion .
This is the result even when the researchers are Christian conservatives themselves .
One such researcher is George Gallup .
Here are the results of a Fall 1995 Gallup poll :
Percentage of respondents who agreed with the following statements : Religion is Religion can " very important " answer all or most Respondents in their life " of today 's problems "
------------------------------------------------------------
Attended college 53 percent 58 percent
No college 63 65 Income over $ 50,000 48 56 $ 30,000 - $ 50,000 56 62 $ 20,000 - $ 30,000 56 60 Under $ 20,000 66 66
Why does this correlation exist ?
The first answer that comes to mind is that religious beliefs tend to be more illogical or incoherent than secular beliefs , and intelligent people tend to recognize that more quickly .
But this explanation will surely be rejected by religious people , who will seek other explanations and rationalizations .
A possible counter - argument is that intelligent people tend to be more successful than others .
The lure of worldly success and materialism draws many of these intellectually gifted individuals away from God .
After all , who needs
God when you ( apparently ) are making it on your own ?
However , this argument does not withstand closer scrutiny .
Most of the studies outlined above describe the religious attitudes of students , who have yet to enter the working world , much less succeed in it .
Some might then argue that the most intelligent students are nonetheless succeeding in school .
But " success " in school ( for those who may have forgotten ! ) is more measured in terms of popularity , sports , physical attractiveness , personality , clothes , etc .
Grades are but one of many measures of success in a young person 's life -- one that is increasingly becoming less important , as many social critics point out .
The simplest and most parsimonious explanation is that religion is a set of logical and factual claims , and those with the most logic and facts at their disposal are rejecting it largely on those grounds .

SACRAMENTO --
Making good on a promise to trim the state budget , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger eliminated a $ 55 - million program Friday that advocates say has helped thousands of mentally ill homeless people break the costly cycle of hospitalization , jails and street life .
The program was one of many high - profile initiatives left in the ashes of the Legislature ’s bitter budget dispute , which stalled Sacramento for much of the last two months .
The impasse lifted Tuesday after Senate Republicans ended their blockade .
They won few concessions , except a promise from the governor to veto $ 700 million from the general fund in an effort to address the state ’s operating deficit .
Schwarzenegger delivered Friday , citing the state ’s need to establish a “ prudent reserve , ” then signing the $ 145.5 - billion budget -- more than seven weeks past the state ’s July 1 deadline .
Advertisement
Among the cuts : $ 1.3 million to track hospital efforts to eliminate infections , which kill more than 7,000 Californians a year ; $ 30 million for state parks ; and $ 6 million to compel drug manufacturers to discount medicines for lower - income people .
Schwarzenegger ordered state health officials to find more than $ 6 million in other parts of the budget to keep the drug program alive , but the cuts will delay the website the state was going to set up to tell consumers which discounts were available .
He also struck a $ 17.4 - million plan to protect senior citizens .
The overhaul of the state ’s conservatorship system was approved last year after an investigation in The Times that detailed how a system intended to protect seniors was plagued with fraud and abuse .

At the time , top Schwarzenegger officials said the overhaul demonstrated his determination to protect the elderly .
Assemblyman Dave Jones ( D - Sacramento ) , who championed the reform effort , said the money was “ critical to preventing horrendous abuses of our most frail and vulnerable seniors . ”
None of the cuts , however , elicited a more vehement outcry than the elimination of the program for the homeless mentally ill .
The program had been on the chopping block all summer .
Advocates , including the architects of California ’s effort to overhaul the state ’s troubled mental health system , had staged a furious lobbying effort to stave off the cut .
But in justifying it , Department of Finance spokesman H.D. Palmer said local governments should step in instead .
“ We believe if these programs are a priority to counties , they have resources available to them to provide funding , ” he said .
Advertisement
Counties across the state , however , are facing the slow erosion of their traditional mental health budgets .
State Sen. Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) , who created the just - eliminated program in 1999 , called the cut “ unconscionable . ”
He noted that despite the allegedly strapped conditions of the state , legislators managed to preserve a tax break for some purchasers of yachts , planes and recreational vehicles -- a measure that could cost the state as much as $ 45 million .
“ A $ 45 - million tax break for yacht owners stays in the budget , ” Steinberg said .
“ And a nationally recognized , incredibly effective program to end homelessness for those living with mental illness gets thrown under the bus . ”
The program served as the blueprint for Proposition 63 , the 1 % “ millionaires ’ tax ” established to overhaul the mental health system .
It is known as Integrated Services for Homeless Adults With Serious Mental Illness , or AB 2034 , after the bill that created it .

Built to expand services beyond traditional outpatient care , the program incorporates job training , housing assistance , even , at times , grocery - buying skills and dental care .
Schwarzenegger praised the program three years ago for creating “ significant savings at the local level . ”
It has served 13,000 people since November 1999 .
There are about 4,700 participants today .
Among those enrolled as of January , there were 81 % fewer days of incarceration , 65 % fewer days of psychiatric hospitalization and 76 % fewer days of homelessness compared with their pre-enrollment days .
Rusty Selix , executive director of the California Council of Community Mental Health Agencies -- like Steinberg , a Proposition 63 coauthor -- said the cost of incarceration can be six times higher than the cost of enrolling someone in the mental health program .
“ Rehabilitation costs money .
But it ’s worth it , ” said Adrienne Sheff , director of adult services at the San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center in Van Nuys .
Los Angeles County receives nearly a third of the state funds through AB 2034 and serves 1,700 people .

“ Clients getting jobs and housing -- I would rather see that for my tax dollar than I would want to see them roaming the streets , ” she said .
“ Once you harness their survivor skills , we have found that we can do wonders . ”
Several lawmakers at the center of the budget dispute did not return phone calls or could not be reached .
They included Senate Republican Leader Dick Ackerman of Irvine -- a yacht owner who pushed to ease the tax burden on owners of yachts , planes and RVs .
An Ackerman spokesman said the senator was unavailable .
In a statement , Ackerman said California was still facing a large budget deficit next year .
The state , he said , must “ start addressing next year ’s problem today . ”
Advocates have pledged to sue the state over the cut to the mental health program .

The voter - approved Proposition 63 forbade the state from dropping below its 2004 funding commitments to mental health .
That provision was intended to prevent the state from cutting with one hand while funding with the other -- a pattern that would neutralize an effort that advocates hope will mark a landmark turn in mental health .
A lawsuit probably would contend that the state violated that measure by slashing the program .
Proposition 63 also prohibits counties from using the new money to backfill old programs , meaning they cannot respond to the cut by simply using Proposition 63 money instead .
Yet in pushing for the cut , the administration has suggested precisely that Proposition 63 -- which is generating hundreds of millions of dollars -- could cushion the blow .
Palmer , the Department of Finance spokesman , said Friday that counties could use many funding sources , including Proposition 63 , to provide similar services .
County mental health directors have contended that such a move would place them in violation of the ballot measure .
Advertisement
Department of Finance Director Mike Genest denied that the administration was trying to use Proposition 63 to fund existing programs .
“ The primary reason for doing this is to save money , ” he said .
If the cut lands the state in court , the battle could take years .
And across the state , once - homeless participants in the program are already feeling the pinch .
Paul Culp , 46 , a college graduate overwhelmed by untreated bipolar disorder , was living under a Tehama County bridge when he was enrolled in the program .
Two years later , he has been reunited with his children and is supporting himself .

“ This program saved me from dying , ” he said .
“ I had that to fall back on , and now I do n’t .
Things seem to be going well , but it just takes one crisis to change that . ”

Amnesty says military steps are geared to protect settlers not Israel
Amnesty International says the body must have a mandate to investigate and prosecute offenders .
It also denounced the barrier Israel is building in the West Bank and called on Palestinians to end militant attacks .
The report marks 40 years since the Mid-East war which led to Israel 's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza .
Amnesty 's UK director Kate Allen said Israel could not justify its behaviour in the West Bank under security grounds .
" Legitimate security concerns are no excuse for ... the mistreatment of thousands of Palestinians in a massive programme of collective punishment , " she said .
In response to the report , Israel 's government defended its observance of international law , and Palestinian rights activists said what was needed was a peacekeeping force - not more monitors with no mandate to intervene .
Loops
Amnesty says the barrier is being built illegally .
This is the conclusion the International Court of Justice came to in an advisory ruling in 2004 .
It also says the barrier has caused unnecessary suffering , and even the deaths of Palestinians .
The UK - based group says it is unjustifiable because it does not separate Israel from the West Bank , but curtails Palestinian movement within the occupied territory .
The structure is almost half built , and when finished will be about twice the length of the Israel - West Bank boundary because of loops onto occupied land designed to protect Israeli settlements .
The report , " Enduring Occupation - Palestinians under siege in the West Bank " , also criticises government - backed Israeli settlement activity which it says is the reason behind many of the military measures .
Israel rejected the criticism , which Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres saying the Palestinians were responsible for their lot .
" The enormous problems caused by the security barrier are the consequences of the second intifada and the buses that the Palestinian suicide bombers coming from the West Bank exploded in Israel . "
Amnesty argues that Israeli military measures appear to exist mainly for the benefit of settlements , not citizens living in Israel .
Jurisdiction
Amnesty says that since September 2000 , Israeli forces have killed some 4,000 Palestinians , most of them unarmed civilians and including about 800 children .
Palestinian armed groups have killed more than 1,100 Israelis , some 750 of them civilians and including 120 children .
About a third of the Israeli civilians killed by Palestinian armed groups were settlers in the occupied territories .
Amnesty stressed that the settlers are civilians who should never be targeted .
The group said human rights violations by both sides highlighted the need for an effective international watchdog .

From the IronPython homepage
They should go ahead and drop that last qualify .
I want to make something very clear , and that is that I absolutely hate writing this post .
The IronPython project is really great , and I 've been impressed by what it has done , and my Microsoft 's embrace of the language .
Admiration does not trump worry , in this case .
A number of issues make IronPython simply not Python .
I 've been advocating this issue more and more recently , so it is about time I wrote at a moderate length about the issue .
In IronPython , str is unicode
IronPython does not encode or decode between str and unicode Now , it may be true that Python plans to drop the current behavior , make str unicode , and add a separate type specifically for dealing with byte strings ( See PEP 358 ) .
However , that is not the case yet , and jumping the gun and making str and unicode the same type is an absolutely incorrect non-solution .
This is not just a matter of taste , but a situation where IronPython is absolutely wrong .
I can make two arguments against this .

There is no encoding anywhere , in which this is the correct behavior .
When There Is No Bytestring , You Have to Look Elsewhere
Any Python code assuming , correctly , that str is a byte string type , is subject to implosion within IronPython and any IronPython code " properly " handling byte data simply can't import outside IronPython at all .
IronPython does not include any of these , so if you write software using them , do n't expect them to run on the .
Net runtime , just because IronPython claims compatibility .
You can probably access all the same facilities , but you have to do so through the .
Net APIs of similar facilities .
I am not even sure that the same facilities are provided there .
The sad fact about a lot of this , is that many fo the libraries not included in IronPython actually work perfectly , if they would include them in the distribution , without change .
Because of this , we have to resort to things I consider terrible , like two different Python scripts , both doing some basic HTTP downloads , and both being completely incompatible because they rely on entirely different APIs : IronPython through .
Net APIs and the real Python through
Does syntax alone make a language ?
Maybe one day it could , but those days died out .
Python is far more than its clean , beautiful syntax .
The libraries that come in the standard library provide even more value .
As a foundation for all the software built on top , these packages are fundamental to the success of Python .
Yes , your code looks beautiful all on its own , but all on its own it does not have an embedded database configuration parser , and mail and web servers .
Right there you have a basis for a huge number of applications , without even leaving the language 's vanilla installation .

Conclusion Language and LibraryConclusion
completely incompatible code
While Fuzzyman is over at the voidspace , talking about how great it is that , in IronPython , str and unicode are the same things , I 'm over here getting more worried every day about the segmentation of Python and IronPython .
One of the most important issues about dealing with unicode is the difference between unicode or unicode strings of text and encoding strings of text or bytestreams containing encoded text , which may be decoded into understandable unicode ( Joel has covered all this ) .
IronPython implicitly can not do this .
A str with a non-ASCII " byte " cannot be encoded by Python , if you do n't tell it the encoding being used .
This is no flaw , it is the law .
IronPython , having no str type , effectively , just assumes the bytes over 128 are taken as the corresponding codepoints .
That 's right .
They just give you a known bad result , and let it go .
So what happens when you truly need to work with byte strings in IronPython , which pretends byte strings are unicode strings ?
Well , you have to look elsewhere .
Of course , the entire .
Net API is at your finger tips , so look no further than System .
Byte and System .
Array , of course .
Sounds easy , but the danger here should be obvious .
IronPython takes the syntax , but stops short of the language .
The problem is one for both Python and IronPython lovers .
In Python land , we 're seeing what appears to be an influx of interest from the IronPython ( also , via Silverlight ) world , but all those new developers are creating .
IronPython advocates , on the other hand , look silly to think they are promoting the Python language , and are completely missing out on hundreds of great libraries , years of built up community , and synergy that is n't just a buzzword .
I really want this to all work out .
IronPython , can we get along ?
Senior US official likens challenges facing America , Roman Republic John Byrne

Get our breaking politics news feed .
The US comptroller general David Walker issued a report last week in Chicago in which he likened the present situation in the United States to the Roman Republic or an organization that fails to adapt and " may not survive . "
Nobody reported it .
The first report of the speech came today in London 's Financial Times .
Walker , who heads the Congressional , nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has offered dire forecasts for the United States in the past .
In interviews with 60 Minutes and NPR , he 's said that he believes the US cannot continue to live at such levels of prosperity indefinitely , since much of current prosperity is erected upon debt .
" Throughout history , many great nations have also failed to survive , " Walker told an audience in Chicago last week .
" I should point out that the longest standing republic and the major superpower of its day no longer exists , and that 's the Roman Republic . "
He warned of striking similarities  between the current crises facing America and the factors toppled Rome , including declining moral values and political civility at home , an over - confident and over - extended military in foreign lands and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government . "
" In my view , " he added , " it 's time to learn from history and take steps to ensure the American Republic is the first to stand the test of time . "
America 's top government inspector did n't stop there .
He also bemoaned US fiscal policy , underfunded healthcare , poor public schools , lack of retirement benefits , a worsening environment , Iraq , aging infrastructure and immigration policy .
His remark about " aging infrastructure " came just days before the Minneapolis bridge collapse .
" Simply stated , America is on a path toward an explosion of debt , " he added .
" And that indebtedness threatens our country 's , our children's , and our grandchildren 's futures . "
" Long range simulations from my agency are chilling , " he continued .
" If we continue as we have , policy makers will eventually have to dramatically and / or slash government services the American people depend on and take for granted .
Just pick a program -- student loans , the interstate highway system , national parks , federal law enforcement , and even our armed forces . "
In a May 60 Minutes broadcast Walker warned that the US faced a " fiscal cancer . "
" The fact is , is that we do n't face an immediate crisis , " he told CBS .
" And , so people say , ' What 's the problem ? '
The answer is , we suffer from a fiscal cancer .
It is growing within us .
And if we do not treat it , it could have catastrophic consequences for our country . "
" If nothing changes , the federal government 's not gonna be able to do much more than pay interest on the mounting debt and some entitlement benefits , " he added .
" It wo n't have money left for anything else  national defense , homeland security , education , you name it . "

Cheney at 13 %
Cheney 's personal favorability rating according to NYTimes polling .
Honestly , I am skeptical .
That number seems impossibly low .
In any event , if that is not exciting enough , watch me take on the Beltway Elite ( not really , it 's our friend Conn Carroll of the Blogometer ) on all things Netroots , Iraq and politics .
Divers recovered the body of a 18 - year - old boy this morning from a pond north of Greeley after he and a friend had driven an old car into the water during a stunt Friday night .
The 18 - year - old , David Griego , and 19 - year - old Darren Bucklen , both of Greeley , sped over a dirt ramp they built at the lake ’s edge and flew 40 feet from the shore in an older car that they had cut the roof off of , said Dale Lyman , spokesman for the Union Colony First Rescue Authority in Weld County .
The car quickly sank , and the victim and his companion came to the surface , Lyman said .
Friends watched as the boys struggled in the water at 9 p.m. and one sank in 25 feet of water , Lyman said .
Apparently Griego was having trouble swimming , possibly because he was injured , Lyman said .
“ This is absolutely insane , ” he said .
“ I ’m not sure what would move someone to try to do this .
They intentionally drove this vehicle into the lake .
It ’s just a huge question mark . ”
Eight divers began searching for the body about 7:30 a.m. , Lyman said .
The body was recovered about 9:30 a.m .
The two friends had built the ramp , about 2 to 3 feet high .
They were traveling about 35 mph when they reached the ramp , he said .
When the two surfaced , Griego was struggling to stay afloat in the pond , which covers about 3 acres , Lyman said .
“ He was in the state of panic and was pulling the older boy down , ” he said .
Divers attached a cable to the car and were pulling it out of the lake , Lyman said .
Margie Martinez , spokeswoman for the Weld County Sheriff ’s Department , said an investigation is underway .
Deputies may consult with the district attorney ’s office for any possible charges .
“ Any time anybody is going into the water they should have life vests on , ” Martinez said .

Functional Functions and the Python Singleton Unpattern
subscribers = [ ]
def addSubscriber ( subscriber ) :
subscribers.append(subscriber )
def publish ( message ) :
for subscriber in subscribers :
subscriber.notify ( message )
And then used it like this ?
from publisher import publish
class worker :
def work ( self ) :
publish ( self )
I 've done this many times myself .
I used to think that this was the " right " way to implement Singletons in Python .
Other languages had static members and synchronized static accessors and factory methods ; all kinds of rigamarole to achieve this effect , but Python simply had modules .
Now , however , I realize that there is no " right " way to implement Singleton in Python , because singletons are simply a bad thing to have .
As
The module above is brittle , and as a result , unpleasant to test and extend .
It 's difficult to test because the call to " publish " cannot be indirected without monkeying around with the module 's globals - generally recognized to be poor style , and prone to errors which will corrupt later , unrelated tests .
It makes code that interacts with it difficult to test , because while you can temporary mangle global variables in the most egregious of whitebox tests , tests for code that is further away should n't need to know about the implementation detail of " publish " .
Furthermore , code which adds subscribers to the global list will destructively change the behavior of later tests ( or later code , if you try to invoke your tests in a running environment , since we all know running environments are where the interesting bugs occur ) .
It 's difficult to extend because there is no explicit integration point with ' publish ' , and all instances share the same look - up .
If you want to override the behavior of " work " and send it to a different publisher , you can't call to the superclass 's implementation .
Unfortunately , this probably does n't seem particularly bad , because bad examples abound .
It 's just the status quo .
Twisted 's twisted .
python.log module is used everywhere like this .
The standard library 's sys.path , sys.stdin/out/err , warnings.warn_explicit , and probably a dozen examples I can't think of off the top of my head , all work like this .
And there 's a good reason that this keeps happening .
Sometimes , you feel as though your program really does need a " global " registry for some reason ; you find yourself wanting access to the same central object in a variety of different places .
It seems convenient to have it available , and it basically works .
Here 's a technique for implementing that convenience , while still allowing for a clean point of integration with other code .
First , make your " global " thing be a class .
class Publisher :
def __init__( self ) :
self.subscribers = [ ]
def addSubscriber ( self , subscriber ) :
self.subscribers.append(subscriber )
def publish ( self , message ) :
for subscriber in self .
subscribers :
subscriber.notify ( message )
the Publisher = Publisher ( ) Second , decide and document how " global " you mean .
Is it global to your process ?
Global to a particular group of objects ?
Global to a certain kind of class ?
Document that , and make sure it is clear who should use the singleton you 've created .
At some point in the future , someone will almost certainly come along with a surprising requirement which makes them want a different , or wrapped version of your global thing , Documentation is always important , but it is particularly important when dealing with globals , because there 's really no such thing as completely global , and it is difficult to determine from context just how global you intend for something to be .
Third , and finally , encourage using your singleton by using it as a default , rather than accessing it directly .
For example :
from publisher import the Publisher
class Worker :
publisher = the Publisher
def work ( self ) :
self.publisher.publish( self )
In this example , you now have a clean point of integration for testing and extending this code .
You can make a single Worker instance , and change its " publisher " attribute before calling " work " .
Of course , if you 're willing to burn a whole extra two lines of code , you can make it an optional argument to the constructor of Worker .
If you decide that in fact , your publisher is n't global at all , but system - specific , this vastly decreases the amount of code you have to change .
Does this mean you should make everything into objects , and never use free functions ?
No .
Free functions are fine , but functions in Python are for functional programming .
The hint is right there in the name .
If you are performing computations which return values , and calling other functions which do the same thing , it makes perfect sense to use free functions and not bog yourself down with useless object allocations and ' self ' arguments .
Once you 've started adding mutable state into the mix , you 're into object territory .
If you 're appending to a global list , if you 're setting a global " state " variable , even if you 're writing to a global file , it 's time to make a class and give it some methods .
Have you ever written a module that looked like this ?
And then used it like this ?
I 've done this many times myself .
I used to think that this was the " right " way to implement Singletons in Python .

( Deleted comment ) From : glyf Date : July 8th , 2007 09:13 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I 'm curious , how did you test the Singleton classes before using this pattern ?
At work we actually ask people during interviews to describe their experiences with singletons , and people have consistently reported that testing is highly problematic , and control of scope even more so .
It 's Python .
Some things are horrible , but everything is testable .
For example , consider this little gem : class Thing : stuffed = False def stuff ( self ) : self.stuffed = True globalThing = Thing ( ) def frob ( ) : globalThing.stuff ( ) #
Oh no !
A global !
What ever will we do !
from types import FunctionType def testable ( thunk , ** newGlobals ) : " This 'll fix that global 's wagon but good . " globs = { } globs.update(thunk.func_globals ) globs.update( newGlobals ) testable = FunctionType(thunk.func_code , globs , thunk.func_name , thunk.func_defaults , thunk.func_closure ) return testable def test_frob ( ) : localThing = Thing ( ) frob Prime = testable ( frob , globalThing=localThing ) frob Prime ( ) print localThing.stuffed test_frob ( )
Coming up with crimes against nature like this takes a little creativity and a little knowledge of the Python runtime .
The real trick is figuring out which one is appropriate in a particular nasty situation , and avoiding nasty situations ( mostly by avoiding globals ) .

For example , libraries like JMock achieve similar , if not identical , results by using
( And who says Oh , sure , it 's tedious and unpleasant in Java , but hey - you are using Java , clearly you like tedious and unpleasant things :) .
But it 's often possible even without bytecode hacking .
For example , libraries like JMock achieve similar , if not identical , results by using java.lang .

Proxy and friends .

From : glyf Date : July 8th , 2007 09:21 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I use Spring ( an IoC container on the Java side ) for much of the configuration I use , since it encapsulates the scope ( instance per VM / session / etc ) and insertion into the appropriate objects .
What do you do with the apps you build in python ?
I have to confess I do n't really understand this question .
I have heard it before , and I keep my ear to the ground in the Java - verse , so I hear periodic murmurs about something or other totally revolutionizing Java programming by providing an even newer , even improveder way to initialize configuration and state and manage the lightweight dependency injection of control configuration inversion rama rama ding dong .
I would say " I do n't think it 's that big of a problem " if I even understood what the problem was that these massive configuration and initialization " container " frameworks were trying to solve .
I assume it's not that big of a problem because I seem to be able to solve something similar by spending 30 seconds every six months writing a tac file , or these days maybe a whole ten minutes writing tests and docs and a twistd plugin .
The other possible answer is that I use Axiom , since Axiom applications are completely self - contained universes that have all the application data and " configuration " information and initialization bootstrapping bundled together in a convenient database format .

I 'll assume you know what IoC is and skip to the " Why I use it " part .
Maybe these are n't issues in Python / Twisted (...)
I understand what the design pattern is , I 've read fowler 's paper , and it's a nice idea when it 's appropriate , but it seems necessary so often in the Java universe that something appears distorted to me .
* Why * this situation occurs is probably more interesting than the solution I believe that 's the thing that I 'm missing , so yes , I 'm curious about it .
So , I can write a simpler class that just " magically " has a DB connection , rather than figuring out how to get the connection in the class itself ( usually a bit of work in Java , and inflexibly changed ) .
Basically , I try to avoid this kind of magic .
Pass parameters where you need 'em , when you are passing too many parameters at once , group them and turn them into objects .
Nevow has a " magic " object , the " context " , which you can get all kinds of juicy awfulness out of , but we are desperately trying to phase it out in favor of people just constructing objects that have all the things they need passed to their constructor .
From what I glean , this is n't quite the same kind of magic though , because IoC containers seem to focus very much on the " top " object rather than random components throughout the page .
I ended up writing configuration * in Python * and sourcing it , which was generally fairly easy and elegant ( and fairly impossible in Java ) .
The first Java program I wrote , ever , ( I was 15 ) was a custom classloader which allowed you to load objects to serve as configuration .
It might not be quite as spiffy as Python , but with judicious use of object array literal syntax , you can do a surprising number of things .
I actually took this idea from java to python , but it sufficied in both areas .
Does that explain the need / want for those sorts of features , and what the original question was getting at ?
Kind of .
I mean , not really , I think I would need to feel the actual pain of building a real J2EE application to really understand this , and uh no thanks say no to drugs kids stay in school .
As a side note , I 've never thought of a db format as " convenient " , ... SQLite changes the game just a little bit , but in many cases that tiny change is enough to make a big difference .
Axiom adds quite a bit of magic on top though .

Observe :
I have a confession to make :
For the past 6 weeks , I ’ve been leading a secret double life .
By day , I ’m a mild mannered system / network / database admin in academia .
I also write some PHP , Perl , and Python code .
By night , however , I ’m an author and editor .
My latest project is bigger than most .
In fact , it ’s an entire magazine .
Devoted to Python .
I am the Editor in Chief of the newly launched Python Magazine .
Why on Earth Are You Doing This ?
Python Magazine was created as a result of some rather unfortunate events in my own early experiences with Python .
Getting started , of course , could n’t be easier .
It was what happened after I had been coding for a while that I had issues with .
Once you needed to do something a little out of the ordinary with the language , it was hard to feel confident that the way I was going was the right way .
For example , I decided to wrap up a bunch of SQL calls in Python and expose them as an API using Python ’s built in SimpleXMLRPCServer .
I thought this was great , because then I could maintain a single back end API , and any language that could make an xmlrpc call could use it without me having to maintain APIs in several languages .
Nice in theory , but people smarter than I questioned my decision to use the built in SimpleXMLRPCServer .
The right road to take , though , was completely unclear .
As another example , I needed to get up to speed on using the python - ldap module , but found that a lot of the documentation lacked anything but the most basic of features , but I was trying to write a full - fledged LDAP management API ( and accompanying command line and GUI tools ) .
Other articles I found were outdated enough that people warned me not to bother with them , pointing to glaring issues with the code samples ( which turned out to be true – some of what was in the code samples turned out to be completely deprecated ! ) .
When I wanted to write code against a PostgreSQL server , the correct module to use was also not immediately obvious , so I had to hunt down the sites of various modules , see which ones were maintained , search for articles that were n’t 5 years old on how to use them …
Gah !
What I really wanted was a resource that fed me information in a way that my brain likes to feed on information .
I really wanted to learn to do things with Python the way I learned to do things with Linux , Solaris , PHP , and even non-technical things like photography , billiards , and brewing beer .
I wanted a magazine .
There was no magazine .
I was bummed .
How did you finagle this one , jonesy ?
I have a friend named Marco Tabini .
He ’s a publisher .
He runs Marco Tabini Associates in Toronto .
He is the publisher of php|architect Magazine .
He ’s also a total geek .
For fun he does things like writing lexical parsers … in PHP .
Nobody should ever do that .
He thinks it ’s fun .
I say pass on that if you are given the chance .
Marco and I met via email .
I wrote to tell him that I had received my first issue of php|architect , and would not recommend it to a friend .
I had found something like 15 errors ( typos and grammatical issues ) in the first two pages of the magazine .
Marco wrote back and said “ hey , we ’re a small outfit .
We ’re an Italian immigrant and an Iranian immigrant , living in Canada , trying to edit technical articles written by people from all over the world with varying levels of experience with English … all for a largely American audience .
Come help us out ! ”
So I did .
Shortly thereafter I became Editor in Chief of php|architect .
Now there were three of us .
Oh joyous day .
Those were great times , and the magazine has since spawned its own online and on - site training , its own line of books , its own series of conferences , and even a cruise !
It probably has stuff I do n’t even know about because I have n’t worked directly for that particular publication since 2004 .
The success of that magazine gave me the courage to go to Marco about 6 weeks ago and ask about letting me head up another magazine , this time about a topic of * my * choosing .
We chatted on IRC for several hours over the course of about a week , bought a couple of domain names , settled on budgets and team members and all that , and set out to make Python Magazine a reality .
So …
How ’s it going ?
Things are * REALLY * rolling now .
There are columnists , there are tech editors , there are authors .
Articles have been commissioned .
Logos and trademarks are in place .
The design team is rocking , the contract team is rolling , and the emails are flying .
In the background , the sound of constant typewriter activity can be heard , just like on those old newscasts from the old Cronkite days .
Exciting times !
That said , we still need LOTS of content .
The behind - the - scenes of a magazine is that you ’d really like to have something like 4 months worth of content “ in the can ” before “ Volume 1 Issue 1 ” is released .
I ’m convinced that this has never happened in the history of publishing , but it ’s a great goal to have , and I ’d be pleased as punch to be the first person ever to achieve it 😉
If you ’re a writer who is doing or has done something interesting with Python , or can illustrate high level concepts from the fields of computer science , research computing , or IT , using Python , we ’d love to hear your thoughts !
Import This
In the end , I hope I can be a good steward to the language and community .
I ’ve already been in touch with a lot of wonderful people – authors and others – who ’ve helped out in some way , either with the magazine , with my own buggy Python code , or both .
That ’s all the news that ’s fit to print for now , but keep an eye here and on the Python Magazine website for more updates as they happen .
Oh yeah – and if you subscribe now , you get a discount , and a chance to win a MacBook !

Ayaan Hirsi
Ali is one brave woman who refuses to submit to Islam .
Ali grew up in a devout Muslim home in Somalia and witnessed the brutal treatment of women first hand .
When her father arranged a marriage to a complete stranger to whom she would be required by Islamic tradition to obey his every command , Ali refused .
Ali moved to Holland to pursue her own dreams ( an act is strictly forbidden by the Koran ) .
After some time outside of Islamic culture and after the events of September 11 , 2001 , Ali rejected her religion of Islam in favor of reason ( she is now an atheist ) .
Since that time Ali has worked , at great personal risk , to educate the West of Islamâ€™s subjugation of women and confront the politically correct Western media for its apologetic approach to her former religion .
In 2004 , Ali co-produced a short movie with Theo Van Gogh entitled Submission to bring attention to the plight of women in the Islamic world .
On November 2 , 2004 , Theo Van Gogh was murdered by a Muslim man who took offense to the blasphemous film .
A note was found on Van Goghâ€™s body warning that Ali would be next .
Ali now lives under the protection of body guards in the U.S. but continues to speak out for the women who are victims of Islamic society .
In April , her book Infidel hit the shelves ( I just picked up the book myself ; very fascinating what I have read so far ) .
The first of the 2 videos is a short interview with Ali where she explains the message she was trying to get across in Submission .
The second video is the movie itself ( Be patient , the video begins in Arabic with some non-English subtitles but the dialogue from that point on is mostly English ) .

When Sun looks to highlight the strongest features of the Solaris operating system , DTrace always appears near the top of the list .
Your editor recently had a conversation with an employee of a prominent analyst firm who was interested , above all else , in when Linux would have some sort of answer to DTrace .
There is a common notion out there that tracing tools is one place where Linux is significantly behind the state of the art .
So your editor decided to take a closer look .
The Linux tool which is most similar to DTrace is SystemTap .
This development is supported by a number of high - profile companies , including Red Hat , Intel , IBM , and Hitachi .
Most distributions have SystemTap packages somewhere in their systems of repositories , making it readily available to Linux users .
DTrace supporters have been known to say that SystemTap is merely a knock - off of DTrace , and a badly - done one at that .
SystemTap proponents will counter that it is an independent development which can hold its own .
Both tools are based on the insertion of probe points in the system kernel .
Whenever a thread of execution hits one of those probe points , some sort of action - as described in the tool 's C - like language - is run .
That action can be as simple as printing a message , or it can be significantly more complicated than that .
DTrace comes with a large set of pre-defined probe points wired into the Solaris kernel - seemingly tens of thousands of them .
These points are well documented and cover most of the kernel .
Some simple wildcarding is implemented for the selection of multiple probe points .
It is claimed that the run -time overhead of unused probe points is negligible .
[ Update : see the comments for some useful clarification on the use of dynamic probe points in DTrace . ]
SystemTap , instead , does not depend on static probe points within the kernel ; that capability exists , but nobody has much interest in maintaining all of those points .
Instead , SystemTap uses dynamic probes ( implemented with kprobes ) which are inserted into the kernel at run time .
A flexible language can enable probes to be easily inserted anywhere in the kernel , with fairly complete wildcard support which allows , for example , all functions within a source file or subsystem to be instrumented with a single statement .
Unused probe points do not exist at all , and so cannot affect system performance .
There are a couple of advantages to the DTrace approach .
The probe points exist and can be easily found in the manuals ; a SystemTap user , instead , is required to have a certain amount of familiarity with the kernel source code .
DTrace probe points are fixed at locations where it is known to be safe to interrupt the execution of the kernel .
The SystemTap documentation , instead , comes with warnings that placing probes in the wrong places can cause system crashes and mutterings about the possibility of implementing blacklists in the future .
The number of " wrong places " appears to be quite small , but that is of limited comfort for an administrator trying to observe the operation of a production system - something which is supposed to be possible with either system .
There is a set of predefined points provided in the " tapsets " packaged with SystemTap , but it is small .
The " D " language provided with DTrace is more restricted than the SystemTap language , though it does have a few features - like the ability to print stack traces - which appear to be missing in SystemTap .
The D language has no flow control or looping constructs .
Instead , the code associated with a probe has a predicate expression determining whether that code is executed when the probe is hit .
Thus each selected probe point can be thought of as having a single , controlling " if " statement around it , with no further flow control possible afterward .
SystemTap 's language , instead , has conditionals , loops , and the ability to define functions .
It also has , for those who like to live dangerously , the ability to embed C code .
There are clear advantages to a more powerful scripting language , but hazards as well : SystemTap must , for example , carry extra code to keep infinite loops in scripts from bringing down the system .
D is , like Java , compiled to a special virtual machine and interpreted at run time .
SystemTap , instead , compiles directly to C. So SystemTap code may execute more quickly , but D may benefit from the additional safety checks which a virtual machine allows .
DTrace has the ability to work with user - space probes .
As with the kernel , developers are required to insert the probe points before DTrace can use them ; it is not clear that large amounts of user - space code have been so instrumented .
There is clear elegance to the idea , though , and this capability may prove genuinely useful in the future as more applications are equipped with probe points .
SystemTap does not currently have this capability .
In practice , simply getting SystemTap to work can be a challenge - even when a distributor - supported package is available .
SystemTap is clearly its own development which must be ( somewhat painfully ) integrated with a specific kernel .
DTrace can be expected to simply work out of the box .
And that is perhaps the biggest difference between the two tracing systems .
SystemTap would appear to have all of the capabilities it really needs to be a powerful system tracing tool - at least on the kernel side .
DTrace features which are missing - speculative tracing , for example - could certainly be added if there were demand for it .
Evidently user - space tracing is in the works .
But what SystemTap really needs is more basic than that .
What 's missing is the degree of maturity exhibited by DTrace .
SystemTap needs to simply work on most systems - and be usable by the system administrators .
To a great extent , the " simply work " part is something that the distributors must address .
Current SystemTap packages as tested by your editor have the look of an edge - of - the - repository afterthought .
They do not have the dependencies to bring in the needed kernel information , requiring a fair amount of manual " what does it need now ? " administrative work .
Even then , performance is spotty at best ; the SystemTap utilities just do not have access to the sort of information ( uncompressed kernel images , for example ) that they need to operate correctly .
Until an administrator can simply tell the package management system to install SystemTap and expect to have it work thereafter , it will be hard to convince anybody that we have a mature tracing tool .
On the development side , there should be an extensive set of well - documented trace points which can be used without having to go into the kernel source .
Digging deeply into the system in a flexible way is always going to require a certain amount of skill , but SystemTap all but requires its users to be kernel hackers .
The hard work of making a tool which can match - and , in places , exceed - DTrace has been done .
What remains is a large ( but relatively straightforward ) job : making this tool usable by a much wider set of system administrators .
Until that is done , DTrace envy will remain with us .
“ Using a box of air in a Copenhagen lab , physicists trace the growth of clusters of molecules of the kind that build cloud condensation nuclei .
These are specks of sulphuric acid on which cloud droplets form .
High - energy particles driven through the laboratory ceiling by exploded stars far away in the Galaxy - the cosmic rays - liberate electrons in the air , which help the molecular clusters to form much faster than atmospheric scientists have predicted .
That may explain the link proposed by members of the Danish team , between cosmic rays , cloudiness and climate change . ”
Results from the Danish National Space Center SKY reaction chamber experiment : Condensation nuclei density as a function of ion density , under steady state with the environmental conditions ( including SO 2 at 155 p.p.t , H 2 0 at 35 % RH and H 2 SO 4 at 108 cm - 3 ) .
Evidently , more ionization implies more particle nucleation .
The Danish National Space Center SKY reaction chamber experiment .
The experiment was built with the goal of pinning down the microphysics behind the cosmic ray / cloud cover link found through various empirical correlations - and it was successful !
From left to right : Nigel Marsh , Jan Veizer , Henrik Svensmark .
Behind the camera : the author .
After a long embargo , results from the Danish National Space Center ( DNSC )
Sky experiment were finally published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society .
These results will probably we overshadowed with today 's announcement of this years ' physics nobel prize winner ( for the COBE microwave background experiment ) , but they areimportant nonetheless .
This is the Royal Society 's press release on the publication of Svensmark et al . :
You can also find more about it in the Danish National Space Center press release
The experiment itself is a 7 mcloud chamber containing marine like air .
By controlling the ionization rate using different UV fluxes ( i.e. , mimicking different cosmic ray ionizations ) , the group checked to see whether the growth rate of small condensation nuclei is affected by different ionization rates , and indeed it does as can be seen in the first figure .
The experiment itself can be seen in the second figure below .
What do these results imply ?
For a long while , evidence pointing out towards a Cosmic Ray → Cloud Cover → Temperature link has been accumulating .
( e.g. , see this short review ) .
The evidence was clear enough to convince many ( such as your humble servant ) that the Cosmic ray climate link is the only reasonable explanation for the plethora of data .
However , a big thorn was the lack of physical evidence for the physical mechanism , which until now was only speculated .
Until now that is .
The SKY experiment unequivocally demonstrates that more cosmic rays would imply more condensation nuclei in the atmosphere .
In many circumstances , it is reasonable to expect that more of the small condensation nuclei would also imply more of the larger cloud condensation nuclei which form the seeds of clouds .
Namely , there would be a link between atmospheric ionization ( i.e. , cosmic rays flux variations ) and climate , in regions devoid of other condensation seeds ( such as dust over land ) .
This link implies that a large fraction of the 20th century global warming can be explained through increased solar activity ( which reduced the cosmic ray flux reaching Earth ) .
More about that can be found in this discussion , or in this paper Kudos for Henrik Svensmark and his group !

US debate 2020 : How Biden will avoid BRAWL with ' aggressive '
Trump during first debate
DONALD TRUMP and Joe Biden have just hours to go before their debate today , which will ...
TORTURE …. I do n’t write much about torture these days because the whole subject just makes me ill .
I know that ’s a lousy excuse .
I ’m sorry .
But if I ’d tuned in to Tuesday ’s Republican debate and heard the crowd hooting and hollering as the candidates played “ can you top this ” over who was most willing to take up the mantle of Hitler , Stalin , and Pol Pot , I probably would have lost it .
It ’s not just that it ’s depraved , it ’s demagogic , and it ’s depressing , but also that it ’s dimwitted .
Macho talk about torture may be a great applause line on the right - wing rubber chicken circuit , but it does nothing to make us safer .
Today in the Washington Post , a former commandant of the Marine Corps and a former commander of CENTCOM explain why :
It is the duty of the commander in chief to lead the country away from the grip of fear , not into its grasp .
Regrettably , at Tuesday night ’s presidential debate in South Carolina , several Republican candidates revealed a stunning failure to understand this most basic obligation .
Indeed , among the candidates , only John McCain demonstrated that he understands the close connection between our security and our values as a nation .
….
As has happened with every other nation that has tried to engage in a little bit of torture — only for the toughest cases , only when nothing else works — the abuse spread like wildfire , and every captured prisoner became the key to defusing a potential ticking time bomb .
Our soldiers in Iraq confront real “ ticking time bomb ” situations every day , in the form of improvised explosive devices , and any degree of “ flexibility ” about torture at the top drops down the chain of command like a stone — the rare exception fast becoming the rule .
…. This war will be won or lost not on the battlefield but in the minds of potential supporters who have not yet thrown in their lot with the enemy .
If we forfeit our values by signaling that they are negotiable in situations of grave or imminent danger , we drive those undecideds into the arms of the enemy .
This way lies defeat , and we are well down the road to it .
Even if basic considerations of morality do n’t sway you , the fact that torture and abuse contribute to eventual defeat on the battlefield should .
That ’s more important than winning a few more votes from the troglodyte crowd .
« What I want for Christmas | Main | Are " nice " and " honest " mutually exclusive ? »
Creativity on speed
It 's been said that art , creativity , and innovation are about the recognition and mastery of constraints .
" Man built most nobly when limitations were at their greatest . "
— Frank Lloyd Wright
" In art , truth and reality begin when one no longer understands what one is doing or what one knows , and when there remains an energy that is all the stronger for being constrained , controlled and compressed . "
— Henri Matisse
One of the best ways to be truly creative -- breakthrough creative -- is to be forced to go fast .
Really , really , really fast .
From the brain 's perspective , it makes sense that extreme speed can unlock creativity .
When forced to come up with something under extreme time constraints , we 're forced to rely on the more intuitive , subconscious parts of our brain .
The time pressure can help suppress the logical / rational / critical parts of your brain .
It helps you EQ up subconscious creativity ( so - called " right brain " ) and EQ down conscious thought ( " left brain " ) .
( One of the best ways to quickly test the dramatic power of shifting from left to right is with Betty Edwards Drawing on the right side of the brain work . )
Ad-lib Jams
I 'm not talking about the kind of time pressure we get from trying to get real work done under unreasonable deadlines .
I 'm talking about a specific technique for using speed as a creativity driver .
I talked about this earlier in Build something cool in 24 hours , based on a talk by Ritual Entertainment game guru Squirrel Eiserloh .
Squirrel is one of the founders of the Ad Lib Game Development Society , and an active participant ( and advocate ) of the Jam model for creating both games and music .
Squirrel said one of their main mottos is from the Glengarry Glen Ross movie , where Alex Baldwin tells / threatens the sales people to " always be closing . "
You are n't there just to do things ... you 're there to make things .
To get something finished , no matter how crappy and ultimately unusable , in the given -- insane -- time constraint .
Creativity Deathmatches
Another jam format that 's been gaining ground is the deathmatch or " battle " .
But unlike the live Battle of the Bands format ( or Poetry Slams ) , which are simply live competitions , the creativity deathmatch / battle is about creating in real - time .
In other words , you are n't just playing your pre-written music or reading your pre-written poems in front of a live audience , you 're also creating something from scratch .
Of course , this idea is nothing new to improv artists from comedy to jazz musicians , but it 's not something one normally associates with things like graphic design or writing code .
( Although there have been code - offs ( like bake - offs for geeks ) , typically held at developer conferences . )
Squirrel sent me this link to the Laptop Deathmatch held recently in Dallas , covered in this Dallas Observer article .
From the article :
" The monthly competition ... pits 16 people in a tournament to find the most talented laptop musicians in town .
Players get three minutes to whip up whatever noise they want , as long as it comes from only a laptop and a MIDI controller device .
The most exciting thing about the event , really , is that nobody actually has a clue what " most talented laptop musician " means . "
But Skyler has been raving about the Art Battle held at the Installation Art Gallery / Skateboard Shoe store here in Boulder .
Sponsored by ( who else ) Pabst Blue Ribbon , artists Scot Lefavor and Ray Young Chu battled it out before a live audience .
Every 30 minutes the host would announce a word or phrase and the two artists had to race to depict it .
[ photos by ronnie innes , via Scot Lefavor 's site ]
I found plenty of other examples of creativity battles including this one from Portland 's Music and Video Art Invitational described as :
" 10 video artists and 20 musicians create original works in a limited time frame using provided source materials .... contributors will be supplied with 10 visual or audio samples , which they will in turn use as source material for an original piece of music , sound , or video . "
[ no pre-arranged material was allowed ]
But perhaps my favorite is the Comic Art Battle , also in Portland .
( Why does so much cool stuff happen up there ? )
When you 're crafting something -- a final product like a software app , painting , piece of music , etc. -- slowing down can make all the difference between crap and not crap .
But when you 're trying to make creative breakthroughs , slowing down gives the rational part of your brain all the time it needs to stop an idea before you 're barely aware of it .
When it comes to building / creating / playing something you did n't even know you were capable of , speed is your friend .
( I read that Vincent Van Gogh completed every one of his paintings in less than 24 hours .
Then again , there is that whole ear thing ... )
But this brings me back to the picture at the top , and Squirrel 's motto " Always Be Closing .
As most of you already know , Tim O'Reilly 's geek campout , Foo Camp , has spawned a number of other 24 to 48 hour " camps " and " jams " including Bar Camp , and the recent Seattle Mind Camp .
While these are awesome experiences , and I wish there were more -- these events should not be confused with creativity jams .
While Foo Camp is where I first learned of the Game Jam format , from Squirrel 's talk , Foo Camp was itself not a make - something - cool - while - you 're - here - to - demo - at - the - end kind of thing .
The camps are more about talking about things people have built rather than actually building them in real - time .
The camps offer a different form of creativity -- more about synthesis and getting new ideas than tapping into the power of your subconscious creativity .
It would be fun to see a combination camp where the first half of the weekend was about actually making something , solo or collaboratively , and the other half was about exchanging ideas with the other participants ( including the things you made during the first half , and lessons learned ) .
I 'll leave you with an article on creativity , by Randy Thom , aimed at those who do sound for motion pictures .
While not at all speed - related , it 's an interesting perspective on creativity :
" The Tyranny Of Competence
In the movie industry a high value is justifiably placed on technical competence .
It is assumed that every craftsperson should know how to use the tools of the trade and be able to perform on cue , under pressure .
The trouble with paying so much attention to skill and technical prowess is this :
The frame of mind in which interesting things germinate is often more confused and desperate than organized and confident . "

Great post .
A couple of years ago , I participated in a similar creativity jam .
It 's a month long quest to produce a 50,000 word novel .
National Novel Writing Month ... it runs every November .
I wrote a lot of crap to hit that target , but I also got some good stuff down on paper in the process , which I may actually do something with someday . :)
Check it out at www.nanowrimo.org.

Jessica , Nano is a great way to up the creativity of your writing .
I did it a few years ago as well .
Unfortunately I am working my way through the rewrite at a snail 's pace but as I read through it there is some lovely stuff I do n't think I would have gotten without the deadline driving me to just write .
Now I have a dilema - the book or the guitar .
When I first started playing guitar there certainly were n't ads with women actually playing one [ never mind marketing it to them ! ]
Posted by : Julie | Dec 7 , 2005 2:33:32 PM
I completed Nanowrimo this year !
I tried a couple years ago and died around 5,000 words .
I 'm very proud of myself .
I 'm close to the end of the novel itself too , so I 'm really looking forward to finishing and then putting it away for a long time before I suffer looking at it again ( and then fingers crossed that I can edit into something good ...
I love the story , I just wish it was written well ! ) .
On the adlib game development note , Ludum Dare ( http://www.ludumdare.com - some form of website may or may not be in existence as you read this ) is having their 8th ( ? ) semi-biannual 48 - hour game development contest this very weekend !
I absolutely love these things .
It always inspires truly new things in gaming ( as the post discusses , in large part due to limitations - there 's a theme provided , and trying to come up with something to fit it makes you do cool stuff ) .
My entries from previous contests are on my website ( Freebies > Gamelets ) .
It 's quite ad - hoc this time around , so sorry if the page is n't there when you see this !

A few quick and sort of related thoughts :
I ’m sure there ’s much creativity in what people call extemporaneous activities .
However , we should n’t think of extemporaneous as entirely spontaneous , especially if that includes some notion of unprepared .
The best extemporaneous artists are almost always exceptionally well prepared people .
They “ innovate ” or “ create ” employing one or more of possibly many well rehearsed patterns that they apply to the unique circumstance they find themselves in .
When you learn extemporaneous skills , you ’re actually learning the patterns that work best for you and developing experience in their application in various circumstances .
If the extemporaneous artists do n’t share this , you really can’t hold it against them – magicians often keep their tricks a secret as well .
I think it ’s clear that necessity is the mother of invention .
Pressures of all sorts can drive creative responses .
And time pressure may be a handy tool given that it ’s one sort of pressure you can impose upon yourself without any / many adverse side - effects .
Creating pressure through exposure to the elements , for instance , may also incite a little creativity , but has a drawback or two of its own .
Finally , do you think “ practicing ” with time pressures would have a beneficial effect on your creative output generally ?
For me , things I label creative almost never happen under time pressure .
They tend to surface when I ’m immersed in something else entirely .
At that point it ’s usually a frantic rush to get it all recorded somehow .

This is a great read .
In art school , I noticed I made the biggest breakthroughs when I had severe limitations .
Between that and the 5k contest , I started to think there may be something behind it , and this article makes that point .
I actually have done series on this concept .
One was " speedie comix " where I wrote a single page comic without thinking about it .
I did that 10 times :

Interesting observations .
As a painter , I know from a first hand experience ( make it a repeated first hand experience ) that I myself , as an author , am not the best judge when it comes to deciding when is my canvas done .
Simply put , I tend to overdo things .
I am aware of this because my best work is invariably the one I was forced to abandon before I got a chance to finish it .
You know how it goes -- I 'm in the middle of doing it , something comes up , yanks me away from my easel , and then one thing leads to another , and eventually I never get a chance to return to the canvas .
Meanwhile I get involved with other projects , I 've started work on other canvases , so for me the first unfinished canvas is a writeoff .
But then something strange happens : after a while , I return to the original canvas with the intention to finally complete it , and much to my shock , I realize that it 's just perfect !
I 'm incapable of explaining how does that actually work , but really and truly , what I thought was rough and unfinished piece of work , almost a sketch , turns out to be perfect .
I would n't add nor remove even a single brushstroke .
I was talking to a friend artist about this , and he had a brilliant idea .
He suggested we conduct an experiment -- I start working on a canvas , and he sort of decides to call me on my phone at a completely random time .
The deal is , once I receive his phone call , I am obliged to stop working .
We have n't had a chance to try the experiment yet , but I 'm really curious to see the results .

Rather than the Glengarry Glen Ross movie , this post makes me think of the Dead Poets Society .
You know , where Robin Williams grabs one of the boys and spins him around until poetry spouts out of his mouth .
Personally , I find adopting a fake accent releases the inhibitions to creativity .
Earned me the nickname ' Frenchy ' !

This article makes me think of two things .
First , it reminds me of the weekend charette way back in design school .
Given 36 hours , a four person multi-disciplinary team , and a design problem people would produce amazing ideas .
A book is the second thought I had .
This argument , in some ways , similar to the one Malcolm Gladwell makes in Blink .
Gladwell basically argues that given enough training and experience , people 's first thought and reactions are more reliable than ones given more time to develop .
I run into this with design problems all the time .
Sometimes rehashing something just drains the fun and life from a good idea .

My all - time favorite instance of " creativity on speed " was in the movie Apollo 13 ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/)
--
" Houston , we have a problem " -- when the team at Mission Control had to figure out a solution to problems created by an explosion in one of the oxygen tanks of the spacecraft ( the wikipedia entry has more details : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13).
In particular , I 'm reminded of the scene where the mission director came into a room full of engineers with a box full of all the equipment the spacecraft crew had available to them on board , dumped it onto the table , and told the crew on the ground this is what their colleagues in space have to work with , and it was up to them to find a solution before the oxygen supplies ran out on the spacecraft .
The PBS special on Apollo 13 ( http://www.shoppbs.org/sm-pbs-apollo-13-to-the-edge-and-back-dvd--pi-1912722.html) was factually more informative , but the movie starring Tom Hanks was more inspiring , largely due to the compelling illustration of creativity on speed .

This past summer I had my first filmmaking experience as part of a team involved in the 48 Hour Film Project ( http://www.48hourfilm.com/ ) .
There were 36 teams in St. Louis alone .
At the start time each team was given a character , prop , line of dialogue and genre .
Then we had 48 hours to write , plan , shoot and edit a 5 to 7 - minute film .
It was fun , frustrating , draining and exhilarating all at the same time .
And some of the resulting short films ( ours included ) were truly well - done , creative and entertaining .
Yes , speed does indeed inspire creative thinking and action !

I was wondering if someone was going to mention the 48 Hour Film Project !
It 's a ton of fun .
I encourage anyone who lives near one of the participating cities to get involved !
' just find a team .
They 're always looking for extra help !

I stumbled across your blog while I was doing some online research .
I recently completed my MFA in Creative Writing , and many of my classmates have confided that they were writing much more prolifically and creatively with those class due dates hanging over their heads constantly .
Interesting !

Hmm ... interesting post .
I always like to do things slowly taking my time .
Maybe I should try out the speed technique .
Lets see how it works

MONTREAL — With the proof caught on video , Quebec provincial police were forced to admit Thursday that three undercover agents were playing the part of protesters at this week ’s international summit in Montebello , Que .
But the Quebec police force denied they were attempting to provoke protesters into violence .
Rather , they said the three were planted in the crowd to locate any protesters who were not peacefully demonstrating .
Police said the trio ’s cover was blown when they refused to toss any objects .
“ At no time did the Quebec provincial police officers act as agents provocateurs or commit criminal acts .
Also , it is not part of the policy of the police force nor is it part of its strategy to act in this manner .
At all times , the officers responded to their mandate to maintain law and order , ” the QPP said in a news release on Thursday night .
The police said after viewing a video clip from YouTube.com and video shot by police officers , they were able to confirm the three were Quebec provincial police officers .
Earlier , both the QPP and the RCMP had denied altogether any of their officers were involved .
The Quebec provincial police declined to comment further , a spokeswoman in Montreal said .
And while Quebec Justice Minister Jacques Dupuis was made aware of the news , a spokesman from his office said he will not comment on the matter either .
Public Safety Minister Stockwell
Day rejected opposition calls Thursday for an inquiry into agents role in trying to provoke protesters into violence at this week ’s North American leaders summit in Montebello , Que .
“ I ’ve made the inquiries and there was no RCMP that were involved as far as those three individuals go , ” Day told reporters after making a crime - prevention announcement in Winnipeg .
“ If people have concerns ... there is a complaints process for the RCMP .
There is also one for the Surete du Quebec .
This incident happened in Quebec , so I imagine people could also file under that complaints process . ”
Day ’s words did little to appease Dave Coles , the union leader who confronted the three men on the protest line and accused them of being cops .
“ We ’re going to talk to our legal counsel and we ’ll decide ( Friday ) what our next action is going to be , ” said Coles , president of the Communications Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada .
The Liberals called for a police probe into the issue , while the NDP called on Day to launch a public inquiry .
The NDP said the public should be worried about the possibility police officers were used to try to turn a peaceful protest into a violent one .
“ If they are police officers , and if they are stepping forward with a mandate to disrupt in any way , that ’s a cause for concern , ” said New Democrat MP Peter Julian .
The three officers , sporting bandannas , showed up on the front lines of a peaceful protest at the Security and Prosperity Partnership summit earlier this week .
One carried a large rock , and protesters allege the officers were trying to incite a riot so that police could move on the crowd .
The event was captured on video and shows one of the mystery men talking to police officers before being brought to the ground , handcuffed and quietly led away along with his friends .
The men were never charged , and photos show them wearing combat boots with identical markings to the ones worn by police at the scene .
“ It ’s just too coincidental that these guys attack a ( police ) line with a boulder and they ’re not charged , ” Coles said .
“ The other four protesters who were arrested ( over the weekend ) were all charged . ”
Quebec Provincial Police and the RCMP have both said they do not use agents to provoke violence .
RCMP spokesman Cpl. Luc
Bessette said this week he could not discuss details of security measures for major events such as the summit because it could compromise future operations .
From Joe Klein at TIME :
the three qualities that make this Administration one of the worst in American history : arrogance ( the surge ) , incompetence ( Walter Reed ) and cynicism ( the U.S. Attorneys )
" The entire VA hospital system is unprepared for the casualties of Iraq , especially the psychiatric casualties .
A lot of vets are saying , ' This is our Katrina moment . '
And they 're right : this Administration governs badly because it does n't care very much about governing
it is increasingly difficult to imagine yet another two years of slow bleed with a leader so clearly unfit to lead
A real - time sensor for detecting cocaine –– made with inexpensive , off - the - shelf electronics –– has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
Two local high school students and a Nobel laureate participated in the discovery .
The potential applications of the sensor are far - reaching and include bioterrorism detection and important medical uses .
The high school students made their own sensors and collected data shown in a graph in the scientific article they co-authored describing the work .
In the article , published in the Feb. 18 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society ( JACS ) , the authors state , " Cocaine serves as an ideal and representative target for testing new analytical techniques due to pressing needs for its rapid detection in law enforcement and clinical settings . "
The sensor can be housed in supporting electronics that are the size of a small hand - held device .
Co-author and Nobel laureate Alan Heeger said , " We have developed a method of detecting small molecules and proteins in a way that is not specific to cocaine –– a whole class of biosensors can be based on this concept .
It can be applied to the prevention of bioterrorism .
It is beautiful work ; the sensor is fully portable . "
Heeger is a professor of physics and of materials and is affiliated with the Center for Polymers and Organic Solids at UCSB .
He won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 2000 .
" For me the most exciting thing is that this is a generic , inexpensive way of detecting a range of interesting targets , " said Kevin Plaxco , associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry .
" Cocaine is just the tip of the iceberg . "
Currently detecting cocaine ( and other illegal and legal drugs ) in bodily fluids must be done by a laboratory with large and expensive equipment .
The process takes from hours to days to get a result .
The potential medical implications of the sensor for detection of prescription drugs may be profound .
A drug like cyclosporin , an immunosuppressant that has revolutionized the field of organ transplants , must be carefully monitored in a patient 's blood to regulate the dosage .
The test to check the ratio of a therapeutic dose versus a lethal dose is a process that takes six hours .
With the new sensor , the blood level of the drug could be immediately detected and deaths could be prevented .
Another drug requiring this type of careful regulation is a family of antibiotics known as aminoglycosides .
Some patients metabolize a certain drug quickly and others slowly .
Because of this vast variance , there are drugs have not been introduced to the market because of the need for an immediate check of the blood level of the drug in order to prevent death .
Plaxco explained that new drugs may be made available when this sensor is applied to this medical use .
To create the sensor , the researchers took a DNA molecule that converts from a floppy and unfolded shape into a structured , folded shape in the presence of cocaine .
They then observe the change in the DNA by monitoring how electrons travel through it .
There are DNA molecules available that bind to many different targets , so it follows that similar sensors can be easily made for other targets .
Currently the cocaine sensor that is widely used by police is the Scott test .
When a chemical is added to the white powder it changes color .
But there are many ways around this test , explained Plaxco , and some cocaine manufacturers add a chemical to block the color change .
" Our sensor can detect cocaine no matter what they have cut it with : powdered sugar , flour , or the coffee that is sometimes used to mask the smell from dogs . "
At this point the new sensor detects cocaine in the blood or saliva to a degree of a few micromolars .
This is equivalent to the concentration of cocaine that would result from dropping a kilogram of cocaine into an olympic - sized swimming pool .
That concentration would be the equivalent of detecting three parts per million in blood .
Still , this is not yet sensitive enough for use in the emergency room , since a person with .3 parts per million of cocaine in their blood would be considered " stoned on cocaine . "
So more work needs to be done to increase the sensitivity of the new test .
Last summer was the first time that Plaxco had high school students doing work for academic credit in his lab .
" It was great , " said Plaxco .
" I thought they might be a distraction , but my students and post - doctoral fellows did a great job of mentoring and they all got a lot out of it , both the mentors and the mentorees . "
First author Brian Baker , a post - doctoral fellow , was one of these mentors .
Elaine Doctor , a senior at Channel Island High School in Oxnard , Calif. , and McCall Wood , a senior at Santa Barbara High School in Santa Barbara , Calif. , participated in the summertime Research Mentorship Program at UCSB on this work .
Elaine Doctor said , " At first I felt kind of intimidated by all the graduate students who are used to all the equipment , but we caught on really fast and everyone was really helpful .
I felt honored to help America 's war on drugs . "
Elaine plans to continue her studies in the sciences , either in biochemistry or biology .
McCall Wood said , " I 'm really excited about this work .
It let me know what research is like and I definitely want to pursue this .
Everyday we would go into the lab and test a different hypothesis .
I found it really exciting and extremely challenging .
I found my limits , like patience .
Being in the lab every day taught me so much about myself and about science in general .
It 's not really the results that were so important but the journey and the process . "

Lawyers ' convention set to criticize Bush on interrogations order Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday August 8 , 2007
Print This Email This The American Bar Association will gather its membership for an annual national convention next week .
One topic on the agenda will be President George W. Bush 's July 20 executive order on interrogations and torture , which the body may criticize in a proposed resolution .
" The resolution concludes that the Executive order is ' inconsistent with US obligations under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , ' " said Michael Posner , the President of Human Rights First , a nonprofit organization that was formerly known as the Lawyers ' Committee on Human Rights .
Posner suggested that the resolution was likely to pass .
" This resolution will be debated and voted on by the House of Delegates next Monday or Tuesday at the ABAs annual meeting in San Francisco , " the human rights attorney said .
" It is noteworthy that the resolution has been endorsed by the ABAs Standing Committee on Law and National Security , which has been supportive of many of the Administrations post - 9/11 policies and actions and traditionally has favored broad executive authority on matters of national security . "
The rebuke of Bush 's executive order by the top national organization for attorneys comes in an indirect manner .
The resolution calls on Congress to pass legislation that supersedes the July 20 executive order .
It also calls on Congress to ensure that wherever detainees are held by US government agencies , including the CIA , they are protected under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
Common Article 3 guarantees basic rights of humane treatment for individuals caught up in armed conflict , regardless of their status .
In a report accompanying the proposed ABA resolution , the president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York described why corrective action was needed .
" The actions urged by these recommendations are necessary to protect American troops who may be detained by other nations that would be disinclined to honor their treaty commitments in light of the U.S. governments failure to honor its own , " stated Barry W. Kamins .
" Furthermore , these actions are necessary to re-establish the nations credibility in asserting the rights of people everywhere .
The worlds most powerful nation must exercise its power while demonstrating its respect for the rule of law . "
Kamins added , " The American Bar Association must go on record as supporting adherence to the rule of law as a fundamental principle , for , when the rule of law is subjugated to a claim of ' necessity ' , all who claim its benefits are less secure . "
Various human rights groups , including Human Rights First , strongly criticized Bush 's executive order on torture on interrogations at the time it was announced .

Many people are creating 3D models of buildings , bridges , dams and other structures around the world and uploading them to the Google 3DWarehouse .
Many of the better quality buildings end up getting included in the Google Earth 3D Buildings layer .
As with most creative processes , sometimes modelers get a little carried away and sometimes include a little easter egg .
I was perusing Greg Rose ’s SketchUp Buildings blog and noticed he had pointed out a little addition to the model of the Tacony - Palmyra bridge between Pennsylvania and New Jersey .
Those of you who saw the classic “ Blues Brothers ” movie will recognize the car jumping the drawbridge in the model – which you can view in Google Earth here .
I do n’t think this is the same bridge from the scene in the movie ( and they did n’t go over the bridge ) , but it certainly is a fun little easter egg for the 3D model !
[ UPDATE : Check out the Google Earth animation someone made of the Blues Brothers car jumping the bridge .
You can see this yourself in GE if you read the story . ]

There ’s a general perception in America that Democrats are weak and have no backbone .
Democrats ca n’t be trusted with defense , with our military , with the war on terror because they do n’t know how to fight , lack the will to fight .
As an acquaintance said to me before the 2004 elections , she hated Bush , but with regards to Kerry said : “ He does n’t defend himself , how is he going to defend my kids ? ”
So today we find out from the Washington Post that Attorney General Gonzales perjured himself again last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The number of times Gonzales has committed this crime – and it is a crime – is heading towards ten or so , if not more .
From today ’s Washington Post :
Then - Attorney General John D. Ashcroft was “ feeble , ” “ barely articulate ” and “ stressed ” moments after a hospital room confrontation in March 2004 with Alberto R. Gonzales , who wanted Ashcroft to approve a warrantless wiretapping program over Justice Department objections , according to notes from FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III that were released yesterday .
One of Mueller ’s entries in five pages of a daily log pertaining to the dispute also indicated that Ashcroft ’s deputy was so concerned about undue pressure by Gonzales and other White House aides for the attorney general to back the wiretapping program that the deputy asked Mueller to bar anyone other than relatives from later entering Ashcroft ’s hospital room .
Mueller ’s description of Ashcroft ’s physical condition that night contrasts with testimony last month from Gonzales , who told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Ashcroft was “ lucid ” and “ did most of the talking ” during the brief visit .
It also confirms an account of the episode by former deputy attorney general James B. Comey , who said Ashcroft told the two men he was not well enough to make decisions in the hospital .
So what does Judiciary Committee chair Senator Leahy plan to do about it ?
Hold more hearings ?
Ooh , scary .
We have a criminal as the top law enforcement officer in the land and you people do nothing about it except hold hearings and issue press releases .
He has lied to you .
He has even lied to you when you asked him about his previous lies .
Yet you do nothing .
We have a word for people like you .
It ’s “ chump . ”
You have the power of the purse .
You have the power to defund Gonzales 100 % if he does n’t step down .
You have the power to defund the US attorney for DC if he wo n’t file charges .
You have the power to impeach Gonzles .
But instead you hold hearings .
When I worked for Ted Stevens , in the minority in the early 90s , with Clinton as president , we simply moved ahead with plans to cut the budget of a senior agency official who crossed our path .
It worked wonders .
No Bush official should give the Democrats the time of day .
They should just lie , cheat and steal – break the law when they do n’t get their away , and tell the Dems to go to hell .
Hell , it ’s what the Bushies are already doing , with impunity .
Everyone knows the Democrats wo n’t do a damn thing anyway .
So if they ’re going to act like chumps , why not play them like chumps ?
I really think the only way things are going to change in our country is for everyone and everything to hit rock bottom .
The Republicans are going to have to destroy our country in order for Democrats to start defending it .
And the Democrats wonder why people label us the party of wimps ?

LONDON -- Officials on Friday were investigating suspicious betting
patterns on a match involving top- seeded Nikolay Davydenko of
Russia , who retired with an injury against a low - ranked opponent at
an ATP tournament in Poland .
In an unprecedented move , British online gambling company
Betfair voided all bets Friday placed on Thursday 's second - round
match at the Prokom Open in Sopot between the defending champion
and No. 4 - ranked Davydenko and No. 87 - ranked Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina .
Betfair said it received about $ 7 million in bets on the match --
10 times the usual amount -- and most of the money was on Arguello
to win , even after Davydenko won the first set 6 - 2 .
" You try to leave it to the players to play the game the right
way , " said Andy Roddick , ranked fifth in the world .
" I think we
expect that of them .
If something 's found that 's shady , I , for one ,
will be extremely [ ticked ] off .
" Obviously you want to wait and see it play out , but it 's too
bad that it only takes one idiot to ruin things and create a bad
story . "
Police are investigating whether a Kaiser Permanente transplant surgeon attempted to hasten the death last February of a 26 - year - old San Luis Obispo man on life support in order to harvest his organs more quickly .
The allegations , if true , would constitute a grave breach of the nation ’s organ transplant rules , as well as a public relations setback for those promoting organ donation , experts in transplantation said .
San Luis Obispo police and the Medical Board of California are looking into the conduct of Dr. Hootan Roozrokh , who was a surgeon at Kaiser ’s now - defunct kidney transplant program in San Francisco .
At issue is whether he ordered excessive doses of powerful pain medication to speed the death of Ruben Navarro , according to several sources familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because investigations are ongoing .
Advertisement
Roozrokh could not be reached for comment .
His attorney , M. Gerald Schwartzbach , acknowledged that his client may have made some mistakes but said that “ he certainly was n’t the only one . ”
“ I just do n’t think that Dr. Roozrokh ought to be crucified as a result of this incident or his career destroyed , ” said Schwartzbach , who declined to address specific allegations .
Medical board spokeswoman Candis Cohen said her agency is also investigating the conduct of a second physician present during the incident .
That person , Kaiser officials confirmed , is Dr. Arturo Martinez , who at the time was the surgical director of Kaiser ’s transplant program .
Martinez declined to comment Tuesday .
Neither surgeon was attempting to recover the organs on behalf of Kaiser ; rather , they were working on behalf of the group that procures and distributes organs in much of Northern and Central California .
Transplant surgeons commonly perform such duties .
Advertisement
Dr. Timothy Pruett , president - elect of the United Network for Organ Sharing , called the allegations “ horrific . ”
He worried that they could scare people away from donating organs to help the 95,000 people awaiting life - saving transplants nationwide .
UNOS is the federal contractor charged with ensuring the safety and equity of the nation ’s transplant system .
“ We have to guarantee to the public that we ’re not going to go out and kill people to get their organs , ” said Pruett , chief of transplant surgery at the University of Virginia .
“ That ’s the worst of those cheap sci - fi books : ‘ The ghoulish docs are out pulling the plugs on these poor defenseless people , trying to snatch their organs . ’ ”
According to San Luis Obispo police , Navarro was near death after being found unresponsive at Casa de Vida , a long - term care facility .
He was taken to nearby Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center and placed on life support .
When it became clear he would not live , his family agreed to allow his organs to be harvested , and transplant surgeons were summoned Feb. 3 , 2006 .
Advertisement
State law specifies that transplant doctors cannot direct the treatment of potential organ donors before they are declared dead .
This restriction is designed , in large part , to assuage concerns that organ retrieval might take priority over patient care .
In this case , however , Roozrokh entered the operating room at Sierra Vista and was directing the administration of drugs to Navarro , the sources said .
When the patient did n’t die , Roozrokh allegedly told nurses : “ Let ’s just give him some more candy , ” according to a person who was briefed on what took place but spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigations .
Navarro was still alive about 30 minutes after being taken off life support -- the time limit set to ensure the viability of the organs .
Advertisement
He was then returned to the intensive care unit , where he died early the following morning .
His organs were not retrieved , police said in a statement .
Within days , nurses at the hospital -- alarmed about what had taken place -- alerted their superiors , Sierra Vista spokesman Ron Yukelson said .
An investigation was immediately launched , and regulators and the coroner were notified .
Yukelson said that outside physicians are not authorized to treat patients at the 165 - bed hospital .
In this case , “ the transplant surgeon began to direct care in the operating room , ” he said .
Schwartzbach said Navarro ’s treating physician was also in the operating room at the time , along with a coordinator from the organ procurement group .
Both could have asked Roozrokh and Martinez to leave , he said .
Advertisement
“ I cannot imagine that anybody ... did anything in that room , in that operating room , over the objection of the patient ’s attending physician , ” Schwartzbach said .
In addition , he said , there ’s no proof that Navarro would have lived any longer had the situation been handled differently .
Kaiser placed Roozrokh on administrative leave May 18 , after learning of the allegations against him , spokesman Matthew Schiffgens said , stressing that Roozrokh was not representing Kaiser during the incident .
The doctor was reinstated in January when there were “ no new developments ” in the investigations , Schiffgens said .
Martinez was not placed on leave , the spokesman said .
Advertisement
As a result of the hospital ’s own inquiry , an operating room nurse has been reassigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of the investigation .
Yukelson would not discuss her role in the alleged incident .
San Luis Obispo Police Capt .
Ian Parkinson said his agency is close to finishing its inquiry and will give the results to the district attorney ’s office in two or three weeks .
“ It ’s a sensitive case , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think we ’ve run across this in our lifetime . ”
Parkinson declined to speculate on possible charges .
The cause of death is pending .
The case has also prompted probes by UNOS and the state Department of Health Services , which regulates hospitals .
Advertisement
The type of organ retrieval at issue in this case , known as “ donation after cardiac death , ” is somewhat controversial .
But it has become more prevalent in recent years as doctors have sought to expand the donor pool beyond the limited number of people who are brain dead .
These donors have suffered a devastating brain injury and have no hope of recovery , but still have minimal brain function .
Removal of life support ultimately causes their hearts to stop .
Sierra Vista officials said this case was the hospital ’s first experience with “ donation after cardiac death . ”
In such cases , said Dr. David Mulligan , chairman of transplant surgery at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix , he tells transplant surgeons to “ have nothing to do ” with potential donors until they have been pronounced dead , which is typically five minutes after their heart stops beating .
Advertisement
“ The surgeons are supposed to be completely out of the room and not involved in the care of that patient , ” said Mulligan , who also sits on the UNOS board .
“ Any interference with the patient management prior to the patient being declared dead is not really appropriate .
It ’s a setup for problems . ”
In a statement , UNOS said it has taken steps to ensure that nothing like the alleged actions in San Luis Obispo happens again .
“ The greatest tragedy resulting from this story would be if altruistic Americans lose faith in organ donation processes and choose not to become organ donors , ” the statement said .
The allegations against Roozrokh come in the wake of a scandal at Kaiser Permanente ’s Northern California kidney transplant program .
The giant HMO announced in May that it would close the fledgling program in San Francisco after The Times reported that hundreds of patients had been endangered after its start - up in late 2004 .

Kaiser had forced patients to leave established programs at two outside hospitals and join its own waiting list .
In the process , Kaiser lost track of many patients and delayed critical surgeries .

The security gaps emerged following a court case over drug smugglers .
The findings come after tough new security measures were implemented in Britain following an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic airliners .
In August airports across Britain were thrown into chaos by tough new security measures applied because of a specific threat concerning hand luggage .
But after spending hours getting through security , many passengers would have been unaware that they were flying on planes whose holds contained tonnes of cargo - much of which had not been checked , inspected or X - rayed .
' Known shippers '
This happens every day as 70 % of air cargo is shipped on passenger airliners .
Under a system called " known shipper " or " known consignor " companies which have been security vetted by government appointed agents can send parcels by air , which do not have to be subjected to any further security checks .
Since 9/11 two people in the US have even have managed to post themselves home by airmail , apparently it was cheaper than buying a ticket
Unless a package from a known shipper arouses suspicion or is subject to a random search it is taken on trust that its contents are safe .
David Reynolds , flight safety and security officer of Balpa , the British Airline Pilots ' Association , told Radio 4's World Tonight programme that " only a small proportion is X - rayed " and that if cargo comes from a known sender " the security checks ( for passenger aircraft ) will be exactly the same ( as for pure cargo carrying aircraft ) " .
" The only additional checks will be if they are not from a known consignor where they will go through an X - ray or a physical check , " he said .
John Goldsworthy , chairman of the European Express Association 's Security Committee , said it would be impractical to scan everything .
He said as well as parcels , cargo might be " large indivisible loads " , requiring a combination of security measures .
" Time , economy , the actual application of 100 % security screening is not a practical option in that it would actually stop the operation , " he said .
One reason the industry thinks security for air cargo is less of a problem is that it believes terrorists want to be certain of destroying passenger aircraft and that they could not be certain of doing that by shipping bombs as parcels .
' Flawed ' system
However several large companies such as FedEx and UPS offer clients the chance to follow the progress of their parcels online .
This is a facility that Chris Yates , an expert on airline security for Jane 's Transport , says could be exploited by terrorists .
Even reliable respectable organisations , you really do n't know who is in the warehouse , who is tampering with packages
Captain Gary Boettcher
" From these you can get a fair indication when that package is in the air , if you are looking to get a package into New York from Heathrow at a given time of day . "
There is also evidence that in the air cargo industries other security measures can also be broken .
One industry source told the World Tonight that possibly as little as a half of air cargo leaving the UK is scanned - and in the US even less is checked .
Since 9/11 two people in the US have even managed to post themselves home by airmail - apparently it was cheaper than buying a ticket .
Captain Gary Boettcher , president of the US Coalition Of Airline Pilots Associations , says the " known shipper " system " is probably the weakest part of the cargo security today " .
" There are approx 1.5 million known shippers in the US .
There are thousands of freight forwarders .
Anywhere down the line packages can be intercepted at these organisations , " he said .
" Even reliable respectable organisations , you really do n't know who is in the warehouse , who is tampering with packages , putting parcels together . "
He added : " A package going from New York to Britain could have a bomb on it that is barometrically detonated so that when the plane descends down to British airspace the bomb goes off . "
Drug smuggling
That may sound fanciful , but the BBC uncovered further evidence it could be all too easy .
In June this year a Nigerian student called Olumwaseum Adeyemi was sentenced to 11 years at Kingston Crown Court for importing cocaine into the UK .
We have to get to the point of checking 100 % of everything because ... somewhere down the line somebody will make an attempt to blow up an aircraft again
Chris Yates
Mr Adeyemi brought pounds of cocaine into Britain unchecked by air cargo , transported from the US by the Federal Express courier company .
He did not have to pay the postage .
This was made possible because he managed to illegally buy the confidential Fed Ex account numbers of reputable and security cleared companies from a former employee .
An accomplice in the US was able to put the account numbers on drugs parcels which , as they appeared to have been sent by known shippers , arrived unchecked at Stansted Airport .
When police later contacted the companies whose accounts and security clearance had been so abused they discovered they had suspected nothing .
In a statement to the BBC FedEx said security was a top priority .
Mr Goldsworthy admitted the current vetting system would not have caught terrorists from 9/11 or the 7 July bombings because they did not have criminal convictions .
" That is correct , yes , but as I say there are quite stringent requirements within the air cargo industry for the vetting of personnel , " he said .
Some pilots groups say the way to tackle the problem is to invest in new neutron scanning technology which they believe would allow all cargo to be scanned quickly and easily .
Mr Yates believes that the case for action is overwhelming .
" We have to get to the point of checking 100 % of everything that goes on a passenger plane because as sure as night follows day one time somewhere down the line somebody will make an attempt to blow up an aircraft again . "
Frightening prospect
It all adds up to a frightening prospect , a vetting system that would not stop potential terrorists working in sensitive areas and a package tracking system that could allow terrorists to target particular flights or even planes , bringing them and their passengers down when and where they wanted .
Dr Jim Swire , whose daughter died in the Lockerbie air disaster in 1988 , said they were aware the known shipper system " was open to abuse " .
He warned the emphasis on preventing suicide attacks could prevent the authorities from taking adequate action to deal with the very real threat of a bomb in the cargo hold .
" Of course what happened at Lockerbie was that there was an automated device in the hold of the aircraft and no terrorist on board .
My message is you do not need a terrorist on board , " he said .
FedEx told the BBC that it had " worked co-operatively and effectively with law enforcement and regulatory agencies around the world for a number of years to continuously strengthen our security program " .
" Not only does FedEx comply with all country - specific aviation security and anti-terrorist regulations in both the UK and the US , but our security processes and procedures meet and often exceed regulatory requirements as well .
" The FedEx security systems consist of multiple layers of interlocking procedures and processes and contain a number of redundancies that comprise an excellent security system .
We do not , however , discuss specific measures for obvious reasons . "
" I have a choice .
I can either stand by and lead my constituents to believe I do not care that the president apparently no longer believes he is bound by any law or code of decency .
Or I can act . "
-- U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers
The latest version of the lengthy report on Bush and Cheney 's crimes produced by John Conyers ' staff on the House Judiciary Committee includes a foreword by former Congresswoman Liz Holtzman which ends thus :
" This pattern of immunity for presidents must stop .
Impeaching President Bush for lying to get us into a war will not only protect us from him , but also send an unmistakable message to future presidents : never again . "
I 'm sure Conyers likes that foreword , because he put it in there and it undoubtedly helps to sell books .
Impeachment sells , and some people will do anything that sells , even faking decency .
Some of the best paid prostitutes probably impersonate virgins .
" We can fire Bush ! " Conyers likes to shout at rallies , later explaining that he simply means we can sit on our hands for two years until Bush 's term ends .
Conyers is refusing to even begin impeachment hearings , even against Cheney , even against Gonzales .
He 's refusing even to meet with the author of his book 's foreword to talk about it .
He 's refusing even to meet with 400 of his constituents gathered to discuss it .
On May 29th , Conyers arrived early at a town hall meeting in Detroit that he had agreed to participate in .
He left before it began , and never returned .
He had , at the last minute , scheduled another public forum for the same time , about gas prices .
The crowd at that one was reportedly much smaller and included a number of people who insisted on talking about impeachment .
Conyers ' only legitimate excuse for not moving on impeachment would be if he were moving on criminal indictments .
His report begins by listing numerous violations of law committed by Bush and Cheney .
But Holtzman 's short foreword argues for the advantages of impeachment over indictment .
I find her case persuasive , and so apparently does some portion of John Conyers .
The question facing the world right now is how to send the rest of John Conyers an unmistakable message .
An activist named Gordon Bennett sent me one idea :
" I am planning , " he wrote of Conyers ' book , " to tear out one page at a time , maybe highlight a key statement , and send it to his Detroit office with a short message pasted to the page from his book , something like ,
" Congressman Conyers - -
" WHY WASTE ALL THIS EXCELLENT RESEARCH ?
LET'S GET ON WITH IT !
" or ,
" YOU'VE MADE THE CASE IN PRINT .
PLEASE MAKE IT ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE ! "
Anyone interested in joining in Bennett 's effort can find Conyers ' report for free at http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/constitutionincrisis or purchase it at all the usual online bookstores .
Mail your page a day to
Chairman John Conyers
2426 Rayburn Building
Washington , DC 20515
or
669 Federal Building
231 W. Lafayette
Detroit , MI 48226
Or , here 's a better idea .
Fax it each day to ( 202 ) 225-0072 or ( 313 ) 226-2085 .
There is a portion of John Conyers that is absolutely golden , that means to do absolutely right by us and our descendants .
But that is precisely why we are so reluctant to hold Conyers to account .
We 're willing to keep moaning about Bush and Cheney .
We 'll even denounce Nancy Pelosi for her efforts to pressure Conyers not to impeach .
But the fate of this nation and all the nations it impacts around the world is too big a matter to allow our friendship and admiration for John Conyers to block us from demanding - and I mean DEMANDING - that he live up to his oath of office .
Conyers pushed this issue when his party was in the minority .
His staff produced a brilliant report .
But those facts make his failure to act less , not more , excusable .
And let 's be clear , after five months in the majority , Conyers is failing to act , not waiting to act .
No more evidence is needed .
No better evidence than what we possess for several offenses is even conceivable .
And no investigations are going to progress much further , now that the White House has made clear that it is going to simply ignore subpoenas ( actually , Cheney announced that before the elections , but who 's counting ) .
Nor can Conyers be said to be waiting for his colleagues to gather together the numbers to guarantee passage of Articles of Impeachment .
Those numbers will follow impeachment proceedings , not precede them .
But Congress Members will only follow where their most senior and respected members lead .
If no one leads , nothing will happen - except the ongoing commission of the sort of crimes chronicled so pointlessly and tragically in Conyers ' report .
The list of crimes is a smorgasbord of impeachment options .
If the war is too tough a sell within Congress , Conyers can proceed with the spying , the signing statements , detentions , torture , Katrina , elections .
He only needs to pick one in order to do what is needed .
Not to act is to be complicit in all of them .

Sa'ed al - Atrash , Paramedic
Today [ Monday , 6 August ] , while I was on my shift at the Red Crescent in ' Araba , the traffic - control officer at our station in Jenin , Ibrahim Yaseen , notified me that Kamelah Ibrahim , from Barta'a , was suffering heart problems and needed assistance and to be taken to hospital .
The traffic - control officer added that members of the village council had arranged with the Israeli DCO for the ambulance to enter the village .
Around 6:50A.M. , Fayez Ashkar and I drove toward the Barta 'a crossing .
We arrived at the crossing at 7:08 A.M. and drove up to the gate because we knew our entry had been coordinated .
A soldier and several security officers standing there ordered us to move back .
We backed up , stopping about twenty meters away from the crossing .
We thought we would only have to wait until they finished checking the car in front of us and that they would then call us for inspection and let us pass .
About 25 - 30 minutes after we arrived , we called our hotline center .
Fayez , who speaks good Hebrew , got out of the ambulance and went to the gate to try to convince the guards to let us pass .
He came back and said that he failed to convince them .
They said our matter had not been coordinated and that we would have to wait .
While waiting , we called our station a few times , and at 7:50 A.M. , the Red Crescent official in charge , Ibrahim Dababneh , told us to come back to the hotline center .
Before we left and headed for Jenin , a volunteer from Machsom Watch came and asked us why we were there .
We told her we were trying to pass through the gate to pick up a patient who was in life - threatening condition and take her to the hospital .
While the woman called someone on her cell phone , one of the security officers signaled to us to come to the gate .
At the gate , the security - company guard told me to go back .
At this stage , we decided to return to Jenin .
In the meantime , relatives of the patient took her by car to the crossing , hoping we would be there , but we had already gone back to Jenin .
We arrived at our station in Jenin around 8:40 A.M.
About five minutes after we arrived , Ibrahim Dababneh told us that a man named Muneer , from the Israeli Civil Administration , asked that we return to the crossing and said that the ambulance could pass through .
We drove back , arriving at the crossing around 9:05 A.M.
When we arrived , dozens of residents told us that the woman had died a few minutes earlier , while waiting at the crossing .
We examined her and found that she had recently passed away .
We wanted to take her to the hospital , but her family insisted that she be taken back to the village to be buried there .
At the gate , the Israeli officer Muneer asked us why we had been so late .
I asked him if he was serious , and he said that he was n't .
He stayed with the family and tried to calm the residents , who were very angry .
Sa'ed Ghaleb Husni al - Atrash , 36 , married with four children , is a paramedic and ambulance driver for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Jenin and ' Araba .
His testimony was given to Atef Abu a - Rub on 6 August 2007 at the first - aid center in ' Araba , Jenin district .
So Elissa designed this study where we looked at two groups of mothers .
One had normal , healthy children .
The other group had a child with a chronic illness .
Physiological and psychological measurements were done on everyone .
With the stressed group , we found that the longer the mothers had been caring for their chronically ill child , the less their telomerase and the shorter their telomeres .
This was the first time you could clearly see cause and effect from a nongenetic influence .
Genes play a role in telomerase levels , but this was not genes .
This was something impacting the body that came from the outside and affecting its ability to repair itself .
By the way , we found similar effects in women who were primary caregivers for partners with dementia .
Q. Is this scientific proof of the mind - body connection ?
A . It ’s a proof .
There have been others .
Researchers have found that the brain definitely sends nerves directly to organs of the immune system and not just to the heart and the lower gut .
In that way , too , the brain is influencing the body .

One of the things that came out of our study of these mothers is a link between low telomerase and stress - related diseases .
We looked at the measures for cardiovascular disease — bad lipid profiles , obesity , all that stuff .
The women with those had low telomerase .
We also looked at low telomeres and cancer .
We wondered if a cell with worn down chromosome tips might divide in some abnormal way .
Our findings have yet to be published , so I ca n’t tell you much here , but we think we ’re onto something .
Q. Is your goal to find a drug to repair the telomeres ?
A. Or an intervention .
We know that stress is bad for cells .
What about alleviating it ?
We ’ve been collaborating on studies looking at the telomerase levels in people who practice meditation .
We are looking at whether or not telomerase changes after a three - month program of meditation .
We ’ll know more soon .
1959 : The first seven astronauts selected to participate in NASA ’s Project Mercury are introduced by the space agency at press conference in Washington .
Dubbed the “ Mercury Seven ” by the press , those chosen were John Glenn , Alan Shepard , Gordon Cooper , Scott Carpenter , Gus Grissom , Wally Schirra and Donald “ Deke ” Slayton .
Project Mercury was the United States ’ first manned space - flight program .
Its mission : to put an American in orbit around the Earth .
Shepard was the first member of the fraternity into space , aboard Freedom 7 .
Although reaching an altitude of 116.5 statute miles and attaining a top speed of 5,134 mph , he did not complete an orbit .
That honor would fall to Glenn 11 months later .
All the astronauts , with the exception of Slayton who was grounded because of a previously undiscovered heart condition , flew in Project Mercury .
Grissom would be killed in 1967 with two other astronauts when a flash fire consumed their capsule during training for the first Apollo mission .
The story of the “ Mercury Seven ” was recounted in The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe , which was later made into an entertaining , if rather fanciful , movie by the same name .

RUGenius also found this google video of it in action … it is hilarious … watch it at least half way through ?
( silly how upset people are getting with me for saying watch it all the way through , maybe it was just funnier to me around 5 am ? )
Ok , maybe after this pic that RUGenius found , not craving it so much …
I did n’t know i could crave a cube hardboiled egg… until now .
Andrew Huff has a great flickr set of the egg cuber in action ~ apparently this is some retro device that i’ve missed out on ?
You take your hardboiled egg while warm , stick it in here , screw the cap down , and * poof * square egg ?
Lots of various pictures and video below …
This would make a fantastic Christmas present !
Try as I might , I cannot find anywhere in the US that will ship this to the UK , nor a supplier in the UK , any suggestions ? ;- o)

Re the egg cuber — when I first moved to California ( Bay Area ) in 1964 ( note : that is 42 years ago ) , one of the initial gadgets I bought was an egg cuber , at Cost Plus store in San FRancisco !!!!!
That was their only store then .

Leave a note
Life is n’t a steady escalator .
Sometimes getting better requires that you first get a lot worse .
If you ca n’t admit to yourself that you suck at something , chances are it will hold you back from future improvements .
Pride , ego , fear of rejection , call it what you will .
The result is the same .
Part of you likes your temporary holdout in life .
It is n’t the work that scares you , or even the unknown .
It ’s the fact that in order to move forward you have to get your hands dirty .
Examples of “ I Suck ” Moments Creating Progress
I ’d like to argue that “ I Suck ” moments are n’t the rarity .
Letting go of what you already have is a crucial part of many improvements .
Here ’s just a few examples of how failing to utilize “ I Suck ” moments could hold you back :
The Dead - End Job
You want to start a business .
But you do n’t know anything about business .
In fact , you ’re pretty sure it ca n’t compete with the salary you are already earning .
Your job is comfortable , but it does n’t make you want to leap out of bed each morning .
Your choice is either to face the inevitable “ I Suck ” moment , ignore your pride and get started with your business .
Or go back to working the job that will eventually suffocate you .
The Dull Relationship
You ’ve been together for months but the passion is n’t there any more .
But you have n’t been dating in awhile and you ’re worried you ca n’t do any better .
Your choice is either to stick with someone who is n’t right for you or admit you suck at dating but go through with it anyways .
The Out - of - Shape Body
It ’s been years since you ’ve hit the gym .
Now you want to get back in shape , but it will mean departing from your days of youthful fitness .
Your choice is to either admit you suck at exercising and struggle out with the basics of fitness and willpower others have mastered – or continue to live an unhealthy life .
The examples of “ I Suck ” moments being the deciding factor are numerous .
I have personally had many “ I Suck ” moments in my own life .
As a shy , introverted kid it took a lot of pride - swallowing to admit I had to learn a lot about communication and socializing .
I started on the bottom and faced more than a few failures .
Now I have hundreds of friends and consider it to be a personal strength .
When I started this blog I was only seventeen and new to writing , blogging and hardly an expert .
I had to face up to the “ I Suck ” moment and work hard to gain traffic .
Looking at months of virtually no subscribers was just a small part of the ego - dissolving I needed to do .
How to Push Past the “ I Suck ” Moments
Nobody wants to be bad at something .
Nobody wants to take a step backwards .
Nobody wants to move from a comfort zone where you already kick - ass to one where you feel out of place .
But sometimes it needs to be done .
Here ’s just a few ideas I ’ve found helpful for pushing past “ I Suck ” until you can eventually say “ I ’m Great ! ”
Cut Denial –
The hardest step is admitting you have a problem .
Admitting that an area of your life is n’t as great as you want it to be .
Or facing the truth that your current direction , while comfortable , is n’t taking you anywhere .

Face Your Pain – Do n’t fight it .
If you feel crappy , search through it .
Do n’t dilute your depressed or uncomfortable feelings about a bad area of your life .
Write out your thoughts and feeling .
Admit “ I Suck ” liberally .
It will substitute a chronic pain for an acute one .
But facing those thoughts is the only way through them .

Start at the Bottom – Push through your pride and start back at the bottom .
If quitting your boring job to pursue your dreams means a cut in salary , you might have to take it .
Losing one relationship may mean you need to stumble in your dating life .

Losing one relationship may mean you need to stumble in your dating life .
Find an Anchor – Find something that gives you self - worth .
Anchor yourself in something more permanent so your self - esteem does n’t crash when you face the “ I Suck ” moment .
This could be family , spiritual beliefs , knowledge , close friends , skills or even the present .
You Don’t Really Suck
“ I Suck ” moments are an illusion in themselves .
As painful as they are , once you go to the other side , you ca n’t imagine not having done it sooner .
Although it may appear to be a dip in quality of life , the opposite often occurs .
Looking back , the “ I Suck ” was more brief than it had first appeared .
Congress has at last taken an interest in a seemingly arcane debate over the metrics used by the FCC and is moving on the issue with surprising speed .
For years , geeks have criticized the way that the agency collects broadband information , focusing especially on the fact that the bar for " broadband " is set laughably low ( 200 Kbps ) and that if one person in a ZIP code has access , then the entire ZIP code is considered " served . "
The Broadband Data Improvement Act ( PDF ) hopes to remedy some of these problems , and it has just unanimously cleared the Senate Commerce Committee .
The bill , should it pass the broader Senate and House , would force the FCC to make a couple of major changes to the way that it puts together its broadband information .
For one thing , the agency is directed to come up with a new metric for " second generation broadband , " defined as being the minimum speed needed to stream full - motion , high - definition video .
The FCC also needs to get far more granular with its reporting , switching from the use of simple ZIP codes to the far more specific ZIP+4 codes .
That may still not appease everyone , but it will greatly increase the quality of data from large , yet sparsely populated areas that might share a zip , but not the full ZIP+4 .
Arguably , it is these areas that need study the most .
The idea is that , unless policymakers have good data to work with , they are likely to end up making poor policy .
Passage of the bill out of committee has already drawn praise from Free Press , one of the groups that has lobbied hard for the bill and has appeared at committee hearings where it was discussed .
Free Press policy director Ben Scott said , " For too long , policymakers have been forced to operate in the dark , relying on misleading and sometimes inaccurate information about the U.S. broadband market .
By providing detailed information about the deployment , availability and use of broadband services in this country , the Broadband Data Improvement
Act promises to bring us one step closer to our shared goal of universal , affordable broadband . "
Pets may not be the only organisms endangered by some food additives .
An arsenic - based additive used in chicken feed may pose health risks to humans who eat meat from chickens that are raised on the feed , according to an article in the April 9 issue of Chemical & Engineering News , the weekly news magazine of the American Chemical Society .
Roxarsone , the most common arsenic - based additive used in chicken feed , is used to promote growth , kill parasites and improve pigmentation of chicken meat .
In its original form , roxarsone is relatively benign .
But under certain anaerobic conditions , within live chickens and on farm land , the compound is converted into more toxic forms of inorganic arsenic .
Arsenic has been linked to bladder , lung , skin , kidney and colon cancer , while low - level exposures can lead to partial paralysis and diabetes , the article notes .
Use of roxarsone has become a topic of increasing controversy .
A growing number of food suppliers have stopped using the compound , including the nation 's largest poultry producer , Tyson Foods , according to the article .
Still , about 70 percent of the 9 billion broiler chickens produced annually in the U.S. are fed a diet containing roxarsone , the article points out .
Complicating the issue is the fact that no one knows the exact amount of arsenic found in chicken meat or ingested by consumers who frequently eat chicken .
" Neither the Food and Drug Administration nor the Department of Agriculture has actually measured the level of arsenic in the poultry meat that most people consume , " according to the article .
The National Chicken Council , a trade association that represents the U.S. chicken industry , claims there is " no reason to believe there are any human health hazards " associated with the use of roxarsone .
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday accused Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales of repeatedly misleading Congress and suggested that he had perjured himself in connection with statements to lawmakers about an anti-terrorism program .
One after another , Democrats -- and some Republicans -- accused Gonzales of a pattern of deceit in addressing issues from his role in last year ’s firing of top prosecutors to his 2004 participation in an unusual late - night visit to the hospital room of his ailing predecessor , John Ashcroft .
“ You ’ve come here seeking our trust , ” Sen . Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , who chairs the Judiciary Committee , told Gonzales .
“ Frankly , Mr. Attorney General , you ’ve lost mine .
And this is something I ’ve never said to any Cabinet member before . ”
The hearing was Gonzales ’ first opportunity to describe under oath his version of a March 10 , 2004 , standoff in Ashcroft ’s hospital room over recertifying President Bush ’s wiretapping program .

But his explanation again was met with skepticism .
The attorney general ’s appearance was designed in part for Gonzales to repair fractured relations with members of Congress ; his credibility has suffered under the weight of multiple controversies .
But if anything , he lost ground -- as his explanations of missteps and statements raised even more questions from senators about his candor and truthfulness .
“ I do not find your testimony credible , candidly , ” Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) said .
“ The chairman ’s already said that the committee ’s going to review your testimony very carefully to see if your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable . ”

While Gonzales still enjoys the support of Bush , the confrontation was remarkable for the ridicule heaped upon the nation ’s top law - enforcement officer .
Gonzales said he wanted to stay at the Justice Department to fix problems that have surfaced during his tenure , including evidence that politics has infected hiring practices at the department .
But lawmakers said Gonzales was the principal problem , and they questioned whether the steps he was taking would make a difference .
The attorney general ’s performance Tuesday reinforced the impression of some who believe he is out of touch with Justice Department policy issues .

Gonzales was confronted with a May 2006 memo in which he authorized expanded communications with White House officials , including the office of Vice President Dick Cheney , regarding pending investigations .
“ What on Earth business does the office of the vice president have in the internal workings of the Department of Justice with respect to criminal investigations , civil investigations , ongoing matters ? ” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - R.I. ) asked .
Gonzales acknowledged that he did not have a good answer .
“ As a general matter , I would say that that ’s a good question , ” he said , eliciting laughter from the dozen or so protesters in the audience .
James B. Comey , a former Ashcroft deputy , told the committee this spring that he believed Gonzales -- along with then - White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. -- had tried to strong - arm Ashcroft into overriding objections Comey had to an administration anti-terrorism program .

Ashcroft had named Comey acting attorney general while he was recovering from gallbladder surgery .
Gonzales , who at the time was White House counsel , defended his actions Tuesday , saying that he decided to involve Ashcroft only after an emergency meeting with senior congressional leaders in the White House Situation Room .
He said “ the consensus ” was the program should be continued , even though Comey objected .
Gonzales said he knew that Ashcroft was seriously ill ; the encounter took place a day after surgery , while he was in intensive care .
But Gonzales denied trying to take advantage of a sick man : “ We never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent . ”
Gonzales also said the disagreement was not about the Terrorist Surveillance Program that Bush ordered after Sept. 11 that authorized warrantless monitoring of domestic phone calls and e-mails with suspected terrorists overseas .
Rather , he said , the disagreement was over “ other intelligence activities , ” which he declined to describe .

The distinction is important because Gonzales told the committee last year that he was aware of no serious dissent within the administration over the warrantless wiretap program .
Democrats and Republicans alike questioned whether Gonzales was being truthful in attempting to explain his earlier testimony .
Whitehouse , a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , accused Gonzales of obfuscation .
“ The path to that kernel of truth is so convoluted and is so contrary to the plain import of what you said , that I , really , at this point have no choice but to believe that you intended to deceive us , ” he said .
John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) , who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and was among the congressional leaders Gonzales said was briefed before the Ashcroft hospital visit , accused Gonzales of fabricating the account .

“ He is making up something to protect himself , ” Rockefeller said in a briefing with reporters after the judiciary committee hearing .
Asked if Gonzales had deliberately misled Congress , Rockefeller said : “ Based on what I know about it , I ’d have to say yes . ”
Rockefeller said lawmakers had received briefings on only one intelligence operation , the warrantless wiretapping .
The program was confirmed by Bush after it was disclosed in media reports in December 2005 .
Responding to those comments , the Justice Department issued a statement saying the attorney general stood by his testimony .
“ We find Chairman Rockefeller ’s statements about his lack of familiarity with this issue puzzling , since the chairman ’s committee has been conducting oversight on this very specific issue , ” said spokesman Brian Roehrkasse .
Gonzales also was questioned Tuesday about an allegation that he had attempted to shape the testimony of a former top aide who was about to appear before Congress .
Monica Goodling told the House Judiciary Committee this spring that Gonzales had tried discuss with her the events leading up to the U.S. attorneys ’ firings and that the encounter made her “ uncomfortable . ”
Advertisement
Leahy noted that Gonzales previously had told the committee that he was not speaking with anyone about the firings because he did not want to interfere with the investigation .
“ So your earlier testimony was wrong ? ” Leahy asked Tuesday .
“ I would n’t say that it was wrong , ” Gonzales replied .
“ My conversation with her was not to shape her testimony .
My conversation with her was to simply reassure her that as far as I knew , no one had done anything intentionally wrong here .
I think she was confused and I think needed reassurance . ”
Advertisement
Gonzales also was asked about the decision of the White House , based on a Justice Department legal opinion , to assert executive privilege and decline to turn over documents and testimony to congressional investigators examining the firings of the U.S. attorneys .
The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote today on a resolution holding White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former Bush counsel Harriet E. Miers in contempt for their refusal to cooperate with the investigation .
The White House has indicated that it will not permit the Justice Department to prosecute people for congressional contempt because of the belief that the law does not apply to cases where presidential aides are invoking executive privilege .
Saying the administration ’s positions on executive privilege and prosecuting contempt cases were effectively preventing Congress from exercising its oversight responsibility of the executive branch , Specter asked Gonzales whether he thought “ you can have a constitutional government ” under those circumstances .
Advertisement
Gonzales observed that Congress and the president have separate powers under the U.S. Constitution , and that “ in very rare instances , they sometimes litigate it in the courts . ”
“ Would you focus on my question for just a minute , please ? ” Specter said .
Gonzales said he could not comment because he said the question related to “ an ongoing controversy in which I am recused . ”
“ I ’m not going to pursue that question , Mr. Attorney General , ” Specter concluded , “ because I see it ’s hopeless . ”

Jan. 2 , 2007  -- Rudolph Giuliani attended the memorial service for former President Ford Tuesday , surrounded by the nation 's biggest political leaders .
But it was the former New York City mayor who ended up making the big news , landing in the middle of a potential political bombshell .
The New York Daily News obtained an 140 - page dossier outlining Giuliani 's presidential campaign strategy , including everything from his fundraising plans to perceived political weaknesses .
Giuliani has n't even officially announced his plans to run for president , although he formed a presidential exploratory committee last November .
The dossier , in the form of a notebook , was given to Daily News reporter Ben Smith by someone " sympathetic " to one of Giuliani 's competitors , although Smith would not reveal which one .
" It was given to me by Christmas elves , " he said .
The headline in the Daily News said the notebook was left in a hotel room by a Giuliani aide .
But the Giuliani camp strongly denied that , and a spokeswoman called the leak of the notebook a campaign dirty trick .
The notebook revealed that Giuliani is planning a gargantuan fundraising push to bring in more than $ 100 million this year , $ 25 million in the first quarter alone .
One page from the notebook included an outline of how the fundraising operation would be organized , using baseball terminology to describe the different levels of fundraising .
MVP ( Most Valuable Player ) fundraisers , for example , would be expected to bring in more than $ 200,000 each , while All - Stars would need to snag $ 100,000 and Sluggers $ 50,000 .
Why does Giuliani need so much money ?
His camp expects to be hit hard on several subjects .
The Daily News reports the notebook lists anticipated problem areas that could come up during a nasty campaign .
For example :
Giuliani's multimillion dollar consulting firm
Giuliani's close relationship with disgraced former aide Bernard Kerik
Giuliani's marital history , including his divorce from his second wife , Donna Hanover
The campaign memo said that Giuliani could expect to be hit with more than $ 100 million worth of attacks on these subjects .
Other than the slightly amateurish quality of losing such a document , nothing in the notebook is severely damaging , or even shocking .
There are no skeletons in the closet that have n't been reported on before .
But the biggest problem revealed in the memo might be that several big - money targets listed as potential Giuliani donors , including Lew Eisenberg , Larry Bathgate and FedEx CEO Fred Smith , have already signed up with Sen.
John McCain , Giuliani 's chief Republican rival .
" There is a limited number of good people out there , " said Republican strategist Rich Galen .
But Galen said Giuliani still has some built - in advantages over his competitors .
" Giuliani is frozen in time " in the minds of Americans , in the events surrounding September 11 , he said .
In the latest polling in Iowa and New Hampshire , Giuliani made a strong showing , and was either leading or closely behind McCain .
If tyranny and oppression come to this land , it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy .
Of all the enemies to public liberty , war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other .
War is the parent of armies ; from these proceed debts and taxes ; and armies , and debts , and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few .
The loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger , real or imagined , from abroad .
-- James Madison
Cowardice asks the question : is it safe ?
Expediency asks the question : is it political ?
Vanity asks the question : is it popular ?
But conscience asks the question : is it right ?
And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe , nor political , nor popular – but one must take it simply because it is right .
-- Martin Luther King , Jr.
Talk radio's role in killing immigration reform in Congress is spurring a backlash .
Some Democrats in Congress , maddened about radio attacks on the bill , would like to revive a federal rule that requires broadcasters to present opposing views on important issues .
Those on both sides of the issue agree talk radio played a major role in derailing the Senate immigration bill .
The constant drumbeat on talk radio stations across the country galvanized voters to jam the Senate 's phone system with angry calls .
That helped persuade lawmakers to kill the bill , all but ensuring that comprehensive immigration reform is dead until after the 2008 election .
Talk show hosts say they merely gave voice to existing anger about legislation that would have given people who broke immigration laws a path to citizenship .
Critics say the hosts distorted a compromise bill and inflamed listeners actively to oppose it .
This past week , the United States Senate passed unanimously -- 97 to 0 -- what amounted to a declaration of war against Iran .
A few weeks ago , the House passed a resolution -- 411 to 2 -- that similarly provided an alleged rationale for war against Iran .
In this manner , Congress , nominally controlled by the opposition party , has granted the Bush administration advance approval for the commencement of hostilities against Iran .
Since the Senate has announced , with no dissenting votes at all , that Iran is itself responsible for acts of war against the United States , and the House has stated , with only two voices in opposition , that Iran is illegally and clandestinely developing nuclear weapons , no prominent Democrat will be able to offer any principled , significant policy objection when Bush announces that the bombs have already begun to fall .
These detestable actions by Congress represent the triumph of pure propaganda , and of warmongering fiction over reality .
In fact , it has never been shown that Iran has violated even one provision of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , to which it is a signatory .
Instead , the United States has deliberately engineered a situation whereby arbitrary , extra-legal demands are placed on Iran .
Then , when Iran fails to comply with these nonbinding , illegitimate demands , Iran is declared to be the criminal -- when the " crime " has been created out of nothing .
( See Gordon Prather 's latest article on this subject , and read his many earlier articles , listed on the right side of that page , for a much fuller history . )
In the same way , it is far from clear exactly what Iran 's influence and actions in Iraq are .
But even if it were true that Iran is aiding groups that attack U.S. forces in Iraq , the United States is in no position to complain -- since we have no right to be in Iraq in the first place .
If we wish to take our personnel out of harm 's way , That is the right course of action , it is the only practical course of action , and it is the one thing we absolutely refuse to do .
Even if our troop levels should be reduced over the next year or two , the plan is for the United States to remain in Iraq for decades to come The United States has already amassed a decades - long history of criminal interference in the Middle East , and of interference with Iran in particular .
Among many other actions , we overthrew the Mossadegh government in 1953 and restored the shah to power , and we provided significant support to Hussein 's Iraq in the devastating war with Iran in the 1980s ( see Sheldon Richman 's detailed article for a comprehensive review of our incessant interventions up to the time of its writing , all of which were uniformly disastrous in their ultimate results ) .
On the other hand , Iran has invaded no one , and it is several years away from having even one nuclear weapon , if one assumes that is Iran 's goal ( which Iran denies ) .
If the United States attacks Iran , it will be attacking a country that does not threaten it ( again ) , and a country thatseriously threaten it ( again ) .
This would be an indisputable example of criminal , aggressive war , a crime against peace condemned by the Nuremberg Principles -- those principles we ourselves devised after World War II to condemn the kind of horrors perpetrated by the Nazis .
Now our governing class , with only two exceptions , has officially approved in advance a crime of the same exact kind .
And if the United States were to use nuclear weapons of any kind , the crime would be ungraspably worse .
In half a century , the roles have been completely reversed , and the United States now assumes the part played by those we defeated in World War II .
But the worst and most soul - shattering aspect of this development is the following : almost no one in the United States itself appears to have even noticed or begun to appreciate the nature of this profound shift -- although many people in the rest of world certainly understand it , and judge us accordingly .
We have become the monsters , and we continue to insist that we represent the Good .
We attack a comparatively defenseless nation like Iraq , and proclaim we are battling Evil .
We murder a million people who never harmed us , and who never could have even had they wished to -- and our moral purity remains intact .
We prepare to attack another country that does not threaten us , and we maintain that we are only " defending " ourselves , and even " civilization " itself .
The horrifying consequences of an unprovoked U.S. attack on Iran should be painfully obvious to everyone ; over a year ago , I detailed those consequences at length .
Possibly millions dead , chaos and war that spread across the globe , severe economic dislocation and possibly economic collapse , the complete isolation of the United States from the community of nations , and still more and still worse -- possibly including the imposition of martial law in the U.S. itself .
The conclusion is stark and infinitely bleak : an attack on Iran would wipe every other issue and concern out of existence for the foreseeable future , probably for years to come if not much longer .
Forget debates about global warming ; nuclear clouds might be spreading across the globe .
Never mind reforming our health care system ; millions of people around the world , and possibly here at home , will be worried about survival of the most primitive kind .
will matter in the least .
Several days ago , I offered some harsh words about the lack of sustained protest to these developments on the part of those who say they are deeply opposed to the current administration .
The truth appears to be still worse .
In looking over some of the major liberal and progressive blogs last evening and this morning , I see that several of them have not eventhe Senate resolution from several days ago .
Are these bloggers truly so unintelligent that they fail to see the significance of this action ?
I do n't think so .
So what explains this silence ?
Is it simply that they refuse to criticize the Democrats on a matter of such grave significance ?
Is their tribal loyalty the value of greatest importance to them ?
In that severely critical post , I referred to the suggestions I offered almost half a year ago concerning a plan to build public resistance to an attack on Iran .
I have no proprietary feelings about those ideas whatsoever , and I have often said that others can probably think of additional and better ones , if they only put their minds to it .
I 've also emphasized that writers and bloggers with huge audiences have an opportunity to galvanize action on the part of many people in a way that I myself , as just one example , do not .
( My normal daily readership is well under a thousand unique visitors , in the absence of links from " big " bloggers . )
I had hoped my suggestions might spur thought and discussion on this topic , and that they might indirectly help to at least try to avert catastrophe .
Nothing remotely like that has occurred .
Perhaps people think that nothing they do at this point can alter what seems close to inevitable .
It may be that even large - scale , continuing public protest would change nothing -- butSince it has n't been tried , it is impossible to predict what the effects might be .
And permit me to offer a recent example , an instance where activism on the part of a large number of " ordinary " Americans did in fact change an outcome of some significance .
In terms of substance , I view the example as a profoundly unfortunate one , for it has to do with the defeat of the immigration bill .
I viewed that bill as a terrible one , but for reasons directly opposed to those offered by its loudest opponents -- for their opposition was obviously racist in nature .
Of course , they denied their objections were racist , but they all finally resorted to discussions of " demographics , " and what they viewed as terrifying changes in our " culture " and to " way of life . "
Such coded words fool no one , and this kind of viciously disapproving attitude toward immigrants has a long and awful history in the United States
But with regard to the following observations , I am not concerned withopponents of the immigration bill fought it so vehemently : I am focused only on the fact that they opposed it so strenuously , and that their opposition had the intended effect .
I 've mentioned that I listen to far too much talk radio , in part because I do n't have television .
I listened to a number of conservative talk radio shows during both recent periods when the immigration bill came up for consideration : Limbaugh , Hannity , Al Rantel here in Los Angeles , Mark Levin , and several others .
On both occasions , all of the shows talked about the immigration bill
They discussed what they viewed as its inevitable awful results , why it was " unAmerican , " how it would destroy our country , and included the other standard rightwing talking points on this subject .
And they all did something else : they told their listeners to call and email people in Congress , and to call and email various Republican organizations , including the Republican National Committee , and to take all these actions repeatedly .
They provided phone numbers and email addresses , and they indicated the general message that should be conveyed .
They did n't do this only once in one show : they did it throughout their shows , onshow , for over a week both times .
The message was unceasing and unrelenting .
It was repeated over and over and over .
You could n't listen to one of the major conservative talk shows without hearing it within five minutes of tuning in .
It went on One part of the message deserves particular note , and all of the shows I heard made the same point : they condemned those Republicans , including Bush , who supported the bill without mercy .
They told people to inform the RNC and all the appropriate Congressmen and Senators that they would receive , including financial support , unless the bill was defeated .
In their view , support of the bill was a betrayal of core conservative principles .
They therefore maintained that any such alleged " conservatives " did not deserve to be in office .
As one , they said that these betrayers of the conservative faith should not hold power any longer -- and that the principles they believed were imperiled were more important than the continuation in power by the Republican party .
As a result of all these shows hammering the identical theme without interruption , in every hour of every show on multiple shows for days at a time , Congress was inundated with calls and messages from deeply angry Republicans .
And here is the point to take home :
You can find many stories like this one I repeat that my concern here is not whether conservatives ' objections to the bill were valid ( they were n't ) , or whether they " distorted " the bill 's provisions ( sometimes they did , sometimes they did n't ) .
My point is the strategic one : they did n't want the bill passed , they mobilized massive , large - scale opposition , and I also listen to a number of liberal talk shows .
Over the last few years , I have never heard anything similar on the liberal shows .
Not about the Military Commissions Act ( see both " ' Thus the World Was Lost ' " and " America , Now Without the Revolution " ) , not about the Roberts , Alito or Gonzales nominations , not about ending the immoral and criminal occupation of Iraq -- and not about preventing an attack on Iran .
Not on any of these issues .
Nor have I ever seen a similar kind of effort on the liberal and progressive blogs .
Every once in a while , the liberal blogs will urge action on perhaps on a single day , maybe two -- and then the issue vanishes until some new development ( not brought about by the bloggers themselves ) might catapult it into public consciousness again .
Such tactics are sporadic , severely limited in time and scope , very infrequent , and completely ineffective .
I hesitate to say that the conservatives who worked so hard to defeat the immigration bill are " serious " about their ideas .
That word grants them a stature that is entirely undeserved , particularly since the reasons for their opposition are so viciously ignorant .
But I will acknowledge that theyabout their ideas and that they areto them , in a way that it appears liberals and progressives are not .
With the exception of Kucinich 's proposal to defund the Iraq catastrophe entirely , not one of the Democrats ' proposed plans for " redeployment " will end the occupation of Iraq : all of them allow for the presence of tens of thousands of American troops into the indefinite future .
Do the liberals and progressives have any serious , sustained objection to that ?
Apparently not .
But much more significantly : do the liberals and progressives seriously object to an attack on Iran ?
The Congressional Democrats obviously do n't .
Do the liberal writers and bloggers ?
To judge from their actions , it does n't appear they do either -- and certainly not when compared to the recent sustained assault mounted by conservatives .
I can only conclude that most liberals and progressives care only about maintaining and expanding their control and power , and that they are determined not to " rock the boat " too much before 2008 .
Never mind that the world may be entirely changed by that time , never mind that war may be spreading out of control and that our economy may be in free fall -- or that martial law may have been imposed .
If we should survive until the fall of 2008 without the worst happening , it will not be because of anything the liberals have done , for they will have done nothing if they continue their current pattern of behavior .
And if they win in 2008 , that will only be a repeat of 2006 : they will win because of the profound nausea and revulsion directed at the Republicans , andbecause of a positive alternative offered by the Democrats .
Certainly with regard to Iran , the Washington Democrats offeralternative : they repeat the Republican propaganda in its entirety .
On this matter , I would be pleased and even thrilled , far beyond my capacity to express it , to be proven wrong .
So go ahead , liberals and progressives : prove me wrong .
Please .
Prove me wrong today .
And tomorrow , and the next day .
Prove me wrong for the coming 18 months , and even beyond that .
Prove me wrong .
I beg you .

Having an index over Scheme source is no fun without a way to perform searches and present results in an human - friendly way .
This weekend I therefore wrote a little web - servlet , which takes a query , looks up the terms in the index , and returns links to documents containing all terms .
It did n't take many searches to realize that I need to spend some time on 1 ) ranking the results and 2 ) supporting both case sensitive and case insensitive queries .
In general ranking is difficult to get right , hopefully the narrow scope of indexing Scheme source only will help .
Managing Gigabytes explains ranking in details , and since I keep track of the term frequencies in the index , the ground work has been done .
Supporting both case sensitive and insensitive searches with the same index can be done with a little trick : after tokenizing all terms are converted to lower case before they are put in the index .
When a search is made the query is likewise converted to lower case before a search is made .
The returned document numbers can be used directly for a case insensitive search .
To avoid false matches for a case sensitive search , the actual documents are retrieved from a repository and a simple minded search for the query terms are made .
This approach makes sense when indexes are large and the repository is available .
My plan is put the index on a web - server without the repository , so instead I plan to make to indexes one for each type of search mode .
Fortunately the code written so far is prepared for different indexes .
In lieu of an online web - servlet to try , I offer a screen shot :

Computer maker Dell Inc will reduce more than four years ' worth of earnings by up to $ US150 million ( $ A183.52 million ) after an internal probe found the company misled its auditors and manipulated results to meet performance goals .
The struggling company said that its net income for the restatement period will be reduced by between $ US50 million and $ US150 million ( $ A61.17 million and $ A183.52 million ) , or two cents to seven cents a share .
The largest reductions in quarterly profits were expected to be in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and the second quarter of fiscal 2004 , each lowered between 10 per cent and 13 per cent .
When a small nonprofit called the Judicial Crisis Network poured millions into a campaign to stop the Senate from confirming Barack Obama ’s Supreme Court pick last year , and then spent millions more supporting President Donald Trump ’s choice for the same seat , political observers assumed conservatives from around the country were showering the group with donations .

Not so .
Newly obtained tax documents show that JCN ’s money came almost entirely from yet another secretive nonprofit , the Wellspring Committee , which flooded JCN with nearly $ 23.5 million in 2016 .
Most of Wellspring ’s funds , in turn , came from a single mysterious donor who gave the organization almost $ 28.5 million — nearly 90 percent of its $ 32.2 million in revenues .
Like JCN , Wellspring — at one time tied to the donor network spearheaded by conservative industrialists Charles and David Koch — is a nonprofit that is supposed to be dedicated to social welfare functions and does n’t have to disclose the names of its benefactors .
Since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision loosened certain constraints on political spending , these and other 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups have become increasingly politically active while providing anonymity to their donors .
Often one group , like Wellspring , will act as a conduit , giving most of its funds to other , similar groups with political agendas .
“ It sounds like Wellspring Committee acted as a dark money conduit to provide an extra layer of secrecy to whomever was bankrolling the Judicial Crisis Network ads , ” Brendan Fischer of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington said in an email interview .
“ This has the effect of layering secrecy on top of secrecy , and almost entirely insulating donors from any form of public accountability . ”
But , Fischer added , “ Even though the public does n’t know who is really behind the tens of millions spent , there is nothing stopping these secret donors from making their identities known to the beneficiaries of that spending . ”
Illinois Policy Action was another organization that benefited from Wellspring ’s grants in 2016 , receiving $ 2.5 million ; it ’s the lobbying arm of the Illinois Policy Institute , a conservative Chicago think tank in Chicago that has ties to the state ’s billionaire governor , Republican Bruce Rauner , according to the Chicago Tribune .
In 2016 , the institute released a documentary critical of Rauner ’s political opponent , Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan , a Democrat .
The American Future Fund , another former Koch “ dark money ” nonprofit , pulled in $ 2 million from Wellspring last year .
It spent more than $ 12.7 million in 2016 federal elections without disclosing its donors .
Early in the Republican presidential primaries , AFF appeared to be supporting Sen. Marco Rubio ( R - Fla . ) through attacks on his GOP opponents , Sen . Ted Cruz of Texas , Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Donald Trump .
When the group ran ads highlighting lawsuits against Trump University , the Republican frontrunner tweeted “ Phony Rubio commercial .
I could have settled , but wo n’t out of principle ! ”
Trump did eventually settle the lawsuit for $ 25 million after becoming president .
Wellspring also paid out $ 750,000 to a firm called BH Group LLC , not as a grant but for “ public relations ” services .
The corporation is nearly untraceable beyond an address for a “ virtual office ” in Arlington , Va .
A representative of the company that manages the space , Regus , said that the BH Group has no physical presence and that all its mail is forwarded to another address .
The representative would not provide a forwarding address or any names of individuals affiliated with BH Group “ for security reasons . ”
BH Group LLC ’s only other appearance in the public record ?
On the list of Trump inaugural donors :
It gave $ 1 million to help pay for the festivities .
Virginia incorporation records show the LLC was n’t formed until the end of August 2016 .
That means Wellspring ’s payment to it was made between then and the end of the year — right around when the Trump inaugural committee was doing the bulk of its fundraising .
As for the Judicial Crisis Network , when Trump ’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch was sworn in last April , the group ’s chief counsel was there , snapping pictures in the White House Rose Garden .
Ok , so you might have saved a few dollars by melting parts of your keyboard for that ergonomic feel , but would you really be better off using the monstrosity above ?

Rumsfeld ' has conflict , ' will not testify on Pat Tillman 's death Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday July 31 , 2007
Print This Email This Update :
This story has been updated to reflect comment from the Oversight Committee 's Republican staff .
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld will not testify at a hearing scheduled for Wednesday on the friendly fire death of Army Specialist Patrick Tillman , RAW STORY has learned .
The former Pentagon head ' has a conflict ' that will prevent him from appearing , but will not face a subpoena .
Tuesday afternoon , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a witness list for the Tillman hearing .
Rumsfeld , who was invited to testify by Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) on July 16 , was not present .
A member of the Committee 's Republican staff told RAW STORY that the White House had no role in the ex-Defense Secretary 's decision not to testify , and that he was not available due to ' a conflict . '
" The White House did not assert executive privilege , executive confidentiality or anything else , " said Brian McNicoll , Communications Director for the Oversight Committee 's Republican staff , in a Tuesday afternoon e-mail .
" In fact , it had no involvement in his response .
He sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member saying he had a conflict that couldnt be resolved . "
While Rumsfeld will not appear , he did answer questions from the committee .
Apparently , no subpoena will be necessary .
" We posed questions to his attorney , and his attorney got right back to us with answers , " McNicoll added .
" The committee has enough information to not force the issue for tomorrows hearing . "
RAW STORY did not receive comment from the Rep. Waxman 's staff .
The witnesses scheduled to testify are : * Gen. John P. Abizaid ( Retired ) , Former Commander , U.S. Central Command
* Gen. Richard B. Myers ( Retired ) , Former Chair , Joint Chiefs of Staff
* Gen. Bryan Douglas Brown ( Retired ) , Former Commander , U.S. Special Operations Command
* Lt. Gen. Philip R. Kensinger , Jr. ( Retired ) , Former Commander , U.S. Special Operations Command
Today , the Army censured the last for these four witnesses , Lt. Gen .
Kensinger , for what it described as a " perfect storm of mistakes , misjudgments and a failure of leadership , " according to the Associated Press .
Kensinger was also accused of ' deception . '
The hearing is set to focus on the sequence of events and what Department of Defense staff knew of Tillman 's 2004 death in Afghanistan , which was falsely reported as resulting from enemy forces .
Tillman 's death was a result of fratricide , or ' friendly fire . '
Tillman , a former NFL player , voluntarily enlisted in the Army with his brother after September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
In an exchange on July 13 before Rumsfeld was invited to testify , Rep. Waxman announced that White House Counsel Fred Fielding had refused to issue certain documents to the committee because of executive privilege .
Earlier in the day , the group VoteVets.org strongly criticized the White House for the assertion of privilege in the Tillman investigation .
" There is no Executive Privilege claim that holds any water when the matter is the death of an American soldier - especially one who had been used by the Administration as a poster for the war , " said Jon Soltz , an Iraq War veteran who heads the group , in a statement sent to RAW STORY .
" By refusing to release every pertinent document , the White House is fostering a climate of distrust among those in the military , hurting efforts to recruit new soldiers , insulting the memory of Pat Tillman , and causing undue pain to his family .
Unless the President has something to hide , he should release all the documents requested by Republicans and Democrats on the Committee . "
CSS2.2
The early pace of CSS development was pretty impressive .
First proposed by Hakon Lie in Oct 1994 , CSS1 became one of the first W3C recommendations in Dec 1996 .
Nipping at its heals , CSS2 became an official recommendation in May 1998 , just 18 months later .
By June 1999 the first 3 draft modules of CSS3 had been published , and in their ground breaking book published that same year , Bert Bos and Hakon Lie postulated that CSS3 would arrive sometime in late 1999 .
Over 7 years later , and we ’re still waiting .
This begs the question , what went wrong ?
For a recent conference , I decided to do a talk on CSS3 .
While researching all the cool CSS3 features modern browsers support , I became intrigued why things were taking so long .
I started reading up on the W3C , how it was structured , how you became a member and exactly who was on the CSS working group .
I started speaking to existing members and invited experts , reading blog posts from critics and people who had resigned , and looking at every bit of public information I could find .
Organisations pay thousands of dollars to join the W3C , and in return get to set the agenda on forthcoming technologies .
While most of the companies involved are eager to shape the future of the internet in a positive direction , they all have their own agendas .
Some obviously want to build better browsers , while others are worried about backwards compatibility and engineering problems .
Some organisations have a vested interest in technologies such as SVG , while others are more concerned with opening the web up to different platforms like mobile phones and TV .
By paying to be a member of the W3C , companies are able to get some of the brightest minds in the industry working on the issues important to their business , and who can blame them ?
CSS3 has been in development in it ’s current form since early 2000 .
There are currently 5 modules in “ Candidate Release ” status , and a further 6 are in “ Last Call ” status .
This sounds good , until you realise that the selectors module was in “ Candidate Release ” as far back as 2001 , and got rolled back to “ Last Call ” in 2005 .
Some of the current modules are set to be rolled back , while other modules like the “ Box Model ” module have n’t been touched since 2002 .
Of the 40 or so modules , only the TV profile and media queries modules are nearing completion .
Lucky us .
There are various reasons why this is taking so long .
Many of the issues are technical and ca n’t be avoided ; problems when testing , issues with backwards compatibility and bugs with browser implementation .
However there also seems to be a lot of politics involved .
Discussions are getting bogged down in the same old arguments that occur time and again , priorities have been given to the wrong areas , and companies have been pursuing their own personal agendas .
Despite being broken down into separate modules , the scope of CSS3 is vast .
As well as trying to look at the needs of the current web , the W3C are trying to anticipate the future .
One of the big issues is internationalisation , which brings up problems most of us have n’t even heard of before .
Tibetan style text justification anybody ?
Also with the project taking so long , the W3C are working in a constantly shifting environment .
What may have been true about the web back in 2000 , may not be true today , next year or in the next decade .
My fear is that the W3C has bitten off more than it can chew , and this is having a negative effect on the web .
We currently live in a world of live texture mapping and rag doll physics .
And yet as web developers , we do n’t even have the ability to create rounded corner boxes programmatically .
The W3C are so concerned with shaping the future , I ’m worried that they may have forgotten the present .
Forgotten the needs of the average web designer and developer .
I ’ve been thinking about this for a while , and wonder if we need an interim step .
If CSS3 is as big and complicated as the development timeline suggests , maybe we need something simpler ?
Something that gives us designers and developers the tools we need today , and not the tools we need in five or ten years .
Maybe we should take all of the immediately useful parts of CSS3 such as multiple background images , border radius and multi-column layout .
Maybe we should take all the CSS3 properties , value and selectors currently supported by the likes Safari , Opera and Firefox .
Maybe we should take all of this information and build a simpler , interim specification we can start using now .
Maybe , just maybe , it ’s time for CSS2.2 ?
Over to you .

Hanover , May 30 ( DPA ) Users of the Windows 98 operating system should soon permanently disconnect their machines from the Internet to guard against possible virus attacks .
' This reduces the risk that viruses will exploit security holes in the system , ' says Axel Vahldiek from the Hanover - based computer magazine ' c't ' .
Microsoft recently announced that July 11 will be the last day of support for Windows 98 and Windows Me .
No more new security updates will be offered from the company 's homepage after that date .
Computers being used for non-Internet related purposes are not threatened by this .
For other computers , however , users should consider buying a newer machine that can support a more modern operating system .
Old computers often fail to meet the minimum hardware requirements for newer operating systems .
There is no real alternative to the Microsoft support , Vahldiek feels .
' Microsoft has never released the source code for Windows 98 .
That 's why no other provider can fill the gap , ' he says .
The software maker has also declined to reveal its internal estimates on numbers of users .
' But not all that many people are still using Windows 98 , ' says Microsoft spokesperson Irene Nadler .
Most of the holdouts are companies that operate specific applications using the operating system .
Only a few private users have for whatever reason chosen not to move to the newer Windows XP .
A new Windows version called Vista is expected on the market next year .

The You ’re In Control system uses computation to enhance the act of urination .
Sensors in the back of a urinal detect the position of impact of a stream of urine , enabling the user to play interactive games on a screen mounted above the urinal .
While urination fulfills a basic bodily function , it is also an activity rich with social significance .
Along with the refreshing release it provides , the act of micturition satisfies a primal urge to mark our territory .
For women who visit the bathroom in groups and chat in neighboring stalls , urination can be a bonding ritual .
For men who write their names in the snow , extinguish cigarettes , or congregate around lampposts to urinate , urination can be a test of skill and a way of asserting their masculinity .
Flush the urinal to playYou 're a Nation , and drown political opposition as they campaign in key swing states .
Technology is patented .
What began as the pet project of a few enthusiastic users has grown into a corporate - backed initiative demonstrating Google Earth 's potential as a live - saving humanitarian tool .
The Crisis in Darfur project is a downloadable set of layers for Google Earth which combines high - resolution satellite images of Darfur with photographs and first - hand accounts of the genocide currently underway in the region .
Users of Google 's 3 - D world atlas can zoom in on burned - out Sudanese villages , read the stories of the victims and see stunning arial shots of massive refugee camps in Eastern Chad .
While the data in the Crisis in Darfur project was available before the project 's birth , it was spread out in a variety of formats and stored different places the web .
" There 's a tremendous amount of data out there , but most of it does n't interact very well , " says Declan Butler , a senior writer at Nature and one of the early volunteers in the The BrightEarth Project which developed the download package .
Butler worked with a team of volunteers to bring together disparate data from the U.S. State Department , Amnesty International and photographers and journalists working in the region , turning it into interactive layers for the free program .
" Google Earth allows you take data from lots of different sources and mix them together easily – anybody can make these files , " adds Butler .
" Google Earth is really like a browser and adding layers is like making a webpage . "
The initial concept was the brainchild of Michael Graham , now head of the Genocide Prevention Mapping Initiative at the U.S. Holocaust Museum .
Graham says his team had an " aha ! " moment when Google Earth was released in June 2005 .
He quickly saw the software 's potential to help humanitarian teams spread information about evolving crises more rapidly .
" Why should organizations like the U.N. or aid organizations have to spend days creating and disseminating individual maps whenever they want to contribute to the ' situational picture ' ? " asks Graham .
He cites the ability to quickly build new maps from layers of information as one of the program 's strongest features .
In creating the Crisis in Darfur project , Bright Earth and the Genocide Prevention Mapping Initiative hope to demonstrate the usefulness of Google Earth for use in non-profit aid work .
In fact , as more groups turn to the popular visual - mapping tool as a way to raise awareness of their causes , Google has decided to formalize their efforts into a new Google Earth Outreach program .
The company will use the program 's website , which launched Tuesday , to promote the layers created by non-profit and public - benefit groups .
Now , aid groups responding to crisis events in remote areas , such as the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan , are eyeing Google Earth as a potential life - saving tool .
" Satellite imagery and other remote sensing material has been used in relief efforts for a while now , " says Paul Currion , creator of Sahana , an open - source software tool used to manage large - scale relief efforts .
However , he says , the non-profit community " has n't yet realized the full potential of this technology . "
If mathematical brilliance generated electricity , there 'd be enough wattage at this restaurant table – a stone 's throw from the American Institute of Math – for a good 20 million homes .
The conversation flows from food to hobbies to , well , zeta functions .
But as dinner winds down , George Csordas , a distinguished - looking functions theorist from the University of Hawaii , confesses that he never balances his checkbook .
" I hate doing the math , " he says with a broad smile .
Victor Vinnikov from Israel 's Ben Gurion University jumps in .
" It 's restaurant checks for me , " he says .
" I can calculate the 15 percent tip , but adding it back in – forget it . "
These two are part of a group of 28 mathematicians who recently assembled to ponder some of the hardest math problems since Archimedes – part of a week - long workshop at the institute .
Now , before you flip away to read about something simpler – like , say , the Middle East – let me state up front just how much math you 'll need to understand for this article : zero .
Let me also state the most important number for this group of mathematicians : zero .
Finally , let me offer a definition of math from David Farmer , director of programming at the institute : Math is about making connections , especially where they are n't obvious .
In other words , it 's a dating service for numeric ideas .
These 28 experts play Cupid .
To do its work , the institute chooses some of the brightest mathematicians from disparate specialties and provides a focused but informal schedule packed with good food and libations , along with lots of small workspaces where no one is ever far from a whiteboard .
Week - long workshops focus on problems from braid groups to keeping graduate students devoted to math .
The institute 's executive director , Brian Conrey , jokes that the definition of an extroverted mathematician is one who looks at the other person 's shoes in a conversation .
But this is decidedly not the case with the 21 men and seven women who make up this week 's group .
Despite spending considerable mental time in places that would take half a book to explain , they laugh , chat , banter , and presumably mow their lawns much like everyone else , with nary a pocket protector in sight .
This particular group is puzzling a number of problems this week , the most famous of which is the Riemann Hypothesis .
It was posited in 1859 by Bernhard Riemann , a German mathematician who was smart in the same way that Einstein was something of an idea man .
Proving the hypothesis has become the math equivalent of hunting down the FBI 's most wanted .
The good news is that the hypothesis involves an equation that can be written in the space of a postage stamp .
The bad news is that it can take lifetimes to understand .
So let 's say this :
It involves a seemingly harmless set of numbers called prime – numbers divisible only by themselves and by 1 .
Where they occurred was unpredictable , until Riemann came up with his equation .
Mathematicians believe that zeros will be the key to proving the equation , which is why they are so ardently pursuing the great goose eggs .
Explaining it further would require that half a book .
But here 's something easy to grasp – whoever proves the hypothesis first will get a million - dollar reward .
Who says there 's no real - world benefit to pure math ?
The American Institute of Math was founded in 1994 by John Fry and Stephen Sorenson as a haven for pure math .
These Silicon Valley businessmen made their money through retail computer stores , namely Fry 's Electronics .
But before that , they were math majors in college , and before that , they were all - American kids , playing team sports on gridirons and diamonds .
In contrast to their childhood pastimes , math eschewed a team approach , favoring the lone - genius - in - the - closet phenomenon .
" Most of the other sciences have a high degree of collaboration , " said Sorenson .
" In math , working together was called cheating . "
Fry and Sorenson wanted to change all that .
So they bought a piece of land in nearby Morgan Hill and designed a $ 50 million crenelated castle with frescoes , fountains , and 12 marble lions , inspired by Spain 's Alhambra .
After 13 years of delays , approval processes , and environmental reports , the institute held a gala ground - breaking in May , replete with a Mediterranean menu and a decor full of dazzling Moorish geometric patterns .
In the meantime , they set up an interim shop in a plain , windowless space that was Fry 's Electronics ' first corporate headquarters and , in 1997 , hired Mr. Conrey as executive director .
Conrey is a fit man with looks and charm that invite comparisons to Tom Brokaw .
Unlike Mr. Brokaw , he is an analytic number theorist .
In nearly ten years , he has transformed the institute from an unknown , unfunded , vacant warehouse into a functional , comfortable setting that hums with math and has accrued support from donors including the National Science Foundation .
" We 've grown by factors of ten , " said Conrey , being typically numeric .
" We started with a $ 5,000 grant , and have built up to $ 5,000,000 . "
He has also built a program of five - year fellowships , awarded annually to " an absolutely first - rate PhD . "
And Conrey has put together a library of all the math papers he could lay his hands on – 100,000 and counting .
Most of all , he works with David Farmer to bring in the best brains on the planet for week - long sessions .
The idea is to foster group work and make connections – that math definition again – that will continue for months , years , or lifetimes .
Last March 19 , one of these groups announced that they had hit the math jackpot .
They 'd solved a problem with a mystical - sounding name , " the exceptional Lie group E8 . "
It took a platoon of 18 mathematicians four years – and two of those years were spent just realizing it could be solved .
The team also needed 77 hours of a supercomputer named Sage , which did much of the grunt work – namely , the 204 billion entries that form the result .
Writing it would require a piece of paper the size of Manhattan .
Even if the Riemann Hypothesis were the only focus of this week 's group of 28 , actual results would still take the mathematicians a great deal of time .
" One year after the workshop , we 'll e-mail them and that 's when we find out what they 've been up to " says Farmer .
Still , a half - dozen papers are likely to come out of this week of chasing zeros .
And one day , Riemann will fall .
Fear not , though :
The institute will soldier on .
" The Riemann Hypothesis is just the first of an enormous list of functions , " said Farmer , " all of which need proving . "
I was reading yesterday about a Pew study on attitudes towards genetically modified foods .
Americans are largely against this technology , with 46 % opposing its use compared to 27 % in favor .
The interesting part was that respondents are not well informed about the fact that they are already eating GMFs .
According to the press release , 26 % believe they have eaten GMFs and 60 % believe they have not .
However , according to this Los Angeles Times article about the report , genetically modified foods are widespread in the American diet .
" Today , 89 % of soybeans , 83 % of cotton and 61 % of corn " are genetically modified to resist pests or tolerate weedkillers .
Given that people are afraid of this technology , it ’s surprising that they are so wrong about how much they are being exposed to it .
I would speculate that people think that these foods are harmful , and the fact that they do n’t ever hear about anyone being harmed means that they assume that no one is being exposed to them .
If GMFs actually were harmful and were in widespread use , people would be aware of problems .
It ’s interesting that the absence of such reports is apparently taken to indicate low levels of use rather than a reduction in judgments of harmfulness .
This fits into the article I mentioned last week about inaccurate perceptions of risk .
Maybe our lives today are so safe that there ’s no real harm in misjudging risk .
It might be that other factors such as social signaling are more important .

Lambda , the Ultimate Label
Twobit is based on viewing lambda expressions as assembly language labels that have been augmented by a list of symbolic names for the registers that are live at that label .
The simplicity of this view results from allocating all non-local , non-global variables on the heap .
Aggressive lambda lifting makes this practical by eliminating all non-local variables except for those that would have to be allocated on the heap anyway .
The eliminated non-local variables become additional arguments to lambda expressions , which means they will be allocated in registers .
Most optimizations used in Twobit are well - known , but a few are new or unusual :

Translations
Brian Friel ’s play Translations , set in 19th - century Ireland , is about using languages to communicate and control .
As you might expect , the relation between Irish and English figures prominently in the play ’s plot .
It is only fitting that Oleg and I are writing this post in Dublin , at the European Summer School in Logic , Language and Information , because what we want to show you is a nice perspective we learned here last week that relates multiple ways to interpret natural and programming languages .
In honor of multilingualism , you can download this post as both a literate Haskell program and an OCaml program .
To make sense of this post , you only need to know either Haskell or OCaml .
{-# OPTIONS - fglasgow - exts - fno-monomorphism - restriction #-}
A programming - language researcher and a ( natural - language ) linguist both aim to relate form to meaning .
Usually , there are an infinite number of forms and meanings , so it is impossible to exhaust them in a brute - force list .
Instead , it is natural to assume a finite set of building blocks for expressions , then describe systematically the form and meaning of all expressions by specifying the form and meaning of each building block and how they compose .
Formally , we define an abstract data type of expressions : the constructors are the building blocks and the observers are a function from expressions to forms and a function from expressions to meanings .
Form ← Expression → Meaning
Linguistics often labels this picture as
Sound ← Syntax → Meaning
or as
Phenogrammatics ← Tectogrammatics → Semantics
whereas computer science usually labels this picture as
Concrete syntax ← Abstract syntax → Semantics
so the left arrow is a pretty printer ( whose inverse is a parser ) and the right arrow is an evaluator or compiler ( whose inverse is a decompiler ) .
Of course , we want to restrict ourselves to well - formed expressions only , using what some linguists call categories and most computer scientists call types .
We also want to restrict the two arrows to produce well - formed forms and well - formed meanings only .
In other words , the building blocks should preserve well - formedness .
One way to implement this picture formally is to represent an expression as a data structure , perhaps a tree of building blocks .
But then , to enforce well - formedness , it would seem that we need a family of tree types that call for advanced type - system features such as generalized algebraic data types or dependent types .
Instead , we will represent an expression as a program that invokes constructors of abstract data types .
The latter data types are abstract in that they may be either form or meaning .
In other words , we will represent an expression as a program that is parametrically polymorphic in types that are either form or meaning .
A linguistic example
In natural language , two fundamental types are e , for entities , and t , for propositions .
Our abstract syntax includes two entities john and mary , two quantifiers everyone and someone , and a transitive verb saw .
In Haskell , we define a type class that relates two types e and t .
We call this type class Symantics because its interface defines syntax and its instances define semantics .
class Symantics e t | e -> t , t -> e where john :: e mary :: e everyone :: ( e -> t ) -> t someone :: ( e -> t ) -> t saw :: e -> e -> t
In OCaml ( or more generally ML ) , we define a module signature Symantics that includes two types e and t .
For example , the function saw maps an object entity and a subject entity ( in that order ) to a proposition .
module type Symantics = sig type e type t val john : e val mary : e val everyone : ( e -> t ) -> t val someone : ( e -> t ) -> t val saw : e -> e -> t end ; ;
Without specifying either form or meaning , we can already construct expressions in the abstract .
In Haskell , an abstract expression has an overloaded type .
The following definitions each have the type Symantics e t => t because they denote propositions , not entities .
For example , test1 is the proposition that John saw Mary .
test1 = saw mary john test2 = someone ( \x -> everyone ( \y -> saw y x ) ) test3 = everyone ( \y -> someone ( \x -> saw y x ) )
Analogously in OCaml , an abstract expression is a functor that takes a Symantics module , say S , as input , and produces ( a module containing ) values whose types are defined in S .
The following functor produces values of type S.t because they denote propositions , not entities .
module TEST( S : Symantics ) = struct open S let test1 = saw mary john let test2 = someone ( fun x -> everyone ( fun y -> saw y x ) ) let test3 = everyone ( fun y -> someone ( fun x -> saw y x ) ) end ; ;
With these test cases in place , it is now time to implement Symantics concretely .
The two arrows in the pictures above amount to two implementations .
For simplicity , we take the meaning of a proposition to be whether it is true in a model with just two people , John and Mary , who saw each other but not themselves .
In Haskell , we provide an instance of the Symantics class .
data Thing = John | Mary instance Symantics Thing Bool where john =
John mary =
Mary everyone f = f John && f Mary someone f = f John || f Mary saw Mary John = True saw John Mary = True saw _ _ = False
We can then resolve the overloading in test1 , test2 , and test3 above to compute their meaning .
Indeed , test2 is false because no single person saw everyone — John did n’t see John , and Mary did n’t see Mary — but test3 is true because each person was seen by a ( different ) person .
> test1 :: Bool True > test2 :: Bool False > test3 :: Bool True
Meanwhile in OCaml , we provide a module for the Symantics signature .
module Truth = struct type e = John |
Mary type t = bool let john =
John let mary =
Mary let everyone f = f John && f Mary let someone f = f John || f Mary let saw obj subj = match subj , obj with John , Mary | Mary , John -> true | _ -> false end ; ;
We can then instantiate the TEST functor above by this Truth module .
module TT = TEST ( Truth ) ; ; let _ = TT.test1 ; ; (* true *) let _ = TT.test2 ; ; (* false *) let _ = TT.test3 ; ; (* true *)
In programming - language terms , an instance of the Symantics class in Haskell or a module for the Symantics signature in OCaml is an interpreter for the object language whose abstract syntax is defined by the class or signature .
In particular , the meaning arrow is an interpreter that evaluates an expression .
On the other hand , the form arrow is also an interpreter — one that prints ( or pronounces ) an expression .
We can define it as another Haskell instance
instance Symantics String String where john = " John " mary = " Mary " everyone f = f " everyone " someone f = f " someone " saw obj subj = subj ++ " saw " ++ obj
or another OCaml module
module Pheno = struct type e = string type t = string let john = " John " let mary = " Mary " let everyone f = f " everyone " let someone f = f " someone " let saw obj subj = subj ^ " saw " ^ obj end ; ;
and test it in Haskell
> test1 :: String " John saw Mary " > test2 :: String " someone saw everyone " > test3 :: String " someone saw everyone "
or in OCaml
module TP = TEST ( Pheno ) ; ; let _ = TP.test1 ; ; (* " John saw Mary " *) let _ = TP.test2 ; ; (* " someone saw everyone " *) let _ = TP.test3 ; ; (* " someone saw everyone " *)
to reveal the well - known scope ambiguity in the English sentence “ someone saw everyone ” .
To wit , test2 and test3 have the same form but we have already seen that they have different meanings .
In these definitions of someone and everyone , linguists will recognize quantifier lowering or quantifier raising , computer scientists will recognize continuation - passing style ( CPS ) , and hey , logicians might even recognize a representation theorem or two .
Exercise : extend the language to include sentences such as “ someone ’s mother saw everyone ’s father ” and “ Mary knows who John saw ” .
Much related work
There is a ton of work in both computer science and linguistics along these lines : to extend the language of abstract expressions , to refine the form and meaning arrows , to simplify the metalanguage in which the interpreters are implemented , to build more interpreters that perform additional processing such as logical deduction or partial evaluation , to compose interpreters , to optimize self - interpretation …
In our recent paper on tagless interpretation , Jacques Carette , Oleg Kiselyov and I tried to survey the most immediately related work , yet we completely missed the connection to natural languages and did not realize that pretty printing is another interpreter .
It was at a ESSLLI workshop on type - theoretic grammars , thanks to several talks about abstract categorial grammars ( ACGs ) , that we recognized this connection .
Our paper describes tagless partial evaluators and CPS transformations for a programming language .
These interpreters do not map function types to function types homomorphically ( whereas ACG arrows do ) .
A lobotomized version of this paper is accepted at APLAS 2007 ; the source code is online .
Finally , multiple interpretations are about to arise in the two ongoing series of posts on this blog .
In “ Word numbers ” , we will interpret a grammar using multiple instances of the Seminearring class .
class .
In “ From walking to zipping ” , we will interpret a walk using multiple instances of the Monad class .
Stay tuned .
Most mornings , as I drag my increasingly malfunctioning body out of bed , I glance out a window to catch sight of a poor soul nearing collapse on the jogging trail .
Losing weight is a horrible process – torture , actually .
And though wholesome living is n’t painless , nearly everyone understands what ’s involved .
Thus , with great curiosity , I turned my attention to the Metro Denver Health and Wellness Commission ’s brand - new plan to tackle our supposed obesity epidemic in Colorado .
Would they be tackling my carcass as I head into a Burger King for some tasty trans - fatty French fries , I wondered ?
Because , other than that , a gaggle of bureaucrats is n’t going to accomplish much on this front .
“ We ’ve all read that Colorado rates high on the ‘ healthy ’ scale , but our communities ’ waistlines are expanding at the same rate or faster as the rest of the nation – with 55 percent of metro
Denver adults overweight or obese , and one in three area children ages 2 to 14 at risk of becoming overweight , ” says Lt. Gov. Barbara O’Brien , who ’s spearheading this project .
Communities do n’t have waistlines , actually .
Individuals do .
And the truth is , almost every child is at risk of becoming overweight if their parents allow them to sit on a couch and play video games all day .
And the vast majority of parents know this – whether they do the right thing or not .
Nonetheless , O’Brien , well - meaning as she is , has absolutely no business telling us what to eat or how much to exercise .
Theresa
Donahue , executive director of the wellness commission , tells me , “ We ’re here to work on changing settings and offering organizational support .
We ’re here to make it easier for people to make healthy choices .
We ’re not here to blame people . ”
Why not blame people ?
Whose fault is it ?
Yours ?
And it is as easy to find an apple in a supermarket as the potato chip aisle .
( Or so I ’m told . )
“ To some extent they do know an apple is good for you , ” explains Donahue .
“ It may not be easy for them to find during the course of a day .
There are not that many options . ”
There are thousands of options .
Hundreds of thousands .
Even in a fast - food restaurant , a consumer can make more prudent choices .
And most Coloradans realize this .
In fact , the commission itself states that in metro Denver , nearly 70 percent of survey participants claimed they exercised every day or at least three times a week .
Now , nearly 30 percent of metro
Denver respondents indicated that people prefer “ less - healthful foods . ”
And that ’s because , almost always , less - healthful food tastes a whole lot better .
Duh .
In the end , the wellness commission has a noble goal .
The problem is that when citizens are slow to react , health zealots begin to concoct ways to coerce individuals to adapt a lifestyle they ’ve chosen for us .
Take , for instance , Colorado ’s Blue Ribbon Commission for Health Care Reform – which features many of the same players as the wellness commission .
Right now , this group is putting together a health care plan for Coloradans .
One of the plans moving forward includes a provision that states , “…
The most effective ways to modify health behavior consist of applying ‘ sin taxes . ” ‘
Of course , there is no credible proof that “ sin taxes ” – extra taxes on unhealthy foods , in this case – will modify behavior .
None .
Imagine , though , if a government commission was looking into ways to modify the types of things you said .
Or modify your reading habits .
Or , even , modify your sexual habits .
We would be outraged .
Worse , a “ sin tax ” on foods not only punishes the “ guilty . ”
If , for instance , you pick up a Twinkie after running a marathon , Colorado would try to “ modify ” your behavior .
( Orwell would be proud ) .
“ No .
We ’re not talking about mandates , ” says Donahue , of the wellness commission .

OSBF - Lua
Text classification module for the Lua Programming Language
and a production class anti-spam in Lua using the module # 1 in CEAS 2008 Spam Filter Live Challenge Winner of TREC's Spam Track 2006

Overview
OSBF - Lua ( Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams with confidence Factor ) is a Lua C module for text classification .
It is a port of the OSBF classifier implemented in the CRM114 project .
This implementation attempts to put focus on the classification task itself by using Lua as the scripting language , a powerful yet light - weight and fast language , which makes it easier to build and test more elaborated filters and training methods .
The OSBF algorithm is a typical Bayesian classifier but enhanced with two techniques that I originally developed for the CRM114 project : Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams - OSB , for feature extraction , and Exponential Differential Document Count - EDDC ( a.k.a Confidence Factor ) , for automatic feature selection .
Combined , these two techniques produce a highly accurate classifier .
OSBF was developed focused on two classes , SPAM and NON - SPAM , so the performance for more than two classes may not be the same .
spamfilter.lua is an anti-spam filter written in Lua using the OSBF - lua module .
It takes special advantage of EDDC to introduce TONE - HR , a highly effective training method .
The combination of OSB , EDDC and TONE - HR to enhance a classical Bayesian classifier resulted in the best spam filtering performance in TREC's Spam Track 2006 and in CEAS 2008 Live Challenge .
The Confidence Factor was officially introduced in the paper " Exponential Differential Document Count - A Feature Selection Factor for Improving Bayesian Filters Accuracy " , presented in the MIT Spam Conference - 2006 , after being in experimental use for more than a year in both projects : CRM114 and OSBF - Lua .
The conference slides are also available .
The OSB technique was officially announced in the paper " Combining Winnow with Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams for Incremental Spam Filtering " , a work headed and presented by Christian Siefkes in the 8th European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases ( PKDD ) , on September 2004 .
The CRM114 implementation of OSBF was one of the classifiers submitted to the TREC's Spam Track 2005 by the CRM114 team , but its first results were not good because of a bug .
Later , the bug was fixed and the OSBF - Lua version was submitted to the track coordinator , prof .
Gordon Cormack , for an extra evaluation .
The new results were comparable to those of the best participants , with the advantage of being 5 to 10 times faster .
Our notebook paper comments on the results of the four filters submitted by the CRM114 team : OSBF , Winnow , OSB Unique and OSB .
OSBF - Lua is free software and is released under the GPL version 2 .

Installation
OSBF - Lua requires Lua 5.1 installed with dynamic loading enabled .
OSBF - Lua was developed and tested under the Lua 5.1 work , alpha , beta and final 5.1 versions .
It probably wo n't work with previous versions .
Installation steps :
Install Lua with dynamic loading enabled :
For linux , execute " make linux " and " make install " .
For other OS , read the instructions in the INSTALL file and your OS documentation on how to create shared libs .
You might want to change the occurrences of the O2 flag in CFLAGS to O3 , in all makefiles , for increased speed .
Install the OSBF - Lua module : $ tar xvzf osbf-lua-x.y.z.tar.gz $ cd osbf - lua -x.y.z edit the " config " file to suit to your platform - not necessary for Linux - or to change the default installation PREFIX dir ( /usr / local ) .
$ make make install
If you want to install in the default dir you must be root to do the " make install " step .
If you do n't have root access , you may set PREFIX to point to a dir you have write access to , for instance $ HOME / lib .
You need to add the new installation dir to LUA_CPATH so that Lua loader can find osbf.so .
Ex : Installing in $ HOME / lib
< edit config and set PREFIX to $ HOME / lib >
$ mkdir $ HOME / lib
$ make install
$ export LUA_CPATH=$LUA_CPATH :$HOME/lib/?.so
After osbf module is properly installed , you may want to install the spamfilter , a Lua script that uses the OSBF - Lua module to classify and tag messages as spam or non-spam ( ham ) according to the score they get , or to the white / blacklists , if any :
make install_spamfilter
The spamfilter files are installed in / usr / local / osbf - lua .
If the dir does n't exist it 'll be created
The next step is to configure your email account to use the spamfilter :
do the following steps under your account , not as root
create your local osbf-lua dir : mkdir $ HOME / osbf-lua
create your log and cache dirs : mkdir $ HOME / osbf - lua / log mkdir $ HOME / osbf- lua / cache
Note :
Old messages in the cache dir should be deleted regularly , typically from a cron job , to preserve disk space .
Check Christian Siefkes ' trainfilter for his clean - up script .
copy the spamfilter config file to your dir : cp /usr/local/osbf-lua/spamfilter_config.lua
$ HOME / osbf-lua
edit spamfilter_config.lua to set your password
change the current dir to your osbf-lua dir and create the spamfilter databases ( spam.cfc and nonspam.cfc ) cd $ HOME / osbf- lua lua /usr/ local /osbf-lua/create_databases.lua # change ' / usr / local ' to your PREFIX
add the following lines to your .
procmailrc
# set OSBF_LUA_DIR to where spamfilter.lua , spamfilter_command.lua etc were installed
OSBF_LUA_DIR=/usr/local /osbf-lua # change ' / usr /local ' to your PREFIX
OSBF_LUA_USER_DIR=$HOME/osbf-lua
# let the Lua interpreter find the " osbf " module .
# uncomment if you installed a local copy of the osbf module ( e.g. no root access )
#LUA_CPATH=$HOME/lib/?.so : $ LUA_CPATH
:0fw : .msgid.lock
* < 350000 # do n't check messages greater than 350000 bytes
| $ OSBF_LUA_DIR/spamfilter.lua --udir $ OSBF_LUA_USER_DIR
OBS : The " osbf - lua " dir and all files and dirs under it must be writable by the user or group that procmail runs under .
Check your installation by sending a message to yourself with the following command in the subject line :
help < your password >
You should receive a message with a help on the spamfilter .
Then , send another command in the subject line to verify that the databases were created correctly :
stats < your password >
You should get a statistics report on the just created databases .
From now on , all messages you receive with less than max size specified in the procmail recipe will be classified and tagged according to the score they get :
Tag Meaning [--] almost sure it's a spam - score <= - 20 [ -] probably it 's a spam ( reinforcement zone ) - score < 0 and > - 20 [+ ] probably it 's not spam ( reinforcement zone ) - score >=0 and < 20 [++]
almost sure it's not spam - score >= 20 .
This tag is here just for symmetry , it 's not used .
An empty tag is used in place of it so as not to pollute the messages .
If the classification is wrong you must train the filter replying ( you must do a " Reply " , not a " Forward " ) the message back to yourself , replacing the subject with the correspondent training command :
learn < password > spam
or
learn < password > nonspam
The body of the message may be erased , it 's not required .
The original message , temporarily saved on the server by the spamfilter , will be recovered through the SFID ( Spam Filter ID ) , a special mark added to the header when the message arrived to the server .
If you make a mistake , you should undo the training with the command " unlearn " .
Ex :
unlearn < password > spam
if wrongly trained as spam .
Training when the classification is wrong is essential for accuracy .
Training when in the reinforcement zone , called reinforcement , is highly recommended for increasing and keeping the accuracy high .
After you have a well trained filter , say 99 % or better accuracy , you may want to reduce the reinforcement zone , eg. [ - 10 , 10 ] , so as not to do many reinforcements a day .
You may change the reinforcement zone , tags , etc , by editing the file spamfilter_config.lua .
As of version 2.0.2 , there 's a new feedback mechanism , based on an HTML form report sent to the user , which completely removes the nuisance of sending training commands in the subject line for each message .
The training report shows a table with the messages in the cache dir with scores between - 20 and +20 , containing Date , From , Subject and a list of actions , for each message , up to 50 messages per report .
The user selects the proper action for each message and click on the " Send Actions " button to generate a pre-formatted training message , ready to be sent .
The training report can be sent to the users on scheduled times , from a cron job .
After 10 learnings on each class , the training report suggests the proper training action for each message , based on its score , and colors each line of the table in red when the suggested action is " Train as Spam " , or in blue for " Train as Non-spam " .
This makes the training process even easier , because most of the time the user does n't have to do nothing more than just click the " Send Actions " button , for well trained databases .
See the script cache_report.lua for details .

A new study of more than 1,000 women found that those with migraine headaches scored better on a word recall test than those without migraines over an extended period .
It may be that a causal factor for migraines leads to more intense brain activity and less reduction in performance .
Anecdotally , those with bouts of migraines tend to be highly intelligent - some people who have suffered from them include Virginia Woolf , Catherine the Great , Emily Dickinson , Sigmund Freud , Frederic Chopin , George Bernard Shaw , Charles Darwin , Tolstoy , Joan Didion , and the mathematician John Nash .
In ancient times , Alexander the Great reputedly experienced migraines ( Plutarch ) .
Migraines have been found in other studies to be associated with menstrual periods .
Researchers say medications for migraine , diet and behavior changes may play a role in helping women with migraines protect their memory .
The findings are being published in the April 24 , 2007 , issue of Neurology ( abstract ) , the scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
For the community based study , 1,448 women , of which 204 had migraine , underwent a series of cognitive tests beginning in 1993 and again approximately 12 years later .
The study found while women with migraine performed worse on cognitive tests , such as word recall , at the beginning of the study , their performance declined 17 percent less over time than women without migraine .
In other words , the migraine group outperformed the control group .
In the group with migraines those over age 50 showed the least amount of cognitive decline on a test used to assess cognitive functioning .
" Some medications for migraine headaches , such as ibuprofen , which may have a protective effect on memory , may be partially responsible for our findings , but it 's unlikely to explain this association given we adjusted for this possibility in our study and the medications showed no indication of a significant protective effect , " said study author Amanda Kalaydjian , PhD , MS , of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , MD .
Dr. Kalaydjian says another factor that needs to be explored is the possibility that women with migraines may change their diet or behavior in some way that might improve cognition .
" For example , alternative treatment for migraine includes adequate sleep , as well as behavioral and relaxation techniques , and a reduction in caffeine , " said Dr. Kalaydjian .
" Despite these theories , it seems more likely that there may be some underlying biological mechanism , such as changes in blood vessels or underlying differences in brain activity , which results in decreased cognitive decline over time , " said Dr. Kalaydjian .
" More research is needed to fully understand how migraine affects cognition . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Electric announced early Monday it would sell its plastics business to Saudi Basic Industries Corp. in an $ 11.6 billion deal .
GE ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) has been shopping the unit for some time , and the price and buyer were not a surprise , having earlier appeared in published reports .
" This sale is the right move at the right time for GE share owners , " said GE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt .
" We received a good price from a respected global company in a highly competitive bidding process .
We will use the proceeds to fund the stock buyback and strengthen the company through restructuring . "
GE said its net proceeds from the sale would be about $ 9 billion .
It said the profits from the sale will allow it to increase its share repurchase plans to between $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , up from the $ 6 billion it had previously announced plans to repurchase .
Shares of Dow component GE were up 15 cents , or 0.4 percent , to $ 37.10 at the open of trading Monday following the pre-market announcement .
Shares gained 43 cents , or 1.2 percent in trading Friday after reports that the sale was close .
The price topped earlier estimates of a sales price $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion made by analysts surveyed by Reuters .
" I 'm glad they got it done , and I 'm glad they got more than people were maybe expecting , " Peter Klein , senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management , a Cleveland - based company that manages about $ 20 billion and holds GE shares , told wire service Reuters .
The plastics business has been hurt by the high price of oil , a basic raw material used in the business .
GE reported that benzene , a petrochemical used to make plastics , is 32 percent more expensive than a year ago .
The company reported a 46 percent decline in segment profits in the first quarter to $ 121 million , despite only a 3 percent fall in revenue to $ 1.5 billion .
Plastics saw the biggest percentage decline in profits for any segment at GE , a diversified conglomerate whose businesses included everything from consumer appliances and light bulbs to jet engines and electric turbines , as well as media unit NBC Universal and a large finance arm .
GE competitors include Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV ( Charts ) , Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd ( Charts ) and Siemens AG ( Charts ) .

This newspaper argued on behalf of its seriousness in the 1990s , during the Clinton perjury controversy , and today is no different .
We 'd have hoped that more conservatives would agree .
The integrity of the judicial process depends on fact - finding and truth - telling .
A jury found Libby guilty of not only perjury but also obstruction justice and lying to a grand jury .
It handed down a very supportable verdict .
This is true regardless of the trumped - up investigation and political witch hunt .
It is true regardless of the unjustifiably harsh sentence .
Had Mr. Bush reduced Libby 's sentence to 15 months , we might have been able to support the decision .
Alas , he did not .
Bush has received criticism from a few surprising corners , including Fred Hiatt and FoxNews / LieberDem Lanny Davis , who has a somewhat tortured post at The Hill 's blog arguing that Bush is a flip - flopper on the pardon issue .
So he 's lost Fred Hiatt , the Moonie Times , and Davis .
Who is supporting Bush 's decision ?
The wingnuts , neocons , the Beltway gasbags , and those Republican candidates who feel they must cater to the winguts , neocons , Beltway gasbags and various and sundry dead - enders .
That would be the people who for the war in Iraq , who want to go to the war with Iran , and who support the surge .
Kudos to Lanny for breaking away from the neocon orbit on this one .

Related : In Austria , It 's Pronounced ' Fooking '
The local authorities are hitting back with the signs now set in concrete .
British tourists have left the residents of one charming Austrian village effing and blinding by constantly stealing the signs for their oddly named village .
While British visitors are finding it hilarious , the residents of Fucking are failing to see the funny side .
Only one kind of criminal stalks the sleepy 32 - house village near Salzburg on the German border - cheeky British tourists armed with a sense of humor and a screwdriver .
But the local authorities are hitting back with the signs now set in concrete , police chief Kommandant Schmidtberger is on the lookout .
" We will not stand for the Fucking signs being removed , " the officer said .
" It may be very amusing for you British , but Fucking is simply Fucking to us .
What is this big Fucking joke ?
It is puerile . "
Local tourist guide Andreas Behmueller said it was only the British that had a fixation with Fucking .
" The Germans all want to see the Mozart house in Salzburg , " he explained .
" Every American seems to care only about ' The Sound of Music ' ( the 1965 film shot around Salzburg . )
The occasional Japanese wants to see Hilter 's birthplace in Braunau . "
" But for the British , it 's all about Fucking . "
Guesthouse manager Augustina Lindelbauer described the village 's breathtaking lakes , forests and vistas .
" Yet still there is this obsession with Fucking , " she said .
" Just this morning I had to tell an English lady that there were no Fucking postcards . "
We do n't know how severe the stolen sign problem there really is , but Austria is indeed home to a town called ' Fucking ' ( 48 ' 03 " N 13 ' 51 " E ) .
Pronounced " fooking , " the little hamlet of Fucking is named after the man who founded the village in the 6th century .
His name ?
Focko .
This sign carries the hilarity even further : " Bitte - nicht so schnell ! " is German for " Please - not so fast ! " ( Snopes.com )

You were only allowed one egg and three rashers of bacon a week - but Britons were never healthier than when we lived on wartime rations .
So what happened when one modern family gave it a try ?
We all know we 're eating too much but the statistics make grim reading .
Today , almost a quarter of all adults in the UK are obese .
Even more horrifying , a quarter of all British toddlers are already overweight .
Our diet contains too much fat , sugar and salt - and it's putting us at greater risk of diabetes , heart disease , cancer , stroke and even Alzheimer's .
The search is on for healthy and workable solutions .
Scientists are busy working on a whole host of " fat " drugs - only last week , Italian researchers announced they 'd developed a pill that expands in the stomach to make dieters feel full .
Scroll down for more
A more drastic option is major surgery - every year , thousands of Britons undergo gastric banding to reduce their stomach size so they can't overeat .
There 's also myriad weight - busting diets , but as health experts debate the best solution , there could be one old trick they 're missing : wartime food rationing .
While this was ostensibly introduced to share out limited resources , there was a secret agenda behind the weekly food allowances : to attack " dietetic ignorance " among the population and so improve the nation 's health .
It worked .
Britons ate better than they ever had before or , some experts claim , since .
As a result of the balanced diet provided by rationing , children 's health improved and on average they were taller and heavier than before the war .
The incidence of anaemia and tooth decay dropped - while the average age at which people died from natural causes increased , despite the stresses and strains of war .
The principles behind rationing sound surprisingly similar to today 's health messages : reduced consumption of meat , fats and sugar and more of the sort of foods , such as vegetables , which provide essential vitamins and minerals .
Meals were bulked out with healthy oats , pulses and bread - brown bread became the norm .
So would a wartime diet help us today ?
The greatest benefit would be the cut in calories .
Under rationing , men were allowed 3,000 calories a day - slightly higher than 2,500 recommended today .
But the reality is most of us consume as much as 3,100 calories .
As Dr Toni Steer , a nutritionist with the Medical Research Council , explains : " Whatever people consume today , it is too much .
The reason so many of us are overweight is because we eat too much and exercise too little .
" I suspect many people would find that even after a few weeks on rationing they 'd lose weight , even if they did n't increase their activity levels . "
A war - time regiment would also help reduce your risk of heart disease , Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure , as well as cancers such as post - menopausal breast cancer , kidney and colon cancer .
Under rationing , people ate very little meat .
" On average in the UK we eat 40 - 50 per cent more protein than we actually need , " says Dr Steer .
Eating less meat would reduce the risk of heart disease , and possibly bowel cancer .
When it comes to fat , although we eat only a fraction more than people consumed during the war , far more of our fat is saturated .
But perhaps the biggest change in swopping to a wartime regimen would be the reduction in sugar .
Under rationing , every adult was allowed 8 oz ( 230g ) a week - on average we have twice that now .
Just one bowl of a typical breakfast cereal , a serving of baked beans with lunch and a Jaffa Cake would take you over your World War II sugar ration without so much as a sprinkling of white stuff .
As well as affecting dental health , excess sugar consumption has been linked to weight gain , diabetes and by some experts even to cancer .
During the war they even drank their tea more healthily .
Research has shown that three cups of tea a day can cut the risk of heart attack by 11 per cent and stave off some forms of cancer .
But you get greater benefit from its healthgiving properties if you let leaves steep for five minutes in a pot rather than giving a tea bag a quick dunk in a mug .
Of course , the wartime diet was not perfect .
Rationing pre-dated our knowledge of the health benefits of unsaturated fats ( the fact that olive oil and vegetable margarines can actively boost the levels of " good " cholesterol ) .
It would be better to have a slug of olive oil than the weekly wartime 2 oz of lard .
And when it comes to fruit and vegetables , the wartime diet lacked the variety experts say we need to get essential vitamins and minerals .
But if the wartime diet was healthier than what most of us eat today , is it actually practical ?
And would it be enough to sustain the frenetic pace of our modern lifestyle ?
We asked a family of six to live on rations for ten days .
Here is their verdict .
DEE BROOKER , 38 , a housewife , husband Colin , 45 , a civil servant , and their four children ( Felicity , eight , Oliver , seven , Emily , four , and Ben , two ) live in Oxfordshire .
Dee says :
The first shock was the weekly shop .
My supermarket trolley is normally groaning with breakfast cereal , pizzas , pasta and snacks ( including eight or nine packets of biscuits ) but it now contained porridge oats , cornflakes , wholemeal bread , milk and rather grubby - looking root vegetables .
I 'd had to clear out the food cupboards and was rather ashamed of the piles of crisps , cereal bars , biscuits and chocolate .
But I was also worried about how on earth we were going to manage - like many parents , we use food treats as bribes and I do n't have an alternative parenting strategy .
And although the rations cost less than half my normal shop , I was n't sure an entire family would survive for a week on so little .
Breakfast was the first hurdle - this is usually Coco Pops or chocolate chip brioche rolls , and I was n't sure the kids would even try anything else .
But they did eat the porridge .
A typical lunch is sandwiches ( chocolate spread for the children , ham or cheese for the adults ) , crisps , cheese strings , yoghurts - the older children have school dinners .
The wartime version was corned beef sandwiches ( wholemeal bread ) plus an apple for Colin ; jam sandwiches and slice of homemade cake with sliced apple for the children .
I think dinner was the most difficult .
We usually have something like readymade enchiladas with beef mince , followed by cheesecake or biscuits .
One of our first wartime dinners was vegetable terrine , ham with mashed swede ; wholemeal bread and butter ; roly poly pudding ; homemade biscuits .
The first thing I noticed was how little food we were wasting .
Because we all snack throughout the day , no one is hungry at meal times , and I frequently throw good food in the bin .
But because supplies were limited , I had to serve smaller portions , and the kids were rationed to one homemade biscuit after school .
Every time I placed a meal on the table they 'd stare at it in horror , then hunger would get the better of them .
I told them this was it , if they did n't eat it there was nothing else ( which was true ) , and they all at least tried everything I made .
We had surprisingly few complaints ( although I know they did miss
But Colin and I thought the food was lovely .
And as we were filling up on vegetables at every meal - a lot more than we would eat normally - we were n't hungry between meals and did n't feel the urge to snack .
After nearly ten days I 'd lost 2lb and was back to a size 10 , and Colin was thrilled to have lost 5 lb and half an inch off his waist .
Emily and Ben appeared slimmer - a good thing as they were looking rather chubby .
The others were on school dinners which is probably why there was no difference in their weight .
Colin and I also had more energy , and our digestive systems seemed to benefit - we 've both become wonderfully regular in our trips to the loo .
But I think the real transformation was in the children : they slept better , had more energy and were n't as " hyper " ; there was markedly less fighting and whingeing .
And Oliver was transformed - he normally spends a lot of time slumped in front of the TV and is quite lethargic , but he 's been extremely active , careering around like a madman , which is totally out of character .
The only blip was when he once resolutely refused to eat any more porridge and then would n't come to the table to join us for spam fritters at lunchtime .
I finally managed to win him round with some plain air - popped popcorn , and he joined us for the evening meal ( fish pie with parsnips ) .
Now that we 've gone back to our old food , the tantrums and general irritability levels have started to rise .
They have returned to the old " I want " whingeing , which is probably my fault for having treats like chocolate biscuits in the kitchen again .
But I am determined not to let so much sugar and additives creep into our diet .
I guess the real downside of wartime rationing was the preparation time .
Meals normally take me about 30 minutes and while I really enjoyed cooking from scratch and the fact that I could see exactly how much salt , sugar and fat we were eating , it all took so long .
One day I spent five hours chopping and preparing food and I was tied to that cooker for two to three hours most days .
It 's a real shame that so much convenience food has to be unhealthy and that the only way to get really good food is to spend a lot of time preparing it .
Nutritionist 's verdict
Dr Steer says : Wartime rations seem to have boosted the family 's vegetable and fibre intake .
This will have improved the efficiency of their digestive systems and made them feel less lethargic .
Sticking to this diet longer term would help their cardiovascular health .
The switch from grazing on highlyrefined , sugary , salty snacks to eating three main meals a day would also have improved their energy levels .
Unrefined foods result in a slower release of energy into the blood , which avoids the energy peaks and troughs associated with eating sugary , refined foods .
But I 'm not sure the wartime diet provides the variety and choice that makes eating an enjoyable , pleasurable experience .
The modern diet presents huge opportunities for variety , and research is increasingly showing that a varied diet provides the best balance of nutrients we need to be healthy .
We just need to eat a little less .
As a blogger and a former software developer , I must frequently deal with copyright issues .
For most of my adult life , intellectual property has been my primary source of livelihood and remains so to this day .
While some people take issue with the concept of intellectual property and believe that all content should be free , I do n’t count myself among them .
In fact , for the most part I consider the anti-copyright fanatics rather juvenile and intellectually immature .
Too often their utopian language is merely a hollow shell around the desire to get something for nothing .
Overall I happen to think that modern copyright law is extremely fair , balanced , and wise .
I think it ’s perfectly reasonable for the creator of an original work to retain control over his / her creation while at the same time providing the means for others to benefit from that work , to reference it , and to discuss and debate it without undue restrictions .
Creating an original work can take considerable effort , and even though the digital age has stretched some copyright analogies beyond their useful life , I believe the basic premise that creators are entitled to manage their own creations is still sound .
I ’m speaking strictly about copyrights here — trademarks and patents are separate issues and are beyond the scope of this article .
Ideas vs. Expression
Mere ideas are not copyrightable .
What ’s copyrightable are the unique , tangible expressions of those ideas in forms such as articles , books , or podcasts .
You ’re always free to write about the same ideas someone else does , but you must express those ideas in your own unique way .
For example , if you created a site that simply rephrased the same content from another site paragraph by paragraph or translated it into another language , in my opinion that would be a pretty cut - and - dried case of an unauthorized derivative work , and therefore illegal if done without the copyright holder ’s permission .
Fair Use
New bloggers are often confused about what they ’re legally allowed to do with someone else ’s content in terms of republishing it on their own blogs .
The doctrine of “ fair use ” gives you the legal right to reprint portions of someone else ’s copyrighted material for the purpose of commentary or parody .
The permitted size of this portion is n’t precisely defined , but a good rule of thumb ( and fairly standard blogging practice ) is that it ’s acceptable to quote a paragraph or two from a larger piece .
Fair use , however , does not give anyone the right to republish a substantial portion of someone else ’s original work without the permission of the copyright holder .
It makes no difference whether you provide proper attribution and / or a link to the original version .
The practice is still illegal .
For example , unless I grant you permission to do so , you could n’t legally repost an article from StevePavlina.com on your own site — whether or not you provide proper attribution and a link is irrelevant from a legal standpoint .
This is a common mistake made by first - time bloggers … and it often backfires when their ignorance causes them to build a reputation as a content thief , alienating other bloggers who might have otherwise been helpful allies .
So as a practical matter , if you want to share someone else ’s content with your own audience , just quote a brief excerpt , and provide proper attribution with a link to the source , but do n’t republish the entire article without permission .
It will save you a lot of trouble down the road .
This is a fairly standard practice on popular blogs .
Keep in mind that even lists and other compilations are copyrightable , so if a blogger posts nothing but a list of links to other sites , that list is still likely protected by copyright .
This is something of a gray area though , so it depends on the nature of the list .
A few links may not qualify as an original compilation , but a lengthy and unique list that provides added value probably would .
The intent of fair use is to allow people to share ideas and comment on copyrighted works in ways that most people would consider natural and reasonable .
It would be really lame to read an article and not be able to quote it , reference it , or discuss it .
So that sort of behavior is perfectly legal , as well it should be .
Fair use has limits , most of which are common sense .
Unrestricted republishing of another author ’s work is not permitted , unless of course that author explicitly allows such sharing .
And again , it makes no difference whether or not you provide proper attribution .
Republishing and distributing copies of Harry Potter without permission and then claiming it ’s OK because you properly credited the work to J.K.
Rowling just does n’t fly , even if you give the books away for free .
Whether you agree or disagree with the doctrine of fair use on a personal or practical level is a separate topic from the legal issues .
As a practical matter though , violating copyright law , especially if you do it repeatedly , entails some risk .
All it takes is a few minutes for the copyright holder to fire off a DMCA template to your web host .
While some web hosts are gracious enough to give the website owner a chance to remedy the situation , many will react by taking the site offline and / or canceling the hosting account , since such behavior almost invariably violates the host ’s Terms of Service .
Since lawbreaking customers are n’t often deemed worthy of retention , hosts can be rather harsh in dealing with them .
Commercial use
Although generating a profit from someone else ’s copyrighted material has legal ramifications , from a practical standpoint of dealing with infringement in the world of blogging , it makes little difference whether or not someone generates a profit by violating an author ’s copyright .
A profit motive can make a big difference if things wind up in court and the author sues for damages , but that ’s rare .
In most cases it would be rather stupid for the copyright holder to retain a lawyer and sue the copyright thief .
No blogger in their right mind would want to do that except as a last resort for an egregious violation .
Instead there are much faster and easier ways to tackle copyright thieves .
For example , in a few minutes you can email a DMCA notice to the person ’s web host .
If you ever find a copyright thief generating income from your content , a few emails to their income providers will usually get their accounts banned and their funds seized .
For example , if you see someone using Adsense to monetize your stolen content , you can report it to Google to get the thief banned from Adsense and their existing funds seized .
I sort of wonder what Google does with the money that ’s been seized though — they certainly do n’t give it to the original copyright holder .
Do they refund it to the advertisers , donate it to charity , or just keep it ?
What about the money already paid out ?
In any event you ’ll have to decide whether you want to go that route .
I only recommend going after income sources when infringement is clearly deliberate and the person does n’t respond to a direct request .
In most cases all you need to do to remedy a copyright violation is to expose the copyright thief to such a degree that they realize it ’s in their best interest to go legal .
As a practical matter , you must intelligently weigh the importance of enforcing your copyright vs. the effort involved and the possible repercussions of doing so .
Often when I see a small violation and it ’s clear that it ’s done out of ignorance more than anything else , I ’ll simply ignore it , or I ’ll send the person an informal email with a request to remove the content and / or replace it with a brief excerpt and a link .
Some bloggers are even grateful for the pointers , since it ’s usually the people who are just starting out that mistakenly repost copyrighted material .
I ’m not particularly concerned with newbies who do n’t know any better ; the bigger issue is dealing with the deliberate wrongdoers .
Handling copyright violations
Some blogs employ strict enforcement of their copyright , not allowing republishing of their content anywhere .
Others are happy to let anyone repost their content freely .
Most bloggers seem to fall somewhere in the middle , wanting to retain ownership of their content while still encouraging sharing under certain conditions , such as those provided in a Creative Commons license .
On the one hand , I want to encourage people to openly share ideas from this site .
It ’s perfectly reasonable for someone to share an article they find worthwhile .
After all , this type of behavior is precisely what built up StevePavlina.com ’s traffic .
It ’s totally win-win .
This pattern is to be encouraged .
On the other hand , there ’s the dark side of content sharing , something I know to be an issue for many popular blogs .
Sploggers illegally republish other people ’s original content via practices such as feed scraping ( i.e. using a blog ’s RSS feed to automatically republish all new posts from that blog ) .
Material from other blogs is republished en masse for the purpose of spamming search engines and generating ad clicks .
Sometimes these splogs include ads for adult web sites and other potentially objectionable material … not the sort of thing many bloggers would want associated with their content .
It ’s been said the practice of splogging may even hurt bloggers ’ search engine rankings by making their duplicated content appear less unique to search engines ( and therefore less worthy of a high ranking ) .
While SEO experts have n’t seemed to reach a consensus on this issue , splogging can cause a variety of other problems as well .
For example , if images are republished ( which usually happens by default ) , a splog will steal bandwidth from the original blog .
Dealing with sploggers has become fairly routine for many bloggers I know .
Normally it just requires firing off a DMCA notice to their web host , which will often get the site taken offline within a few days .
Contact info for a site ’s web host is easy to find — I use Complete Whois to perform these lookups .
DMCA templates are easy to find online as well ( you can find one on Wikipedia here ) .
And then you can also contact the splogger ’s income providers ( Adsense abuse is the most common ) .
So in practice dealing with a splogger normally only takes a few minutes .
Even so , it can be a bit of a hassle .
In addition to sploggers , there are a variety of other ways people abuse copyrighted content .
Once someone informed me about an off - the - shelf self - help book that included unauthorized reprints of two of my articles — he recognized the content as being written by me .
This was clearly deliberate , as the author copied several pages of original material from me verbatim .
Then he slightly modified details of my personal stories in an attempt to pass them off as his own .
I contacted the publisher directly , who was naturally shocked and dismayed at this author ’s behavior , and we arranged a fair settlement .
I ’ve often been surprised at the lengths people will go to avoid the process of original content creation .
It reminds me of a favorite quote by Bertrand Russell :
Many people would sooner die than think ; in fact , they do so .
Crafting a fair policy for content sharing
Among the most common questions I receive are requests to republish and / or translate content from StevePavlina.com .
These include requests from other bloggers , authors , newsletter publishers , and trainers .
All StevePavlina.com articles are copyrighted by default , so legally anyone who wants to reproduce them must request ( and be granted ) permission first .
Coming up with a reasonable policy for handling reprint requests is n’t easy because such requests can be made for many different reasons .
Most requests come from other bloggers , but there are also requests from authors writing books , newsletter publishers , and even corporate trainers who want to use articles in their training programs .
I ’ve always been fairly generous in allowing people to reproduce articles if they request permission in advance , as long as they do n’t overdo it .
Translating a blog into other languages
Making my content more accessible by translating it into other languages is , in principle , an awesome idea , and I ’m all for it .
I get frequent requests from people overseas who want to create a non-English version of StevePavlina.com , such as in Spanish , German , Russian , Japanese , and other languages .
Many offer to split the revenue with me .
I ’ve already addressed this topic in the FAQ , but the short answer is no .
In my opinion , granting site - wide localization rights to people I ’ve never met just because they ’re eager to do it just is n’t the right direction for me .
Just to intelligently evaluate the suitability of a potential partner would take considerable time .
Machine translation still has a way to go to be practical , and if I ’m going to use human translators , I ’d like there to be a reasonable degree of quality control , consistency , and centralization of multilingual content .
For now I ’m happy to offer free permission to translate up to 5 articles , but I ’m not in a position to authorize anyone to clone the whole site in another language and to promote it using my name .
Recently someone decided to go ahead and do this without permission , translating and reposting a significant number of my articles on their own site .
Within hours of firing off the standard DMCA notice , their web host took the site offline for violating the Terms of Service .
I do n’t like having to do this , especially when it seems the person ’s intent is generally positive , but I think it ’s kinder to do it sooner rather than later .
I have to weigh a lot of variables in considering the best localization strategy , my primary concern being what is the best way to serve the greater good .
I ’ve given this a lot of thought , and I genuinely believe that in this case , people will best be served by a localization strategy that is well - planned , well - implemented , centralized , of consistently high quality , and intelligently maintained , even if they have to wait a bit longer for this to get going .
While getting something up and running immediately may be better in the short run , I ’m taking a long time perspective here , thinking a few decades ahead .
Consequently , I ’m willing to accept a bit of flak for my decision now , confident that this is the right long - term decision .
In terms of the ready - fire - aim approach , in my opinion localizing this site falls squarely in the aim category .
Once hundreds of articles have been translated into a variety of languages , it will be difficult to alter course mid-stream , and early mistakes can produce major headaches down the road .
This is a situation where I believe careful planning trumps hasty action .
I ’m grateful for the existence of copyright law , since it gives me the legal right to control how and when my content gets localized into other languages .
While some people may feel stifled by my current decisions in this area , this is one area where I ’m unwilling to settle for a half - assed approach .
Without undue vanity or ego , I can safely say that such an undertaking is likely to impact millions of lives down the road , and that ’s a responsibility I take very seriously .
Few other projects on my plate offer as much long - term leverage for ongoing contribution as this one does .
Copyright redux
Granting creators legal control over their creations is , in so many ways , a truly elegant and beautiful mechanism .
Having control over a valuable body of work can be an awesome responsibility , one that in my opinion most people are not equipped to handle .
While you may consider it common sense that a creator should retain control over his / her own work , what if that creator is totally irresponsible ?
In my opinion the hidden elegance of the current solution is that we can reasonably assume that someone who has the genius to create a work of real value probably has the sense to manage that work intelligently .
While there are plenty of exceptions , on balance I think this is a fair solution .
Where trouble often arises is when the copyright holder behaves irresponsibly .
This often happens when control over a copyrighted work is wielded by someone other than the original creator , such as when a record company controls the work of a singer .
There are people who will rampantly pirate music produced by major record labels with nary a twinge of guilt , but they have mixed feelings about pirating the work of independent artists who control their own work .
This is an area where I too must intellectually parts ways with modern copyright law .
I ’m not a big fan of treating copyright as intellectual property that can be transferred to someone other than the original creator .
I definitely need to give this more thought , but my gut feeling is that it would be best for at least the derivative rights to a copyrighted work to automatically fall into the public domain upon the death of the creator , even if the creator wills otherwise .
For example , on balance I think that this would have been a better thing for Star Trek after the death of Gene Roddenberry .
While it ’s reasonable for Paramount to retain control of the specific episodes they own ( and paid for ) , I think the world , the characters , and all derivative rights would be better off in the public domain .
But overall I still think copyright law is extremely reasonable .
If a creator wants their work to fall into the public domain upon their death , they can arrange to make it so .
I think that as human beings , we intuitively want to see our collective creative work intelligently cared for in a manner that serves the greater good .
How would you like your own creative work to be managed after your death ?
Would your primary concern be that your successors exploit it for maximum financial gain ?
Or would you be more concerned with seeing others benefit from the legacy you left behind ?
Would you prefer to see all evidence of your existence dissolve into obscurity , or would you want to see ongoing ripples of your contribution long after your earthly departure ?
Every once in a while , we have no choice but to write “ dangerous ” code .
The type of code that , when used improperly , can wreak all sorts of havoc on the system .
Purging audit trail records , fast - swapping statuses , or , like in today ’s example , code that toggles an object ’s " IsUpdated " property regardless of whether that object has been updated .
It ’s a good idea to protect such code , perhaps using access specifiers like “ private ” or “ internal ” or even runtime - enforced security like the System .
Security .
CodeAccessPermission namespace .
Or , one could go the route of Riaan Hanekom 's predecessor and use some sort of … password protection ?
/// < summary > ///
Overrides the IsUpdated value .
Used to set the value to false /// after properties have been populated by the constructor .
/// </summary > /// < param name = " Password " > ///

Chris Matthews weighs in : ' Elizabeth Edwards won this round ' over Coulter David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This Following Elizabeth Edwards ' live televised phone confrontation with conservative columnist Ann Coulter on MSNBC , in which she asked Coulter to stop making personal attacks on her husband , Hardball host Chris Matthews appeared on the Today Show to give his thoughts .
" Ann Coulter 's one of those people who believes that Iraq attacked us on 9/11 ... she also believes that we found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , so there 's always going to be people off to the right or to the left that very different opinions than the rest of us , " said Matthews .
" She obviously believes that she can take these shots at the Edwards family and that 's part of the political discourse . "
" I think a lot of relatively boring guys like to go around carrying her books , to be honest with you , " he continued , saying that Coulter is a " brilliant writer " who " knows how to enrage . "
" Unfortunately , you 're dealing with a real life situation with Ann Edwards ' [ sic ] medical challenges , which we all know about , and the fact that they did lose their son , Wade , and you do n't make jokes about those things in polite society , " he said .
When asked if the Edwards camp should respond , Matthews replied , " My hunch is , that in human terms , Elizabeth Edwards has won this round . "
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on June 27 .
AUGUST 10 -- A Washington man 's karaoke performance of a Coldplay song apparently triggered a female bar patron to attack him early yesterday at a Seattle bar .
According to a Seattle Police Department report , a copy of which you 'll find here , Lindsey Lawrence , 21 , assaulted the unnamed victim while he was performing with " two other subjects " at Changes Tavern , where patrons sing karaoke Wednesday and Thursday night from 9 PM until 1 AM .
When the assault victim launched into Coldplay 's " Yellow , " Lawrence allegedly told the man that his " singing sucked " and that the song " fucking sucked . "
She then grabbed at the man 's microphone and " pushed him and punched him in order to get him to stop singing , " cops reported .
When employees escorted Lawrence from the bar , she " became very violent " and struck several other people ( and was hostile towards police and fire department medics who responded to the scene ) .
Lawrence was booked into the Seattle Correctional Facility , where she is currently being held on an investigation of assault rap .
It is unclear why Coldplay 's music apparently made Lawrence snap , though a famous June 2005 New York Times appraisal by Jon Pareles may offer an insight .
The critic called the British group " the most insufferable band of the decade , " adding that , " the lyrics can make me wish I did n't understand English . " ( 3 pages )
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) have once again expanded the services provided under Medicare .
New coverage of ultrasound monitoring of cardiac output today , new treatments for congestive heart failure yesterday , and , undoubtedly , some new cancer treatment tomorrow .
New technology might even help reduce Medicare costs , though past history argues against that rosy result for most improvements .
Getting more usually means paying more .
Astronomer Michael Brown of the University of California at Berkeley has more bad news for Pluto .
Everyone ’s favorite former planet , it turns out , is not even the heftiest dwarf .
That distinction now belongs to Eris ( formerly Xena ) .
Brown ’s discovery of Eris in 2003 kicked off the what - is - a - planet - anyway fracas last year at the annual meeting of the International Astronomical Union , which reclassified Pluto as a “ dwarf planet . ”
While most astronomers suspected that Eris was bigger than Pluto , no one was sure .
Brown ’s previous observations suggested that Eris was about 5 percent larger than Pluto , but “ the uncertainty was 4 percent , awfully close to being the same size , ” he says .
It was very plausible that if Eris were made of just barely lighter material , it would weigh a little less . ”
Now , using the method pioneered by Sir Isaac Newton when he determined the mass of Jupiter , Brown and his colleagues have determined that Eris , a far - flung rocky mass with a wildly eccentric orbit , is 27 percent more massive than Pluto .
“ Eris is my baby , ” says Brown .
“ It was like having a child .
I feel almost protective , and it ’s hard not to keep meddling with it . ”
To zero in on the mass , Brown and his colleagues looked at the interaction of Eris with its moon , Dysnomia , through the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope .
They used models detailing the gravitational pull between the two objects to deduce that Eris weighs in at 16.6 billion trillion kilograms , making it the most massive dwarf planet known .
That still wo n’t land it in the sought - after planet category , but all is not lost , says Brown .
Both Pluto and Eris move through space in the Kuiper belt , a collection of rocky objects just beyond Neptune ’s orbit .
While it is unlikely that astronomers will continue to find larger objects in the belt , Brown says that the region outside the belt , in the coldest hinterland of the solar system , could very well hold planet - size rocks .
“ Beyond Neptune ’s orbit is the solar system ’s next frontier , ” says Bob Millis , head of Arizona ’s Lowell Observatory .
“ There are really interesting objects out there that remain to be discovered . ”
If astronomers do find a big enough body , the debates over the word “ planet ” could reignite .
“ I suspect that if we find something bigger than Mercury in the region out there , then all this will start all over again , ” Brown says .
“ The astronomers will sit around and argue endlessly ; first they ’ll say that this is n’t important and then proceed to tell you for three hours why they ’re right . ”
Olbermann : Bush Now A President Of A Rabid Corner Of The GOP Posted by Pile ( 6377 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
In the wake of Bush 's commutation of Scooter Libby 's sentence for perjury , Keith Olbermann has a special comment on the depths to which Bush 's white house have now sunk ...
See the video where this MSNBC anchor makes a very convincing case for demanding the resignation of Bush and Cheney .
" I do n't believe my role is to replace the verdict of a jury with my own , " - George W. Bush on why he signed death warrants for 152 inmates as governor of Texas .
The quote is from his own book , " A Charge To Keep . "
" I think that 's a debate - ender , is n't it ? " says Andrew Sullivan .

While in Seattle for a recent business trip , I spent two nights sampling the local cuisine .
I enjoyed each meal immensely , however one clearly stood apart from the other .
But why ?
Article Continues Below
Reflecting on the meals , I saw a great deal of parity : each dish was attractive and stylishly plated ; each venue offered a friendly , cozy atmosphere ; each menu offered a wide assortment of choices , all of which were reasonably priced ; each had charming wait staff .
So what made the experience of the second restaurant so much better than the first ?
As with most things in life , it ’s the little things that matter most .
Take a water glass for example .
A careless server might let it dip quite low or , worse yet , go dry before coming by to refill it .
One who cares about your experience will make sure the meniscus never passes the halfway mark .
And the best servers will leave you surprised to find the glass you just drank from is filled to the brim yet again .
There ’s a lot we , as designers of the web experience , can learn from something as simple as a water glass .
Who is the customer ?
#section2
As a waiter , you know people come to your table with certain needs and possibly even a few expectations .
In most restaurants , the water glass is the first “ touch point ” or point of contact with the customer .
A good first impression is made by filling it quickly , but that ’s just the beginning .
Some people drink more quickly than others and will require more refills .
Some will not drink until they ’ve gotten their food .
Others may never touch their water at all , perhaps requesting iced tea or some other beverage .
When it comes right down to it , you really have no idea what type of person is sitting at your table .
And when it becomes a table of four , six , or even ten , it pays to be prepared .
The web is much the same .
We make beautiful websites that ( hopefully ) make a great first impression , but we need to make sure every touch point keeps the promise made in those first crucial seconds or we squander the small amount of goodwill we were in the process of gaining .
This type of thinking birthed the concept of progressive enhancement .
On the web , we do n’t know anything about the person coming to our website .
We do n’t know what browser she is using .
We do n’t know if she is hitting our site from her cell phone .
We do n’t know if she prefers using her keyboard over her mouse .
We do n’t know if JavaScript ( or even CSS ) is enabled in the device she is using .
We do n’t know if she wants to print the page .
We do n’t know if she is using a screen reader .
We really do n’t know anything .
So what do you do when you do n’t know anything ?
Anticipate .
As web developers , we need to be able to meet our users ’ needs .
And if we ’re really sharp , we can do it without them even realizing it .
Like pouring cold water in a customer ’s lap #section3
Lala.com is a website built around a community of folks who love music .
Its system facilitates the swapping of CDs through the mail within that community .
Figure 1 - 1. Lala homepage .
I hesitate to call their website ( Figure 1 - 1 ) attractive , but it is usable …unless you have JavaScript turned off ( Figure 1 - 2 ) .
Figure 1 - 2. Lala sans JavaScript , circa July 2006 .
You gotta love the fact that there ’s a “ loading ” message even though nothing ’s loading .
Now granted , that screenshot was taken a bit ago , but in the intervening months since I first began hoisting them as an example of what not to do , all they ’ve managed to cobble together is a message ( Figure 1 - 3 ) reminiscent of those heady days amidst the browser wars .
Figure 1 - 3 . Lala brings back fond memories .
The problem here is not that Lala is using JavaScript , but that they are requiring it .
The reason ?
Well , they apparently like the idea of loading all of the content into their pages using Ajax .
In their rush to cram all that Web 2.0 stuff under the hood , they ’ve alienated a good portion of Web 1.0 users and a sizable chunk of the mobile market .
And they ’re not alone .
Consider this : you ’re a Lala user and you ’re browsing around a record shop and stumble upon the new Arcade Fire album .
You did n’t realize it had come out and you want to add it to your Lala wishlist before you forget .
If your phone ’s browser does n’t support JavaScript ( or you keep it turned off to reduce your download time / usage fees ) , you ’re gonna be staring at a screen with good information about what Lala is ( Figure 1 - 4 ) , followed by that message saying you need JavaScript to use the site .
Figure 1 - 4 . Lala a - no - go .
You ’ve got no access to your wish list or anything else on the site .
Even the search box ( way at the bottom of the page ) fails to function .
For a closed application or service , this might be acceptable , but for a public website it ’s a disaster .
Think before you pour#section4
We ’ve already established that as web developers , we ’re generally flying blind when it comes to our users ’ needs .
The best we can do is anticipate what their needs may be and meet those needs at every level , trying to give them the best experience possible .
This is where progressive enhancement comes in — we need to think about possible levels of need and how to deliver on each of them .
Level 1 : No frills #section5
Some users just want the content .
They might be surfing on a mobile device , looking to print out some information , or using some sort of assistive device to browse the web — they may even be browsing with images off .
Keeping your markup clean , well - ordered , and semantic is key for this user .
They want to consume light , fast - downloading pages without distraction .
Level 2 : Make it pretty #section6
Some users like a little window dressing ( or a slice of lemon ) .
For them , you can provide a nicely designed and well layed - out website .
You could even add a few visual flourishes or a bit of Flash and they will be happy .
As long as your design does n’t confuse the visual hierarchy of the page , you ’ve been diligent in your browser testing , and you ’ve provided some basic styles for alternate media , you should be golden .
Level 3 : Make it sing #section7
Other users may want the full monty .
For them you can pull out all the stops and create a marvelous Web 2 .
Oh - my experience replete with yellow fades , sliding widgets , and Ajax galore .
Keep in mind , however , that levels are n’t always that clearly demarcated .
You may need to support an intermediate step between levels one and two , giving Netscape 4.x and IE5 / Mac some basic typographic styles and colors .
Or you may want to consider offering JavaScript enhancements to browsers as they can handle them , injecting a creamy nougat between levels two and three .
Moving unnoticed #section8
Once you ’ve decided on the rough levels of support , you can go about constructing your site .
Start with the content .
Sometimes designers and developers forget that this is why people come to your site to begin with .
Craft it lovingly and serve it to your users with a minimum of distraction , like a well - plated dish ; do n’t just heap it all together like it ’s a buffet .
You worked hard on your content … celebrate it .
Once you ’ve got your content in order , you can begin to establish the look and feel of your site .
Using the various techniques at your disposal , style your site in a way that reaches your users at their level ; hide certain CSS files from older browsers and deliver browser - specific styles to those that need a bit more attention .
Conditional comments have been a real boon in this area , but dig out old favorites like @import and specific media combinations , which can allow you to selectively offer some flavor to the folks in older / problematic browsers .
Be sure to consider the presentation of your content in print and on mobile devices .
Do you give them layouts or just some basic typographic and color treatments ?
How do you handle images ?
Forms ?
Try to anticipate which features a mobile user would want and streamline the experience for them by removing the cruft .
And if you use style : hover on a link , do n’t forget to give equal consideration to : focus , keyboard and mobile users will thank you for it .
Once the design is pulled together , add some sparkle with a bit of clever JavaScript .
You already know to use object and method detection to determine if a script can run in a user ’s browser , but consider how your scripts may interfere with common browser interactions like bookmarking or using the Back button .
And do n’t forget about script interdependencies either .
Will your site become unusable if one script can run and another can’t ?
If you ’re creating a widget or other interface control , generate the additional markup you need once you ’ve determined that the widget can run and everything else is in order .
And if you separate your widget - related CSS from your JavaScript like a good little standardista , make sure the styles are not active until the script has indicated that the widget can be used .
A good way to do that is to engage in class - swapping ( see Table 1 ) .
Table 1 . Class - swapping examples Widget At Rest Activated Tab Interface .tabbed .tabbed -on Auto - submitting Form .auto-submit .auto-submit.active
Finally , if you plan on using Ajax , use it wisely .
There is no need to suck in all of a page ’s content via little Ajax calls ; it just ends up being yet another roadblock between the user and your content .
On top of that , it can lead to <!-- parked domain MAR2013 --> increased overhead on your server <!-- --> , makes your content invisible to search engines , and can render your site <!-- commented out because site was n't loading MAR2013 --> unusable to someone requiring a screen reader <!-- --> and most people on mobile devices .
Do n’t get me wrong , Ajax has its place , but it ’s important to know where that place is and even more important to know where it is n’t .
Collect a big tip#section9
Carefully anticipating your users ’ needs and addressing them in as stealthy a manner as possible is key to leaving a good impression .
As with the water glass , your users should never have to wave you over to be served .
If you pay your income taxes next Monday , April 16 , it will have been 160 days since you last voted on November 7 , 2006 ( see the graph above ) , and it will be 204 days until you vote again on November 6 , 2007 .
The day we pay taxes in April is about as far away from the day we vote for politicians as possible .
It 's been more than 5 months since the last voting day , and more than six months before the next election , and November is probably the time of the year that we are least likely to be thinking about April 15 and taxes .
Suggestions :
1 . Let 's abolish withholding taxes , and require all taxpayers to write a check once a year for their entire tax liability , like taxpayers did from 1913 to WWII ( or make monthly or quarterly tax payments ) .
For someone with $ 100,000 of adjusted gross income that would mean writing a check to the IRS of about $ 17,400 , and probably another $ 3,000 or so to the state treasury , depending on the state you live in .
This would not only relieve companies and organizations of the costly burden of tax collection for the government , but would significantly increase our " tax awareness . "
Here is an exercise about your tax awareness :
What is your monthly car or cell phone payment ?
What is your monthly mortgage or rent payment ?
Most people know these amounts immediately , because most of us write a check for those expenses .
Now , what is your monthly tax liability for federal income taxes , and what is the amount of state income taxes you pay monthly ?
Most of us have no idea what our tax liabilities are , because we do n't write monthly checks for federal and state taxes , employers withhold those taxes and make payments on our behalf .
2 . Next we should move Voting Day and Tax Day much closer together , like the same week or same month .
We could move Voting Day to mid-April right after we pay taxes , or we could move Tax Day to early November right before we vote .
Having greater tax awareness and voting closer to the day we pay taxes might influence our voting behavior ?
MORE ROVE …. Josh Green ’s fortuitously timed Karl Rove profile in this month ’s Atlantic contains this mysterious anecdote :
Hurricane Katrina clearly changed the public perception of Bush ’s presidency .
Less examined is the role Rove played in the defining moment of the administration ’s response : when Air Force One flew over Louisiana and Bush gazed down from on high at the wreckage without ordering his plane down .
Bush advisers Matthew Dowd and Dan Bartlett wanted the president on the ground immediately , one Bush official told me , but were overruled by Rove for reasons that are still unclear : “ Karl did not want the plane to land in Louisiana . ”
Rove ’s political acumen seemed to be deserting him altogether .
I suspect the answer here is that Rove never truly had a lot of political acumen .
He had campaign acumen .
He was good at winning elections , but not at much else .
Green also relates a story from Dick Armey , who was not a big fan of Rove’s .
It ’s really more of a George Bush story than a Karl Rove story , but here it is anyway :
“ For all the years he was president , ” Armey told me , “ Bill Clinton and I had a little thing we ’d do where every time I went to the White House , I would take the little name tag they give you and pass it to the president , who , without saying a word , would sign and date it .
Bill Clinton and I did n’t like each other .
He said I was his least - favorite member of Congress .
But he knew that when I left his office , the first schoolkid I came across would be given that card , and some kid who had come to Washington with his mama would go home with the president ’s autograph .
I think Clinton thought it was a nice thing to do for some kid , and he was happy to do it . ”
Armey said that when he went to his first meeting in the White House with President Bush , he explained the tradition with Clinton and asked the president if he would care to continue it .
“ Bush refused to sign the card .
Rove , who was sitting across the table , said , ‘ It would probably wind up on eBay , ' ” Armey continued .
“ Do I give a damn ?
No .
But can you imagine refusing a simple request like that with an insult ?
It ’s stupid .
From the point of view of your own self - interest , it ’s stupid .
I was from Texas , and I was the majority leader .
If my expectations of civility and collegiality were disappointed , what do you think it was like for the rest of the congressmen they dealt with ?
The Bush White House was tone - deaf to the normal courtesies of the office . ”
Quite a team , no ?
Overview
Recent advances in information technology are causing us to rethink many institutions that shape relationships in our everyday life .
One important area where information technology can have a profound impact are the institutions that promote trust and cooperation among economic agents .
The emergence of online communities has enabled the creation of low cost reputation networks of global reach .
Online reputation mechanisms have emerged as a viable alternative to the more established institutions for building trust ( such as formal contracts ) in electronic environments where such contractual guarantees cannot be efficiently enforced .
On eBay , for instance , an online feedback mechanism that encourages buyers and sellers to rate one another seems to have succeeded in encouraging cooperative behavior in an otherwise very risky trading environment .
The potential applications of online reputation mechanisms go beyond the relatively narrow domain of trust building in electronic marketplaces .
The appeal of reputation mechanisms is that , when they work , they facilitate cooperation without the need for costly enforcement institutions .
They have , therefore , the potential of providing more economically efficient outcomes in a wide range of moral hazard settings where societies currently rely on the threat of litigation in order to induce cooperation .
The rising importance of online reputation systems not only invites , but also necessitates rigorous research on their functioning and consequences .
How do such mechanisms affect the behavior of participants in the communities where they are introduced ?
Do they induce socially beneficial outcomes ?
To what extent can their operators and participants manipulate them ?
How can communities protect themselves from such potential abuse ?
What mechanism designs work best in what settings ?
Under what circumstances can these mechanisms become viable substitutes ( or complements ) of more established institutions , such as contracts , legal guarantees and professional reviews ?
This is just a small subset of questions that motivate my work in this area .

As crude oil prices surge on rising political tensions with Iran , a new government report released Thursday said that the U.S. is unprepared to face an oil supply crisis and urged U.S. policymakers to develop a strategy in order to reduce potential risks related to an oil shock .
The report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that the U.S. has no plans in place to address " peak oil , " the future point in history of maximum oil production , which would be followed by irreversible declines in oil fields around the world .
" While the consequences of a peak would be felt globally , the United States , as the largest consumer of oil and one of the nations most heavily dependent on oil for transportation , may be particularly vulnerable , " the GAO report said .
An expert told CNBC on Thursday that peak oil is the " the single biggest issue to threaten sustainable society " in the United States .
" We are on the verge of actually replacing global warming by this term peak oil , " said Matthew Simmons , author of Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Oil Shock and the World Economy .
" We have demand roaring ahead and supply is faltering . "
Most studies predict oil production will peak sometime between now and 2040 , the agency said .
" We 're basically held hostage by countries that are n't friendly to us in terms of what 's available , " John Kilduff , senior vice president of energy risk management at Fimat USA , told CNBC .
" That is so dangerous to the United States economy you can't believe it .
We have big problems on our hands . "
Laura Bush held an early family party for him on Wednesday , to which a few professional golfers were also invited , and on Thursday the president made a rare outing to watch a baseball game .
But these few birthday celebrations apart , it has been a relentless week for the US president .
A backlash against his decision on Monday to commute the jail sentence of the former White House aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby was followed on Thursday by the withdrawal of support for his Iraq strategy by Pete Domenici , a Republican senator for 35 years .
The loss of such a loyal senator is ominous for Mr Bush 's war plans .
More defections are expected , and Mr Bush cuts a lonely figure , holed up in the White House fretting over his legacy .
Professor Robert Dallek , author of several books about the presidency , said that while it was not unusual for a president to limp to the end of his term as a lame duck , he saw Mr Bush as a particularly pronounced case .
" If you are looking at defeat , no one wants to be associated with the person responsible .
This is the case with Bush .
You do not see his party rally round .
He has united opinion against him and it makes for a lonely , isolated position , " Prof Dallek said .
" Once a president loses trust , he cannot govern effectively . "
Although he has 18 months left in office , Mr Bush 's options are limited .
Last week , he lost his last chance for snatching a lasting domestic legacy when his immigration reform bill was destroyed in Congress .
On foreign policy , there is little optimism of a late breakthrough on Israel - Palestine , Iran or Iraq .
The Washington Post reported this week on academics invited to the White House to discuss with him his legacy , including Sir Alistair Horne , author of a history of the Algerian revolt , which has parallels with Iraq .
They , as well as former staffers and friends , spoke of his loneliness , his agonising over how history will portray him .
Michael Conaway , a still loyal senator and long - time friend , said the president appeared to be worn down by the pressure and spoke of " a marked difference in his physical appearance " .
Although never a social animal , he is reluctant to drop into Washington restaurants unannounced for dinner , as the Clintons did , in part because he is fearful of the public response .
This week , in particular , because of the Libby decision , he has largely avoided public contact - his July 4 speech in West Virginia was invitation - only .
The White House presented the Libby decision as a non-political compromise .
A well - connected source in Washington challenged the consensus that Mr Bush 's poll ratings , at just under 30 % , could not fall much further because that figure represented bedrock Republican support .
The source said commuting Mr Libby 's sentence , a popular move among Republicans , was a panic measure after an alarming erosion in support , mainly because of hostility to the immigration plan .
Mr Domenici's withdrawal of support followed the desertion of the Republican senator Richard Lugar last week , also over Iraq .
About 50 % of the sitting Republican senators face re-election in November next year and their constituents have made them well aware of how unpopular the Iraq war is .
The White House yesterday expressed disappointment , saying it had hoped the senators would not go public with their frustration before September , when the army and others report back on whether Mr Bush 's " surge " strategy is working .
Steve Clemons , head of the progressive thinktank the New America Foundation , has heard the reports of Mr Bush 's decline in power and is sceptical .
He cautioned : " Even though he has lost some ability to dictate events , he is still capable of deploying major influence on the big issues .
We went through the same thing with [ Vice - president Dick ]
Cheney when people thought he was down and out .
I think it is a big mistake to think Bush is now powerless . "
With little positive to show from six years in office , Mr Bush has been talking up his transformation of the supreme court as his legacy .
He has given it a strong rightwing bias , demonstrated by rulings on abortion , employment discrimination and rejection of death penalty appeals .
That will please Republicans , at least .
But Prof Dallek remains unimpressed .
Rating the worst presidents , he said : " Hoover was a disaster .
Warren Harding rates very low in the pantheon of presidents and it is likely that Bush will be seen as a bottom feeder . "

Games like Crysis are hoping to push the boundaries of realism
Mr Entis told the Siggraph conference that games makers had to use much more than graphics to make their creations believable , engaging and fun .
Game worlds must not just look lifelike , he said , they must also react in a realistic manner too .
Tools that let players create content were also becoming important , he said .
Siggraph , held in San Diego , is the world 's leading computer graphics conference .
During his speech , Mr Entis warned against assuming that games which look lifelike automatically take on the characteristics of the real world .
He said this problem was most acute when creating believable human video game characters .
Exquisitely sensitive
Humans were so exquisitely sensitive to how other people move and behave , said Mr Entis , that the smallest differences undermine the almost perfect physical representations of people becoming possible on next - generation consoles such as the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 .
" When a character 's visual appearance creates the expectation of life and it falls short your brain is going to reject that , " he said .
Improvements in graphics would not boost believability , he said .
" Just adding polygons makes it worse . "
He said that to add authenticity EA had made extensive use of motion capture to catalogue how stance , gait and the tiny movements of facial muscles combine when people display different emotions .
Every part of nature that can respond will respond
Glenn Entis , EA
Using this , he said , the game maker had created a movement system for characters that unites these gross and fine - grained changes .
" It gives us alertness and empathy that we have never really had in our games before , " he said .
" Model and motion are what gives fidelity for non-interactive characters , " said Mr Entis , " but it is responsiveness and intelligence that really brings them alive . "
" Players have to relate to the characters they are holding in the palm of their hand , " he said .
Movement matching
The emotion and movement matching system was going to get its first airing in the next release of EA 's basketball game , NBA Live .
Similar demands held true for game worlds as well as the characters that inhabit them , said Mr Entis .
Game worlds must also react in a lifelike manner to whatever people do , he said .
Often this can be done via good physics that dictates how scenery reacts when blown up or how liquids or gases move to produce an engaging , thrilling game .
" Every part of nature that can respond will respond , " he said .
Mr Entis said the forthcoming Crysis title was a good example of a game in which the responsiveness of the world made it more fun to play .
" It 's about worlds that look beautiful but behave beautifully as well , " said Mr Entis .
Finally , he said , easy to use tools for players were growing in importance and in some cases had become as important as the gameplay itself .
EA research
For example , he said , EA research had revealed that more than half the people that played The Sims spent more than half the time they play it just making stuff - be it characters or game extras such as furniture .
" They love making the stuff so much that it becomes the game , " he said .
EA was now working on a European Xbox 360 title called Virtual Me that gives players unprecedented control over the looks and wardrobe of the character they create .
The game will be released alongside a TV programme put together by Big Brother creator Endemol .
The move by the games industry to give players more tools , such as the much - anticipated Spore game by Sim City creator Will Wright , was like the trend towards user - generated content seen on the web , said Mr Entis .
" It 's an exploding area , " he said .
Due to my love for oversimplified graphs , I give to you old - gen hardware sales compared to next - gen hardware sales in delicious pie graph form .
Nintendo should be sending me checks for all this market research I ’m doing in support of their strategy .
Data was taken from the NPD , North America ’s hardware bean counter .
Definitions are as follows :
Old - gen category includes all reported systems selling inferior graphics and processing power namely DS , Wii , PS2 , PSP , GameCube , and GameBoy Advance .
category includes all reported systems selling inferior graphics and processing power namely DS , Wii , PS2 , PSP , GameCube , and GameBoy Advance .
Next - gen category includes all reported systems selling up - to - date graphics and processing power , namely 360 and PS3 .
I find the result pretty astounding .
Granted , I was unable to produce the same figures 18 months after the Dreamcast and PS2 first launched ( data not publicly available ) , but I ’d be surprised if old - gen hardware was outselling next - gen hardware by this much circa the early 2000s .

Chinese premier Wen Jiabao described reports of Chinese hackers breaking into German computers as a matter of " grave concern " and said Monday that his country will cooperate with Germany to resolve the matter .
Jiabao's comments , made during a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Beijing , were prompted by a report published two days earlier in the German news magazine Der Spiegel claiming that Chinese hackers had been able to infect German government computers with spyware .
Merkel said that for Chinese relations with industrialized countries to move ahead , everyone needs to " respect a set of game rules " and " protect intellectual property rights . "
Security experts from Germany 's Federal Office for Information Security ( BSI ) and Federal Data Protection Office discovered Trojan horse programs in computers used in several government ministries , including the Foreign Ministry , the Ministry of Economics and the Research and Development Ministry , as well as Merkel 's office , the report in Der Spiegel said .
Although the first Trojan horse software was detected in May , there are continued attempts to sneak spyware into government computers via the Internet , according to Spiegel .
Security experts monitoring data traffic were able to stop the transmission of a 160G - byte file from a German ministry to China , but no one would say if hackers succeeded in stealing other files , the magazine reported .
BSI and the Federal Data Protection Office declined to comment .
A spokesman at the Federal Ministry of the Interior , while declining to comment on the Spiegel story specifically , said that the federal government , in general , is aware of increased efforts to steal information from computers in the private and public sectors .
" We are making a huge effort to ensure that government systems remain protected from outside attacks , " the spokesman said .
" So far , we 've been able to avoid any damage . "
( Information from pool reporters located in Beijing was used in this report . )
The United States would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic materials for military purposes .
It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers .
It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace
Of all the objects in the universe , the human brain is the most complex :
There are as many neurons in the brain as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy .
So it is no surprise that , ­despite the glow from recent advances in the science of the brain and mind , we still find ourselves squinting in the dark somewhat .
But we are at least beginning to grasp the crucial mysteries of neuroscience and starting to make headway in addressing them .
Even partial answers to these 10 questions could restructure our understanding of the roughly three - pound mass of gray and white matter that defines who we are .
1 . How is information coded in neural activity ?
Neurons , the specialized cells of the brain , can produce brief spikes of voltage in their outer membranes .
These electrical pulses travel along specialized extensions called axons to cause the release of chemical signals elsewhere in the brain .
The binary , all - or - nothing spikes appear to carry information about the world :
What do I see ?
Am I hungry ?
Which way should I turn ?
But what is the code of these millisecond bits of voltage ?
Spikes may mean different things at different places and times in the brain .
In parts of the central nervous system ( the brain and spinal cord ) , the rate of spiking often correlates with clearly definable external features , like the presence of a color or a face .
In the peripheral nervous system , more spikes indicates more heat , a louder sound , or a stronger muscle contraction .
As we delve deeper into the brain , however , we find populations of neurons involved in more complex phenomena , like reminiscence , value judgments , simulation of possible futures , the desire for a mate , and so on — and here the signals become difficult to decrypt .
The challenge is something like popping the cover off a computer , measuring a few transistors chattering between high and low voltage , and trying to guess the content of the Web page being surfed .
It is likely that mental information is stored not in single cells but in populations of cells and patterns of their activity .
However , it is currently not clear how to know which neurons belong to a particular group ; worse still , current technologies ( like sticking fine electrodes directly into the brain ) are not well suited to measuring several thousand neurons at once .
Nor is it simple to monitor the connections of even one neuron : A typical neuron in the cortex receives input from some 10,000 other neurons .
Although traveling bursts of voltage can carry signals across the brain quickly , those electrical spikes may not be the only — or even the main — way that information is carried in nervous systems .
­Forward - looking studies are examining other possible information couriers : glial cells ( poorly understood brain cells that are 10 times as common as neurons ) , other kinds of signaling mechanisms between cells ( such as newly discovered gases and peptides ) , and the biochemical cascades that take place inside cells .
2 . How are memories stored and retrieved ?
When you learn a new fact , like someone ’s name , there are physical changes in the structure of your brain .
But we do n’t yet comprehend exactly what those changes are , how they are orchestrated across vast seas of synapses and neurons , how they embody knowledge , or how they are read out decades later for retrieval .
One complication is that there are many kinds of memories .
The brain seems to distinguish short - term memory ( remembering a phone number just long enough to dial it ) from long - term memory ( what you did on your last birthday ) .
Within long - term memory , declarative memories ( like names and facts ) are distinct from non­declarative memories ( riding a bicycle , being affected by a subliminal message ) , and within these general categories are numerous subtypes .
Different brain structures seem to support different kinds of learning and memory ; brain damage can lead to the loss of one type without disturbing the others .
Nonetheless , similar molecular mechanisms may be at work in these memory types .
Almost all theories of memory propose that memory storage depends on synapses , the tiny connections between brain cells .
When two cells are active at the same time , the connection between them strengthens ; when they are not active at the same time , the connection weakens .
Out of such synaptic changes emerges an association .
Experience can , for example , fortify the connections between the smell of coffee , its taste , its color , and the feel of its warmth .
Since the populations of neurons connected with each of these sensations are typically activated at the same time , the connections between them can cause all the sensory associations of coffee to be triggered by the smell alone .
But looking only at associations — and strengthened connections between neurons — may not be enough to explain memory .
The great secret of memory is that it mostly encodes the relationships between things more than the details of the things themselves .
When you memorize a melody , you encode the relationships between the notes , not the notes per se , which is why you can easily sing the song in a different key .
Memory retrieval is even more mysterious than storage .
When I ask if you know Alex Ritchie , the answer is immediately obvious to you , and there is no good theory to explain how memory retrieval can happen so quickly .
Moreover , the act of retrieval can destabilize the memory .
When you recall a past event , the memory becomes temporarily susceptible to erasure .
Some intriguing recent experiments show it is possible to chemically block memories from reforming during that window , suggesting new ethical questions that require careful consideration .
3 . What does the baseline activity in the brain represent ?
Neuroscientists have mostly studied changes in brain activity that correlate with stimuli we can present in the laboratory , such as a picture , a touch , or a sound .
But the activity of the brain at rest — its “ baseline ” activity — may prove to be the most important aspect of our mental lives .
The awake , resting brain uses 20 percent of the body ’s total oxygen , even though it makes up only 2 percent of the body ’s mass .
Some of the baseline activity may represent the brain restructuring knowledge in the background , simulating future states and events , or manipulating memories .
Most things we care about — reminiscences , emotions , drives , plans , and so on — can occur with no external stimulus and no overt output that can be measured .
One clue about baseline activity comes from neuroimaging experiments , which show that activity decreases in some brain areas just before a person performs a goal - directed task .
The areas that decrease are the same regardless of the details of the task , hinting that these areas may run baseline programs during downtime , much as your computer might run a disk - defragmenting program only while the resources are not needed elsewhere .
In the traditional view of perception , information from the outside world pours into the senses , works its way through the brain , and makes itself consciously seen , heard , and felt .
But many scientists are coming to think that sensory input may merely revise ongoing internal activity in the brain .
Note , for example , that sensory input is superfluous for perception :
When your eyes are closed during dreaming , you still enjoy rich visual experience .
The awake state may be essentially the same as the dreaming state , only partially anchored by external stimuli .
In this view , your conscious life is an awake dream .
4 . How do brains simulate the future ?
When a fire chief encounters a new blaze , he quickly makes predictions about how to best position his men .
Running such simulations of the future — without the risk and expense of actually attempting them — allows “ our hypotheses to die in our stead , ” as philosopher Karl Popper put it .
For this reason , the emulation of possible futures is one of the key businesses that intelligent brains invest in .
Yet we know little about how the brain ’s future simulator works because traditional neuroscience technologies are best suited for correlating brain activity with explicit behaviors , not mental emulations .
One idea suggests that the brain ’s resources are devoted not only to processing stimuli and reacting to them ( watching a ball come at you ) but also to constructing an internal model of that outside world and extracting rules for how things tend to behave ( knowing how balls move through the air ) .
Internal models may play a role not only in motor acts , like catching , but also in perception .
For example , vision draws on significant amounts of information in the brain , not just on input from the retina .
Many neuroscientists have suggested over the past few decades that perception arises not simply by building up bits of data through a hierarchy but rather by matching incoming sensory data against internally generated expectations .
But how does a system learn to make good predictions about the world ?
It may be that memory exists only for this purpose .
This is not a new idea :
Two millennia ago , Aristotle and Galen emphasized memory as a tool in making successful predictions for the future .
Even your memories about your life may come to be understood as a special subtype of emulation , one that is pinned down and thus likely to flow in a certain direction .
5 . What are emotions ?
We often talk about brains as information - processing systems , but any account of the brain that lacks an account of emotions , motivations , fears , and hopes is incomplete .
Emotions are measurable physical responses to salient stimuli : the increased heartbeat and perspiration that accompany fear , the freezing response of a rat in the presence of a cat , or the extra muscle tension that accompanies anger .
Feelings , on the other hand , are the subjective experiences that sometimes accompany these processes : the sensations of happiness , envy , sadness , and so on .
Emotions seem to employ largely unconscious machinery — for example , brain areas involved in emotion will respond to angry faces that are briefly presented and then rapidly masked , even when subjects are unaware of having seen the face .
Across cultures the expression of basic emotions is remarkably similar , and as Darwin observed , it is also similar across all mammals .
There are even strong similarities in physiological responses among humans , reptiles , and birds when showing fear , anger , or parental love .
Modern views propose that emotions are brain states that quickly assign value to outcomes and provide a simple plan of action .
Thus , emotion can be viewed as a type of computation , a rapid , automatic summary that initiates appropriate actions .
When a bear is galloping toward you , the rising fear directs your brain to do the right things ( determining an escape route ) instead of all the other things it could be doing ( rounding out your grocery list ) .
When it comes to perception , you can spot an object more quickly if it is , say , a spider rather than a roll of tape .
In the realm of memory , emotional events are laid down differently by a parallel memory system involving a brain area called the amygdala .
One goal of emotional neuroscience is to understand the nature of the many disorders of emotion , depression being the most common and costly .
Impulsive aggression and violence are also thought to be consequences of faulty emotion regulation .
6 . What is intelligence ?
Intelligence comes in many forms , but it is not known what intelligence — in any of its guises — means biologically .
How do billions of neurons work together to manipulate knowledge , simulate novel situations , and erase inconsequential information ?
What happens when two concepts “ fit ” together and you suddenly see a solution to a problem ?
What happens in your brain when it suddenly dawns on you that the killer in the movie is actually the unsuspected wife ?
Do intelligent people store knowledge in a way that is more distilled , more varied , or more easily retrievable ?
We all grew up with the near - future promise of smart robots , but today we have little better than the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner .
What went wrong ?
There are two camps for explaining the weak performance of artificial intelligence :
Either we do not know enough of the fundamental principles of brain function , or we have not simulated enough neurons working together .
If the latter is true , that ’s good news : Computation gets cheaper and faster each year , so we should not be far from enjoying life with Asimovian robots who can effectively tend our households .
Yet most neuroscientists recognize how distant we are from that dream .
Currently , our robots are little more intelligent than sea slugs , and even after decades of clever research , they can barely distinguish figures from a background at the skill level of an infant .
Recent experiments explore the possible relationship of intelligence to the capacity of short - term memory , the ability to quickly resolve cognitive conflict , or the ability to store stronger associations between facts ; the results are not yet conclusive .
Many other possibilities — better restructuring of stored information , more parallel processing , or superior emulation of possible futures — have not yet been probed by experiments .
Intelligence may not be underpinned by a single mechanism or a single neural area .
Whatever intelligence is , it lies at the heart of what is special about Homo sapiens .
Other species are hardwired to solve particular problems , while our ability to abstract allows us to solve an open - ended series of problems .
This means that studies of intelligence in mice and monkeys may be barking up the wrong family tree .
7 . How is time represented in the brain ?
Hundred - yard dashes begin with a gunshot rather than a strobe light because your brain can react more quickly to a bang than to a flash .
Yet as soon as we get outside the realm of motor reactions and into the realm of perception ( what you report that you saw and heard ) , the story changes .
When it comes to awareness , the brain goes through a good deal of trouble to synchronize incoming signals that are processed at very different speeds .
For example , snap your fingers in front of you .
Although your auditory system processes information about the snap about 30 milliseconds faster than your visual system , the sight of your fingers and the sound of the snap seem simultaneous .
Your brain is employing fancy editing tricks to make simultaneous events in the world feel simultaneous to you , even when the different senses processing the information would individually swear otherwise .
For a simple example of how your brain plays tricks with time , look in the mirror at your left eye .
Now shift your gaze to your right eye .
Your eye movements take time , of course , but you do not see your eyes move .
It is as if the world instantly made the transition from one view to the next .
What happened to that little gap in time ?
For that matter , what happens to the 80 milliseconds of darkness you should see every time you blink your eyes ?
Bottom line :
Your notion of the smooth passage of time is a construction of the brain .
Clarifying the picture of how the brain normally solves timing problems should give insight into what happens when temporal calibration goes wrong , as may happen in the brains of people with dyslexia .
Sensory inputs that are out of sync also contribute to the risk of falls in elderly patients .
8 . Why do brains sleep and dream ?
One of the most astonishing aspects of our lives is that we spend a third of our time in the strange world of sleep .
Newborn babies spend about twice that .
It is inordinately difficult to remain awake for more than a full day - night cycle .
In humans , continuous wakefulness of the nervous system results in mental derangement ; rats deprived of sleep for 10 days die .
All mammals sleep , reptiles and birds sleep , and voluntary breathers like dolphins sleep with one brain hemisphere dormant at a time .
The evolutionary trend is clear , but the function of sleep is not .
The universality of sleep , even though it comes at the cost of time and leaves the sleeper relatively defenseless , suggests a deep importance .
There is no universally agreed - upon answer , but there are at least three popular ( and nonexclusive ) guesses .
The first is that sleep is restorative , saving and replenishing the body ’s energy stores .
However , the high neural activity during sleep suggests there is more to the story .
A second theory proposes that sleep allows the brain to run simulations of fighting , problem solving , and other key actions before testing them out in the real world .
A third theory — the one that enjoys the most evidence — is that sleep plays a critical role in learning and consolidating memories and in forgetting inconsequential details .
In other words , sleep allows the brain to store away the important stuff and take out the neural trash .
Recently , the spotlight has focused on REM sleep as the most important phase for locking memories into long - term encoding .
In one study , rats were trained to scurry around a track for a food reward .
The researchers recorded activity in the neurons known as place cells , which showed distinct patterns of activity depending upon the rats ’ location on the track .
Later , while the rats dropped off into REM sleep , the recordings continued .
During this sleep , the rats ’ place cells often repeated the exact same pattern of activity that was seen when the animals ran .
The correlation was so close , the researchers claimed , that as the animal “ dreamed , ” they could reconstruct where it would be on the track if it had been awake — and whether the animal was dreaming of running or standing still .
The emerging idea is that information replayed during sleep might determine which events we remember later .
Sleep , in this view , is akin to an off - line practice session .
In several recent experiments , human subjects performing difficult tasks improved their scores between sessions on consecutive days , but not between sessions on the same day , implicating sleep in the learning process .
Understanding how sleeping and dreaming are changed by ­trauma , drugs , and disease — and how we might modulate our need for sleep — is a rich field to harvest for future clues .
9 . How do the specialized systems of the brain integrate with one another ?
To the naked eye , no part of the brain ’s surface looks terribly different from any other part .
But when we measure activity , we find that different types of information lurk in each region of the neural territory .
Within vision , for example , separate areas process motion , edges , faces , and colors .
The territory of the adult brain is as fractured as a map of the countries of the world .
Now that neuroscientists have a reasonable idea of how that territory is divided , we find ourselves looking at a strange assortment of brain networks involved with smell , hunger , pain , goal setting , temperature , prediction , and hundreds of other tasks .
Despite their disparate functions , these systems seem to work together seamlessly .
There are almost no good ideas about how this occurs .
Nor is it understood how the brain coordinates its systems so rapidly .
The slow speed of spikes ( they travel about one foot per second in axons that lack the insulating sheathing called myelin ) is one hundred - millionth the speed of signal transmission in digital computers .
Yet a human can recognize a friend almost instantaneously , while digital computers are slow — and usually unsuccessful — at face recognition .
How can an organ with such slow parts operate so quickly ?
The usual answer is that the brain is a parallel processor , running many operations at the same time .
This is almost certainly true , but what slows down parallel - processing digital computers is the next stage of operations , where results need to be compared and decided upon .
Brains are amazingly fast at this .
So while the brain ’s ability to do parallel processing is impressive , its ability to rapidly synthesize those parallel processes into a single , behavior - guiding output is at least as significant .
An animal running must go left or right around a tree ; it can not do both .
There is no special anatomical location in the brain where information from all the different systems converges ; rather , the specialized areas all interconnect with one another , forming a network of parallel and recurring links .
Somehow , our integrated image of the world emerges from this complex labyrinthine network of brain structures .
Surprisingly little study has been done on large , loopy networks like the ones in the brain — probably in part because it is easier to think about brains as tidy assembly lines than as dynamic networks .
10 .
What is consciousness ?
Think back to your first kiss .
The experience of it may pop into your head instantly .
Where was that memory before you became conscious of it ?
How was it stored in your brain before and after it came into consciousness ?
What is the difference between those states
An explanation of consciousness is one of the major unsolved problems of modern science .
It may not turn out to be a single phenomenon ; nonetheless , by way of a preliminary target , let ’s think of it as the thing that flickers on when you wake up in the morning that was not there , in the exact same brain hardware , moments before .
Neuroscientists believe that consciousness emerges from the material stuff of the brain primarily because even very small changes to your brain ( say , by drugs or disease ) can powerfully alter your subjective experiences .
The heart of the problem is that we do not yet know how to engineer pieces and parts such that the resulting machine has the kind of private subjective experience that you and I take for granted .
If I give you all the Tinkertoys in the world and tell you to hook them up so that they form a conscious machine , good luck .
We do n’t have a theory yet of how to do this ; we do n’t even know what the theory will look like .
One of the traditional challenges to consciousness research is studying it experimentally .
It is probable that at any moment some active neuronal processes correlate with consciousness , while others do not .
The first challenge is to determine the difference between them .
Some clever experiments are making at least a little headway .
In one of these , subjects see an image of a house in one eye and , simultaneously , an image of a cow in the other .
Instead of perceiving a house - cow mixture , people perceive only one of them .
Then , after some random amount of time , they will believe they ’re seeing the other , and they will continue to switch slowly back and forth .
Yet nothing about the visual stimulus changes ; only the conscious experience changes .
This test allows investigators to probe which properties of neuronal activity correlate with the changes in subjective experience .
The mechanisms underlying consciousness could reside at any of a variety of physical levels : molecular , cellular , circuit , pathway , or some organizational level not yet described .
The mechanisms might also be a product of interactions between these levels .
One compelling but still speculative notion is that the massive feedback circuitry of the brain is essential to the production of consciousness .
In the near term , scientists are working to identify the areas of the brain that correlate with consciousness .
Then comes the next step : understanding why they correlate .
This is the so - called hard problem of neuroscience , and it lies at the outer limit of what material explanations will say about the experience of being human .

The foreign medics have always insisted they are innocent
However , a mediating body is now said to have agreed a financial settlement with the children 's families .
The High Judiciary Council , which can overrule the Supreme Court , is to meet on Monday to confirm , annul or amend the death penalty verdicts .
The imprisonment of the medics has caused an international outcry .
They insist they are innocent of deliberately giving tainted blood to the children at the Benghazi hospital in 1998 .
Compensation
A spokesman for the Libyan parents , Idriss Lagha - himself the father of one of the victims - confirmed a final deal had been reached with all the interested parties involved , including the European Union and the Libyan government .
TRIAL IN DATES 1999 : 19 Bulgarian medics and a Palestinian doctor are arrested at a Benghazi hospital after an outbreak of HIV / Aids among children .
13 are later freed May 2004 : Libya convicts and sentences five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor for infecting children with HIV .
A Bulgarian doctor is freed Dec 2005 : Libyan Supreme Court overturns the convictions and orders a retrial Dec 2006 : Medics sentenced to death a second time Feb 2007 : Medics appeal to the Libyan Supreme Court June 2007 : Top EU officials hold talks in Libya to try to secure medics ' release 11 July 2007 : Libya 's Supreme Court upholds death sentences
Timeline : Medics trial
But the contents of the deal , reportedly brokered by the Gaddafi Foundation , remain vague .
Mr Lagha said details of the agreement will be made public in the coming hours or days .
The BBC's Rana Jawad , in Tripoli , says any financial settlement with the families of the infected children means they will drop their rights to pursue the death penalty .
Tripoli says that when it meets on Monday , the High Judiciary Council will take into account any financial compensation to the infected children 's families and the amount of time already served by the prisoners .
Its decision will be final and irreversible .
Whatever the outcome , the latest developments signal a near end to this eight - year saga , our correspondent adds .
Diplomatic efforts
Speaking after the Supreme Court ruling , Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov urged Libya to find a quick solution .
" Unfortunately , the court 's ruling today is not a surprise .
We expected the death sentences to be confirmed .
We expect and insist for a swift solution by Libya 's High Judicial Council to finally complete the case , " he said .
The families of the infected children had previously demanded the maximum punishment .
The European Commission said it regretted the decision by Libya 's Supreme Court , and the EU's External Relations Commissioner , Benita Ferrero - Waldner , said she hoped the Libyan authorities would show clemency to the medics .
In recent months , the European Union has stepped up diplomatic efforts to have the medics freed .
The United States has also been involved , with President George W Bush appealing for their release in June .
International attention
The six medics were found guilty and sentenced to death twice , first in 2004 and again in 2006 following a court appeal .
During their trial , one of the doctors who helped first isolate the HIV virus , Luc Montagnier , said the hospital epidemic began before the foreign medics started working at the hospital .
The government in Tripoli is caught between its wish to repair ties with the West and to defend its own legal system , the BBC's Eastern Europe reporter Nick Thorpe says .
Fifty - six of the 438 children infected with tainted blood at the Benghazi hospital have since died .
Mr. Ballmer may have a decidedly low - key office , but he uses an Excel spreadsheet to track his calendar .
Nanotechnology could clean up the hydrogen car 's dirty little secret
( Nanowerk Spotlight ) Back in January , when the U.S. president announced his hydrogen fuel initiative and proposed to spend a total of $ 1.7 billion over the next five years to develop hydrogen - powered fuel cells , hydrogen infrastructure and advanced automotive technologies , he said that it will be practical and cost - effective for large numbers of Americans to choose to use clean , hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2020 .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) Hydrogen Program , the government 's goal is to achieve " technology readiness " by around 2015 in order to allow industry to make decisions on commercialization by then .
That 's only eight years to go .
Given where the technology is today , this goal seems very ambitious , to say the least .
Nanotechnology could help speed up the journey to the hydrogen society , but it will take some sensational breakthroughs on the way .
The three key areas for the vehicles ( we will not touch on the infrastructure issues here ) are clean - the emphasis is on clean - hydrogen production , hydrogen storage , and the fuel cell itself .
We 'll take a look at how nanotechnology will play a role in these areas .
First , let 's get the terminology straight .
Getting an internal combustion engine to run on hydrogen is not difficult ( but it is difficult to get it to run smoothly ) .
Some of the Hydrogen Vehicles on the road today still have an internal combustion engine , but one that uses either pure hydrogen or a mix of hydrogen and natural gas .
True Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles basically are electric cars ( having a flashback to the 1970s here ? ) where fuel cells convert the chemical energy of a fuel – hydrogen – directly into electricity without any intermediate thermal or mechanical processes .
Neat thing is that the exhaust consists solely of heat and water .
Hydrogen Production
Hydrogen fuel cells get their hydrogen either produced on - board by converting liquid fuels ( gasoline , ethanol , or methanol ) to hydrogen , or by using hydrogen that has been generated off - board and stored on the vehicle .
Where that off - board generated hydrogen comes from is problem number 1 : There are no hydrogen wells .
Hydrogen has to be produced , and that can be done using a variety of resources .
The cleanest by far of course would be renewable energy electrolysis : using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen ; this electricity could be generated using renewable energy technologies such as wind , solar , geo- and hydrothermal power .
The dirtiest , at least until highly efficient carbon capture and sequestration technologies are developed , is the gasification of coal .
Of course you can also use nuclear energy to provide the electricity for electrolysis .
However , 95 % of all the hydrogen produced in the United States today ( and 50 % worldwide ) , some 9 million tons annually , is produced from methane in natural gas using high - temperature steam – so - called steam methane reforming .
Government researchers say that they see natural gas only as a ' near - term ' solution ; ' near - term ' meaning the time it takes to come up with a better and cleaner solution that scales industrially .
That solution does n't exist yet .
And here is the dirty little secret : while politicians and the energy industry talk about the clean future of the hydrogen economy , the DOE 's Hydrogen Energy Roadmap foresees up to 90 % of hydrogen production coming from fossil fuels – coal , gas , oil – the rest mostly from nuclear power plants ( why do you think the oil companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into hydrogen technology ? ) .
In other words : although hydrogen fuel cell cars themselves may emit nothing but water and heat , the process of powering the fuel cells with hydrocarbons will continue the economy 's dependence on fossil fuels and leave behind carbon dioxide ( sequestered or not ) , the primary cause of global warming .
The greatest challenge to clean hydrogen production is its cost .
Unless government mandates the use of hydrogen or significantly increases the taxes on existing fossil - based fuels , the ' gallon / liter gasoline equivalent ' ( the amount of fuel with the energy content of one gallon / liter of gas ) will be the measure used by drivers to decide what fuel to use .
And the cheapest way today to produce hydrogen is from fossil fuels .
Nanotechnology 's major contribution to the clean production of hydrogen lies in its application to solar cells and the catalysts used in water electrolysis .
The holy grail here would be a highly efficient device that you fill with water , put in the sun , and get hydrogen without using any outside source of energy .
Solar cells have the potential to make this dream come true .
The two key issues for now are efficiency ( which is low ) and cost ( which is high ) .
In one type of solar cell hydrogen is generated directly in a photoelectrochemical process that is based on the conversion of sunlight energy to chemical energy .
It has been shown that nanoscale electrode materials , resulting in higher surface area to volume ratios , will increase the efficiency of the cell .
Another type of solar cell – a photovoltaic cell – produces electricity that can then be used to power electrolytic production of hydrogen from water .
Experiments with nanowire arrays and other nanostructured materials have shown that they improve the efficiency of these cells .
Without going into details here – we have plenty of news articles and spotlights on this topic on our site – it is probably safe to say that nanotechnology will play an important role in building the type of highly efficient solar cells required to become a viable alternative to fossil fuel based hydrogen production .
Hydrogen Storage
Storing the hydrogen onboard that is needed to run your car 's fuel cells poses another challenge .
Very roughly speaking you would need about 1 kg of hydrogen to drive 100 km ( or some 2.2 lbs. per 60 miles ) .
That means you need about 5 kg / 10 lbs. of hydrogen to have the same average range as today 's cars .
Since hydrogen 's density is only 1/10th of a gram per liter at room temperature , that means you somehow need to pack 50,000 liters ( ∼14,000 gallons ) of hydrogen into your tank .
There are three ways of doing this : as a high - pressure compressed gas ; a cryogenic liquid ; or as a solid .
Compressed hydrogen gas tanks will likely be used in early hydrogen - powered vehicles and will need to meet cost and packaging requirements to play a role across various vehicle platforms .
Honda last year announced the FCX concept car that stores 5 kg of hydrogen at 5000 psi in a tank small enough to fit into a midsize car .
Rather than using thousands of psi to compress hydrogen into a tank , or cooling it down to minus 252 °C ( minus 421° F ) to liquefy it , an intriguing alternative of hydrogen storage has led to metal hydrides , chemical hydrides , and physisorption - based storage , where hydrogen is adsorbed onto the interior surfaces of a porous material .
The stored hydrogen can then be released by heat , electricity , or chemical reaction .
Many metals are capable of absorbing hydrogen as well .
Nanotechnology plays an important role here .
Nanomaterials have diverse tunable physical properties as a function of their size and shape due to strong quantum confinement effects and large surface to volume ratios .
These properties are useful for designing hydrogen storage materials .
For instance , researchers are now investigating nanostructured polymeric materials as hydrogen storage adsorbents .
The new polymer adsorbent material has shown great promise in preliminary tests .
Due to their large surface areas with relatively small mass , single - walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) have been considered very promising potential materials for high capacity hydrogen storage .
Theoretically , they can store hydrogen up to 7.7 wt % , as every carbon atom in SWCNTs chemisorbs one hydrogen atom .
In addition , the subsequent physisorption of hydrogen on the surfaces of hydrogenated SWCNTs can increase the capacity of hydrogen storage even further .
However , there is some skepticism on carbon nanotube hydrogen storage due to early mistakes in experimental publications and a rational basis for high capacity hydrogen storage materials is now being developed .
Fuel Cell
Not surprisingly , a fuel cell is essentially just the reverse of an electrolytic cell : whereas electricity is used to decompose water into its constituent gases during electrolysis , in a fuel cell water and electricity are generated by the direct recombination of hydrogen and oxygen .
A major challenge for hydrogen powered cars today is the cost of the vehicle .
The cost for fuel cells alone are currently hovering between $ 1,000 and $ 3,000 per kilowatt .
To compete with vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines , those figures need to drop to about $ 30 / kW .
There are several kinds of fuel cells , but Polymer Electrolyte Membrane ( PEM ) fuel cells – also called Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells – are the prime candidates for use in automobiles .
Both the electrolytic and the fuel cell use expensive platinum ( which currently sells for about $ 45,000 per kilogram ) as electrode material .
Researchers are looking at two ways to bring the cost of catalysts down :
One way to minimize platinum usage is to increase catalytic efficiency by nanostructuring the platinum metal ; another way of eliminating the use of platinum altogether is by exploring the use of much cheaper non-precious metal catalysts where the nanostructured surfaces match or exceed the catalytic properties of platinum .
DIGG THIS
The latest chapter of John T. Flynn ’s Men of Wealth that has my head spinning concerns someone I probably should have known about , except that late 19th - century Wall Street lore is in short supply these days .
But thanks to Flynn , I now know all about Hetty Green ( 1834 — 1916 ) , whose weird and creepy life now haunts me to no end .
She was the richest woman of the Gilded Age , and sometimes the richest person , having died with a solid $ 200 million .
But she was a miser .
In fact , if the term describes her , it should describe no one else , or else we need some other modifier like x - treme miser or hyper-miser .
This is a woman who refused to pay the doctor to treat her son ’s leg wound , so it later had to be amputated .
She was once offered a horse for $ 200 and she was outraged at the price so she found out everything terrible she could on the seller and intimidated him down to $ 60 .
She rode the ferry with the cars rather than pay the passenger fee .
She lived in a dumpy house in Hoboken .
She had two changes of clothes , both black and tattered .
She would travel hundreds of miles to collect debt payments .
She never tipped .
She was wicked smart .
Emphasis on wicked : she was called “ the witch of Wall Street . ”
On the smart part : her key to success was rather simple , so simple , says Flynn , that everyone preaches but hardly anyone practices it .
She bought things that no one wanted and sold them when everyone wanted them .
Nothing was permanent in her mind .
So she bought bonds when they were crashing and dumped them when they were in high demand .
She did the same with real estate , and railroads .
She seemed to have money to lend when no one else did , so a long line of borrowers was always at her door .
She offered tough terms and charged a high price .
Before she invested a dime in anything , she would find out the names of all the principles of the company .
She would dig up every bit of dirt she could find .
She would then take all the accusations against each person and interview them at length , demanding detailed answers .
She would do the same when people came to her to borrow money .
She would n’t lend unless she felt she effectively owned the person in question .
As Flynn writes : “ She was not a builder .
She projected no great productive industry .
Her business was to stand on the side and take her toll from those who were producers and builders and needed her money . ”
She was crazed with paranoia .
She was convinced that everyone was out to kill her .
When a wood beam fell nearby , she was sure that it was intended for her .
Same with every mishap : the entire world was organizing against her , in her mind .
She hated everyone and everything , truly .
Normally in a market economy , such people do n’t thrive .
But she did , if only because she had the goods .
She had been fascinated by finance when she was a young girl , as she read aloud the stock pages to her aging family members .
She inherited some of their money made from the whale oil trade .
She turned that into an enormous financial empire with which she did absolutely nothing except spend it on litigation .
She loved the courtroom and sued many people .
She insulted them in the courtroom with venomous comebacks and cruel words .
She always lost .
Did she love ?
Briefly , apparently .
Edward H. Green was a wealthy bachelor who , for some odd reason , took a liking to her .
He wrote her a love letter , and , on the same day , wrote a check for a cheap suit of clothes from a tailor .
He inadvertently switched the letters , so that Hetty got the letter intended for the tailor .
She was so touched that he would spend so little on a suit that she agreed to marry him .
Later he lost all his money .
She provided no help and let him languish in poverty the rest of his days .
One good thing : she hated politicians .
When they asked her railroad officials for free passes , she instructed the officials to hand them a card that read :
MONDAY : “ Thou shalt not pass . ” Numbers XX , 18 .
TUESDAY : “ Suffer not a man to pass . ” Judges III , 28 .
WEDNESDAY : “ The wicked shall pass no more . ” Naham I , 15 .
THURSDAY : “ This generation shall not pass . ” Mark XIII , 30 .
FRIDAY : “ By a perpetual decree it shall not pass . ” Jeremiah V , 22 .
SATURDAY : “ None shall pass . ” Isaiah XXIV , 10 .
SUNDAY : “ So he paid the fare thereof and went . ” Jonah I , 2 .
What became of her money ?
Part of the estate was divided up in a thousand directions , owing to a complication in a family will .
Part went to various family members .
Nothing much came of any of it .
What can we say about this miser ?
I think we can say that she did much good , despite her wickedness and despite her horrid ways .
She lent money at a profit .
She bought when no one was buying and sold when everyone was .
She engaged in mutually beneficial exchange .
She was a pill to work with , but evidently people were happy enough about what she had to offer that they were willing to put up with it .
Both sides of the exchange ended up better off than they were before .
Now , people on the left sometimes think that the market economy breeds such types .
No so .
Hetty was famous being unlike all her colleagues .
Everyone was liberally minded by comparison .
Indeed , the Gilded Age gave rise to the accusation that vast wealth makes people wild spendthrifts .
Both ca n’t be true .
What we can observe from the life of Hetty Green is that there are bad people in all kinds of institutions .
Capitalism does n’t create misers ; it turns their ways toward productive good .
Hetty hurt no one but herself and those dear to her .
The market economy localized the effects of her sins and contained them .
She created massive value to society and was rewarded for it .
It is even hard to argue that she hurt herself .
She was as happy as she could be just the way she was , and no amount of forcing her to be otherwise could have improved the situation .
She embodied traits that we think of as being awful but she worked in an industry that allowed these traits to be turned to good for all .
That is a credit to the market economy !
Indeed , it is the highest praise of the free market that it can find a place even for someone so awful as this .
A note about Flynn ’s extraordinary book : it was published in 1941 .
Flynn was an old - time progressive , a journalist deeply suspicious of the business class .
He was disgusted at the truth he saw about the New Deal : it was a racket concocted by the corporate class .
He turned against FDR .
He was shocked to see that his fellow liberals did not follow suit .
Then he opposed U.S. entry into World War II .
I suppose this book was written during his period of sadness , as a way of investigating the complex relationship between government and business .
He gradually came around to a full - blown embrace of the free market as the only means to check the power of the government - business combine .
This is only one chapter .
Every chapter is just as great .
It is a phenomenal work , and it is a mystery to me that it seems to have been forgotten .
Thank goodness this reprint is now available again .

The Best of Jeffrey Tucker
The few souls that attempt to read and understand website privacy policies know they are almost universally unintelligible and shot through with clever loopholes .
But one of the most important policies to know is your internet service provider 's – the company that ferries all your traffic to and from the internet , from search queries to BitTorrent uploads , flirty IMs to porn .
Wired News , with help from some readers , attempted to get real answers from the largest United States - based ISPs about what information they gather on their customers ' use of the internet , and how long they retain records like IP addresses , e-mail and real - time browsing activity .
Most importantly , we asked what they require from law - enforcement agencies before coughing up the data , and whether they sell your data to marketers .
Only four of the eight largest ISPs responded to the 10 - question survey , despite being contacted repeatedly over the course of two months .
Some ISPs would n't talk to us , but gave answers to customers responding to a call for reader help on Wired 's Threat Level blog .
Marc Rotenberg , the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , says ISPs should be more circumspect about keeping user data .
Maintaining detailed data for long periods of time makes any internet company a huge target for law enforcement fishing expeditions .
" From a user perspective , the best practice would be for ISPs to delete data as soon as possible , " Rotenberg said .
" ( The government ) will treat ISPs as one - stop shops for subpoenas unless there is a solid policy on data destruction , " Rotenberg said .
The results :
AOL , AT&T , Cox and Qwest all responded to the survey , with a mix of timeliness and transparency .
But only Cox answered the question , " How long do you retain records of the IP addresses assigned to customers . "
These records can be used to trace an internet posting , website visit or an e-mail back to an ISP 's customers .
The records are useful to police tracking down child - porn providers , and music - industry groups use them to sue file sharers .
Companies have also used the records to track down anonymous posters who write unflattering comments in stock - trading boards .
Cox 's answer : six months .
AOL says " limited period of time , " while AT&T says it varies across its internet - access offerings but that the time limits are all " within industry standards . "
Comcast , EarthLink , Verizon and Time Warner did n't respond .
Some of the most sensitive information sent across an ISP 's network are the URLs of the websites that people visit .
This so - called clickstream data includes every URL a customer visits , including URLs from search engines , which generally include the search term .
AOL , AT&T and Cox all say they do n't store these URLs at all , while Qwest dodged the question .
Comcast , EarthLink , Verizon and Time Warner did n't respond .
When asked if they allow marketers to see anonymized or partially - anonymized clickstream data , AOL , AT&T and Cox said they did not , while Qwest gave a muddled answer and declined to answer a follow - up question .
Comcast , EarthLink , Verizon and Time Warner did n't respond .
This question was prompted by hints at a web - data conference last March that ISPs were peddling their customer 's anonymized clickstream data to web marketers .
Anonymization of data such as URLs and search histories is not , however , a perfect science .
This became clear last summer when AOL employees attempted to provide the search - research community with a large body of queries that researchers could mine to improve search algorithms .
AOL researchers replaced IP addresses with different unique numbers , but news organizations quickly were able to find individuals based on the content of their queries .
Wired News also asked the companies if they have been in contact or discussions with the government about how long they should be keeping data .
The Justice Department , along with some members of Congress , are pushing for European Union - style data- retention rules that would require ISPs to store customer information for months or years – a measure law enforcement says is necessary to prosecute computer crimes , such as trading in child pornography .
ISPs were nearly universally reluctant to talk about any conversations or meetings they have had with federal officials .
AOL had no comment , Qwest dodged the question , AT&T would n't say , but noted it would broach the issue with the government as part of an industry - wide discussion .
For its part , Cox says it has not been contacted .
As for whether they oppose data retention : Qwest said that the market should decide how long data is kept , while Cox was " studying the issue " ; AOL is working with the industry and Congress , and AT&T is " ready to work with all parties . "
Internet surveillance recently got easier , as the deadline passed last week for ISPs to equip their networks to federal specifications for real - time surveillance of a target 's e-mails , VOIP calls and internet usage – as well as data like IP address assignment and web URLs .
While law enforcement currently prefers to ask for stored internet records rather than get real - time surveillance , that balance may shift once the nation 's networks are wired to government surveillance standards .
I put out a new product a couple of weeks ago .
This new product has so far won 16 different awards and recommendations from software download sites .
Some of them even emailed me messages of encouragement such as “ Great job , we ’re really impressed ! ” .
I should be delighted at this recognition of the quality of my software , except that the ‘ software ’ does n’t even run .
This is hardly surprising when you consider that it is just a text file with the words “ this program does nothing at all ” repeated a few times and then renamed as an .exe .
The PAD file that described the software contains the description “ This program does nothing at all ” .
The screenshot I submitted ( below ) was similarly blunt and to the point :
Even the name of the software , “ awardmestars ” , was a bit of a giveaway .
And yet it still won 16 ‘ awards ’ .
Here they are :
Some of them look quite impressive , but none of them are worth the electrons it takes to display them .
The obvious explanation is that some download sites give an award to every piece of software submitted to them .
In return they hope that the author will display the award with a link back to them .
The back link then potentially increases traffic to their site directly ( through clicks on the award link ) and indirectly ( through improved page rank from the incoming links ) .
The author gets some awards to impress their potential clients and the download site gets additional traffic .
This practise is blatantly misleading and dishonest .
It makes no distinction between high quality software and any old rubbish that someone was prepared to submit to a download site .
The download sites that practise this deceit should be ashamed of themselves .
Similarly , any author or company , that displays one of these ‘ awards ’ is either being naive ( at best ) or knowingly colluding in the scam ( at worst ) .
My suspicions were first aroused by the number of five star awards I received for my PerfectTable Plan software .
When I went to these sites all the other programs on them seemed to have five star awards as well .
I also noticed that some of my weaker competitors were proudly displaying pages full of five star awards .
I saw very few three or four star awards .
Something smelled fishy .
Being a scientist by original training , I decided to run a little experiment to see if a completely worthless piece of software would win any awards .
Having seen various recommendations for the rundenko.com submit - everywhere.com submission service on the ASP forums I emailed the owner , Mykola Rudenko , to ask if he could help with my little experiment .
To my surprise , he generously agreed to help by submitting “ awardmestars ” to all 1033 sites on their database , free of charge .
According to the report I received 2 weeks after submissions began “ awardmestars ” is now listed on 218 sites , pending on 394 sites and has been rejected by 421 sites .
Approximately 7 % of the sites that listed the software emailed me that it had won an award ( I do n’t know how many have displayed it with an award , without informing me ) .
With 394 pending sites it might win quite a few more awards yet .
Many of the rejections were on the grounds of “ The site does not accept products of this genre ” ( it was listed as a utility ) rather than quality grounds .
The truth is that many download sites are just electronic dung heaps , using fake awards , dubious SEO and content misappropriated from PAD files in a pathetic attempt to make a few dollars from Google Adwords .
Hopefully these bottom - feeders will be put out of business by the continually improving search engines , leaving only the better sites .
I think there is still a role for good quality download sites .
But there needs to be more emphasis on quality , classification , and additional content ( e.g. reviews ) .
Whether it is possible for such a business to be profitable , I do n’t know .
However , it seems to work in the MacOSX world where the download sites are much fewer in number , but with much higher quality and more user interaction .
Some download site owners did email me to say either “ very funny ” or “ stop wasting my time ” .
Kudos to them for taking the time to check every submission .
I recommend you put their sites high on your list next time you are looking for software :
www.filecart.com
www.freshmeat.net
www.download-tipp.de ( German )
This is the response I got from Lothar Jung of download - tipp.de when I showed him a draft of this article :
“ The other side for me as a website publisher is that if you do not give each software 5 stars , you do n’t get so many back links and some authors are not very pleased with this and your website .
When I started download - tipp.de , I wanted to create a site where users can find good software .
So I decided the visitor is important , and not the number of backlinks .
Only 10 % of all programs submitted get the 5 Suns Award . ”
Another important issue for download sites is trust .
I want to know that the software I am downloading does n’t contain spyware , trojans or other malware .
Some of the download sites have cunningly exploited this by awarding “ 100 % clean ” logos .
I currently use the Softpedia one on the PerfectTablePlan download page .
It should n’t be too difficult in principle to scan software for known malware .
But now I am beginning to wonder if these 100 % clean logos have any more substance than the “ five star ” awards .
The only way to find out for sure would be to submit a download with malware , which would be unethical .
If anyone has any information about whether these sites really check for malware , I would be interested to know .
My thanks to submit - everywhere.com for making this experiment possible .
I was favourably impressed by the thoroughness of their service .
At only $ 70 I think it is excellent value compared to the time and hassle of trying to do it yourself .
I expect to be a paying customer in future .
** Addendum 1 **
This little experiment has been featured on reddit.com , digg.com , slashdot.com , stumbleupon.com and a number of other popular sites and blogs .
Consequently there have been hundreds of comments on this blog and on other sites .
I am very flattered by the interest .
But I also feel like Dr Frankenstein , looking on as my experiment gains a life of its own .
If I had known the article was going to be read by so many people I would have taken a bit more time to clarify the following points :
I have no commercial interest in , or prior relationship with , the three download sites mentioned .
I singled them out because I infer from emails received that they have a human - in - the - loop , checking all submissions ( or a script that passes the Turing test , which is even more praiseworthy ) .
I offered all three a chance to be quoted in the article .
Today I received a similar email from tucows.com , but they were too late to make the article .
I do n’t know if they read the article before they emailed me .
I have no commercial interest in , or prior relationship with , the automatic submission service mentioned .
I approached them for help , which they generously provided , free of charge .
The only business mentioned in which I have a commercial interest is my own table planning software , PerfectTablePlan .
** Addendum 2 **
23 awards ‘ won ’ at the latest count .

Tiny plastic fibers could be the key to some diverse technologies in the future -- including self - cleaning surfaces , transparent electronics , and biomedical tools that manipulate strands of DNA .
In the June issue of the journal Nature Nanotechnology , Ohio State University researchers describe how they created surfaces that , seen with the eye , look as flat and transparent as a sheet of glass .
But seen up close , the surfaces are actually carpeted with tiny fibers .
A drop of water balances perfectly on a plastic surface invented by researchers at Ohio State University .
The surface is covered with microscopic fibers , and can be made to attract or repel water .
The surface shown here is water repellant , so the drop can't spread out along the surface ; instead , it retains its spherical shape .

The patent - pending technology involves a method for growing a bed of fibers of a specific length , and using chemical treatments to tailor the fibers ' properties , explained Arthur J. Epstein , Distinguished University Professor of chemistry and physics and director of the university 's Institute for Magnetic and Electronic Polymers .
" One of the good things about working with these polymers is that you 're able to structure them in many different ways , " Epstein said .
" Plus , we found that we can coat almost any surface with these fibers . "
For this study , the scientists grew fibers of different heights and diameters , and were able to modify the fibers ' molecular structures by exposing them to different chemicals .
They devised one treatment that made the fibers attract water , and another that made the fibers repel water .
They found they could also make the surfaces attract or repel oil .
Depending on what polymer they start with , the fibers can also be made to conduct electricity .
The ability to tailor the properties of the fibers opens the surface to many different applications , he said .
Since dirt , water , and oil do n't stick to the repellant fibers , windows coated with them would stay cleaner longer .
In contrast , the attracting fibers would make a good anti-fog coating , because they pull at water droplets and cause them to spread out flat on the surface .
They devised one treatment that made the fibers attract water , and another that made the fibers repel water .
They found they could also make the surfaces attract or repel oil .
Depending on what polymer they start with , the fibers can also be made to conduct electricity .
What 's more , researchers found that the attracting surface does the same thing to coiled - up strands of DNA .
When they put droplets of water containing DNA on the fibers , the strands uncoiled and hung suspended from the fibers like clotheslines .
Epstein said scientists could use the fibers as a platform to study how DNA interacts with other molecules .
They could also use the spread - out DNA to build new nanostructures .
" We 're very excited about where this kind of development can take us , " he added .
Epstein's research centers on polymers that conduct electricity , and light up or change color .
Depending on the choice of polymer , the nano - fiber surface can also conduct electricity .
The researchers were able to use the surface to charge an organic light - emitting device -- a find that could pave the way for transparent plastic electronics .
Finally , they also showed that the fibers could be used to control the flow of water in microfluidic devices --- a specialty of study co-author L. James Lee , professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and head of Ohio State 's Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices .
Lee and Epstein are advisors to former graduate student Nan-Rong Chiou , who developed the technology to earn his doctorate .
He is now a visiting scholar at the university .
Other co-authors on the paper included former doctoral students Chunmeng Lu and Jingjiao Guan .
The technology is a merger of two different chemical processes for growing polymer molecules : one grows tiny dots of polymer " seeds " on a flat surface , and the other grows vertical fibers out from the top of the seeds .
The fibers grow until the scientists cut off the chemical reaction , forming a carpet of uniform height .
The university will license the technology , and Epstein and his colleagues are looking for new applications for it .
Aside from anti-fog windows , self - cleaning windows , and organic LEDs , Chiou said that he foresees the surfaces working in glucose sensors , gene therapy devices , artificial muscles , field emission displays , and electromagnetic interference shielding .

Sunni Arab Iraqis have long complained about death squads
The probe comes after a US general revealed the arrest of 22 policemen allegedly on a mission to kill a Sunni .
" We have found one of the death squads .
They are part of the police force , " US Maj Gen Joseph Peterson said .
Sunnis have long accused Iraqi forces of operating death squads - but the claims have never been substantiated .
Iraqi deputy interior minister Maj Gen Hussein Kamal said his ministry had set up an inquiry .
For a very long time we have been talking about such violations ... that there are squads that raid houses and arrest people who are found later executed in different parts of the capital
Nasser al - Ani
Iraqi Islamic Party
" The interior minister has formed an investigation committee to learn more about the Sunni person and those 22 men , particularly whether they work for the interior ministry or claim to belong to the ministry , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
Hundreds of Sunni Arab Iraqis have been found dead since the 2003 war in what appear to have been extra-judicial killings .
On Wednesday , the bodies of four unidentified men were found in Baghdad 's Shia district of Shula .
They had been handcuffed , blindfolded and shot in the head .
Iraqi insurgents have also often used a similar tactic against Iraqis working with international forces or the Iraqi government .
Detained
Gen Peterson , who is in charge of training the Iraqi police , told the Chicago Tribune on Wednesday that US forces had stumbled across the first evidence of death squads within the interior ministry .
The 22 interior ministry traffic policemen , dressed in police commando uniforms , were arrested in late January at an Iraqi army checkpoint in northern Baghdad and asked what they were doing .
They told soldiers they were taking a Sunni man away to be shot dead .
" The amazing thing is ... they tell you exactly what they 're going to do , " Gen Peterson said .
Militias
Gen Peterson said US forces were holding four of the men at the Abu Ghraib prison and that the 18 other men were being detained at an Iraqi jail .
The Sunni man , who was accused of murder , is also being detained .
Subsequent investigations found the four men in US custody are linked to the Badr Organisation , the armed militia of one of Iraq 's main Shia parties , the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq .
I think there are many people inside the interior ministry involved with these deaths or giving the uniforms of colleagues to criminals
Iraqi Human Rights Minister Narmin Uthman
But Gen Peterson said he was convinced Iraqi Interior Minster Bayan Jabr , a member of Sciri , had no knowledge of or involvement in the death squads .
" Who are these guys ?
That 's what the minister is trying to find out , " he said .
" They are discrediting him and his organisation .
He wants to find these guys .
He does not support them . "
But Gen Peterson said he believed other death squads were operating within the Iraqi security forces .
" It 's an issue of loyalties , of allegiance , " he said .
" If you 're still wearing your Badr T - shirt under your uniform , that 's a problem . "
' Official help '
Iraqi Human Rights Minister Narmin Uthman said she believed lower - level officials were helping the death squads .
" These officials are helping the criminals by informing them on where targeted people are going or where people are living , " she told AP .
A spokesman for the country 's main Sunni Arab party , the Iraqi Islamic Party , backed the launch of the investigation .
" For a very long time we have been talking about such violations and we have been telling the interior ministry officials that there are squads that raid houses and arrest people who are found later executed in different parts of the capital , " Nasser al - Ani said .
Home HOPL - III : Modula - 2 and Oberon Niklaus Wirth discusses two of his Pascal successor languages in the HOPL - III paper on Modula - 2 and Oberon .
This is an account of the development of the languages Modula - 2 and Oberon .
Together with their ancestors ALGOL 60 and Pascal they form a family called Algol - like languages .
Pascal ( 1970 ) reflected the ideas of Structured Programming , Modula - 2 ( 1979 ) added those of modular system design , and Oberon ( 1988 ) catered to the object - oriented style .
Thus they mirror the essential programming paradigms of the past decades .
Here the major language properties are outlined , followed by an account of the respective implementation efforts .
The conditions and the environments are elucidated , in which the languages were created .
We point out that simplicity of design was the most essential , guiding principle .
Clarity of concepts , economy of features , efficiency and reliability of implementations were its consequences .
The main influence on these languages were the Xerox Parc languages of
The main influence on these languages were the Xerox Parc languages of Mesa and Cedar ( which were Pascal derivatives ) .
Mesa and Modula - 2 explored modules , while Cedar and Oberon were concerned with the entire operating system experience .
As Wirth states a couple of times in the paper , his main goal was to teach programming concepts , using language design to further that end , but with an eye for use in non-academic settings .
He frowns on the design of modern PLs , with its lack of resource constraints and kitchen - sink approaches - expressing concern that it makes it hard to teach structured programming .
He also expresses concern that operating systems are no longer a subject of research , much less integration with PL design .

Does the Death Penalty Really Reduce Crime ?
Associated Press reporter Robert Tanner writes an article today stating that evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the death penalty reduces crime .
As with most media coverage of controversial issues , there is a paragraph or two in which the other side makes its case .
In this instance , the lone voice arguing against the efficacy of the death penalty is Justin Wolfers , a professor at Wharton who just ca n’t seem to keep his name out of our blog .
Tanner does his best to make Wolfers look bad , quoting him as dismissing these studies because they appear in “ second - tier journals . ”
Given the evidence I ’ve examined , I believe that Wolfers is on the right side of this debate .
There are recent studies of the death penalty — most bad , but some reasonable — that find it has a deterrent effect on crime .
Wolfers and John Donohue published an article in the Stanford Law Review two years ago that decimated most of the research on the subject .
Analyses of data stretching farther back in time , when there were many more executions and thus more opportunities to test the hypothesis , are far less charitable to death penalty advocates .
On top of that , as we wrote in Freakonomics , if you do back - of - the - envelope calculations , it becomes clear that no rational criminal should be deterred by the death penalty , since the punishment is too distant and too unlikely to merit much attention .
As such , economists who argue that the death penalty works are put in the uncomfortable position of having to argue that criminals are irrationally overreacting when they are deterred by it .
CFM International has successfully carried out an initial test of a CFM56 - 7B engine using an ester - type biofuel .
This marks an important step forward in reducing the amount of carbon emmissions from airline engines .
CFM56 engines are produced by CFM International ( CFM ) , a 50/50 joint company of Snecma ( SAFRAN Group ) and General Electric Company .
The biofuel used for this test is 30 percent vegetable oil methyl ester blended with 70 percent conventional Jet - A1 fuel .
This test was designed to check the operation of a jet engine using a fuel made from biomass , without making any technical changes to the engine .
With this type of biofuel , the target is a net reduction of 20 percent in carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions compared with current fuels .
“ Our goal is to support the industry in identifying replacements for traditional hydrocarbon - based fuels , including synthetic fuels that use a mixture of biofuels and jet fuel , â€ said Pierre Thouraud , Snecma Vice - president engineering .
CFM is running engine tests to develop solutions based on mixtures of jet fuel and second - generation biofuels .
For instance , it is currently focusing on the evaluation of alternative fuels made using biomass ( offering properties closer to those of jet fuel ) , which also offer better environmental performance .
Along with its parent companies , CFM International is participating in a number of emissions - focused initiatives , including the U.S. CAP ( Climate Action Partnership ) , French Calin , and European Alpha - Bird programs .
For alternative fuels to be used in the aviation industry , there are a number of major technology challenges that must be met , including energy density , thermal stability ( avoiding coking at high temperature ) , use at very low temperatures ( freezing ) or high temperatures , lubricating effect with materials used , and the availability of mass production facilities worldwide .
â€ œCFM International is satisfied with this first CFM56 engine test using a biofuel , another major step towards an ecologically friendly Jet engine economy , â€ said Eric Bachelet , president and CEO of CFM .

Not only do engine improvements save the planet , but they save airlines money as well .
Burning less fuel , means they save money .
What follows is something I posted in September of 2008 .
The US presidential campaign was building up steam and I was sick and tired of hearing ‘ Drill Baby Drill . ’
It made me ill because of the stupidity of the entire argument .
I wrote ,
Even when production is pumping at full capacity , additional offshore drilling facilities would amount to about 200,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) .
The US currently uses 21 million bpd .
This does not take into account the increase in oil consumption necessary to continue to grow our economy [ during the time it would take to get the drills up and drilling ] .
The bottom line is that additional offshore drilling will provide 1.2 % of the oil we use every day if we do n’t increase consumption and we ’re willing to wait 20 years .
So now Obama has opened up most of the east coast among other areas for oil exploration .
The Democrats are pretending to have been betrayed , the Republicans are saying he did n’t go far enough and the environmentalists are mad as hell .
The truth is that this was a beautiful political move .
President Obama gave his Democratic base ammunition for the upcoming election and took steps towards soothing the sting of those opposed to “ health care ” reform on the right .
Sure there are factions within the Democratic party who are oppose to more offshore drilling but fewer than five Democrats will actually vote against their Democratic candidates this November because the President opened up more offshore areas for oil exploration .
Instead those candidates will be able to say , “ Look , we ’re trying to become more energy independent by opening up areas previously off limits and the Republicans are n’t going along with us .
We ’re willing to try what the Republicans have been asking us for years . ”
I ’m not sure if those political bullets will hit their targets but hey , it ’s something .
The real genius of this move lies in the fact that the Republicans have been saying for ever and ever that we could solve this energy problem if those wacky environmentally conservative Democrats would just open up more offshore areas for drilling .
It ’s total bullshit of course , as you ’ll read below but they ’ve gotten away with it because average Americans do n’t know the facts .
Obama has now taken that sound bite away from them .
And as an added bonus if the Republicans do speak out against this they will be branded even more deeply as the Party of No .
I ’m guessing the environmentalists who are upset about this do n’t understand the facts .
Little if any of the oil in these new areas will ever be pumped out of the seafloor .
It ’s too costly .
We wo n’t be able to afford it .
There is no real threat to the environment here because it ’s highly unlikely that any substantial new drilling in these areas will ever take place .
This is political theater , nothing more .
Grab a bag of popcorn and be amused .
Original post from September 2008 …
I wo n’t go so far as to say I ’m against lifting the ban on drilling for oil off the east coast of the United States of America .
I say that because the only reason the idea is being bandied about is that the last two Republican presidents were oil tycoons and that party is desperate to reframe the rise in the price of gasoline as the fault of the Democrats .
Perhaps Democrats should agree to lift the ban and when the price of gas does n’t go down , Republicans will be left without that political punch to throw .
Having said that , I am not in favor of lifting the offshore drilling ban because drilling for oil off the east coast of the U.S. is stupid .
Here ’s why .
The USGS says there are 17.8 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable resources ( read Unproven Reserves ) in waters currently off limits to exploration .
The EIA says production could n’t really get started until 2017 and would n’t be fully ramped up for another 15 years until about 2030 .
Remember the U.S. uses more than 7 billion barrels a year .
Great , there might be two and a half more years worth of oil .
Even if we could start pumping at full capacity today when my daughter is 2 ½ , she ’ll be 5 when all that oil is used up .
Even when production is pumping at full capacity , additional offshore drilling facilities would amount to about 200,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) .
The US currently uses 21 million bpd .
This does not take into account the increase in oil consumption necessary to continue to grow our economy .
The bottom line is that additional offshore drilling will provide 1.2 % of the oil we use every day if we do n’t increase consumption and we ’re willing to wait 20 years .
Oh and if the oil companies do n’t sell that oil to other countries .
Remember , we currently export about 1.5 million barrels of oil from the US every day .
There is no guarantee that big oil will even keep this measly 200,000 bpd in the US .
And do n’t forget the hurricanes .
Notice I did n’t even mention the possible environmental catastrophes or the hit tourism might take if lounging at the beach starts to include a beautiful view of the flare from a drilling rig .
Offshore oil is politicians playing the blame game and that ’s all it is .
The sad part is that a majority of Americans are falling for it while their leaders , Republicans and Democrats alike , continue to refuse to act appropriately .
If you want a quick test of whether or not a politician understands energy issues ask her if she ’d like to see the cost of gasoline go down .
If she says yes , she does n’t know what the hell she ’s talking about .

Every morning for as long as she can remember , Nicky Taylor — like millions of other women — has carried out her ' getting ready ' routine .
It starts with shower gel , shampoo and conditioner ,
includes mouthwash , cleanser and a moisturiser , and ends with an array of age - reversing serums , make - up , hair gel , deodorant , toothpaste and perfume .
Exfoliating scrubs , nail varnishes and cellulite - busting creams are often thrown into the mix , too .
It is a ritual that not only sets Nicky up for the day but one she has always believed was essential to keeping her looking good and feeling well .
But over the past six weeks , Nicky , 42 , has cut this daily routine , and all the products associated with it , out of her life altogether .
Yes , for 40 days and 40 nights , there has been no showering , no hair washing , no teeth cleaning and no deodorant .
She has ditched her make - up and hair styling products , and allowed herself access to just three outfits ( her running kit , a pair of jeans and a
T - shirt , and one summer dress ) .
So what has been behind this bizarre behaviour ?
A bout of madness ?
A desire to lose all her friends ?
Nicky , a mother - of - three who lives in Kidderminster and works as a television documentary maker , claims it 's the first scientific experiment of its kind , designed to find out how she will look and feel without the aid of the avalanche of expensive modern beauty products .
She was , in effect , seeking to find out whether we are all simply wasting our money in the name of vanity .
Are all the lotions and potions that women — and millions of men — use religiously every morning merely a form of social and psychological armour , or do they have a practical physical use ?
" I 'd reached a point where I was looking in my bathroom cabinet and feeling disgusted with myself , " says Nicky .
" As a nation , we spend
£ 10.5 billion on grooming and I personally spend around £ 2,000 each year on beauty products .
I'm a sucker for any advert that claims a new cream or body wash will make me look younger or banish lines and wrinkles , and I think nothing of handing over £ 50 for the latest must - have product .
" Every night I was slathering on layer after layer of so - called miracle creams from a range of bottles and pots , and I had so much in my bathroom cabinet that something fell out and hit me on the head whenever I opened the door .
I was guilty of beauty product gluttony .
" Then , one evening earlier this year , I sat down and read the labels of everything I used and worked out I was applying more than 200 different chemicals to my body each day .
These are said to be safe , but what is not known is the effect that the ' cocktail ' of chemicals is having on our bodies . "
She adds : " With the incidence of diseases such as breast cancer on the rise , it 's difficult not to wonder if these products could partly be to blame .
Health campaigners are particularly worried about a group of chemicals called parabens , which are added to cosmetics to prevent them from degrading . "
Nicky 's approach was extreme , to say the least : surely having a good old clear - out would have sufficed ?
But no .
She says that once the seed of the idea was sown , she thought she might as well push herself to the limit .
" I always think I look absolutely terrible if I have n't washed my hair that morning , when the reality is that other people do n't really notice at all , " she says .
" The idea that we need all these products and that we have to be clean at all times is endemic in society , and I wanted to see what happened when I stopped washing altogether .
Would I lose all my friends ?
Would I stink to high heaven ?
Or would life just carry on as normal ? "
Before starting her experiment , Nicky called in scientists from the Skin Research Centre at the University of Leeds .
They took swabs from her armpits , mouth and groin to test levels of bacteria and yeasts , the results of which would be compared with identical swabs taken at the end of the six weeks .
To protect her children through the experiment , Nicky committed to wearing latex surgical gloves when preparing their food .
She then emptied her bathroom of products — which filled two black bin liners — and the experiment began .
" Usually , I start my morning with a run , then a shower and breakfast , " says Nicky , who is divorced .
" But once I started the experiment , the half hour I 'd usually spend in the bathroom became a lie - in , which initially I thought was great .
" Then I went for my run as usual and started battling with urges to shower as soon as I got back home .
It just did n't feel right to get dressed after exercising without washing . "
However , it was n't until the fourth day of not washing that Nicky began to notice a certain odour emanating from her person .
" My hair quickly became pretty unpleasant , " says Nicky .
" Normally , I 'd wash my hair every day , use a thickening conditioner , then I 'd style it with mousse and hairspray .
" Within a few days it turned into a bird 's nest and instead of allowing it to fall flatteringly around my face , I 'd taken to pulling it all back into a ponytail .
" I 'd heard that hair begins to clean itself after a few weeks , using oils which are naturally secreted by the body , but I was n't sure I 'd be able to wait that long .
I was only four days in and I felt so unpleasant all over that I wanted to quit . "
By the second week , Nicky 's experiment and the subsequent haze of body odour accompanying her was beginning to affect her children , who refused to cuddle her .
Nicky also had her first social engagement of the experiment — a work event at the Dorchester Hotel in London .
" Until that point , I 'd been working from my house in Kidderminster , so I had n't really had to see many people , " she says .
" Now , I had to show my face at an occasion where everyone else would be dolled up to the nines .
" I spent about 30 seconds pulling on my summer dress and slicking back my hair — which is the fastest I 've ever got ready for a party .
But I felt incredibly nervous as I got on the train .
I psyched myself up to expect people to move to the other end of the carriage , but that did n't happen .
No one seemed to blink an eye .
" The same thing happened at the party .
I thought everyone would turn and point and stare , but they did n't .
I 'm sure people thought I looked scruffy and wondered why I did n't have so much as a scrap of make - up on my face , but no one said anything or talked to me with any less respect .
" I was worried everyone would be edging away from me but that did n't happen .
It made me wonder whether my children were over - reacting . "
By week three , however , Nicky was beginning to see the signs of being socially ostracised , particularly by other mothers at the school gate .
" Things really were getting to a stage that I thought was utterly grim , " says Nicky .
" My hair was stuck together with grease .
My toenails were turning a strange colour and I 'd developed dry , peeling skin on my hands .
" But again , other people did n't seem to notice , not unless I told them .
I wondered if I thought I looked far worse than I actually did , and it made me consider just how obsessed we all are about the way we look and how much we agonise over little things when most of the time other people simply do n't notice .
" It was only when I made the mistake of telling the other mothers at my children 's school , who had n't seemed to mind my scruffy appearance at all until then , that things changed .
When they realised I had n't washed for three weeks , they turned up their noses and acted as though I was the most disgusting thing on the planet , even pulling their children away from me .
" It 's as though we have been so brainwashed by advertisers to think that we must use these products every day that the thought of using none at all was too much for them to bear .
After all , until that point they 'd been merrily standing next to me every day as though there was nothing out of the ordinary .
" Once all the other mums knew , I felt very embarrassed and took to walking away from the school gate instead of stopping to chat .
They all looked so glamorous and I felt like a scruff in their midst .
" I also developed bath envy — whenever I heard one of the children turn the shower on , I was filled with jealousy . "
But by the end of the fourth week , something extraordinary happened .
Nicky noticed that not only was she physically feeling better than she had done in a long time , her skin had begun to glow .
For years , she has experienced Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) , which bizarrely seemed to improve the longer she went without washing .
Although there is no medical explanation for this , Nicky is convinced it is to do with a sudden break from the chemicals seeping into her body .
At the same time , a persistent cyst on her eye disappeared —
Nicky believes because she stopped irritating it with mascara and eyeliner on a daily basis .
" I went to see Dr Val Curtis from the London School of Hygiene to seek her opinion , " says Nicky .
" She told me that while I would eventually lose my teeth if I carried on not cleaning them indefinitely , not wearing make - up could well have helped my cyst .
" She said there was no known link between the use of beauty products and the prevalence of conditions such as IBS .
But it is such a modern - day complaint and I believe it 's possible that it is somehow linked to the chemicals in all the products we use .
" Aside from that , the most extraordinary thing was that without a doubt — and despite not having washed my face for a month — my skin looked fresher and brighter than it had for a decade .
" I also felt really healthy and good about myself , at least until I came into contact with other people , at which point I felt self - conscious and embarrassed . "
However , as the experiment drew to a close , all Nicky could think about was rediscovering her old self .
" I was sick of wearing the same few items of clothing for six weeks .
My hair was so greasy that it stayed in its ponytail position even when the hair band was n't there .
And my teeth were horribly discoloured and covered in a build - up of plaque .
" By the end , I 'd virtually become a hermit because I could n't face letting anyone see me like that .
The stigma of being unwashed was just too strong for me to ignore , and overrode any sense I had of feeling healthy or looking fresh - faced .
" I cancelled going to a friend 's wedding because I could n't endure seeing anyone in the state I was in .
It would have felt like a mark of disrespect to go to a wedding without making an effort . "
But before stepping under the shower , Nicky had a second set of tests done by the team of scientists from the University of Leeds .
The results showed that although there were up to 5,000 times more bacteria in each of the areas tested , levels were surprisingly still within what are deemed to be ' normal ' parameters for a human being .
More importantly , there were no signs of any sinister bacteria such as E.coli or streptococcus , meaning Nicky 's health was not being put at risk by not washing .
The most serious outcome from her experience came when Nicky went to the dentist to have her teeth cleaned and was told she needed a filling .
It was the first she 'd ever had and came as a direct result of not brushing her teeth for six weeks .
Now enjoying long , luxurious showers every day , Nicky is reflecting on what she learned from her experience .
" I 'd never want to do anything like that again because not washing affects your friendships , family relationships and self - confidence , " she says .
" Thank goodness I work from home , otherwise it would most likely have had a detrimental effect on my career .
" But the experiment worked in that I proved to myself there is no need for all these beauty products on which I 've been frittering away so much money .
My desire for them was all in my mind , not an actual physical need .
" It showed me that for years I 've been using excessive amounts , and , at the same time , potentially putting my health at risk because of all the chemicals they contain .
" I was amazed to find that the point when my skin looked its best was after a month of not using anything at all .
As a result , I 've become far more moderate in what products I use and what I am prepared to spend money on .
" A bar of soap , organic shampoo and conditioner , and a basic moisturiser are all I need now .
I no longer wash my hair every day and I no longer feel self - conscious if I 'm not done up to the nines .
" If people did n't notice when they had me standing next to them during the experiment , I 'm sure they wo n't be aware of small things that would once have got me down , such as a bad hair day or a minor skin outbreak .
" While I would n't suggest anyone else takes things to the extreme that I did , they can rest assured that when it comes to their beauty routines , less is more . "

Poverty and Public Health
Since 2000 , Americans have been getting poorer , and national rates of severe poverty have climbed sharply , according to a study published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine .
The researchers reported that the growth in the poverty rate is due largely to a rise in severe poverty and that " moderate " poverty has grown little .
The percentage of Americans living in severe poverty - earning less than half of the poverty threshold - grew by 20 % between 2000 and 2004 , and the proportion in higher income tiers fell .
The researchers reported that the number of Americans living in severe poverty increased by 3.6 million between 2000 and 2004 .

" These trends have disturbing implications for society and public health , " said Steven H. Woolf , MD , MPH , Professor of Family Medicine , Epidemiology and Community Health , Virginia Commonwealth University , and lead author of the study .
The researchers found that the only category of Americans to increase in size were those whose earnings were at least $ 8,000 below the poverty threshold , who grew by approximately 50 % between 2000 and 2004 .
All other income tiers decreased during these years .
The poverty threshold in 2004 for a family of four was $ 19,307 .
" The rise in severe poverty is striking children the hardest , " said Woolf .
His study found that children under age 5 are twice as likely to be living in severe poverty as the rest of the population .
" In 2004 , one of three Americans with incomes less than 50 % of the poverty threshold - 5.6 million people - was a child . "
Severe poverty is also dramatically worse among African Americans and Hispanics , and minority children therefore face the greatest risk .
The researchers reported that children account for 45 % of Hispanic and African Americans living in severe poverty .
The authors discuss the broad societal implications of the increase in poverty .
Likely health consequences include a higher prevalence of chronic illnesses , more frequent and severe disease complications , and increased demands and costs for healthcare services .
Adverse effects on children carry long - term implications .
" This is not just a problem for the poor , " Woolf added .
" Except for a small class of highly affluent Americans , income for the entire U.S. population has fallen since 2000 . "
The researchers describe a " sinkhole effect , " in which " families and individuals in the middle and upper classes appear to be migrating to lower income tiers that bring them closer to the poverty threshold . "
U.S. household income , adjusted for inflation , fell by 3.6 % between 2000 and 2004 .
Woolf says that the sinkhole effect and the upsurge in poverty could deeply affect society and calls for the reexamination of policies enacted in recent years to foster economic progress .
After a couple of aborted attempts in the past , I ’m learning Haskell in earnest now .
I think it ’s because I ’m just tired of feeling stupid .
I hang around programming .
reddit.com quite a bit and Haskell is a big topic of conversation there .
In fact , I ca n’t remember the last time I visited without reading some little bit of proselytizing or some effusive post about the productivity of the language .
I ’m not knocking that ; I ’m all for it actually .
The thing is , I was tired of not really knowing what a monad was , or how to really go about programming anything substantial without side effects , and it was getting to me ; so off I went in the stray moments around Christmas vacation with my old dog-eared copy of The Haskell School of Expression .
And , like anyone who has been programming in a completely different paradigm for years , I started to try to make sense of what I was learning in terms of what I know .
For the most part , it ’s been a good ride .
It took me a little while to figure out that when a Haskeller declares an algebraic data type , the constructors are , in a sense , like the states of an object in an OO language .
In the Haskell School of Expression , Paul Hudak uses a running example of a program manipulating shapes .
He declares a Shape data type with constructors for Square , Rectangle , Circle , etc .
All the while , he starts to declare functions which operate on values constructed via each of these constructors .
In the back of my mind , of course , I was screaming what connects all of these things ?
In OO , you ’d have common shared behavior but here you have to treat each construction separately .
Eventually , when I started looking at recursive data types , it made more sense .
The other hurdle I ’ve been getting over is the Haskell approach to naming .
An example : there is a function in the standard prelude called foldr1 .
What that means , for the uninitiated , is : perform a list fold operation from the right to the left and use the last elements in the list as the basis of the fold .
Now , I do n’t know how to make a better name than that for what foldr1 does , but it ’s hard not to feel bad about it .
Names should really communicate .
Yes , in C we had names like sscanf and fprintf but , when those names were settled , compilers and linkers only cared about so many characters , right ?
From what I ’ve seen so far , this approach to naming is pretty common in Haskell .
In Simon Thompson ’s book Haskell : The Craft of Functional Programming , he starts with an example that has two functions : flipV and flipH .
They could ’ve been named flipVertical and flipHorizontal , but it seems that the Haskell way is to use abbreviations and short identifiers .
It ’s great when you already know what the function names mean , but if you do n’t you have to do a bit of hunting around to decipher code .
I ’ve been thinking a bit about why Haskellers approach naming this way , and I have a couple of ideas .
One is that Haskell came , essentially , from the computer science community .
Most Haskell tutorials and books make more than passing mention that Haskell programs are easy to reason about and can serve as launching points for proofs of correctness .
Haskell also looks a lot like math .
List comprehensions look very much like set notation .
If you have symbol y you can have distinct symbols named y’ and y’’ .
It ’s cool and mathematical ; you can almost hear the chalk on the chalkboard .
I think that culture does have a lot to do with Haskell ’s naming conventions , and I ’m sure that my own culture has a lot to do with my concern over them .
Many OO practitioners go out of their way to make clear evocative names .
When you write code that way , it reads like a story .
If I say account .deposit ( 2 ) in an OO program , or account.getBalance ( ) , I ’m stringing together nouns and verbs .
Yes , it ’s backwards , of course .
In English we put verbs before the things that they operate on , so you ’d think that in Haskell , things would be better .
We could say getTail [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , for instance , to get the tail of a list , but the naming conventions do n’t quite work that way .
If you want the tail , you say tail [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .
In this case , the function is given a noun name ; it ’s named after its result .
I first saw this “ name the function after its result ” style of naming in a textbook about functional programming years ago .
I forget which book it was .
It ’s nice , but it is n’t universal .
There ’s the case of foldr1 that I mentioned above .
The foldr1 function ’s name does n’t tell you anything about the result , really ; it tells you what operation is being performed , how it is being performed and what you should expect to give it as arguments .
Again , I do n’t see any way around this .
And , I guess we could see the “ fold ” portion of foldr1 as a noun – ( what do you get ?
You get the fold ) , but that feel like a rationalization .
The thing is , programs in Haskell appear to be fundamentally different from programs in traditional OO languages .
Haskell seems to pull you into a mode where you are using language mechanisms : lists , pattern matching , and higher - order functions to express your solution , and when you do , you get to use powerful functions that operate on those abstractions .
The only mechanism built into an OO language is method dispatch , and the bias is toward making up your own home - grown abstractions with noun-verb syntax .
The foldr1 function is all about lists ; it has nothing to do with your problem at all .
Once could argue that it should really be an operator , something resigned to punctuation - character status , but that just sidesteps the issue .
In Haskell , the fundamental parts of your program are lists , data types , and functions that operate on them .
It appears that you can move Haskell programs closer to a DSL - like style , and in fact , Paul Hudak does that in a music example in School of Expression , but the code I ’ve seen so far is n’t very DSL - ish .
I ’ve gotten this feeling that perhaps cryptic naming is an integral part of the Haskell experience .
Maybe , given Haskell 's semantics , there just are n’t enough verbs to go around .
What do I mean by that ?
Let ’s consider foldr1 one more time .
If we were trying to do something similar in OO we ’d probably place the function on the List class , would n’t we ?
List could have a foldRight function and a foldLeft function .
We could distinguish folds with starting values via overloading .
There ’s no real need to encode a distinction in the method name ; no need for a “ 1 ” .
No , I do n’t know whether it is the structure of the language or the culture , but there ’s something which has pushed the community toward abbreviations and encoded names .
I wonder if it will ever look normal to me .
And , if it does , will I be delighted or scared ?
A conventional camera captures blurred versions of scene information away from the plane of focus .
Camera systems have been proposed that allow for recording all - focus images , or for extracting depth , but to record both simultaneously has required more extensive hardware and reduced spatial resolution .
We propose a simple modi_cation to a conventional camera that allows for the simultaneous recovery of both ( a ) high resolution image information and ( b ) depth information adequate for semi-automatic extraction of a layered depth representation of the image .
Our modification is to insert a patterned occluder within the aperture of the camera lens , creating a coded aperture .
We introduce a criterion for depth discriminability which we use to design the preferred aperture pattern .
Using a statistical model of images , we can recover both depth information and an all - focus image from single photographs taken with the modified camera .
A layered depth map is then extracted , requiring user - drawn strokes to clarify layer assignments in some cases .
The resulting sharp image and layered depth map can be combined for various photographic applications , including automatic scene segmentation , post - exposure refocussing , or re-rendering of the scene from an alternate viewpoint .

I wo n’t review the film here — nyceve , among others , has already done a better job than I could .
But this film is a masterpiece — and one told from the nurses ’ point of view .
Those of us who are n’t RNs tend to think of the healthcare crisis in terms of numbers : infant mortality , deaths of uninsured , murder by insurance , record insurance industry profits , etc .
Nurses , however , are on the front lines fighting the " denial of care " industry ( alias : private insurance corporations ) and are used to seeing the tragic stories SiCKO uncovers .
That ’s why yesterday was so exciting for them .
CNN , CNBC , USA Today , AP , The Wall St. Journal were all there , doing live stand - ups , shouting out questions , finally giving the silent genocide that is our healthcare system the attention it deserves .
Already Moore has changed everything — and we need to keep that change rolling .
The day opened with a press conference with California Speaker Fabian Nunez .
Nunez is the perfect candidate to see the film : he has taken tens of thousands of dollars from the insurance corporations , and is carrying their water with bills to expand their customer base ( and customer abuse ) .
He is emblematic of weak - kneed politicians across the country who wo n’t do the right thing — and who must be forced to .
Michael Moore then went under the dome of the California Senate , and gave a rip - roaring defense of him film .
" I believe these insurance companies are an illegal racket and should be forced out of business . "
High drama .
From there Moore proceeded to rally the troops of 1,000 nurses and doctors outside , who gave him a hero ’s welcome .
Finally , a media star who uses his celebrity to make a difference !
The nurses escorted him to the film ’s screening in a sea of red scrubs , an image that appeared on the front pages of papers across California .
During the film , nurses alternated between laughing and crying , shock , horror and hope as the story of their battles was unfolded on the big screen .
There was much discussion afterwards about how to help this movie have the maximum impact .
Moore stressed that we must have a great opening week so that more theaters across the country will pick it up .
He also gave everyone blanket permission to call up local theaters , say they are close personal friends of his , and ask for help in setting up a discussion or handing out literature .
If you ’re unsure if you can talk to the audience as they leave this film in tears ready for action , use this rule of thumb : it ’s better to ask forgiveness than permission .
And of course — calling all nurses , doctors , and other healthcare professionals .
We need you to join the " Scrubs for SiCKO " campaign .
Sign up with us , we ’ll send you literature to hand out opening night June 29th .
Bring a buddy , and help solve this healthcare crisis by advocating for guaranteed healthcare on the single - payer model .

in Moscow
The march started off peacefully
GayRussia leader Nikolai Alexeyev was bundled into a police van and driven away moments after arriving outside the offices of Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov , who has called homosexuals " satanic " .
Mr Alexeyev was attempting to deliver a petition signed by more than 50 MEPs urging Mr Luzhkov to allow such events .
British veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell was punched in the face by an anti-gay rights protester .
After receiving the blow , he leaned on a lamppost and shouted : " Someone protect me , Someone protect me , " before being roughly escorted away by riot police .
His attacker was not detained .
Protection ?
The pop group Right Said Fred , in Moscow for a concert , turned up at the protest .
Band member Richard Fairbrass was hit on the nose and ran away with blood on his face .
Where are the police ?
Why are n't you protecting us ?
Marco Cappato
Italian MEP
" What we have is authoritarianism and we are moving towards totalitarianism , " said Lydia Hmelevskaya , a 24 - year - old lesbian .
" I have been beaten up on a train because of the way I look .
I have the right to look the way I want to . "
Nationalists pelted German MP Volker Beck with eggs and tomatoes before officers took him to a waiting police van .
He was driven away to a government building , then later released .
Italian MEP Marco Cappato intervened to stop a Strasbourg parliamentary aide being attacked .
" Where are the police ?
Why are n't you protecting us ? "
Mr Cappato shouted as nationalists gathered nearby , prompting officers to take the MEP away and drive him to a police station .
Rainbow banner
The demonstration began peacefully with dozens of journalists and scores of uniformed officers and Omon riot police congregating near a statue opposite Mayor Luzhkov 's offices on Tverskaya Street , one of Moscow 's busiest thoroughfares .
Orthodox extremists and nationalists arrived to speak to journalists and denounce the event .
British gay rights activist Peter Tatchell was punched in the face
Violence erupted after police detained Mr Alexeyev .
As Mr Beck was marched away , someone briefly unfurled a rainbow - coloured banner - adopted by gay rights groups as a symbol of pride .
One extremist began punching the person holding the banner .
The police broke up the scuffle but allowed the attacker to walk away .
On numerous occasions , nationalists circled gay rights activists as they spoke with journalists , then reached in to punch or kick the person being interviewed .
One journalist was attacked because he wore an earring , which led nationalists to say he was gay .
Police intervened to arrest dozens of gay rights activists and only rarely detained their attackers .
Mayor Luzhkov 's office says it banned this year 's gay pride march .
But Mr Alexeyev claims the order is invalid because the letter he received from Moscow officials refers to the wrong date - 27 May 2006 instead of 2007 .
Last year 's march was banned and also saw gay activists and supporters attacked by nationalists .
Mr Alexeyev is seeking to appeal against the 2006 ban in the European Court of Human Rights .
Do different colors affect your mood ?
In our highly visual world , color is everywhere ; in the arts , in marketing and design .
It should n't be a surprise , then , that the impact of color on people can be pretty immense .
The use of colors in everyday life can have different psychological effects .
The right color choice can make you feel less hungry , or raise your blood pressure .
That 's why color schemes are very important to companies as part of their brand personality -- McDonald 's and other fast food chains are closely linked to the color red .
At the farthest end , since color affects people 's mental health , there 's a growing trend of color therapy to help with mood .
Some of effects of color psychology are even baked into the way we talk about colors .
In color theory , we designate colors in a lot of different ways .
One of the most basic distinctions is between warm colors and cool colors .
On a color wheel , warm colors go from red-violet to yellow , and the rest are cool .
Now the colors obviously do n't have a temperature , but we associate them with different sensations .
Desert sands are red and yellow .
Shady trees are green , and cool ocean waters are blue .
These color associations are what inform our everyday culture .
Now , it 's important to note that the psychology of color is n't universal .
Different cultures associate things differently , so people 's color preferences can change a lot .
In fact , cultural differences can change the very colors we see-- usually , different exposure is responsible for differences in color perception .
For example , if someone does n't learn the different varieties of the color pink , they will actually see them as the same color , where someone else might see them as different .
Black
The color black is the color of authority and power .
Black also implies submission .
Priests wear black to signify submission to God .
Some fashion experts say a woman wearing black implies submission to men , although other would argue the opposite .
Black outfits can also be overpowering , or make the wearer seem aloof or evil .
Villains , such as Dracula , often wear black .
Separately , it is popular in fashion because it makes people appear thinner .
It is also stylish and timeless .
White
Brides wear the color white to symbolize innocence and purity .
White reflects light and is considered a summer color due .
White is popular in decorating and in fashion because it is light , neutral , and goes with everything .
However , white shows dirt and is therefore more difficult to keep clean than other colors .
Doctors and nurses wear white to imply sterility .
Red
The color red stimulates a faster heartbeat and breathing .
It is also the color of love .
Red clothing gets noticed and makes the wearer appear heavier .
Since it is an extreme color , red clothing might not help people in negotiations or confrontations .
Red cars are popular targets for thieves .
In decorating , red is usually used as an accent .
Decorators say that red furniture should be perfect since it will attract attention .
The most romantic color , pink , is more tranquilizing .
Sports teams sometimes paint the locker rooms used by opposing teams bright pink so their opponents will lose energy .
Blue
The color blue is one of the most popular colors .
It causes the opposite reaction as red .
Peaceful , tranquil blue causes the body to produce calming chemicals , so it is often used in bedrooms .
Blue colors can also be cold and depressing .
Fashion consultants recommend wearing blue to job interviews because it symbolizes loyalty .
People are more productive in blue rooms .
Studies show weightlifters are able to handle heavier weights in blue gyms .
Green
Currently the most popular decorating color , the color green symbolizes nature .
It is the easiest color on the eye and can improve vision .
It is a calming , refreshing color .
People waiting to appear on TV sit in " green rooms " to relax .
Hospitals often use green because it relaxes patients .
Brides in the Middle Ages wore green to symbolize fertility .
Dark green is masculine , conservative , and implies wealth .
However , seamstresses often refuse to use green thread on the eve of a fashion show for fear it will bring bad luck .
Yellow
Cheerful sunny yellow is an attention getter .
While it is considered an optimistic color , people lose their tempers more often in yellow rooms , and babies will cry more .
It is the most difficult color for the eye to take in , so it can be overpowering if overused .
Yellow enhances concentration , hence its use for legal pads .
It also speeds metabolism .
Purple
The color purple connotes luxury , wealth , and sophistication due to its rarity and its association with Ancient Rome .
It is also feminine and romantic .
However , because it is rare in nature , purple can appear artificial .
Brown
The color brown is abundant in nature .
Light brown implies genuineness while dark brown is similar to wood or leather .
Brown can also be sad and wistful .
Men are more apt to say brown is one of their favorite colors .
Food for Thought
While blue is one of the most popular colors it is one of the least appetizing .
Blue food is rare in nature .
Food researchers say that when humans searched for food , they learned to avoid toxic or spoiled objects , which were often blue , black , or purple .
When food dyed blue is served to study subjects , they lose appetite .
Green , brown , and red are the most popular food colors .
Red is often used in restaurant decorating schemes as a primary color or an accent color because it is an appetite stimulant .

The presidential campaign of Senator John McCain , the Arizona Republican who once seemed poised to be his party ’s nominee in 2008 , acknowledged yesterday that it was in a political and financial crisis as a drop in fund - raising forced it to dismiss dozens of workers and aides and retool its strategy on where to compete .
The campaign said the decline in contributions had left it with $ 2 million .
It said it had raised just $ 11.2 million over the last three months , despite Mr. McCain ’s promise to do better than his anemic $ 13 million showing in the first three months of the year .
Mr. McCain ’s advisers blamed his close association with the recently defeated immigration bill , which was strongly opposed by conservatives already skeptical of his ideological credentials .
But he has also had to contend with a host of other issues , including his support of the Iraq war , opposition from evangelical voters , the prospect of former Senator Fred D. Thompson ’s entry into the race , and the sense that his continuing struggles to raise money were consuming the campaign and making fund - raising even more difficult .
Mr. McCain was visiting Iraq as his aides moved to reshuffle his campaign organization a second time .
They said they would focus his efforts now on three states with early contests : Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina .

Renault F1 driver
The Spanish Grand Prix was the best race of my short Formula One career - and Renault 's most competitive this season .
So this is a good time to give you an insight into what a driver goes through during a race .
Preparation
The start
The race Fatigue Post - race PREPARATION
I have my lunch three hours before the race starts , normally around 11 am , and from then on I sip a fitness drink my trainer mixes me .
I never ask what 's in it , and it varies from race to race depending on the requirements , but there 'll be a mixture of certain things - electrolytes , carbohydrate , salts , potassium , that sort of stuff .
I put my helmet on 10 - 15 minutes before the start of the race and start to think about what might happen
As the race gets closer , I have a little bit of a physio , we do a warm - up for the neck and the upper body , and some stretching .
Then 15 minutes before I must drive out of the garage I get changed , put my race kit on , and have a quick run through with my engineers on the plan for the race .
At 1.30 pm , half an hour before the race starts , the pit lane opens .
I do a practice start at the end of the pit lane and then head off for the grid .
If I 'm not in the top 10 , we can put more fuel in to give us a better strategy and I might do a couple of reconnaissance laps to get a feel for the car .
But in Barcelona on Sunday I qualified eighth , and if you 're in the top 10 you 're not allowed to refuel , so I went as slowly as possible around the lap and coasted in to my grid position because we wanted to save as much fuel as possible to be in the best position for the race .
I get out of the car again , and head back to the motorhome to cool down a little bit , have a few more sips of the energy drink and go to the loo for the last time .
I 'm not really thinking about the race at this point , but I am getting into some kind of race mode .
Back to top THE START
I put my helmet on 10 - 15 minutes before the start of the race , get into the car and just wait for the time to count down , thinking a little bit about the start - maybe try to create a couple of different scenarios about what might happen .
You can't plan it , and you need to be open - minded because things happen fast , but you might think which cars you might be able to overtake , or which ones behind are likely to have a fast start and could be trying to pass you .
The actual driving , keeping the car on the road , is all natural , all automatic - what I 'm thinking about is where to make time
We always do a practice start when we set off on the warm - up lap .
My engineer watches the computer read - outs in the pits , and if everything is fine he tells me to keep the same settings , and if not - if there 's too much wheelspin or the revs go too low - he tells me what to change .
I warm up the tyres and brakes in the second part of the warm - up lap to get them closer to the right temperature , and then I just stop on the grid and wait for the lights .
Five lights go on one after the other , and we start when they go out .
When the first couple of lights go on , I select first gear and put the revs at the right level .
By that time , three or four lights are on and I just wait .
I 'm not nervous at all - well , maybe a little bit .
But that 's normal .
I never panic .
I 'm always well in control .
I do n't rush .
When the lights go out , I do n't really feel the adrenaline .
I just try to react to what 's happening in front of me , and if I see a gap I try to go there and make some places .
If there is some trouble , I try to avoid it .
Even if you have a near - miss , you 're not nervous .
It 's happened so many times in our careers , we are used to it .
Afterwards , you might think : " OK , that was pretty close . "
But at that moment , if someone 's coming back on to the track and he 's close to you , you 're just trying to avoid him , and if you do then just put your head down , and smile a little bit because you 've made one place .
Back to top THE RACE
After you 've got through the first corner , you get into a rhythm .
If someone is behind you , try to defend , make sure no - one overtakes you ; if someone 's holding you up , try to overtake them or push them into a mistake .
The actual driving , keeping the car on the road , is all natural , all automatic - at least for me .
Even if the race is not very eventful , there is never a moment when I am thinking about anything else - it is very important your mind does n't wander
What I 'm thinking about is not where to brake or whatever .
It 's where is this car slower than me , where is the best place to overtake .
Sometimes you get information from the engineers , asking you to try to overtake someone , or not let the guy behind you past .
We do n't talk much , but a couple of laps before the pit stop they ask me how the car is feeling .
They try to talk to me on the straight , but if it's in a corner - even a fast one - it's not a problem , even though I 'm on the limit .
It 's not a distraction at all .
I can hear them wherever I am on the circuit , but the engine is very loud so they can't hear me unless the revs are low .
So I have to wait until I 'm in a slow corner to tell them whether I want any changes made to the car in the pit stop if it 's not working for me .
Sometimes , they come on the radio with bad news .
On Sunday , after my first pit stop , they said : " OK , you 're target minus 10 laps " .
That means I had to make my next stop 10 laps earlier than planned - because we had a refuelling problem .
The problem put me out of sync with the others .
I had less fuel on board , so the car was fast , and I caught David Coulthard 's Red Bull quickly .
I had a bit of a go once , but I did n't have enough straight line speed to make the move stick , so I had to wait for the next call to come into the pits again , and hope he made a mistake .
During a race , there is no time to take a breather
You start to think about the pit stop , making sure you get the best entry into the pit lane , and maybe you can overtake him in the pits .
There is a speed limit in the pits , and as you come up to the line where it starts , you have to brake as late as possible but still make sure you are under the limit - but not too much - then press the limiter button on the steering wheel and get back up to the limit straight away .
Even if the race is not very eventful , there is never a moment when I am thinking about anything else .
Everyday life just does n't enter my head .
I am totally focused on the race .
It 's very important that your mind does n't start to wander .
I 'm sure you 'd lose lap time if you did that .
Back to top THE PHYSICAL SIDE Spain was not a particularly tough race , but some are , like Malaysia .
It 's so hot and humid , it 's uncomfortable all the time .
You get sweat pouring down into your eyes .
Sometimes you have to open your visor a little bit on the straight , or put your hand up through the bottom of your helmet , to wipe your eyes .
On Sunday , it was a good feeling after the race - I felt I had done the maximum I could
Physically you start to get tired .
You start to lose your power , and concentration is really on the limit .
But it 's important to try to put that to one side and dig deeper and deeper .
Even then , I always feel totally in control - but sometimes it takes a lot more effort to do that .
During a race , there is no time to take a breather .
But I 'm reasonably relaxed in the car all the time .
Even when I 'm really pushing , my knuckles are not white on the steering wheel , it 's just all the senses are really sharp to react in case I have a moment .
You can't be tense for an hour and a half .
Back to top POST - RACE
At the end of the race , sometimes I 'm happier than others , depending on the result .
On the slowing down lap , I might think about what was good or bad in the race , where I made a mistake .
I have to go really slowly so as not to waste fuel , because the car is weighed at the end of the race , and we run it as close to the minimum weight limit as possible .
I 'm glad to get out of the car at the end of the race - it 's a big effort to do an F1 race
I have a few words with the engineers on the radio .
They tell me the result straightaway .
The team can hear me , so I thank everybody for their hard work .
I 'm glad to get out of the car at the end of the race - it 's a big effort to do an F1 race .
Mentally you 're pretty tired , although in Spain physically I could have done another race if I 'd had to - and I did n't even have a drinks bottle in the car because it saves some weight .
We worked it out that not having it would save us four seconds over the race distance , so I decided not to bother .
But in somewhere like Malaysia , I would lose more than four seconds if I could n't drink .
Physically I would n't be able to keep it together because I 'd dehydrate too much , and if you dehydrate , no matter how well prepared physically you are , your body just can't do it .
When I get out of the car , I 'm weighed by the officials - I only lost half a kilo on Sunday when in races like Malaysia it can be up to three - then my physio is there with a drink , and there are some media to talk to .
The Renault was much more competitive in Spain I get changed - sometimes have a shower , sometimes not .
On Sunday I did n't bother because I was n't that sweaty .
And then we have to do a post - race debrief with the engineers , which can take up to an hour .
Even if it 's been a bad weekend , I go round the whole team to say thanks - even the catering and marketing people - to try to motivate them to keep pushing hard .
Then it 's back to the hotel or airport and by the next day I 'm ready to drive again On Sunday , it was a good feeling after the race .
I felt I had done the maximum I could .
I was able to do every lap 100 % and if you do that you have to be happy , even if the result could have been better .
606 : DEBATE
We only finished seventh , but without the problem in the pit stop I would have been a quite comfortable fifth and not far from Robert Kubica 's BMW .
That 's a big step forward and a bit of a surprise because at Barcelona you really need the performance of the car otherwise you 're normally going to have a tough weekend .
But the car was pretty good and the race was a bit more like it should be .
But the priority is still to get back to the front where Renault belong .

舞台
ある背徳的な森に、交尾好きの鳥たちが棲んでおりました。鳥たちは昼も夜も男も女も無く交尾に励んでおりました。あまりにも酷いので神は掟を定められました。
神は掟を守らせるために、どの組み合わせでどの鳥が生まれるのかを覚えていられるように手帳に書いておく方法を決められました。つまり、それはこんなイコールで結ばれた式です。
交尾のルール : 女 男 = 子
例えば、ニワトリ ペリカン = 鴨、と書くと、ニワトリの女とペリカンの男が交尾すると鴨が生まれるという具合です。ただ、男女の組み合わせを逆にして、ペリカンの女とニワトリの男にすると、鴨とはまた違った子が生まれるかも知れないので注意してください。
神によって好きでもない男とも交尾させられた女の鳥たちは、そんな苦しい境遇の中でも何とか愛を伝えるためにある工夫をしました。女の鳥は好きな男との交尾の後は必ず男と同じ種類の鳥を生む事にしたのです。
鳥 A が 鳥 B を好きな時 : A B = B
ここで突然ものまね鳥が登場します。
ものまね鳥とは : ものまね鳥 x = x x
x は、どんな鳥にも当てはまるという意味です。ものまね鳥の女は男と交尾すると、男の種類の子を二羽生んで死にます。例えば、「 ものまね鳥 スズメ = スズメ スズメ 」 の場合、ものまね鳥の女はスズメの男と交尾をすると、男女二匹のスズメを生みます。二羽のスズメは生まれるとすぐにまた交尾を始めますが、それはまた後でお話します。
話はそれますが、ある女の鳥は、二羽の女と同じ事をする事があって、それを結合鳥と呼びます。鳥
B が x の子を産み、その息子が 鳥 A と交尾して出来た子が、鳥 C と x の子と同じ種類だとすると、鳥 C は、A と B の結合鳥なのです 。
鳥 C が 鳥 A と 鳥 B の結合である時 : C x = A ( B x )
実は、どんな鳥同志にも結合鳥が居るそうです。例えばガチョウがスズメとニワトリの結合鳥で、そこへペリカンの男が現れるシチュエーションを想像します。
ニワトリ ペリカン = 鴨 ( ニワトリとペリカンで鴨が生まれる ) スズメ 鴨 = 白鳥 ( スズメと鴨で白鳥が生まれる ) ガチョウ ペリカン = 白鳥 ( ガチョウとペリカンで白鳥が生まれる ) つまり、ガチョウ ペリカン = スズメ ( ニワトリ ペリカン ) = 白鳥
こんな風に一羽の鳥が二代分頑張るわけです。ここでやっと問題です。
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Stuart Bowen , the U.S. special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction whose office has uncovered abuse of both Iraqi and U.S. funds , is under investigation himself , a White House spokeswoman said on Wednesday .
U.S. special inspector general for Iraq Stuart Bowen testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington February 8 , 2006 .
The hearing was held to address issues affecting the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
“ Complaints against Mr. Bowen are being looked at by the integrity committee of the PCIE ( President ’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency ) , said spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore .
She gave no details about the investigation or the nature of the complaints against Bowen , who heads the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , or SIGIR .
Bowen ’s office declined comment .
The council , created in 1992 , is comprised of presidentially appointed inspectors general and headed by Clay Johnson , the deputy director for management of the White House Office of Management and Budget .
Johnson told Reuters he had no details on the nature of the allegations against Bowen , saying only they were filed by former and current employees .
“ Right now there have been no findings , ” he said , adding the inspector general of the Social Security Administration had been appointed by the integrity committee to conduct the investigation .
“ It has been going on for a long time , ” Johnson said .
He said he chaired the council , but emphasized it was independent of the White House , and his role was very limited .
He said the integrity committee was created in 1996 to investigate any allegations involving inspectors general .
Several former SIGIR employees filed complaints about Bowen in 2006 , focusing on charges that he failed to come to work for long periods at a time , and used SIGIR staff to work on a book about the broad lessons of Iraq reconstruction , said one former SIGIR employee , who asked not to be identified .
“ It is SIGIR ’s standing policy neither to confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation , whether by SIGIR investigators or any other ( U.S. government ) agency , ” said spokeswoman Denise Burgess .
Bowen was appointed as inspector general of the Iraqi Coalition Provisional Authority in January 2004 , remaining in that role after the creation of SIGIR .
His office produces quarterly reports to Congress about Iraq reconstruction efforts .
His latest report said seven of eight rebuilding projects that costing about $ 150 million had previously been declared successes , were now in disrepair or had been abandoned .
Bowen , a lawyer who spent four years in the U.S. Air Force , previously served as deputy assistant to President George W. Bush as well as associate counsel .
Before his White House tenure , Bowen was a legal adviser to the Bush - Cheney transition team ; and from 1994 to 2000 , he held a variety of positions on Bush ’s staff in Texas , when Bush was governor .
Johnson said he had no information about a separate investigation by the council of Johnnie Frazier , the Commerce Department inspector general , which was first reported in the Washington Post on Wednesday .

Lebanon is firmly en route to becoming the third nation in the Middle East after Iraq and the Palestinian territories to experience a devastating Washington - backed war and a massive influx of new illegitimate debt to cover reconstruction expenses , anti-debt activists say .
A conference held Thursday in Stockholm for donors raised more than $ 940 million in pledges of new money to reconstruct Lebanon after 33 days of Israeli bombing of the country ’s infrastructure , bridges , roads , and factories .
More than 1,100 Lebanese people were killed in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah , a third of them children under 12 .
More than one million were forced to leave their homes .
Initial official figures estimate the first phase of reconstruction at $ 2.5 billion .
Damages include some 150 bridges and an oil spill that dumped 15,000 tons of oil into the sea and polluted 90 mi. of coastline .
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , 60,000 housing units in Lebanon were damaged or destroyed in the war , of which at least 15,000 were completely destroyed while another 15,000 sustained major damage .
Since the Aug. 14 cease - fire , the United Nations says the return of hundreds of thousands of people to their homes has been hampered by enormous quantities of unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) , especially the bomblets scattered by cluster bombs , which will place a long - term drain on the government .
Prior to the conference , the Lebanese government said at least $ 540 million were immediately needed to help the country with short - term recovery .
On Thursday , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said the damages could reach at least $ 3.5 billion for infrastructure alone .
" We have heard of preliminary estimates of $ 3.5 billion in infrastructure damage , to which one needs to add the impact of the massive displacement of the population , the exodus of many professionals , and possible private sector bankruptcies , " the IMF ’s representative at the Stockholm meetings said in a statement .
At this rate , Beirut will most certainly continue to turn to international lenders and donors for help with reconstruction for a long time .
And this , debt watchers say , will in turn plunge the country into greater debt .
World Bank figures show that Lebanon was already up to its neck in debt  some $ 22.2 billion  even before the war .
For a country of only 3.5 million people , the smallest Arab nation , it is a colossal burden .
" What was already a difficult budgetary and debt situation has been made much more precarious by the conflict .
Government debt stood at 175 percent of GDP [ gross domestic product ] at end -2005 , one of the highest ratios in the world .
The conflict has made matters much worse , " the IMF said .
The country ’s main creditors are Saudi Arabia and France .
Both have pushed for a neo -liberal set of policies in Beirut , which led to the privatization of pubic assets and , critics say , the empowerment of local elites and foreign companies at the expense of the middle classes and the poor .
The European - based Committee for the Abolition of Third World Debt ( CADTM ) notes that in 2004 , Lebanon paid out $ 4.4 billion to service its external debt and warns that new borrowing will bring further pressure from rich nations and international financial institutions like the IMF .
" This implies another increase in its debt and in new economic measures of structural adjustment which accompany it , " said Éric Toussaint and Damien Millet of CADTM in a brief assessment of the country ’s new needs .
" Therefore , the Lebanese people are going to have to pay very dearly , in the years to come , for consequences of this war inflicted by Israel in violation of international treaties governing relations between states . "
Just like Iraq in 2003 , a foreign country came in and destroyed the country ’s infrastructure , only to give foreign companies and institutions power in the subsequent reconstruction efforts , they said .
For example , the Paris Club of bilateral creditors gave Iraq a partial and conditional debt reduction in 2004 as long as it followed economic prescriptions from the IMF .
The Paris Club figures say the country ’s total debt for 2005 was $ 63.2 billion , or 183 percent of GDP .
Now Iraq is back to borrowing from multilateral lenders like the IMF and the World Bank .
The IMF alone lent Iraq $ 685 million last year .
" The Lebanese people paid the first time by giving their lives , losing their loved ones , enduring the destruction of their homes , their property , and infrastructure , " the authors said .
" They must not pay a second time by being bled dry to finance reconstruction . "
Israel has also destroyed most of the Palestinian infrastructure , consistently targeting power generation stations as well as government ministry buildings .
" Palestine , Iraq , and Lebanon must demand accountability from their aggressors , " the CADTM analysts say .
For Lebanon , they suggested that its people demand cancellation of their debts instead of allowing their government to seek more aid and new loans .
" For Lebanon , a possible solution resides in the immediate cancellation of its debt and the establishment of funds for its reconstruction , which would be fed by reparations deposited by Israel , " the authors suggested .
The United States , which backed the Israeli campaign and helps equip and finance the Israeli army , should also contribute to the fund .
" It is only then that it will be possible to say that the Lebanese people will have received justice , " they said .
In a telephone interview from Paris , Millet acknowledged that their proposal will not fly without the commitment of the Lebanese government , which as part of the local elite and ruling class , is unlikely to back a proposal that would not benefit the local businessmen .
He argued that some rich Lebanese whose wealth is held in Western banks should invest in their own country ’s bonds .
" They have no interest in [ debt ] cancellation because cancellation will give power to those who suffer from the debt [ the poor and the middle classes ] , " Millet said .
The IMF itself acknowledges that without highly concessional new financing for Lebanon , there is a real risk of the total collapse of the Lebanese economy .
The institution did not mention grants or debt cancellation .
The combination of a growing government financing need , higher world interest rates , and lower GDP growth will all certainly cause Lebanon ’s debt to spiral upward .
Every serious hacker sooner or later needs the popcount instruction .
This " population count " instruction counts the set bits in a register , and is so useful that the NSA demands that all computers they purchase implement it in hardware .
Decryption , uncompression ( decompression is something divers do :) , pattern recognition , Zobrist hashing ( generating keys in a certain Hamming distance range ) and cellular automata all profit from a " popcount " ( better to be called BC ) instruction , and the time and effort it saves is very substantial , compared to a kludge in MMX or SSE2 , where it 's done on 64 or 128 bits in parallel .
But even with hundreds of millions of transistors in current CPU 's , there is n't a single mainstream desktop CPU that implements this so - called " canonical NSA instruction " .
This reeks of a conspiracy .
The Itaniums and some less prolific CPU 's implement it ( V9 SPARC and Seymore Cray 's Cyber , both at the explicit request of the NSA - as well as Sun 's UltraSparc , the PowerPC and Dec 's Alpha 21264 , heck - even the T800 Transputer had it ) , but neither the latest Pentiums , nor the latest Opterons support it .
Conspicuously absent , in spite of a billion transistors in real estate .
It would n't be the first time that a microprocessor manufacturer ( Intel ) would implement undocumented opcodes , only to " licence " them to major - sworn to secrecy - software producers .
Those opcodes can have aliases , so that when they leak , they can be traced back to the licencee .
That way , Intel could provide Microsoft with a competitive advantage in producing Codecs and unZIPpers ( to give but an example ) , whilst Microsoft would , for Intel 's benefit , delay their 64 - bit OS for the Opteron for more than a year , to give Intel time to catch up with AMD .
Of course this is all conjecture , but it 's inspired by the historical fact that a certain CPU manufacturer has sold the specs to undocumented opcodes before , whilst we all know that Microsoft is getting convicted for illegal monopolistic practices on a regular basis .
In the past there was COCOM , which was a set of export restrictions to prevent the Cold War adversary from getting their hands on powerful CPU 's , amongst other things .
But nowadays the " enemy " is everywhere , the new enemy uses encryption and the NSA would like to keep the edge .
One of the ways to maintain an edge is to either keep certain capabilities of current CPU 's a secret , or to prevent these capabilities from being implemented in affordable mainstream PC 's altogether .
If mainstream CPU 's would have a popcount instruction , I could make a Go position evaluation function run twice as fast as it does now .
In Go , chains of stones have liberties , and when chains are merged or captured , liberties need to be re-counted .
Merging chains can be done very efficiently using bitboards ( as used in chess ) , and it would be ideal to count liberties using this much missed instruction .
At the moment I need to use a parallellized algorithm that uses MMX or SSE2 .

If you believe what you see on TV , women are inscrutable , conniving , hysterical and apt to change their minds without reason or warning .
Some women 's magazines perpetuate these stereotypes by offering advice on how to entrap men or keep them guessing .
And some of the basic differences between men and women can seem a little confusing , depending on your point of view .
So it 's not surprising that one of the most requested articles in the history of HowStuffWorks is " How Women Work . "
The irony is that from conception until the eighth week of gestation , male and female bodies are almost exactly the same .
The only difference is at the chromosomal level , deep inside the embryos ' cells .
Inside every cell of a person 's body , DNA is tightly wound into pairs of structures called chromosomes .
One pair of chromosomes determines whether the person is male or female .
Except in the case of extremely rare abnormalities , a person with two X chromosomes is female , and a person with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome is male .
For a few weeks , these chromosomes are all that differentiates male embryos from female embryos .

­ Of course , by the time embryos grow into adults , there are big differences between male and female bodies .
On average , females are shorter and smaller than males are , although females have a higher percentage of body fat .
Typically , female bodies have reproductive organs that can support a developing baby and nourish it after its birth .
Their blood pressure is lower , and their heart beats faster , even when they 're asleep [ Source : FDA ] .
Female bodies also have faster blood flow to their brains and lose less brain tissue as they age than male bodies do [ Source : Psychology Today ] .
­ And then , of course , there are hormones , which a lot of people view as a huge difference between men and women .
But every person 's body , whether it 's male or female , uses hormones to regulate and control a wide range of processes .
Hormones are the products of the endocrine system , which includes numerous glands located in various parts of the body .
For example , two well - known hormones are adrenaline , which comes from the adrenal gland , and insulin , which comes from the pancreas .
These and other hormones are vital to the lives and health of all people .
­­Sex hormones , on the other hand , work a little differently in male and female bodies .
In male bodies , the testes produce the hormone testosterone , which regulates sperm production and causes masculine secondary sex characteristics .
In female , the ovaries produce hormones like estrogen and progesterone , which regulate reproductive processes .
Male bodies convert a little testosterone into estrogen , and females ' bodies make small amounts of testosterone , so neither hormone is exclusive to one sex or the other .
A man 's testosterone levels can fluctuate throughout the day as his body regulates its production of sperm .
But a woman 's sex hormone levels fluctuate as part of her reproductive cycle , which takes about a month to complete .
During a woman 's childbearing years , the recurring changes in her hormone levels can cause symptoms like irritability and moodiness , known as premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) .
When a woman reaches perimenopause , her body slows down its production of sex hormones .
During the process , her levels of estrogen and progesterone can vary significantly , causing symptoms like hot flashes and trouble sleeping .
Sex hormones can affect a woman 's emotions and physiology throughout most of her life .
But contrary to some people 's perceptions , they 're not responsible for every facet of her behavior .
In this article , we 'll look at some other common perceptions and stereotypes about women as we examine how they work .

Public Citizen Appeals on Behalf of Gripe Web Site Operator to Protect Internet Free Speech
Court Ruling Endangers First Amendment Rights of Consumers Who Use the Internet to Complain About Companies
WASHINGTON , D.C. – A Pennsylvania resident left legally blind after lasik eye surgery should be allowed to identify his doctors on a Web site warning the public about the risks of the surgery , Public Citizen said in an appeal submitted today on his behalf in a Pennsylvania state court .
The appeal , which was filed in Pennsylvania Superior Court in Philadelphia , seeks to reverse an injunction against Dominic Morgan forbidding him from criticizing doctors Herbert Nevyas or Anita Nevyas - Wallace on any Internet Web site .
Morgan received unsuccessful lasik surgery in 1998 and created the Web site www.lasiksucks4u.com in 2002 .
After he included criticism of his doctors on the site , they threatened to sue him unless he eliminated certain statements that they claimed were defamatory .
Morgan removed all of the criticisms of the doctors while he reviewed the libel claims and decided what he could legally post .
However , when he added new material criticizing the doctors to the Web site several weeks later , along with documentary support of his claims , the doctors sued claiming that his initial removal of the criticisms to avoid suit constituted an agreement never to mention their names on the Internet .
The doctors claimed that because they had “ agreed ” not to sue Morgan if he removed the criticisms , his temporary removal of the criticisms constituted his acceptance of such an “ agreement , ” which was binding on Morgan in perpetuity .
Companies routinely threaten consumers and Internet hosting companies with libel , defamation or trademark infringement litigation in response to legitimate criticism .
With a short deadline for compliance , consumers are often pressured into removing criticism from Web sites and censoring their speech to avoid costly and time - consuming litigation .
In his correspondence with his doctors ’ lawyer , Morgan did not acknowledge that his claims were defamatory , nor did he promise to refrain from mentioning the doctors in the future .
In fact , he sent a letter reserving the right to add new information about the doctors on the site in the future .
Judge Edward J. Maier of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia ruled that Morgan ’s initial removal of references to his doctors on the original site , as well as subsequent correspondence between Morgan , his lawyer and the doctors ’ lawyer , constituted an agreement to waive Morgan ’s free speech rights concerning future criticism of his doctors .
He then enjoined Morgan from mentioning the Nevyases ’ names on www.lasiksucks4u.com or on any Internet Web site .
The appeal argues that as a matter of First Amendment law , the court ’s decision wrongly imposes a prior restraint on Morgan ’s speech that ignores the established principle that purported waivers of free speech must be found to have been clear and knowingly made and narrowly construed .
As a matter of contract law , the appeal cites the fact that Morgan said nothing that could be construed as an agreement or a waiver of his speech rights .
Not only did he say nothing about refraining from future criticism of his doctors , he expressly stated his intention and reserved his right to do just that .
“ This case typifies a common problem for consumers who use the Internet to criticize companies , ” said Paul Levy , the Public Citizen attorney who filed the appeal .
“ Consumers who receive threats from companies often react by taking down the criticisms while they evaluate their chances of defending a lawsuit .
If the temporary removal of criticisms from a Web site can be construed as an ‘ agreement ’ not to say anything about the company in the future , this will have a chilling effect on Internet free speech and consumer rights . ”
Carl Hanzelik of the law firm of Dilworth Paxson LLP in Philadelphia serves as local counsel for Morgan .
Public Citizen has a record of defending the First Amendment rights of Internet users .

* Illustration : Heads of State * Bill Gates is an improbable humanitarian .
He built a reputation as a nightmare boss at Microsoft , a totalitarian who screeched at employees he thought were stupid .
He bludgeoned competitors with his illegal monopoly .
And he 's a nerd 's nerd — someone who seems perennially uncomfortable around people and only at ease dealing with the intricacies of software code .
And that is precisely why he's now saving the world .
As you probably know , Gates is aggressively tackling third world diseases .
He has targeted not only high - profile scourges like AIDS but also maladies like malaria , diarrhea , and parasitic infections .
These latter illnesses are the really important ones to attack , because they kill millions a year and are entirely preventable .
For decades , they flew under the radar of philanthropists in the West .
So why did Gates become the first major humanitarian to take action ?
The answer lies in the psychology of numeracy — how we understand numbers .
I 've been reading the fascinating work of Paul Slovic , a psychologist who runs the social - science think tank Decision Research .
He studies a troubling paradox in human empathy :
We 'll usually race to help a single stranger in dire straits , while ignoring huge numbers of people in precisely the same plight .
We 'll donate thousands of dollars to bring a single African war orphan to the US for lifesaving surgery , but we do n't offer much money or political pressure to stop widespread genocides in Rwanda or Darfur .
You could argue that we 're simply callous , or hypocrites .
But Slovic does n't think so .
The problem is n't a moral failing :
It 's a cognitive one .
We 're very good at processing the plight of tiny groups of people but horrible at conceptualizing the suffering of large ones .
In one recent experiment , Slovic presented subjects with a picture of " Rokia , " a starving child in Mali , and asked them how much they'd be willing to give to help feed her .
Then he showed a different group photos of two Malinese children — " Rokia and Moussa . "
The group presented with two kids gave 15 percent less than those shown just one child .
In a related experiment , people were asked to donate money to help a dying child .
When a second set of subjects was asked to donate to a group of eight children dying of the same cause , the average donation was 50 percent lower .
Slovic suspects this stuff is hardwired .
Psychologists have long observed that our ability to discriminate among quantities is finely tuned when dealing with small amounts but quickly degrades as the numbers get larger .
Our ears work that way , too .
When a very quiet sound becomes slightly louder , we detect the difference right away .
But once a noise is really loud , it has to increase dramatically for it to seem " louder . "
The same holds true for our judgments of weight and , of course , less tangible quantities like money .
We 'll break the bank to save Baby Jessica , but when half of Africa is dying , we 're buying iPhones .
Which brings me back to Gates .
The guy is practically a social cripple , and at times he has seemed to lack human empathy .
But he's also a geek , and geeks are incredibly good at thinking concretely about giant numbers .
Their imagination can scale up and down the powers of 10 — mega , giga , tera , peta — because their jobs demand it .
So maybe that 's why he is able to truly understand mass disease in Africa .
We look at the huge numbers and go numb .
Gates looks at them and runs the moral algorithm : Preventable death = bad ; preventable death x 1 million people = 1 million times as bad .
We tend to think that the way to address disease and death is to have more empathy .
But maybe that 's precisely wrong .
Perhaps we should avoid leaders who " feel your pain , " because their feelings will crap out at , you know , * eight people . *
What we need are more Bill Gateses — people with Aspergian focus , with a direct sensual ability to understand what a million means .
They 've got to be able to envision every angel on the head of a pin .
Because when it comes to stopping the mass tragedies of today 's world , we 're going to need every one of them .

When nicotine binds to a neuron , how does the cell know to send the signal that announces a smoker ’s high ?
As with other questions involving good sensations , the answer appears to be sugar .
A University of Southern California study proposes a role for sugar as the hinge that opens a gate in the cell membrane and brings news of nicotine ’s arrival .
Structural biologist Raymond Stevens of The Scripps Research Institute , who was not involved in the study , called it “ a landmark accomplishment for the fields of structural biology and neuronal cell signaling . ”
Besides substance addiction , Stevens pointed to epilepsy , schizophrenia and depression as targets for improved drugs that could result from the study ’s findings .
The study provides the first detailed look at part of the mouse nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) , one in a large and important group of molecules , known as ion channel proteins , that allow signals to pass between neurons .
The results reveal an important role for the sugar molecules in such proteins .
“ Our studies fill a major gap in the field and set a new paradigm , ” said Lin Chen , associate professor of molecular and computational biology at USC .
Many existing theories , which do not consider sugar ’s role , are probably incomplete , Chen said .
The debate over how signals pass from the outside of a cell to the inside is a long - standing one .
Some researchers had suggested that when a chemical such as nicotine binds to an ion channel protein on the cell surface , the protein starts a “ conformational wave ” that propagates a signal through the protein body to the cell membrane , Chen said .
But the molecular basis of such a wave in nAChR or any other protein has not been clearly established .
Instead , the Chen group ’s study of crystal structure suggested a simple mechanical role for sugar molecules attached to the surface of the receptor .
“ They serve as the link between the neurotransmitter binding site and the membrane region where the gate is located , ” Chen said .
“ The sugar is kind of like a hinge .
It ’s pulling the door open and closed . ”
Cutting the sugar chains stopped the gate ’s operation , according to Chen , who said , “ The sugar is critical , in my opinion . ”
The researchers also found a water molecule deep in the receptor ’s core – significant because proteins normally are filled with hydrophobic ( water repellent ) matter that helps the structure hold its shape , Chen said .
The water molecule may enable the receptor to alter its shape in counterbalance to the bending hinge , said Chen , who explained , “ Think of it as a lubricant . ”
Previously studied “ homologs ” of nAChR – proteins that share its structure but not its signaling function – are entirely hydrophobic , Chen said , supporting the theory that the buried water molecule plays a functional role .
Chen called the group ’s Nature Neuroscience study “ one of the few times that you felt that you connected the dots . ”
The study also represents a tour de force of protein crystallography .
Homologs of nAChR had been studied at the atomic scale , but not the receptor itself .
The corresponding authors were Chen and Zuo-Zhong Wang , associate professor of neurobiology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC .
Cosma Dellisanti , research associate in molecular and computational biology at USC , was first author .
The other co-authors were Yun Yao of the Keck School and James Stroud of the University of California , Los Angeles .
Funding for the research came from the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the National Institutes of Health .

Harvard University 's endowment fund has graduated some of the most sought - after money managers in the hedge - fund world .

Mr ....
Microchips ?
Been there .
Software ?
Done that .

Soooo 20th century .
Now , Silicon Valley is looking to become clean and green – and it could turn into the region 's next big high - tech push .
Its new focus : so - called " clean technology " – technology that uses natural resources more efficiently or not at all , thereby reducing the environmental impact of products and cutting costs .
Most of Silicon Valley 's current emphasis is on clean energy .
Entrepreneurs here are aiming to transform solar , fuel - cell , and biofuel projects into viable industries with huge potential .
Already , the market amounts to $ 55 billion – more than the entire Internet advertising market dominated by the high - tech region 's current darling , Google .
In 10 years , the clean - energy market by one estimate could quadruple .
In the past year , for the first time , more silicon in the US has gone toward making solar panels than computer chips .
More important , venture capitalists are pouring money into clean technology , thanks to a confluence of events .
" We have an energy crisis , there 's a national security crisis , and there 's a climate - change crisis .
And as a famous economist once said , ' A crisis is a terrible thing to waste , ' " says Vinod Khosla , a top venture capitalist .
Twenty - five years ago , he cofounded Sun Microsystems .
Now , he is funding dozens of clean - tech companies , everything from Altra , a biofuels firm , to LivingHomes , a home - building company that uses eco-friendly materials and the efficiency of prefabricated construction .
" Clearly this is a very important area , and a much larger market than the Valley has traditionally dealt with , " he says .
One factor driving clean energy 's expansion are laws in nearly two dozen states that mandate that a portion of electricity come from renewable sources .
California has gone further with the passage last year of a law that caps greenhouse gas emissions .
Experts see similar federal regulation around the corner , creating an enormous demand for clean energy .
Another factor : rising hopes that clean energy can one day compete with fossil fuels .
Already , the cost gap is narrowing .
If entrepreneurs can close it , then they will be competing in an enormous market .
" The industries they are attacking are so immense .
We import tens of billions of dollars of gasoline each year , " says Ron Pernick , coauthor of the forthcoming book , " The Clean Tech Revolution . "
[ Editor 's note :
The original version had the incorrect dollar amount of gasoline imports . ]
That huge market potential is luring big players such as General Electric and Sharp into the sector .
Citigroup announced this week a $ 50 billion investment in clean tech .
British Petroleum is investing $ 400 million in biofuel research at the University of California at Berkeley .
Startups are cropping up as well .
Mr. Pernick 's market research firm , Clean Edge , now tracks 45 clean - energy companies listed on US stock exchanges .
The index is up 12 percent since February .
Just three years ago , Pernick says , it would have been impossible to find enough companies to track .
Silicon Valley is buzzing with optimism .
Venture capital funding jumped sixfold to $ 300 million from the first to the third quarter last year .
But some analysts see limits to clean tech 's potential .
" While clean technology [ companies ] will grow , and they become very important , especially here in California , they 're not going to replace the fossil - fuel based system , " says Anne Wenzel , principal economist at Econosystems , a market research firm in the Bay Area .
Fossil fuels are so efficient , and the existing infrastructure to deliver them so vast , that clean energies will remain a small percent of the overall market , she says .
Nor does she expect clean tech to surpass the current titans of the Valley .
" As far as overtaking software or biotechnology or web and search engines : no , " she adds .
" But it 's a very viable business . "
Historically , alternative energy has flourished during energy crises , only to sharply contract when fossil - fuel prices drop and stabilize .
Many in the clean - tech community argue that the days of cheap fossil fuels are over , due to their scarcity , the rapid economic rise of India and China , and the effects of global warming beginning to be felt by businesses .
Some clean - tech startups will fail , admits Mr. Khosla .
But he and others argue this boom is built on sterner stuff than the dotcom boom .
For one thing , it 's built on extremely diverse technologies , insulating the industry if one technology stumbles .
For another , it has a relatively high barrier to entry .
It takes expensive equipment , research space , and staff to get a clean - tech startup off the ground .
" You ca n't just create a company in a bedroom and a weekend like people were doing in the ' 90s , " says Seth Fearey , chief operating officer of Joint Venture : Silicon Valley Network , a market research and advocacy group in San Jose .
Clean technology " is coming out of a solid foundation – the semiconductor industry , " he adds .
" This new industry is based on an existing workforce , existing talent , existing research programs . "
This is particularly true of solar power , around which much of Silicon Valley 's clean tech is clustered .
SunPower , one of the region 's top solar companies , turned to T.J. Rodgers , founder of Cypress Semiconductor , to help apply the lessons of mass producing semiconductors to the mass production of solar panels .
Applied Materials , a major semiconductor equipment firm , is now moving into solar - panel manufacturing , too .
The adoption of mass - production efficiencies have already pushed prices down for solar panels .
The price for a watt of solar power , adjusted for inflation , went from $ 21.83 in 1980 to $ 2.70 in 2005 , according to Applied Materials .
Within five years , a SunPower spokesperson predicts , the price of solar power will rival – without any subsidies – the price of conventional power .
Installers of solar panels , like SolarCity in Foster City , Calif. , are also hammering out inefficiencies .
The company offers savings of 15 to 30 percent to neighborhoods that band together to purchase panels .
This process is a Silicon Valley hallmark , says John McClure , vice president of corporate strategy at Applied Materials .
" It takes science experiments and makes them into mass - produced products . "
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe AP Digg

Facebook TOKYO ( AP )  Japan will not apologize again for its World War II military brothels , even if the U.S. Congress passes a resolution demanding it , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told parliament Monday .
Abe , elaborating on his denial last week that women from across Asia were forced into sexual slavery in the 1930s and 1940s , said none of the testimony in hearings last month by the U.S. House of Representatives offered any solid proof of abuse .
" I must say we will not apologize even if there 's a resolution , " Abe told lawmakers in a lengthy debate , during which he also said he stood by Japan 's landmark 1993 apology on the brothels .
Historians say that up to 200,000 women — mostly from Korea and China — served in Japanese military brothels throughout Asia during the war and in the years leading up to it .
Accounts of abuse by the military — including kidnapping of women and girls for use in the brothels — have been backed up by witnesses , victims and even former Japanese soldiers .
But right - wing Japanese scholars and politicians routinely deny direct military involvement or the use of force in rounding up the women , blaming private contractors for any abuses .
Abe last week sided with the critics , saying that there was no proof that the women were coerced into prostitution .
On Monday , he elaborated , saying there was no evidence of coercion in the strict sense — such as kidnapping — but he acknowledged that brokers procuring women otherwise forced the victims to work as prostitutes .
Abe did not explain further .
The U.S. House is considering a non-binding resolution that would demand a formal acknowledgment and apology from the Japanese government for the brothels .
A House committee heard testimony last month from women who described being taking captive by Japanese authorities and repeatedly raped as so - called " comfort women . "
Abe suggested he did not consider such testimony conclusive evidence .
" There was no testimony based that had any proof , " he told lawmakers Monday .
The prime minister , who is slumping in the polls since his election in September , was accused by the opposition of endangering Japan 's international standing as a nation supporting human rights .
" Unless Japan offers an apology ... I am afraid the international community will think Japan has not learned the lesson on human rights or from the war , which Japan started , " Democratic Party lawmaker Toshio Ogawa said .
The issue also could disturb a recent rapprochement between Japan and its neighbors .
Relations with China and South Korea have been tense in recent years , in part because of disagreements over Japan 's conquest of East Asia in the 1930s and ' 40s .
Abe , however , has worked to repair relations since taking office .
His remarks last week prompted angry responses in South Korea and the Philippines .
In Seoul , the Foreign Ministry accused Abe of " glossing over the historical truth . "
The 1993 apology was made by then - Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono , but was not approved by the parliament .
It came after a Japanese journalist uncovered official defense documents showing the military had a direct hand in running the brothels , a role Tokyo until that point had denied .
Victims and their supporters have pushed unsuccessfully for official government compensation .
Japan set up a private fund for compensation in 1995 , but has refused to provide government money .
The fund will be dissolved at the end of March .
Abe 's government attempted to deflect criticism on Monday .
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said the media had not properly interpreted Abe 's remarks , and insisted that the government was eager to resolve historical issues with its neighbors in a " forward - looking " manner .

Wind turbines and Opera music , they go together like peanut butter and jelly , or so says Peter Gardiner and the good people at Glyndebourne opera company in England .
They think that there new 850 kw turbine will supply 100 % of the opera house ’s annual energy needs .
Executive chairman Gus Christie said : “ For the sake of future generations and for the sake of the beautiful Downs , we have to do something , we can do something , and I think this will send a very positive message to people who visit and people who live around the area . ” ( via )
The project was not without its detractors , who claimed it would change the natural beauty of the local environment .
Lewes planning officers had recommended the application be turned down , believing it would “ cause serious harm to the natural beauty , character and tranquillity of the Sussex Downs and the proposed South Downs National Park ” .
This raises some interesting questions .
Just about anyone you ask will tell you that they like the natural world to look as , well , natural as possible .
However this flies in the face of the facts of our lives .
We build houses , lay down roads , put up electrical lines , dig mines , damn rivers , cut down forests , plant crops , and a whole host of other activities that change the way the natural world works .
In fact one could make an argument that for the last couple hundred years we have been engaging in a giant world sized experiment in changing the very climate we live in .
We might not have realized that we were doing it , but all that coal , oil and gas that we have been burning has been doing some interesting things to the planet .
From the point of view of say a bacteria , this is no problem , they will keep adapting , keep changing , a cold earth , a hot earth , they do n’t care .
For something a little bigger and more complicated , something that breeds slowly and might have a hard time adapting to rapid change , humans maybe , this experiment could be a big deal indeed .
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with a warmer earth , unless of course your survival depends on the climate we have now .
In that case you might be a bit miffed if say your crops die in a massive drought and your house is swallow up by the ocean
If you want to slap some solar panels on your home , should the local home owners association be able to tell you no ?
Is preserving the look and feel of your home more important than saving the species ?
What if someone wants to put up a wind farm 5 miles off the shore of cape cod , should we let a couple people worried about the view keep us from harnessing clean renewable power ?
The point I am making ( I knew I had one ) , was that for too long we have been too willing to accept the status quo .
We will gladly allow a nasty coal , oil or gas power plant to spew dangerous greenhouse gas emissions into the air day and night .
Emissions that will lead to the destruction of thousands of coastal communities , the killing of uncountable plants and animals , and that might lead to the destruction of our culture .
Yet we throw a fit when someone wants to put up a wind turbine , because we think it is going to alter the view .
NOT putting up the turbine is going to alter the view far more than putting up the turbine .
At a certain point it becomes folly to put up with this sort of attitude .
If the boat is sinking you do n’t fuss about what you hair looks like , you jump into the damn life raft and hope for the best .

See , it was n’t government incompetence that caused the bridge to collapse in Minneapolis .
According to the beyond whacko
Phelps clan , Minnesota is too gay friendly :
The Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka , Kan. , plans to stage protests at funerals of victims of the 35W bridge collapse to state that God made the bridge fall because he hates America , and especially Minnesota , because of its tolerance of homosexuality .
The church and its pastor , the Rev. Fred Phelps , have become notorious over recent years for their claim that the attack of 9/11 was an act of God ’s vengeance and their determination to make that case at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who died in Iraq .
Oh , Fred and his family were notorious way , way before that .
But , you know , at least Fred is clear about his hatred of gays .
Cause you have to wonder what the agenda is for the other homophobes — who also hate gays , btw .
Hat tip , Dave B .
Last night I was flying home on Southwest Airlines .
As so often is the case on a Southwest flight , the steward made a humorous announcement .
He advised that , in the event of an emergency requiring oxygen , if you have more than one child , first place the oxygen mask on the child least likely to place you in a nursing home .
As I listened , I thought of Jim B .
Jim B. was my father - in - law ’s roommate during his one - month nursing home stay .
Fortunately for my father - in - law , his condition improved and he was able to leave the home and join his wife in an assisted living apartment .
Although my father - in - law ’s situation had a happy ending , it is an unfortunate truth that for many , a nursing home stay is a life sentence .
What is also true is that many of these individuals are limited physically but have almost full mental capacity .
Such is the case for Jim B .
There is little privacy for the residents of this nursing home .
Their living space is n’t much more than a cubicle .
There is little in the way of activities .
Most lie in bed and watch television .
Some of the residents of the home are there because of strokes or heart attacks , yet the menu consists of meat at almost very meal .
Vegetables and fruits are mostly canned .
This is institutional food at its worse .
On the door of the room shared by my father - in - law and Jim B. was a preprinted sign with Jim B ’s named filled - in .
It read “ Happy Birthday , Jim B ” .
There was nothing personalized about the message .
Other than a pre-printed signature “ from the staff ” the poster was not signed .
To say this home is an unpleasant place is an understatement .
To say that nobody would choose to end their life in this place is an understatement .
To say that many families make heartbreaking choices is an understatement .
I am not critical of any choice a family may make .
But I do know this :
The incentives that the federal government provides has the effect of institutionalizing some of our senior and disabled citizens who could function at home and whose families would rather that they be at home .
Medicaid programs that cover individuals with low incomes or disabilities automatically pay for nursing homes .
It ’s up to individual states to decide how much they will pay for in - home services .
According to the Wall Street Journal , few states fund the level of skilled care that many would need .
This relative scarcity of funding is also true for assisted living situations .
The irony is that assisted living or home care would cost the taxpayers less than a nursing home .
The Wall Street Journal reports that the state of Georgia , for example , spends about $ 81,000 a year for each resident in institutional care , including nursing homes .
By comparison , home and community care costs about $ 26,000 a year .
Government funding creates perverse incentives .
For this problem , I have no ready answer .
I would be the last to argue for a new entitlement program .
Yet clearly there is something wrong in this bias towards institutionalized care .
Although there are many who seek other choices , on balance this bias towards institutionalized care seems to grow .
For example , many support a new entitlement of universal pre-school and day care for children .
Many others support further expansion of government provision of health care services .
I find this bias troubling and puzzling .
We all have had enough experience with the low level of services provided by unaccountable institutions and bureaucracies .
In spite of our experience , somehow we believe that the new program we advocate will be done better and more efficiently .
Until this societal belief changes , the programs politicians advocate will not change .

If you installed WordPress more than two times , you know the drill .
Download the latest version , unzip or untar , copy config - sample .
php into config.php , edit config.php , upload files to your web host , visit new WordPress URL , click “ Next Step ” a couple of times , while submitting blog name and administrator ’s email .
After all is done , login with username “ admin ” and provided random password , go to Options menu , and set things the way you want them to be .
Then upload and activate chosen plugins , and then switch theme to something you ’ve spent some time searching for or designing .
Overall , the process is very simple and straight forward .
And there are rumors that it will be even simpler in upcoming versions of WordPress .
It ’s all nice and good .
But there is something that only you can make better .
If you installed WordPress more than two times , and by now we know you did , chances are you have a certain way of configuring things .
You probably use the same administrator ’s email .
Or want to use a pre-defined password , not a randomly generated one , because you seriously can’t remember random passwords for those 20 test WordPress installations just on your laptop .
Now , going through Options , setting things the same every time is boring .
There are , of course , better ways .
In this post we ’ll see how to automate this task with a plugin .
In one of the near future posts we ’ll see how to do even better with a custom install .
php file .
To get a few ideas for a starting point , let ’s look at what WordPress does itself .
It uses some defaults for sure , as there are many things that we do n’t need to change when we login for the first time .
Yes , those are called reasonable defaults , and WordPress has them specified somewhere .
Let ’s look .
I ’ll save you some source code digging and tell you where the yummy stuff is .
SQL scheme and default options are in wp - admin / upgrade - scheme .php file , and some initial records , like first post , first page , first comment , and default blogroll are done from wp- admin/ upgrade - functions .php .
So , now that we know what WordPress sets for it ’s defaults , we have an idea of what we want to change .
Let ’s pick something simple , just for the sake of the example .
Say , I want to use 20 items in RSS by default , not 10 .
And I want to disable smilies , because most of my WordPress installations are for corporate clients with very little sense of humor .
The options I am therefor interested in are ‘ posts_per_rss ‘ and ‘ use_smilies ‘ .
I want to set 20 for the first one , and 0 for the second one .
It ’s time to write my plugin .
Here is the first version , as small and simple as I cared to make it :
I save this code into local_settings .
php file and upload it to wp - content / plugins / folder .
Now I can see a new plugin entry in the Plugins management .
Before I activate my plugin , I want to see the old values .
I check the Options ->Reading screen and see that Syndicated Feeds ->
Show the most entries is set to 10 , as in all WordPress installations by default .
I also make a test post with a smily in it and check that the smily image in fact appears on my new WordPress front page .
And just to be absolutely sure , I look through all options quickly for the values that I ’m interested in .
Everything is right – default WordPress stuff .
Now I Activate my plugin and rush back to Options -> Reading to see the changes .
Hooray !
The number of items in my RSS feed is set to 20 now .
Reload the front page , and I do n’t see the smily anymore .
It ’s pure ASCII stuff – columns and brackets .
Quick list of options confirmed that the default WordPress values are now in fact my default values .
A quick beer to celebrate the victory and and a new skill in my toolbox .
But wait .. what ’s that ?
Hold on !
Oh , no !
It seems that I ca n’t change my default values to anything else now …
I do want to have my own defaults , yes .
But I want to be able to change them on those sites that need changes .
Like with WordPress values – I can change all the defaults I want .
Now , whenever I change the number of RSS items in Options -> Reading screen and save a new value , it seems to have no effect .
My default of 20 items comes back no matter what I do .
The good thing is that I just started my celebrations , and my mind is still sober .
I am quickly enlightened to the fact that those two lines in my plugin are executed on every WordPress page load .
I specified no conditions at all .
It ’s time for the second version of my plugin .
This time , I want those lines to execute only once , when my plugin is activated .
How do I tell WordPress to execute those lines at specific moment in time ?
I need a hook .
A quick look at Plugin API and WordPress Hooks sorts me out .
It turns out , I am looking for register_activation_hook ( ) function .
So , here is the second version of my plugin :
What ’s happening here ?
Nothing much .
I put all my options in a function .
And then I told WordPress to call this function every time a plugin in the current file is activated .
A test is in order .
I go to my Plugins management and disable the old version .
Now I go to Options -> Reading and change my default value back to WordPress default value of 10 .
Save it and make sure that it works .
It does ( because my super plugin is disabled and does not interfere with the balance of nature ) .
Now I upload the new version of my plugin , go back to Plugins screen and Activate it .
A quick check with Options -> Reading confirms that the value of RSS feeds was set to my default of 20 .
And I can change it now too .
The smily test is also passed and I ’m smiling too over a new bottle of beer .
While I enjoy my pint , I have a couple of small ideas on how to improve my plugin .
First of all , I want to set default WordPress values back when my plugin is deactivated .
This seems like a proper line of behavior .
So , here is the third version of my plugin , which adds this important functionality :
For any action there is a reaction .
For any activation there is a deactivation .
I do n’t even have to dig through the documentation anymore .
I ’m assuming some things exist , and they in fact do .
This is one of the reasons I love WordPress so much .
Another round of tests shows that everything works OK .
I ’m proud enough to show this little thing to one of my co-workers , who immediately spots the problem .
You see , this is why you should stick to open source code as much as possible , and show your code to as many people as possible .
It ’s just so much easier to make your code better this way .
The problem my co-worker noticed is with going back to WordPress defaults .
It is true , WordPress sets those values that I use as initial defaults .
But those values are n’t necessarily the same when my plugin is activated .
So , instead of going back to initial WordPress values , I should return to values which were set before my plugin was activated .
To do so , I have to save those values before I overwrite them .
Here comes the fourth version ( and final for now ) of my plugin :
Whoa !
It ’s a long one !
But I ’m just building on the previous versions here .
I get the values of the options before I overwrite them with mine .
I save them into two other options ( ‘ orig_posts_per_rss ‘ and ‘ orig_use_smilies ‘ ) .
When my plugin is deactivated , I revert the changes .
And , being a good WordPress citizen that I am , I delete the unused options .
While testing the plugin , the quick access to WordPress options tip comes handy .
When my plugin is activated , I can see the extra options in the list of all options , although there is no direct user interface to edit those options .
When my plugin is deactivated , I can make sure that the unused options are deleted .
Here , you have it .
A quick and easy way to customize WordPress installations without doing lots of boring manual work and without modifying any internals .
Next time we ’ll see a totally different approach to this problem – a customized install .
php file .
If you are in a hurry , you can find all about it yourself .
I gave you all the hints already .
Matthews : Rove may be compelled to testify after resignation David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday August 13 , 2007
Print This Email This MSNBC host Chris Matthews predicted Congressional Democrats will " have a better chance " of compelling Karl Rove to testify on his role in the firing of nine US Attorneys now that he is resigning from the White House .
" You have to wonder about his exposure now because he 's used executive privilege to protect himself from Pat Leahy on the Judiciary Committee , and Congressman Henry Waxman , both hot to trot to get him in a witness chair , " Matthews said on NBC's Today Show Monday after news broke that Rove was resigning as the president 's top political adviser .
" He 's exposed now , it seems to me on the leak case .
In terms of the eight US Attorneys who were fired , I think he 's also exposed there not having the White House position any more . "
NBC White House correspondent David Gregory , filling in as a Today Show co-host , asked Matthews whether Democrats would have a better chance of getting Rove to comply with subpoenas demanding his testimony .
" You gotta bet they 're gonna try , " Matthews said .
" And you gotta bet they 're gonna have a better chance now with the courts . "
A Judiciary Committee spokeswoman told RAW STORY that Leahy , the committee 's chairman , would address Rove 's resignation later Monday .
Matthews said Rove has long been a target of Democrats , who believe he is behind numerous scandals in recent years .
" This guy is the democrats ' Moby Dick . ...
They believe he got a guy elected to the presidency who did n't have the brains to get there on his own , " Matthews said .
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on August 13 .
There 's much more than meets the eye to how we perceive light , researchers have learned in recent years .
The latest revelation : blue light helps fend off drowsiness in the middle of the night .
A small study of 16 volunteers found that exposure to short - wavelength light , or blue light , perked them up immediately .
" Light exposure to this system , particularly blue light , directly reduces sleepiness , ” said Steven Lockley of the Brigham and Women 's Hospital .
“ Subjects exposed to blue light were able to sustain a high level of alertness during the night when people usually feel most sleepy , and these results suggest that light may be a powerful countermeasure for the negative effects of fatigue for people who work at night . "
The study , sponsored by National Space Biomedical Research Institute , is detailed in the Feb. 1 issue of the journal Sleep .
" The effects lasted as long as the blue light was on , which was 6.5 hours , " Lockley told LiveScience .
" I expect it would last at least for a few hours more if we extended the light exposure for longer although not ad infinitum .
We hope to do studies with longer exposures shortly . "
The work adds to other evidence that the human eye sees things we 're not consciously aware of .
Other research has shown that the eye 's hidden perceptive abilities help control our 24 - hour internal clock , so we know when to sleep and when to wake .
" These findings add to the body of evidence that illustrates that there is a novel photoreceptor system that exists in the human eye in addition to that used for sight , " Lockley said .
Eventually the finding could lead to ways to improve alertness in nighttime drivers , shift workers , pilots or astronauts , said Lockley , who is also an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School .
More work needs to be done , however .
Blue light in the wrong doses can be dangerous to the eye .
By Vera Frankl
Jensen is currently pursuing an appeal against his sentence
As part of a three - part series , Vera Frankl examines the fate of some of the young people locked up for life in the US state of Colorado .
Over 40 of the children currently behind bars in Colorado have no hope of ever being released .
They were sentenced , while still under 18 , to life without parole - in violation of international human rights law .
" After we got convicted , I guess I was still in shock , " says Erik Jensen , who is one of these .
" But once the initial flurry is over , it 's just despair .
You feel like anything I do is for nothing . "
Law changes
When Jensen was 17 , he helped a friend of his to cover up the murder of his own mother .
Jones 's family say he has changed massively in prison
" Once the prosecutor says that child is going to be filed on as an adult , that 's the end of the story .
Once that happens , no judge can stop it , no legislator can stop it , it just goes , " said Jensen 's father Curt .
" And the rest of society does n't realise that we 've changed the laws in this country , so that there is no other country that matches it in terms of what we do to our juveniles .
None . Zero .
In the world . "
Thirty years ago , it was almost unheard of for children under 18 in the US to be tried and sentenced as adults .
But that changed after an upsurge in teenage violence across the country in the 1980s .
More than 40 states adopted laws which made it easier to try children as adults .
Tougher penalties were also introduced , which often included mandatory sentences for certain crimes .
Mandatory sentence
In Colorado , this has meant children as young as 14 have been jailed for life .
Some have been sent to Limon prison , 70 miles east of Denver , which has a reputation as one of the toughest jails in the state , the scene of riots , rapes and murders .
It 's easy for people to say ' you 're being very harsh ' , but I have to sit down with the victim 's family and say , ' I know that your child 's dead , but this guy 's going to be out on the street in five years '
Dave Thomas , Colorado District Attorneys Council
As with the Jensen case , the local district attorney chose to try Jones not as a juvenile , but as an adult .
Although the jury accepted that the killing was accidental , Jones was found guilty on charges that , in Colorado , carry a mandatory sentence of life without possibility of parole .
" The attorney general kept arguing , ' this is a tragic case , but the law 's the law ' , " said his father John .
" There 's a problem with the law .
If nobody cares that it 's tragic on both sides , if nobody cares what really happens , these laws just do n't make any sense . "
Once a child is charged with a crime , the district attorney or prosecutor usually has just 72 hours to decide whether that child should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult .
And many in Colorado argue there is nothing wrong with that .
Among them is Dave Thomas , head of the Colorado District Attorneys Council .
He said his " underlying belief " is that the prosecutors use good judgement when they look at these cases .
" Yes , there is a huge difference between treating them as a juvenile and treating them as an adult .
" I think you have to believe that a public official will make good choices . "
Second chance
But Mary Ellen Johnson , director of the Pendulum Foundation - which lobbies on behalf of juvenile criminals - says she does not believe it should be down to a district attorney to decide a child 's fate , as they are political figures .
" Other states give kids a second chance , " she said .
" The difference between those other states and Colorado is that they go before a judge , and the judge says ' you 're rehabilitatable , I 'm going to stick you in the juvenile system . '
" In Colorado , the district attorney makes the choice .
It 's up to the district attorney who 's voted in by the people ­ it's a political office and so it's a slam dunk for a district attorney .
He 'll try these kids as an adult . "
But Dave Thomas argues that it is precisely this that makes the system work .
" There is that public pressure , that 's why they are elected , that 's why they 're in a position to make decisions , " he said .
" They are the voice of the people , and so they need to be sensitive about how the public feels about crime and what should happen to crime .
" It 's easy for people to say ' you 're being very harsh . '
But when I have to sit down with the victim 's family and say , ' I know that your child 's dead , but this guy 's going to be out on the street in five years ' - that 's very difficult . "
Col Wilkerson has been critical of Mr Cheney in the past
Col Lawrence Wilkerson accused Mr Cheney of ignoring a decision by President Bush on the treatment of prisoners in the war on terror .
Asked by the BBC's Today if Mr Cheney could be accused of war crimes , he said : " It 's an interesting question . "
" Certainly it is a domestic crime to advocate terror , " he added .
" And I would suspect , for whatever it 's worth , it 's an international crime as well . "
I look at the relationship between Mr Cheney and Mr Rumsfeld as being one that produced these two failures in particular , and I see that the president is not holding either of them accountable ... so I have to lay some blame at his feet too
Col Wilkerson
Wilkerson interview text
This is an extraordinary attack by a man who until earlier in the year was Mr Cheney 's colleague in the senior reaches of the Bush team , the BBC 's Justin Webb in Washington says .
Col Wilkerson has in the past accused the vice - president of responsibility for the conditions which led to the abuse of prisoners .
But this time he has gone much further , appearing to suggest Mr Cheney should face war crimes charges , our correspondent adds .
Intelligence questions
He said that there were two sides of the debate within the Bush administration over the treatment of prisoners .
Mr Powell and more dovish members had argued for sticking to the Geneva conventions , which prohibit the torture of detainees .
Dick Cheney has been accused of advocating the use of terror
Meanwhile , the other side " essentially wanted to do away with all restrictions " .
Mr Bush agreed a compromise , that " Geneva would in fact govern all but al - Qaeda and al - Qaeda look - alike detainees " .
" What I 'm saying is that , under the vice - president 's protection , the secretary of defence [ Donald Rumsfeld ] moved out to do what they wanted in the first place , even though the president had made a decision that was clearly a compromise , " Col Wilkerson said .
He said that he laid the blame on the issue of prisoner abuse and post - war planning for Iraq " pretty fairly and squarely " at Mr Cheney 's feet .
" I look at the relationship between Mr Cheney and Mr Rumsfeld as being one that produced these two failures in particular , and I see that the president is not holding either of them accountable ... so I have to lay some blame at his feet too , " he went on .
In the BBC interview , Col Wilkerson also developed his views on whether or not pre-war intelligence was deliberately misused by the White House .
He said that he had previously thought only honest mistakes were made .
But recent revelations about doubts in the intelligence community that appear to have been suppressed in the run-up to the war have made him question this view .
World 's Largest Cargo Ship
Get a load of this ship !
15,000 containers and a 207 ' beam !
And look at the crew size ( 13 ) for a ship longer than US aircraft carriers , which have complements of 5,000 men and officers .
Think it 's big enough ?
Notice that 207 ' beam means it was NOT designed for the Panama or Suez canal .
It is strictly transpacific .
Check out the " cruise speed " .
31 mph means the goods arrive four days before the typical container ship traveling at 18 to 20 mph on a China - to - California run .
So this behemoth is hugely competitive when carrying perishable goods .
This ship was built in three , perhaps as many as five sections .
The sections floated together and then welded .
It is named Emma Maersk .
The command bridge is higher than a ten story building and has eleven rigs that can operate simultaneously .
Additional info :Country of origin - DenmarkLength - 1,302 ftWidth - 207 ftNet cargo - 123,200 tonsEngine - 14 in - line cylinders diesel engine ( 110,000 BHP ) Cruise Speed - 31 mi/hCargo capacity - 15,000 TEU ( 1 TEU = 20 ft3 container ) Crew - 13 people
First Trip - Sept. 08 , 2006 Construction cost - US $ 145,000,000 +
The silicone paint applied to the ship 's bottom reduces water resistance and saves 317,000 gallons of diesel per year
Labels : amazing
The best part is how this thing is just 14 cylinders .
Yeah , right !
When cylinders get that big , they should n't be allowed to call them cylinders .
They should be called something else , such as maybe " Luxembourgs " or " Oprah Winfreys " . -- 14 Cylinders is actually close to maximum for a marine Diesel .
Plenty of normal cargo ships have only 6 cylinders .
But the cylinders are quite big , 3ft bore and 8 ft stroke .
Check it out here : http://people.bath.ac.uk/ccsshb/12cyl/Here: http://www.metacafe.com/watch/265696/emma_maersk/ is video of it going through the Suez canal .
So not only transpacific .
One of the early voyages was China to UK , using the Suez canal for the second time .
Seagal Blames FBI for Floundering Career Former action star wants apology for implicating him in a nefarious plot .
Aug. 17 , 2007  --
Movie buffs might assume that '90s action star Steven Seagal 's career took a nosedive due to changing audience tastes , the emergence of younger muscle - bound actors or that his acting was less than Oscar - worthy .
Well , you could be mistaken .
According to Seagal , it 's the FBI 's fault that he now stars in low - budget movies that go straight to video .
And he wants an apology from the bureau .
The 56 - year - old pony - tailed martial - arts expert broke a long silence today to complain that his career was devastated by an FBI affidavit in 2002 that described allegations that he was involved in a plot to intimidate two journalists out of writing stories about him .
" False FBI accusations fueled thousands of articles saying that I terrorize journalists and associate with the mafia , " Seagal told the Los Angeles Times .
" These kinds of inflammatory allegations scare studio heads and independent producers - – and kill careers . "
According to allegations detailed in the affidavit and a subsequent affidavit , Seagal hired infamous private eye Anthony Pellicano to frighten Times reporter Anita Busch and Vanity Fair writer Ned Zeman .
In 2002 , someone shot a bullet through the windshield of Busch 's car and left a dead fish with a rose in its mouth and a sign reading " Stop " on top of the vehicle .
Zeman said an unidentified man pointed a semiautomatic pistol at his head and said , " Stop ! " before pulling the trigger .
Luckily for him , there was no bullet in the chamber .
Seagal was never charged in the case and the investigation quickly changed course , focusing on Pellicano , who now sits in federal jail awaiting trial on wiretapping and other charges .
But the actor has still not been publicly cleared by the FBI .
" We have received no apology from the FBI or Department of Justice , " Seagal lawyer Jan L. Handzlik tells ABCNEWS.com .
" In fact , Steven was left hanging for several years while story was reprinted over and over again .
And the damage to Steven 's career was substantial even though these allegations are not true . "
Seagal 's action movies peaked at the box office in the mid-1990s and his last hit was " Exit Wounds " in 2001 .
More recently , he was cast as " Cock Puncher " in the " Untitled Onion Movie , " the much - delayed film from the creators of the satirical newspaper .
Handzlik also claimed that Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel A. Saunders , a lead prosecutor in the case , turned down several offers Handzlik made in late 2002 and early 2003 to have Seagal come in for questioning .
Seagal claims that prosecutors and the FBI did n't accept the offer because they knew the allegations were false .
" The FBI did n't want to know , " he told the Times .
" It would 've been very easy to prove if Pellicano was calling me or if I was calling him .
The FBI subpoenas phone records every day .
Why not mine ? "
Handzlik claims that Seagal has n't talked to Pellicano in over 14 years since the actor hired the private eye for a " routine job . "
Seagal reportedly was n't happy with the detective 's work on the job or his fee .
And another of Seagal 's lawyers , Carmen A. Trutanich , claims he arranged for the actor to take a polygraph on Sept. 27 , 2004 , to prove he was telling the truth .
" According to the polygraph , there was no deception involved , " said Trutanich .
A spokesperson for the FBI did n't return calls seeking comment .
No one would have believed me if I had said five years ago that Microsoft would have a page on its
Web site called “ Open Source at Microsoft
In the beginning , there were forking servers and then came threaded servers .
Although they manage a few concurrent connections well , when network sessions reach into the hundreds or even thousands , forking and threading servers spawn too many separate , resource - consuming processes to be efficient .
Today , there is a better way , asynchronous servers .
A new breed of frameworks for third - generation languages is taming the once complex world of event - driven programming .
A rising star in the Python community has been Twisted , which makes asynchronous programming simple and elegant while providing a massive library of event - driven utility classes .
In this article , I discuss asynchronous event - driven programming and how it 's done in Twisted .
Because reading about code only gets you so far , I cite examples from a real Twisted application developed for this article : a simple proxy server that blocks unwanted cookies , images and connections .
Instructions on how to get the complete source code are in the on-line Resources .
What Is Twisted ?
The Twisted Project has been gaining popularity as a powerful and increasingly stable way of implementing networked applications .
At its core , Twisted is an asynchronous networking framework .
But unlike other such frameworks , Twisted boasts a rich set of integrated libraries for handling common protocols and programming tasks , such as user authentication and even remote object brokering .
One of the philosophies behind Twisted is breaking down traditional separations among toolkits , as the same server that serves Web content could resolve DNS lookups .
Although the package itself is quite large , applications need not import all the components of Twisted , so run-time overhead is kept to a minimum .
As with Python , Twisted 's user base has been expanding from its academic roots to the commercial and government sectors .
At Zoto , we 're using Twisted in a distributed photo storage and management application , because it enables us to develop scalable network software quickly in a famously productive language , Python .
Programming day to day , I appreciate Twisted for its impressive toolkit and supportive community .
And as with all community - oriented open - source projects , Twisted is a safe business bet , because its existence does n't hinge on the continued support of any single company or institution .
What Is Asynchronous Programming ?
Have you ever been standing in the express lane of a grocery store , buying a single bottle of water , only to have the customer in front of you challenge the price of an item , causing you and everyone behind you to wait five minutes for the price to be verified ?
Plenty of explanations of asynchronous programming exist , but I think the best way to understand its benefits is to wait in line with an idle cashier .
If the cashier were asynchronous , he or she would put the person in front of you on hold and conduct your transaction while waiting for the price check .
Unfortunately , cashiers are seldom asynchronous .
In the world of software , however , event - driven servers make the best use of available resources , because there are no threads holding up valuable memory waiting for traffic on a socket .
Following the grocery store metaphor , a threaded server solves the problem of long lines by adding more cashiers , while an asynchronous model lets each cashier help more than one customer at a time .
This is n't to say there are n't benefits to a threaded model .
For instance , with microthreads , the amount of resources used by any particular thread is reduced substantially .
There 's an inherent complexity in asynchronous programming , especially when you need to do many blocking operations in succession .
In Python , however , the benefits of threading are diminished by Python 's Global Interpreter Lock ( GIL ) .
Threaded programming in Python is refreshingly simple , because all internal Python operations are thread - safe .
To add an item to a list or set a dictionary key , no locks are required , so as to avoid race conditions among threads .
Unfortunately , this is implemented through an interpreter - wide lock that Python 's interpreter uses liberally .
So , although two threads safely can append to the same list at the same time , if they 're appending to two different lists , the same lock is used .
Because threaded Python applications suffer a resulting performance hit , asynchronous single - thread programming is all the more desirable for a language such as Python .
Accepting Connections and Sending Responses
Let 's start with a simple example of a server that accepts connections on port 1100 .
For each connection , it sends the UNIX time and closes the socket .
Listing 1 .
This simple Twisted server sends the time and then closes the socket .
import time from twisted .
internet import protocol , reactor class TimeProtocol ( protocol .
Protocol ) : def connectionMade ( self ) : self.transport.write (

Addressing the complexity of handling multiple sessions with one thread is at the core of a framework such as Twisted .
Network sessions are represented by subclasses of the twisted.internet.protocol .Protocol class , such that each Protocol instance represents a network session .
These objects are spawned by Factory objects , which inherit from twisted.internet.protocol .
Factory .
A singleton , twisted .
internet.reactor , handles the dirty work of polling sockets and invoking events .
Calling reactor.run ( ) in Twisted simply starts the event loop , and run ( ) exits when the application finishes , the same as an event loop in GTK or Qt .
The Proxy Server Example
Our proxy server has two kinds of networked chat sessions : incoming HTTP requests and their respective outgoing proxies .
Because HTTP is a chat - like protocol , we can inherit our protocol class from Twisted 's LineReceiver , which subclasses Protocol while providing extra functionality useful for chat sessions , such as HTTP .
Twisted actually includes classes specifically for making and handling HTTP requests .
We are writing our own in part because Twisted 's prefab classes do n't facilitate proxy serving and also because it's a good programming exercise for this article .
Figure 1 . Class diagram for a proxy server .
The Protocol classes handle individual connections while the Factory classes create them .
Refer to Figure 1 for the class structure we are going to use .
Instances of the Factory classes are used by Twisted to spawn off Protocol instances for each connection made .
We create one SimpleHTTP class and inherit from it classes for managing incoming and outgoing traffic .
Because HTTP is mostly the same for client and server , we can manage most of the lexical processing in one superclass and let subclasses do the rest , which is exactly how Twisted 's own HTTP classes work .
Handling Callbacks
Operations you 'd otherwise do with one or two methods tend to require several callback methods in event - driven programming .
The rule of thumb is , any time there 's a blocking operation you need to wait on , it happens outside your code and , therefore , between two of your methods .
In the case of our proxy server , we can break down into separate chunks each part of handling a request .
Most of what a proxy server does amounts to reading in data from a browser , making a few changes to that data and sending the modified data to the remote Web server .
As of HTTP / 1.1 , multiple Web hits can be handled over one network connection .
In Figure 2 , you can see what happens to each request , keeping in mind that multiple requests can be made per HTTP connection .
Arrows connecting boxes show which events are spawned and in what order .
Figure 2 . Overall Steps in Processing Proxy Hits
In a blocking program , one might expect to handle opening a remote connection and sending it a line of text like this : connection = socket.open( remote_server , remote_port ) connection.write ( get_string ) response = connection.readline ()
We 've all seen this kind of blocking code before , so what is different about the Twisted way ?
Because we do n't want to wait around for the connection to be made in an event - driven program , we simply schedule some code to run when the remote server gets back to us .
In Twisted , this kind of deferment is handled by using an instance of the twisted .
internet.defer .
Deferred class as a placeholder for the result you would expect from a blocking operation .
For example , in our proxy server , we accept a Deferred object when we initiate a remote connection ( Listing 2 ) .
Listing 2 . Deferring operations in Twisted are like putting them on hold until a blocking operation gets back to us .
d = self.outgoing_proxy_cache.getOutgoing ( host , int ( port ) ) d.addCallback(self.outgoingConnectionMade , uri ) d.addErrback(self.outgoingProxyError , uri ) The self.outgoing_proxy_cache.getOutgoing method initiates an outbound proxy connection .
It does n't wait , however , for the connection to be made to return to the caller ; it returns immediately .
The behavior of all methods to return as soon as possible is what makes a single - threaded server possible .
Any and all CPU time taken by a method is spent processing , not waiting for external things to happen .
Notice how as a replacement for the connection object itself , a Deferred object is returned .
By calling addCallback and addErrback on the Deferred object , we are scheduling future events to be fired , such that when an outbound connection is ready , the self.outgoingConnectionMade method is called .
By passing uri as a second argument to addCallback , we are telling Twisted that self .
outgoingConnectionMade also should be called , with uri as an additional argument .
Handling Errors
In the event of an error , self.outgoingProxyError is called with a Failure object , which brings us to error handling .
Python 's traditional error handling is done through exceptions , a concept familiar to other high - level languages , such as Java ( Listing 3 ) .
Listing 3 . Traditional Error Handling in Python try : ( offending code ) except ValueError : ( error handling code ) except MyError : ( error handling code ) Although Python 's model of exception handling works exceptionally well ( pun intended ) for synchronous designs , it does not take into account asynchronous design .
For example , when we initiate an outbound HTTP connection , Twisted continues processing other events while the connection is made .
But , we want to specify behavior to address any problems that may occur at the time we request the connection .
Fortunately , the good people making Twisted took this into account .
Just as code is scheduled to run when a blocking operation completes successfully , it also can be scheduled to run in case of an error .
Twisted also handles all exceptions raised within the event loop , with hooks for developers to manage and log exceptions .
This has an added benefit too : although an exception might abort a specific event from completing , it does not bring down the server , even if you have n't put any exception - handling code in place .
Twisted Classes and Event Handling
When using some of the Twisted classes , such as the LineReceiver class we 're using , you can handle many events simply by adding methods with the correct names to your classes .
Each time the protocol receives a line , the lineReceived method is invoked with the text of the line as an argument .
Our SimpleHTTP class , which is intended to do minimal processing of an HTTP session , has methods such as these : startNewRequest : invoked at the beginning of each request .
lineReceived : designed to facilitate chat - oriented protocols .
Each time a line of text comes over the socket , this method automatically is called .
rawDataReceived : when sending a binary file or raw streams of data , it is n't reasonable to process information separated by newline characters .
To account for this , LineReceiver lets us switch to raw mode transfer , in which case rawDataReceived is called instead of lineReceived .
handle FirstLine : HTTP works by starting each request with a single line .
Generally , the client is sending a GET or POST request with a URI , and the server responds with a status code .
handleFirstLine is used to handle either of these cases .
handleHeadersFinished : invoked when HTTP headers are sent fully .
handleRequestFinished : invoked when the HTTP request itself has completed .
Writing separate methods for states or actions that occur in the processing of a protocol is how Twisted programmers queue up events .
At the beginning of a request , we can specify events to occur at each stage of handling a request .
In our earlier example , we decided to call self .
outgoingConnectionMade once a connection has been made .
Let 's take a look at that method , as shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 . Scheduling Events in Twisted def outgoingConnectionMade ( self , outgoing_proxy , uri ) : " " " This occurs when our outbound proxy has connected .
It 's a Twisted callback method . " " " assert ( outgoing_proxy , Outgoing Proxy ) self.outgoing_proxy = outgoing_proxy outgoing_proxy.incoming_proxy = self # Send HTTP command and echo back result outgoing_proxy.
write ( ' %s %s %s ' % \ ( self.http_command , uri , self.http_version ) \ + self.delimiter ) outgoing_proxy.firstline_sent_def.addCallback ( self.outgoingFirstlineReceived ) #
Send anything we have queued .
self.flushOutgoingBuffer ( )
#
Add callbacks for when headers are ready outgoing_proxy.headers_finished_def.addCallback ( self.outgoingHeadersReceived ) outgoing_proxy.request_finished_def.addCallback ( self.handleOutgoingRequestFinished )
Notice that outgoing_proxy represents the connection we are making to a remote server , on behalf of the Web browser we are serving .
We 're sending the HTTP request by calling outgoing_proxy .
write .
We 're also scheduling the self .
outgoing FirstlineReceived method to be called when a response is received from the remote server .
The self .
outgoingHeadersReceived method is called when the remote server has sent back all of its HTTP headers .
Finally , self .
handleOutgoingRequestFinished is called when the remote server has finished entirely responding to our outgoing HTTP request .
Although the outgoingConnectionMade method returns before any of this happens , we 're lining up events to happen in the future .
It well may be that while waiting for a response on one connection , ten other requests are opened and closed — all in the same thread .
All information relevant to a connection is stored as instance data on protocol classes .
Factories spawn protocol instances , protocol instances keep session states and deferred objects bind future data to event handlers .
Completing the puzzle , the reactor manages the dirty work of polling sockets .
This is the combination of tools upon which Twisted is built .

For the past seven years , random number generators have been running all over the world , electronically flipping 200 coins each second , with the intention of measuring a global consciousness .
The Global Consciousness Project ( GCP ) , originating from Princeton , have named these random event generators Electrogaiagrams ( EGGs ) and are using them to test whether a human consciousness extends a field around the earth which can change the results of random events .
They claim that when an important event occurs , such as the 9/11 terrorist attack or the Indian Ocean tsunami , the random event generators start to display patterns that should not exist in truly random sequences .
Not only does the GCP detect spikes of less - than - random activity around some important events , but according to the project it actually predicts them , too .
In the aforementioned 9/11 attack there was a bizarre spike of non-random activity four hours before the attacks ; as for the Indian Ocean tsunami , analysts say that the EGGs detected it 24 hours in advance .
“ We may be able to predict that a major world event is going to happen , ” says Roger Nelson , the project leader .
“ But we wo n’t know exactly what will happen or where it ’s going to happen . ”
As it stands now it will be difficult for the GCP to predict events since they examine data from the EGGs after an event occurs .
In each study , an important event is chosen , ranging from the funeral of Princess Di to an Oprah Winfrey special airing on television .
They then analyze a certain timespan around the event to test if the EGGs created numbers that are conclusively too patterned to be random .
Naturally there are many criticisms towards the GCP .
First , how is one to determine what a significant event is ?
Then , how does one know how close a non -random event had to have occurred for it to be a significant relation ?
Also , would n’t it be easy to see a pattern before or after an important event and then claim it was responding to a global consciousness ?
Even if all these questions were answered , the project gives no solid explanation of how human consciousness would extend a field or affect random number generators .
While this project could be a case of scientists looking too hard at raw data to find patterns , the GCP disagrees .
“ We ’re perfectly willing to discover that we ’ve made mistakes , but we have n’t been able to find any , and neither has anyone else , ” says Nelson .
“ Our data shows clearly that the chances of getting these results by fluke are one million to one against . ”
Also , the data the GCP releases are controlled experiments with defined criteria .
Even so , it is easy for a project like this to construct a hypothesis that cannot be disproved – any patterned data confirms the hypothesis , whereas any that does not are simply some other effects of global consciousness .
However , until someone comes up with solid evidence that the GCP is fruitless , the EGGs will continue to flip their virtual coins , trying to see into the future .
BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA — Thursday , June 28 , 2007 — On Friday , June 29 , not everyone in the continental U.S. will be waiting in line to purchase a $ 500 iPhone .
In fact , hundreds of thousands of digital aficionados around the globe wo n't be standing in line at all , for June 29 marks the release of version 3 of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
Version 2 of the GPL governs the world 's largest body of free software — software that is radically reshaping the industry and threatening the proprietary technology model represented by the iPhone .
The author of the GPL is Professor Richard M. Stallman , president and founder of the Free Software Foundation , and creator of the GNU Project .
With his first revision of the license in sixteen years , version 3 of the GPL fights the most recent attempts to take the freedom out of free software — most notably , version 3 attacks “ Tivoization ” — and that could be a problem for Apple and the iPhone .
Now , from China to India , from Venezuela to Brazil , from Tivos to cell phones :
Free software is everywhere and it is slowly building a worldwide movement of users demanding that they have control over the computers and electronic devices they own .
Tivoization and the iPhone ?
“ Tivoization ” is a term coined by the FSF to describe devices that are built with free software , but that use technical measures to prevent the user from making modifications to the software — a fundamental freedom for free software users — and an attack on free software that the GPL v3 will put a stop to .
The iPhone is leaving people questioning : Does it contain GPLed software ?
What impact will the GPLv3 have on the long - term prospects for devices like the iPhone that are built to keep their owners frustrated ?
Peter Brown , executive director of the FSF said , “ Tomorrow , Steve Jobs and Apple release a product crippled with proprietary software and digital restrictions : crippled , because a device that is n't under the control of its owner works against the interests of its owner .
We know that Apple has built its operating system , OS X , and its web browser Safari , using GPL - covered work — it will be interesting to see to what extent the iPhone uses GPLed software . ”
You can help spread the message
The GNU GPL version 3 will be released at 12:00 pm ( EDT ) — six hours before the release of the iPhone — bringing to a close eighteen months of public outreach and comment , in revision of the world 's most popular free software license .
About the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL )
The GNU GPL is the most widely used free software license worldwide : almost three quarters of all free software packages are distributed under this license .
It is not , however , the only free software license .
Richard Stallman wrote the version 1 and 2 of the GNU GPL with legal advice from Perkins , Smith & Cohen .
Version 1 was released in 1989 , and version 2 in 1991 .
Since 1991 , free software use has increased tremendously , and computing practices have changed , introducing new opportunities and new threats .
In 2005 , Stallman began revising the GPL for version 3 .
In January 2006 , the FSF began a systematic process of public review and feedback , with legal advice and organizational support from the Software Freedom Law Center .
About the GNU Operating System and Linux
Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a free software Unix - like operating system called GNU .
GNU is the only operating system developed specifically for the sake of users ' freedom .
See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html
In 1992 , the essential components of GNU were complete , except for one , the kernel .
When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under the GNU GPL , making it free software , the combination of GNU and Linux formed a complete free operating system , which made it possible for the first time to run a PC without non-free software .
This combination is the GNU / Linux system .
For more explanation , see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
The GNU GPL is used by developers with various views , but it was written to serve the ethical goals of the free software movement .
Says Stallman , “ The GNU GPL makes sense in terms of its purpose : freedom and social solidarity .
Trying to understand it in terms of the goals and values of open source is like trying understand a CD drive 's retractable drawer as a cupholder .
You can use it for that , but that is not what it was designed for . ”
About The Free Software Foundation
The Free Software Foundation , founded in 1985 , is dedicated to promoting computer users ' right to use , study , copy , modify , and redistribute computer programs .
The FSF promotes the development and use of free ( as in freedom ) software — particularly the GNU operating system and its GNU / Linux variants — and free documentation for free software .
The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software .
Its Web site , located at www.fsf.org , is an important source of information about GNU / Linux .

We did n’t need any further proof that Congressional Republicans really do n’t give a damn about the troops or their families but we just got it in the United States Senate anyway .
Just moments ago , Senate Republicans succeeded in a filibuster in which they refused to end debate on Virginia Democrat Jim Webb's , which would have placed strict limits on National Guard and reserve deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan as well as mandating more downtime at home before active - duty combat troops are returned to battle .
The vote was 56 - 41 to end debate , with 60 votes needed to move to a full , up - or - down vote on the Webb measure .
Once again , the GOP has been successful at destroying another Democratic attempt at helping service members and their families caught in the buzzsaw of the Bush administration 's lies and incompetence .
“ We have an amendment before us that is critical for the strength of our military and the well - being of our troops .
Regardless of where we stand on the war , I would hope that we stand as one in our commitment to keeping our military the strongest in the world , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) before the vote .
" We should all agree that we ca n’t sustain that strength if our men and women in uniform are n’t given the protection and care they need .
That ’s not a Democratic talking point or a Republican talking point – it ’s just common sense .
" Apparently not to Republicans , who have now drawn yet another line in the sand -- this one saying that , in addition to not caring about keeping America 's troops in Iraq forever , they do n’t even care if they have to go back four or five times with insufficient training , rest and time with their families .
Of course , the always - worthless Joe Lieberman voted with Republicans to kill Webb 's troop - protection amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill , along with Senator Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) who just showed how sincere he is in his statements about breaking ranks with George W. Bush on the Iraq occupation .
Among those joining Senate Democrats in supporting the Webb measure , were Republicans Norm Coleman , Olympia Snowe , Susan Collins , John Sununu , Chuck Hagel , Gordon Smith and John Warner -- all but Snowe are up for reelection next year .
" Sadly , our forces are being burned out .
Many of our troops are on their third or even their fourth tour in Iraq and Afghanistan , " said Patty Murray ( D - WA ) on the Senate floor Tuesday .
" Months ago , the Department of Defense announced that their tours would be extended from 12 months to 15 months .
And on top of all that , they are not receiving the necessary time at home before they are sent back to battle .
" And until Democrats get past 60 votes in the Senate , it 's hard to guess when relief is coming .
November 2008 can't get here fast enough .
I will have more information on this vote later .
The list of Republicans who voted to kill Webb 's legislation and who do n’t " support the troops " in any way , shape or form is here
No matter how closely you listen , you will not hear the Earth hum — but humming it is .
Far , far below the range of human hearing , waves of energy are coursing through the crust , causing the ground beneath your feet to rise and fall about three - millionths of an inch every few minutes .
First detected by networks monitoring seismic activity in 1998 , the tiny ripples were initially chalked up to the many small earthquakes that occur each day around the world .
But studies over the past decade have proved that the hum is far too constant for that explanation .
In February , oceanographer - turned - seismologist Spahr Webb , of Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , reported finding the hum ’s likely origin : ocean waves colliding over continental shelves .
When two trains of waves , traveling in different directions , smash into one another , they send a continuous cacophony down to the seafloor .
That energy triggers vibrations that ripple through the planet , producing an inaudible ringing .
“ It ’s the equivalent of a magnitude 6 earthquake occurring every day , ” Webb says .
“ That ’s the kind of energy we ’re talking about . ”

Earth ’s hum turns out to be just one of the many enigmatic signals resonating in the range known as infrasound .
Broadly defined as sound waves longer than 56 feet , infrasound lies below the rumbling 20 - hertz bass notes at the threshold of human hearing .
Hurricanes , tsunamis , and tornadoes also generate their own characteristic low - frequency noise .
Scientists are now studying infrasound to learn more about those powerful natural events and how to predict them — a skill that certain animals may already have .
In fact , some animals generate their own ultrabass tones for a unique type of long - distance communication .
A big reason for the surge in interest is the growing number of monitors capable of picking up reverberations from nuclear tests , a mandate of the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty .
In 2004 , the stations helped scientists prove that what was feared to be a North Korean nuclear test was in fact the detonation of a train carrying explosives .
The same basic technology can document a previously unheard world of natural sound as well .
For example , physicist Alfred Bedard of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder , Colorado , is working on a network of sensors that can identify a tornado before it reaches the ground .
The NOAA team has set up several arrays of sensors , spaced hundreds of miles apart , that register slight variations in air pressure — a sign of a lengthy sound wave passing by .
( Scientists are not sure why tornadoes pump out infrasound , but Bedard thinks it may result from a rapid expanding and contracting of the vortex . )
The readings are relayed to a laboratory in Boulder , where they are analyzed for advance warning of an approaching tornado .
“ The goal of the weather service is to get an average warning of tornadoes of about 10 minutes , ” Bedard says .
“ We ’re detecting signals that are arriving at our sites 30 minutes prior to a tornado report .
At the University of Mississippi , physicist Henry Bass leads a group using infrasound to help predict developing storms .
Hurricanes stir up ocean waves and may contribute to the planet ’s overall hum .
Picking out the infrasound pulses from individual hurricanes could be “ a way of supplementing the information available from satellites and airplanes , ” Bass says .
“ We do n’t know if it will work , but at this point the state will try almost anything . ”
Infrasound detection may also be useful for predicting volcanic events .
Certain low - frequency activity may signal that a volcano is likely to spout an ash cloud , a column of jagged volcanic sand that can reach as high as 30,000 feet .
An early warning would be tremendously useful , says University of Hawaii geophysicist Milton Garces , because pilots could divert their flights around the threat .
Similar infrasound monitoring is already under way to detect avalanches in Utah and Wyoming .
Garces has also analyzed the low - frequency sound waves accompanying the seafloor earthquake that caused the 2004 Indonesian tsunami for premonitory clues .
Crashing waves , volcanoes , hurricanes , earthquakes , avalan­ches — if it ’s a powerful enough event , Bass says , it will have an infrasonic signature .
Infrasound would therefore seem to be a possible explanation for the folk wisdom that animals have a sixth sense attuned to impending natural disasters .
After the 2004 tsunami , for instance , rumors spread of dogs that refused to go outside , zoo animals that would n’t leave their shelters , and elephants that burst their chains and rushed to higher ground .
Katy Payne , a bioacoustics expert at Cornell University , has found that some animals tune in to infrasonic rumblings .
While observing elephants at the Oregon Zoo a couple of decades ago , she experienced a familiar shuddering around her .
As a youth , Payne had sung in a choir in a massive church with a pipe organ that pumped out extremely deep bass sounds .
Sitting near those elephants , she felt the same sensation .
“ I was feeling a throbbing in the air , ” she says .
“ I guessed that the elephants were making sounds below the frequency humans can hear , and I turned out to be right .
There was a whole frequency down there that nobody was paying attention to . ”
Subsequent studies have shown that elephants generate infrasound calls to communicate over long distances .
The elephants ’ calls would be deafening — around 110 decibels , as loud as a rock concert — but we cannot hear a note because the waves are so lengthy , as long as 225 feet .
This part of the sound spectrum travels especially well through water , so alligators , hippos , and whales use infrasound calls as well .
The cries of blue whales may reach thousands of miles undersea .
But can infrasound - using animals actually sense a tsunami or other impending disasters ?
Caitlin O’Connell - Rodwell , who studies elephants at Etosha National Park in Namibia , sees evidence that elephants can sense the approach of major storms , but she is not convinced by the tsunami story .
There is just not much hard evidence that animals really did sense the danger .
In fact , a herd of collared , satellite - tracked elephants in Yala National Park in Sri Lanka did not move at all .
“ There really is no short , easy answer , ” O’Connell - Rodwell says .
This sixth sense is not the only infrasound - related conspiracy theory .
Rumors persist that a low - frequency buzz pervades certain locations , allegedly inspiring foul moods or even suicides .
In 2003 , English artist Sarah Angliss built an enormous pipe capable of producing sounds below 17 hertz , then put on two concerts back to back .
Two pieces in each concert included an infrasonic hum .
After the infrasound - enhanced performances , she says , some listeners cited a feeling of coldness , anxiety , and shivers down the spine .
Yet Bedard , who once carted his equipment over to Taos , New Mexico , to test persistent rumors that the town was haunted by an almost inaudible noise , says there is no scientific consensus on this issue : “ It ’s a conundrum .
There ’s literature that says there ’s no effect , that people are n’t bothered by infrasound , and yet there ’s another body of literature that says they are . ”
To Bass , these unknowns are what make the study of infrasound so exciting .
“ You hear things all the time , and 95 , 98 percent of the time you have n’t a clue what they are , ” he says .
“ They ’re going to be equally cool once you figure them out . ”

It can catch you embarrassingly unawares - as Cherie Blair has discovered .
But rather than being a precursor to sleep , scientists say the yawn is actually designed to keep you awake .
A study has found that when you yawn , the inhaled air reduces the temperature of vessels in the nasal cavity , allowing cooled blood to be sent to the brain .
This chills the brain , making it more alert and able to perform better .
Scroll down for more ...
Those who breathe in through the nose instead of the mouth are much less likely to yawn , as the vessels in the nasal cavity are already cooled .
To avoid embarrassment and quell a fit of the yawns , you can adopt
this method or apply something cold to the forehead , the researchers said - advice that might have been welcomed by the former prime minister 's wife .
Mrs Blair failed to suppress a very public yawn during the closing ceremony of last year 's Commonwealth Games in Melbourne .
Scroll down for more ...
The scientists believe that ' contagious ' yawning - where one immediately mimics another 's yawn - is an evolved protective mechanism to make a group more alert .
Their team , from New York State University , spent months watching 44 students , examining why they yawned and what happened when they did .
They found that the physical mechanism of yawning cooled the brain - making it operate more efficiently .
Leading researcher Dr Gordon Gallup said : ' According to our hypothesis , rather than promoting sleep , yawning should antagonise sleep .
' We think contagious yawning is triggered by empathic mechanisms which function to maintain group vigilance . '
For the study , volunteers were shown hours of film clips of men and women yawning .
The number of ' contagious ' yawns they made were recorded .
While watching the films , volunteers were told to breathe in and out in one of four ways - strictly orally , strictly nasally , orally while wearing a nose plug , or just normally .
Fifty per cent of those breathing normally or through their mouths yawned while watching the films .
But none of those breathing through their nose was affected .
Those who held a cold pack to their forehead - again cooling the vessels - also avoided yawning , but those who held a warm pack to their forehead were not so lucky .
Researcher Robert Provine , from the University of Maryland in Baltimore , said yawning could mark the body 's readiness to become alert .
' Paratroopers report yawning before they jump .
' Yawning signals a transition between the behavioural states of wakefulness and sleepiness , and boredom to alertness . '
Meanwhile , a team at Kyoto University in Japan has discovered that chimpanzees also suffer from contagious yawning .
The scientists believe their findings provide further evidence that apes may possess an advanced level of self - awareness , similar to that found in humans .
Israel and the US are increasingly alarmed by Iran 's growing power
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , has said the aid will preserve his country 's military advantage over other countries in the Middle East .
The new military aid package represents a 25 % increase from present levels .
The US announced multi-billion - dollar arms deals with Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and other Gulf states last month .
Washington says it wants to help its allies in the Middle East meet their security needs and counter the growing power of Iran in the region .
' Investment in peace '
Mr Burns and Israeli Foreign Ministry Director - General Aharon Abramovitz signed the memorandum of understanding on the new aid package at a ceremony in Jerusalem .
Needless to say , given Israel 's predicament , living in a region that is very violent and unstable , its military edge is of interest to our country , and we 've committed to that
Nicholas Burns
US Undersecretary of State
Arms deal analysis
It will see Washington transfer $ 30 bn over the next decade , compared to $ 24bn over the past 10 years .
The first payment of $ 2.55 bn will be made in October 2008 .
Mr Burns called the aid package an " investment in peace " , saying " peace can not be made without strength " .
" Needless to say , given Israel 's predicament , living in a region that is very violent and unstable , its military edge is of interest to our country , and we 've committed to that , " he said .
The money must be used to purchase military equipment from the US defence industry , although Israel will also be permitted to use 26.3 % to buy equipment from local companies .
The arrangement requires Congressional approval , but Mr Burns said he thought there would be little opposition , the Associated Press news agency reported .
' Iranian challenge '
After arriving in Jerusalem on Wednesday evening , Mr Burns met Mr Olmert briefly .
US ARMS AID TO ISRAEL $ 30 bn over 10 years 1st payment of $ 2.55 bn in 2008 Annual payments rising to $ 3.1 bn by 2011 26.3 % can be spent in Israel Rest must be spent on US arms
Mr Olmert asked the US envoy to thank President George W Bush and the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , for their efforts in bringing about the accord .
" The aid agreement with the US is an important and significant component for Israel , and proves once again the depth of the relationship between the two countries and the United States ' commitment to Israel 's security , and to preserving its qualitative advantage over other countries in the Middle East , " Mr Olmert said .
While he is in Israel , Mr Burns is also meeting Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , Defence Minister Ehud Barak and other Israeli officials for " discussions on regional security , including the challenge posed by Iran " .
The Bush administration said last month that it was offering weapons aid to other countries in the region , including $ 20bn for Saudi Arabia , $ 13 bn for Egypt and $ 20bn to be shared between Qatar , Bahrain , Oman and the United Arab Emirates .

Payday Loan Blog - Google 's Acquisition Report Card
You 've probably been reading more and more about Google 's recent acquisition binge , what it means to privacy , monopolistic concerns , etc .
Unfortunately , I have n't been seeing enough of what it means to Google as a business .
will they allow Google to grow more profitably in the future , will they create some sort of economic moat ?
To understand the future , we need to peer into the past .
With the help of the Wiki article on Google 's past acquisitions , the following is an attempt to score each acquisition .
A " good " or " bad " acquisition is based solely on whether Google has done anything useful , to date , with that acquisition .
Since we have no real insight into the depths of Google , in terms of key engineers that might have floated from one project to another , it is conjecture at best .
But hey , we hope you enjoy the analysis anyhow .

So far , most of the purchases , from the outsider 's point of view , were made to either bolster core search technologies , expand advertising reach , extend web accessibility value chain , or help to make sense of all the data .
Even then , the acquisitions marked " mixed " or " bad " may have synergies we simply can't see right now , or as theorized above , were made more to acquire talent than any specific technology .
The Future Of Google Does this mean the pending transactions of Doubleclick , Feedburner , and possibility Salesforce are a good idea ?
Most likely .
Doubleclick could be used to once again expand that ad network , Feedburner would bring access to even more user information , and Salesforce would be a mixed opinion , likely used as a compliment to Neotonic .
I want to know when Google is going to stop holding back though ; buy Apple and Nintendo , just to get it out of the way .

Caloric Restriction in non-obese people translates into less oxidative damage in muscle cells , according to a new study by scientists at Pennington Biomedical Research Center .
As oxidative damage has been linked to aging , this could explain how limiting calorie intake without malnutrition extends life span .
Civitarese and colleagues found that indeed fewer calories can improve whole body metabolism in conjunction with an increase in SIRT1 gene expression in skeletal muscle .
These results raise the possibility that SIRT1 may contribute to more efficient metabolism , less oxidative stress , and increase longevity in humans as it does in lower organism .

A calorie - restricted diet provides all the nutrients necessary for a healthy life but minimizes the energy ( calories ) supplied in the diet .
This type of diet increases the life span of mice and delays the onset of age - related chronic diseases such as cancers , heart disease , and stroke in rodents .
There are also hints that people who eat a calorie - restricted diet might live longer than those who overeat .
In addition , calorie - restricted diets beneficially affect several biomarkers of aging , including decreased insulin sensitivity ( a precursor to diabetes ) .
But how might caloric restriction slow aging ?
A major factor in the age - related decline of bodily functions is the accumulation of “ oxidative damage ” in the body ’s proteins , fats , and DNA .
Oxidants–in particular , chemicals called “ free radicals ” –are produced when food is converted to energy by cellular structures called mitochondria .
One theory for h ow caloric restriction slows aging is that it lowers free - radical production by inducing the formation of efficient mitochondria .
Civitarese and colleagues enrolled 36 healthy overweight but non -obese young people into their study .
A third of them received 100 % of their energy requirements in their diet ; the caloric restriction ( CR ) group had their calorie intake reduced by 25 % ; and the caloric restriction plus exercise ( CREX ) group had their calorie intake reduced by 12.5 % and their energy expenditure increased by 12.5 % .
The researchers found that a 25 % caloric deficit for 6 months , achieved by diet alone or by diet plus exercise , decreased 24 hr whole body energy expenditure ( i.e. overall calories burned ) , which suggests improved mitochondrial function .
Their analysis of genes involved in mitochondria formation indicated that CR and CREX both increased the number of mitochondria in muscle .
Both interventions also reduced the amount of DNA damage–a marker of oxidative stress–in the participants ’ muscles .
The researchers also examined gene expression in the study participants .
In yeast , worms , and flies the activation of the Sir2 gene increases life span and regulates cellular metabolism .
An important question is whether caloric restriction can regulate SIRT1 ( the mammalian equivalent of Sir2 ) in humans .
Civitarese and colleagues found that indeed fewer calories can improve whole body metabolism in conjunction with an increase in SIRT1 gene expression in skeletal muscle .
These results raise the possibility that SIRT1 may contribute to more efficient metabolism , less oxidative stress , and increase longevity in humans as it does in lower organism .
The results suggest that even short - term caloric restriction can produce beneficial physiological changes leading to improved health .
Whether caloric restriction and the associated health benefits can be sustained over longer term remains to be established in humans .

But it is also the age of migration alarm , as European ships patrol African coasts to intercept human smugglers and new fences are planned along the Rio Grande .
Countries that want migrant muscle and brains also want more border control .
Many of them see illegal migrants as a security threat , especially in a terrorist age , and worry that large - scale migration , even when legal , can undercut wages , require costly services and subject national identities to bonfires of religious and cultural conflict .
The stakes can be seen here in Mindelo , a semicircle of barren hillsides that gaze out at the only sign of natural life , a beckoning sea .
In a country with little rain and a history of famine , migration began as a necessity and became part of the civic DNA .
You can dine at Café Portugal , drink at the Argentina bar and stroll Avenida da Holanda .
Yet Holland — the Netherlands — now requires would - be migrants to pass a test on Dutch language and culture .
Other countries have raised the cost of visa applications , discouraged applicants by requiring them to travel to the Cape Verdean capital , Praia , and placed new penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants .
While the Netherlands has long been a favorite destination for residents of this island , a Cape Verdean song now warns that “ Holland belongs to the Dutch . ”
Watch out
Because they can make you go back swimming
And you ’ll get home with seaweed in your teeth
Mindelo , Cape Verde ’s second - largest city , contains 63,000 people and about as many variations on the migrant ’s tale .
On the hillside neighborhood of Monte Sessego , Maria Cruz , 70 , beams at the living room suite her son sent from Rotterdam .
Out toward the airport , Stenio da Luz dos Reis , 17 , studies Dutch and hopes to join his mother in the Netherlands .
Down by the beach , Orlando Cruz , 46 , stares at vacant tables .
He fell off a ladder in New Jersey and used the insurance money to start a hotel and restaurant , which are now nearly empty .
As construction racket fills her half - finished house , Evanilda Lopes , 27 , speaks freely about the fraudulent papers that got her to the Netherlands .
As he hustles change for his H.I.V. medication , Manuel Gomes , 41 , is equally frank about the crimes that got him deported from Providence , R.I .
He moved there as a child and grew up wild — selling drugs , stealing cars and burglarizing homes .
Now like hundreds of others deported here from the United States , he finds himself a man without a country , exiled to a world no less foreign for having been the place of his birth .
“ You have a Cape Verdean here who would cut his right arm off to go back , ” said Mr. Gomes , who lives in a one - room hovel without running water or electricity .
Bush Administration 's intelligence chief acknowledges ' series ' of other ' secret surveillance activities '

President Bush authorized a " series of secret surveillance activities " by executive order after Sept. 11 , 2001 , according to a letter from Bush Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell to Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) .
The disclosure marks the first time " that the administration has publicly acknowledged that Bush 's order included undisclosed activities beyond the warrantless surveillance of e-mails and phone calls that Bush confirmed in December 2005 , " according to the Washington Post .
Bush 's executive order authorized " a number " of intelligence activities .
The name created by the Bush team -- ' Terrorist Surveillance Program ' -- applied only to " one particular aspect of these activities , " McConnell wrote .
" This is the only aspect of the NSA activities that can be discussed publicly , because it is the only aspect of those various activities whose existence has been officially acknowledged , " McConnell said .
The Post did not say that the only reason warrantless wiretapping was acknowledged in the first place was due to a groundbreaking article by James Risen , that exposed the program in the New York Times .
McConnell 's letter sought to defend Attorney General Gonzales from Senate Democrats ' allegations of perjury .
Gonzales told Congress that no legal objections were raised about the " Terrorist Surveillance Program , " and then later shifted course , saying his remark was about " other intelligence activities . "
These other activities were apparently those that McConnell acknowledges but does not disclose .
" But in doing so , McConnell 's letter also underscored that the full scope of the NSA 's surveillance program under Bush 's order has not been revealed , " notes Post reporter Dan Eggen .
" The TSP described by Bush and his aides allowed the interception of communication between the United States and other countries where one party is believed to be tied to al - Qaeda , so other types of communication or data are presumably being collected under the parts of the wider NSA program that remain hidden . "
" News reports over the past 20 months have detailed a range of activities linked to the program , including the use of data mining to identify surveillance targets and the participation of telecommunication companies in turning over millions of phone records , " Eggen adds .
" The administration has not publicly confirmed such reports . "
Today 's New York Times does not even carry the story on its front page .
In fact -- Risen 's A11 piece today in the Times today is titled , " Democrats Scrambling to Expand Eavesdropping . "

We 'll start by figuring out how much energy in kilowatt - hours the light bulb uses per year .
We multiply how much power it uses in kilowatts , by the number of hours in a year .
That gives 0.1 kW x 8,760 hours or 876 kWh .
The thermal energy content of coal is 6,150 kWh / ton .
Although coal fired power generators are very efficient , they are still limited by the laws of thermodynamics .
Only about 40 percent of the thermal energy in coal is converted to electricity .
So the electricity generated per ton of coal is 0.4 x 6,150 kWh or 2,460 kWh / ton .
To find out how many tons of coal were burned for our light bulb we divide 876 kWh by 2,460 kWh / ton .
That equals 0.357 tons .
Multiplying by 2,000 pounds / ton we get 714 pounds ( 325 kg ) of coal .
That is a pretty big pile of coal , but let 's look at what else was produced to power that light bulb .
A typical 500 megawatt coal power plant produces 3.5 billion kWh per year .
That is enough energy for 4 million of our light bulbs to operate year round .
To produce this amount of electrical energy , the plant burns 1.43 million tons of coal .
It also produces :
Pollutant Total for Power Plant One Light Bulb - Year 's Worth Sulfur Dioxide - Main cause of acid rain 10,000 Tons 5 pounds Nitrogen Oxides - Causes smog and acid rain 10,200 Tons 5.1 pounds Carbon Dioxide - Greenhouse gas suspected of causing global warming 3,700,000 Tons 1852 pounds
It also produces smaller amounts of just about every element on the periodic table , including the radioactive ones .
In fact , a coal - burning power plant emits more radiation than a ( properly functioning ) nuclear power plant !

A couple of weeks ago , I was reading reddit.com when I found a link to the Michael Moore new movie Sicko playing at video.google.com .
Moore had made some comments at the time about his position on the leaked movie .
When I saw this on reddit I thought it was a joke , but there it was in video.google.com .
So I watched the entire thing at the time , I was up until 4 am in the morning watching it .
Tonight am going with Laura and some friends that did not see it to watch it again at the theater .
A Handful of Events
For years I have been incredibly annoyed at the power that special interest groups have over policy making in the United States .
It all begun by reading Howard Zinn , Noam Chomsky and the progressive sites .
Around that time there were a series of events happening , but I was too busy with the Moonlight hack - a- thon .
Luis Villa posted a link to Larry Lessig post where he has decided to move his work and activism in a different direction , a much needed one : .
You should read the whole thing , but here are some bits that I found interesting :
If you 've been reading these pages recently , you 'll know my allergy to that word .
But this friend 's use of the term not to condemn me , but rather as play , made me recognize just how general this corruption is .
Of course he would expect I was in the pay of those whose interests I advanced .
Why else would I advance them ?
Both he and I were in a business in which such shilling was the norm .
It was totally reasonable to thus expect that money explained my desire to argue with him about public policy .
I do n't want to be a part of that business .
And more importantly , I do n't want this kind of business to be a part of public policy making .
We 've all been whining about the " corruption " of government forever .
We all should be whining about the corruption of professions too .
But rather than whining , I want to work on this problem that I 've come to believe is the most important problem in making government work .
And so as I said at the top ( in my " bottom line " ) , I have decided to shift my academic work , and soon , my activism , away from the issues that have consumed me for the last 10 years , towards a new set of issues :
Namely , these .
" Corruption " as I 've defined it elsewhere will be the focus of my work .
For at least the next 10 years , it is the problem I will try to help solve .
The other thing that bothered me at the time was that one of the Supreme Court Justices in the United States became an apologist for torture :
The conservative jurist stuck up for Agent Bauer , arguing that fictional or not , federal agents require latitude in times of great crisis .
" Jack Bauer saved Los Angeles .
...
He saved hundreds of thousands of lives , " Judge Scalia said .
Then , recalling Season 2 , where the agent 's rough interrogation tactics saved California from a terrorist nuke , the Supreme Court judge etched a line in the sand . [...]
So there you have it , America making sound legal decisions based on the hit - show 24 .
Google and HMOs
The US is a country that has grown to believe that two differing points of view should be given " equal time " to portray their position regardless of the value of the arguments .
Except things are not fair and not equal in a country where you get the best democracy that money can buy .
So Michael Moore presents a film in 2007 after 30 years of HMO propaganda and will be up against a multi-billion dollar industry that will use every tool at their disposal to keep the profits rolling , and the health service at the lowest possible level .
And now we have Google 's Health Advertising team pitching their services to a rotten industry ( from Boingboing ) .
They are willing to help this industry catapult the propaganda :
Many of our clients face these issues ; companies come to us hoping we can help them better manage their reputations through " Get the Facts " or issue management campaigns .
Your brand or corporate site may already have these informational assets , but can users easily find them ?
We can place text ads , video ads , and rich media ads in paid search results or in relevant websites within our ever - expanding content network .
Whatever the problem , Google can act as a platform for educating the public and promoting your message .
We help you connect your company ’s assets while helping users find the information they seek .
If you 're interested in learning more about issue management campaigns or about how we can help your company better connect its assets online , email us .
We 'd love to hear from you !
Setting up these campaigns is easy and we 're happy to share best practices .
Ah , " Get The Facts " campaigns to better manager company reputations .
Where have I heard that one before ?.
Sure , Google could keep selling their ads and do Get the Facts campaigns out , but actively reaching out to this rotten industry saddens me .

TECHNOLOGY constantly overtakes language .
Recent additions to the Oxford English Dictionary have included po-faced entries for “ Google ” ( the verb ) , “ wiki ” and “ mash - up ” .
But most clichés are stubbornly indifferent to such concerns .
Indeed , they often act as a linguistic fossil record , preserving objects and behaviour that have long since fallen into petrified obsolescence .
Industrious sorts no longer burn the midnight oil .
Flashes in the pan are common even if the flintlock muskets that gave rise to them are museum pieces .
Colours are still nailed to masts , metal though they now usually are .
In a technological age ever more clichés are being untethered from their origins in this way .
People write out plenty of metaphorical cheques , whether blank or bouncing .
Many of them are to be found in the post , but fewer in real life ( some shops no longer accept them ) .
There is no need to keep your cards close to your chest , or indeed an ace up your sleeve , when so much gambling happens online .
Thanks to reviews , awards and celebrity book - club stickers , you can in fact judge a book by its cover .
If you carry a mobile phone , write e-mail or post entries on MySpace , being out of sight does not mean being out of mind .
And in the age of the iPod , no one can be accused of being unable to carry a tune .
Old assumptions are stranded by other changes too .
Currencies fluctuate : the dollar looks less than almighty , at least for the moment .
Populations evolve : Tom , Dick and Harry make for an unrepresentative trio of everymen today ; Kevin , Chloe and Muhammad would be more accurate .
Trade patterns shift : turning down all the tea in China would weigh heavily , to be sure , but the European Union is more impressed by the Chinese production of bras and dressing - gowns .
Today 's coast is never clear but always strewn with plastic and other detritus .
Rare is the athlete who can radiate Olympian calm at a modern - day Olympic games .
Earnest environmental concerns are also starting to flip well - worn phrases on their heads .
Putting new wine into old bottles is now to be applauded .
Where it was once desirable to trail clouds of glory , they now require emissions credits .
Regulators are another threat .
Hunting - grounds , happy or not , are fewer in number .
Recently shelved plans by the European Commission to get rid of Britain 's imperial measures endangered all manner of activities , from exacting a pound of flesh , inching forward and feeling ten feet tall to being miles away .
Being archaic does not always make a cliché redundant .
People still jump on bandwagons , read the riot act , burn the candle at both ends and keep irons in fires .
As long as its meaning is clear , a saying can be both historic and current .
The trouble comes when technology robs a cliché of its substance as well as its form .
When love fades , the jilted may seek consolation in the thought that there are plenty more fish in the sea .
But there are n't : the oceans have been plundered .
“ For everything there is a season ” is a phrase with a ring of majestic certainty .
But with air - freighted fruit and genetically modified veg , it too is wrong .
And if once it was believed that the camera never lied , PhotoShop should have taught that the lens bends the truth as effortlessly as it bends light itself .
As for rocket science , not long ago it was held up as the paragon of baffling complexity .
Now , as tourists hurtle into space and almost every failed state seems poised to go ballistic , rocket science seems less sophisticated .
Proud owners of silicon implants scoff at the notion that beauty is only skin - deep .
Among the transgendered , Bob is as likely to be your auntie as your uncle .
The moral of it all ?
Clichés just are n't what they used to be .
Carlos Slim AP file Digg

Reddit
Facebook MEXICO CITY ( AP )  Mexican telecom magnate Carlos Slim has quietly overtaken investor Warren Buffett as the world 's second - richest man and is close to wresting the top spot from Bill Gates , Forbes magazine reported Wednesday .
In the two months since Forbes calculated its 2007 wealth rankings , the 67 - year - old Slim 's fortune rose $ 4 billion to $ 53.1 billion , while Buffett 's holdings slipped to $ 52.4 billion as of March 29 .
In an article on its website , Forbes attributed part of Slim's " amazing run " to a 15 % increase in the stock price of Carso Global Telecom ( CGTVY ) , part of a larger rally in Mexican stocks .
Slim 's America Movil cellphone company ( AMX ) also soared on news of a possible acquisition of Telecom Italia .
In the 2007 rankings released March 8 — but prepared almost a month earlier — Forbes had listed Slim as the world 's third - richest man and estimated Gates ' fortune at $ 56 billion .
Slim said shortly afterward that he was n't concerned about his ranking or taking over the top spot , but he expressed differences with Buffett , the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) ( BRKB ) , and Gates , the chairman and co-founder of Microsoft ( MSFT ) .
" It 's not about having who knows how many bonds , to spend them on whatever one wants or live it up all year , " said Slim , an engineer who wears modest suits and whose main indulgence appears to be expensive cigars .
" I do n't have apartments abroad .
I do n't have a house abroad . "
Slim , who owns Mexico 's dominant phone company and has holdings throughout Latin America , said his vision of a businessman 's role in the world is at odds with that of Buffett , who announced last year he would donate $ 1.5 billion every year to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
" It 's very interesting , because he leaves those who are running his affairs the responsibility of being very profitable , " Slim said of Buffett .
" If they 're inefficient or do n't get real - term returns , they 're not going to be running anything . "
" Our concept is more to accomplish and solve things , rather than giving — that is , not going around like Santa Claus , " Slim said .
" Poverty is n't solved with donations . "

ABN fears world housing crash
Soaring borrowing costs could spark a housing slump on a ' global scale ' , investment bank ABN Amro has warned .
Families have taken on ' unsustainably large ' mortgages , leaving them vulnerable to the sharp increases in bond yields and official interest rates seen in recent weeks , wrote economist Dominic White .
Britain is one of the most exposed markets thanks to rampant speculation over the past decade , though it is by no means alone .
Claims that shortfalls in the supply of new homes will lead to an inexorable rise in UK property prices in coming decades have 'as much credibility as Britney Spears ' latest comeback , ' he wrote .
' The decline in global interest rates has now been largely reversed , ' White said .
' Rising real interest rates could result in greater economic volatility .
I believe this leaves housing markets vulnerable to a correction on a global scale . '
Can prices keep rising or is there a sharp downturn on the cards .
A This is Money poll says confidence is waning .

>> Will house prices crash ?
Central banks have raised interest rates to the highest level since 2001 across the 30 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Meanwhile yields on government bonds - a key measure for the cost of borrowing - have increased in recent days , sending shockwaves through financial markets .
Although fears for the health of the US housing market have captured headlines , the degree of over - valuation is more ' severe ' in Britain , Australia , Spain and Ireland , ABN Amro calculates .
A note by the bank in April found that UK residential property is 50 % overvalued , whereas US houses are 25 % too expensive .
The research comes ahead of a slew of key data that will expose the health of the British economy .
Among the most significant reports will be official inflation numbers due on Tuesday .
Economists expect consumer price growth to ease to 2.5 % , but even a larger drop is unlikely to prevent further hikes by the Bank of England .

Researchers have discovered how the brain can suppress emotionally troubling memories .
They say their findings might lead better therapies for patients with post - traumatic stress disorder or anxiety to gain control of debilitating memories .
“ You ’re shutting down parts of the brain that are responsible for supporting memories , ” says Brendan Depue , at the University of Colorado , US .
He said his team discovered that activity in the brain ’s emotional centre is also reduced .
In the study , published in Science , 16 adult volunteers learned to associate pictures of specific human faces with disturbing pictures , such as car crashes , wounded soldiers , an electric chair or a violent crime scene .
They were then shown each face a dozen times and asked to try and either remember or forget the troubling image associated with each one .
After subjects had worked to block a particular negative image , they were shown the associated face one last time , and 53 % of the time they could no longer name its troubling pair .
Those asked to remember the image , recalled it 71 % of the time in the final test .

Reduced activity
The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to show the volunteer ’s brain activity in real time .
As the subjects focused on forgetting the images , the team found increased activity in parts of the prefrontal cortex – the brain ’s control centre for complex thoughts and actions .
This seemed to direct a decrease of activity in the visual cortex , where images are usually processed .
This was followed by reduced activity on the hippocampus , where memories are formed and retrieved , and the amygdala , the emotion hub .
The research is still far from being translated to clinical therapies , Depue and others acknowledge .
“ In the first place , the stimuli used in this study may be unpleasant , but they are hardly traumatic , ” says John Kihlstrom , at University of California , Berkeley , US , who was not involved in the study .
Harrowing experience
“ My prediction is it wo n’t be as easy to suppress something that ’s long - standing and personally emotional , ” says Depue .
People with post - traumatic stress disorder are often troubled for decades by recurring images of a harrowing experience .
“ It might be the case that people with memory disturbances have to gain some control over the memory representation by remembering it and trying a different emotional response to the memory before successful suppression , ” he adds .
A drug targeting specific brain regions might eventually boost the ability to suppress , said John Gabrieli , at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , US .
For a mother haunted by the memory of her son ’s suicide , he said , “ it is hard to imagine that you would ever get her to forget that the event occurred .
But the more you could weaken the memory in any dimension , the better it would be . ”

The browser that set off the latest dispute has been in development for some time , but Microsoft first made it available to the public for downloading last week in a test version .
It is the first new release of Microsoft 's browser in five years .
A final version is expected to be released this summer and will be included in Microsoft 's new operating system , Windows Vista , which is scheduled for release next January .
The focus of Google 's concern is a slender box in the corner of the browser window that allows users to start a search directly instead of first going to the Web site of a search engine like Google , Yahoo or MSN .
Typing a query and hitting " Enter " immediately brings up a page of results from a designated search engine .
That slice of on - screen real estate has the potential to be enormously valuable , and Microsoft is the landlord .
Internet Explorer 7 is the first Microsoft browser to have a built - in search box , while other browsers like Firefox , Opera and Safari have had them for some time .
Google estimates that the boxes , when available , are the starting point for 30 to 50 percent of a user 's searches , making them a crucial gateway to the lucrative and fast - growing market for advertisements that appear next to search results .
Microsoft has lost some ground in the browser market in the last year , mainly to Firefox , which is a Google ally .
But Microsoft still holds more than 80 percent of the market .
And Internet Explorer 7 is expected to be extremely popular because it is an improvement over Microsoft 's previous browser , and because Microsoft will promote downloads of it and include it in Windows Vista .
That gives Microsoft the potential to use the browser to steer substantial traffic , and business , to MSN and away from rivals .
MSN handled 11 percent of searches in the United States in March , down slightly from a year earlier , according to Nielsen / Net Ratings , a market research firm .
That put it well behind Google , which had a 49 percent share , and Yahoo , with 22 percent .
Microsoft insists it has no intention of deploying its browser as a weapon in the search wars .
But Google suspects otherwise .
In meetings beginning last year , Google told Microsoft of its objections to the company 's plans to set MSN as the default search engine in Internet Explorer 7 , according to Ms. Mayer of Google .
Yahoo raised similar objections in a meeting with Microsoft last year , according to a Yahoo employee who was briefed on the conversation .
Yahoo declined to comment last week beyond a statement : " We would be concerned about any company 's attempts to limit user choice or change user preferences without their knowledge , and believe others would share that concern . "
