Scientists , including Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution ’s Department of Global Ecology , have found that the Earth ’s global warming , 55 million years ago , may have resulted from the climate ’s high sensitivity to a long - term release of carbon .
This finding contradicts the position held by many climate - change skeptics that the Earth system is resilient to such emissions .
The work , led by Mark Pagani of Yale University , is published in the December 8 , 2006 , issue of Science magazine .
For some years scientists have known that an ancient global warming event , called the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) beginning about 55 million years ago , was caused by a massive release of carbon .
The geologic record shows that the ensuing greenhouse effect heated the planet by about 9° F ( 5° C ) , on average , in less than 10,000 years .
The temperature increase lasted 170,000 years and caused profound changes to the world ’s rainfall patterns , made the oceans acidic , and affected oceanic and terrestrial plant and animal life , including spawning the rise of our modern primate ancestors .
But understanding just how much carbon was responsible for the temperature increase and where it came from remains elusive .
The new calculations used data from carbon found in fossils of ancient land plants and tiny marine organisms known as plankton .
" We can tell that the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere and ocean was more or less the same as what is available today as coal , oil , and gas , " Caldeira explained .
" The carbon heated up the Earth for over 100,000 years .
If the climate was as insensitive to CO 2 as the climate skeptics claim , there would be no way to make the Earth so warm for so long . "
The source of this ancient carbon is still a mystery .
It might have come from massive fires burning coal and other ancient plant material , or it could have come from " burps " of methane from the continental shelves .
" By examining fossils and ancient sediments on the sea floor , we can see that something very unusual happened to Earth ’s carbon cycle , " Caldeira continued .
" At the same time the climate near the North Pole became like Miami .
We can tell it did n’t take all that much carbon to make this change in climate . "
If the source of the release was ancient plant material , calculations indicate that for each doubling of atmospheric CO 2 concentration , the Earth would warm at least 4 ºF ( 2.2 ºC ) and possibly twice this much .
If ancient methane was the cause , as many believe , the situation is even more dire .
The methane would have become carbon dioxide in the atmosphere within decades .
The research indicates that much less of it would have been available to cause climate change , which means that the climate is even more sensitive to added CO 2 than we have thought .
" If ancient methane ‘ burps ’ really occurred , as many believe , " Caldeira said , " a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 concentration would warm the Earth by over 10 ºF ( 5.6 ºC ) .
If that ’s what happened , we could be in for a mighty toasty future . "
With a continuation of current trends in the use of coal , oil , and gas , natural background atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are expected to double around mid-century .
The ancient emissions are comparable to the CO 2 that can be expected from human activity over the coming few centuries .
If human - induced carbon emissions continue unabated , there could be a similar shift in species evolution .
" The last time carbon was emitted to the atmosphere on the scale of what we are doing today , there were winners and losers , " Caldeira remarked .
" There was ecological devastation , but new species rose from the ashes .
Luckily for us , our ancient primate ancestors were winners .
Who knows who the winners and losers will be in the next go round " "
" Our carbon dioxide emissions are risking biological , chemical , and climate changes of a magnitude that has not been seen for more than 50 million years , " he warned .
" Our work provides even more incentive to develop the clean energy sources that can provide for economic growth and development without risking the natural world that is our endowment . "

Okay this is very bad .
the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) has fabricated and disseminated a cover - up story as to why it never investigated the Foley emails sent to it by CREW
CBS News has reported that according to the FBI when CREW gave the Bureau the original set of emails from Rep. Mark Foley to a former House page , they were “ heavily redacted . ”
The FBI is lying .
Both the former page ’s name and the person to whom the page forwarded Rep .
Foley ’s emails were clearly visible
“ the FBI can not have it both ways ; either it failed to investigate the Foley emails because they did not rise to a level of criminal activity or because it did not have adequate information to do so .

EVERY now and again America , a nation largely made up of immigrants and their descendants , is gripped by a furious political row over whether and how it should stem the flood of people wanting to enter the country .
It is in the midst of just such a quarrel now .
Congress is contemplating the erection of a wall along stretches of the Mexican border and a crackdown on illegal workers , as well as softer policies such as a guest - worker programme for illegal immigrants .
Some of the arguments are plain silly .
Immigration 's defenders claim that foreigners come to do jobs that Americans wo n't — as if cities with few immigrants had no gardeners .
Its opponents say that immigrants steal American jobs — succumbing to the fallacy that there are only a fixed number of jobs to go around .
One common argument , though not silly , is often overstated : that immigration pushes down American workers ' wages , especially among high - school dropouts .
It is n't hard to see why this might be .
Over the past 25 years American incomes have become less equally distributed , typical wages have grown surprisingly slowly for such a healthy economy and the real wages of the least skilled have actually fallen .
It is plausible that immigration is at least partly to blame , especially because recent arrivals have disproportionately poor skills .
In the 2000 census immigrants made up 13 % of America 's pool of workers , but 28 % of those without a high - school education and over half of those with eight years ' schooling or less .
In fact , the relationship between immigration and wages is not clear - cut , even in theory .
That is because wages depend on the supply of capital as well as labour .
Alone , an influx of immigrants raises the supply of workers and hence reduces wages .
But cheaper labour increases the potential return to employers of building new factories or opening new valet - parking companies .
In so doing , they create extra demand for workers .
Once capital has fully adjusted , the final impact on overall wages should be a wash , as long as the immigrants have not changed the productivity of the workforce as a whole .
However , even if wages do not change on average , immigration can still shift the relative pay of workers of different types .
A large inflow of low - skilled people could push down the relative wages of low - skilled natives , assuming that they compete for the same jobs .
On the other hand , if the immigrants had complementary skills , natives would be relatively better off .
To gauge the full effect of immigration on wages , therefore , you need to know how quickly capital adjusts and how far the newcomers are substitutes for local workers .
City to city
Empirical evidence * is as inconclusive as the theory .
One method is to compare wage trends in cities with lots of immigrants , such as Los Angeles , with those in places with only a few , such as Indianapolis .
If immigration had a big effect on relative pay , you would expect this to be reflected in differences between cities ' wage trends .
David Card , of the University of California , Berkeley , is one of the leading advocates of this approach .
His research suggests that although there are big differences between cities ' proportions of immigrants , this has had no significant effect on unskilled workers ' pay .
Not everyone is convinced by Mr Card 's technique .
His critics argue that the geographical distribution of immigrants is not random .
Perhaps low - skilled natives leave cities with lots of immigrants rather than compete with them for jobs , so that immigration indirectly pushes up the supply of low - skilled workers elsewhere ( and pushes down their wages ) .
Mr Card has tested the idea that immigration displaces low - skilled natives and found scant evidence that it does .
An alternative approach , pioneered by George Borjas , of Harvard University , is to tease out the effect of immigration from national wage statistics .
Mr Borjas divides people into categories , according to their education and work experience .
He assumes that workers of different types are not easily substitutable for each other , but that immigrants and natives within each category are .
By comparing wage trends in categories with lots of immigrants against those in groups with only a few , he derives an estimate of immigration 's effect .
His headline conclusion is that , between 1980 and 2000 , immigration caused average wages to be some 3 % lower than they would otherwise have been .
Wages for high - school drop - outs were dragged down by around 8 % .
Immigration 's critics therefore count Mr Borjas as an ally .
But hold on .
These figures take no account of the offsetting impact of extra investment .
If the capital stock is assumed to adjust , Mr Borjas reports , overall wages are unaffected and the loss of wages for high - school drop - outs is cut to below 5 % .
Gianmarco Ottaviano , of the University of Bologna , and Giovanni Peri , of the University of California , Davis , argue that Mr Borjas 's findings should be adjusted further .
They think that , even within the same skill category , immigrants and natives need not be perfect substitutes , pointing out that the two groups tend to end up in different jobs .
Mexicans are found in gardening , housework and construction , while low - skilled natives dominate other occupations , such as logging .
Taking this into account , the authors claim that between 1980 and 2000 immigration pushed down the wages of American high - school drop - outs by at most 0.4 % .
None of these studies is decisive , but taken together they suggest that immigration , in the long run , has had only a small negative effect on the pay of America 's least skilled and even that is arguable .
If Congress wants to reduce wage inequality , building border walls is a bad way of going about it .

Introduction
The Lisp family of languages has long been a rich source of ideas and inspiration in the area of error handling .
Here we will survey some of the abstract concepts and terminology , as well as some specific language constructs that Lisp has contributed .
Although there are numerous dialects of Lisp , several of which offer the modern concepts and capabilities described herein , we will focus specifically on Common Lisp as described in the ANSI standard , X3.226-1994 [ X3J13 1994 ] .
Condition Systems vs Error Systems
The Common Lisp community typically prefers to speak about its condition system rather than its error system to emphasize that there are not just fatal but also non-fatal situations in which the capabilities provided by this system are useful .
Not all exceptional situations are represented , or sometimes even detected .
A situation that is represented within the language is referred to in Common Lisp as a condition ; an object of class CONDITION is used to represent such a situation .
A condition is said to be the generalization of an error .
Correspondingly , within the language the class CONDITION is a superclass of another class ERROR , which represents situations that would be fatal if not appropriately managed .
So the set of all situations involving conditions includes not only descriptions of outright erroneous situations but also descriptions of situations that are merely unusual or questionable .
Even in the case of non-error conditions , the programmer may , as a matter of expressive freedom , choose to use the same capabilities and protocols as would be used for " real " error handling .
Condition Handling Is Primarily a Protocol Matter
To properly understand condition handling , it is critical to understand that it is primarily about protocol , rather than mere computational ability .
The establishment of protocols is a sort of before - the - fact hedge against the " prisoner 's dilemma " ; that is , it creates an obvious way for two people who are not directly communicating to structure independently developed code so that it works in a manner that remains coherent when such code is later combined .
For example , if we want to write a program that searches a list for an object , returning true if the object is present and false otherwise , we could write the following , but would ordinarily not :
( defun search - list ( goal - item list - to - search ) ( handler - case ;; Main body ( progn ( dolist ( item list - to - search ) ( when ( eq item goal - item ) ( return - from search - list t ) ) ) ;;
Search has failed , signal an error .
( error ' search - failure :item goal - item ) ) ;;
Upon error , just return false .
( error ( ) nil ) ) )
The reason not to write this is not that it will not work , but that it involves undue amounts of unneeded mechanism .
The language already contains simpler ways of expressing transfer of control from point A to point B in a program where the same programmer , acting in the same role , controls the code at both points .
For example , the following would suffice :
( defun search - list ( goal - item list - to - search ) ( dolist ( item list - to - search ) ( when ( eq item goal - item ) ( return - from search - list t ) ) ) nil )
However , if the intended action in the case of a failing search were not specified , and was to be provided by the caller , the use of condition handling mechanisms might be appropriate .
For example , in the following code , only the signaling is occurring , and the handling is being left to the caller .
Because of this , the use of condition handling facilities is appropriate because those facilities will provide matchmaking and data transport services between the signaler and the handler .
( defun search - list ( goal - item list - to - search ) ( dolist ( item list - to - search ) ( when ( eq item goal - item ) ( return - from search - list t ) ) ) ( error ' search - failure :item goal - item ) )
Protocol is simply not needed when communicating lexically among parts of a program that were written as a unit and that are not called by other programs that are either logically separated or , at minimum , logically separable .
The distinction is subjective , but it is nevertheless important .
Historical Influences
Before beginning to look in detail at the features of Common Lisp 's condition system , it 's useful to observe that computer languages , like human languages , evolve over time both to accommodate current needs and to repair problems observed in past experience .
The interesting features of the Common Lisp condition system were not suddenly designed one day as a spontaneous creative act , but rather grew from many years of prior experience in other languages and systems .
Influence of Multics PL / I on Symbolics Zetalisp
The PL / I language , designed at IBM in the early 1960's , included an extensive condition mechanism which had an extensible set of named signals and dynamic handlers running in the dynamic context of the signal .
Since PL / I included " downward " lexical closures these handlers had access to the erring environment , and sometimes to the details of the error .
Multics , whose official language was PL/ I , adapted and extended this , including the addition of any_other , cleanup , and unclaimed_signal , the passing of machine conditions and other arbitrary data , cross-protection - domain signals , and the use of this mechanism to manage multiple suspended environments on one stack .
For security reasons , Multics had an elaborate and rigidly enforced separation of various kinds of code into protected " rings " .
The Multics operating system relied on their expanded signaling system for several critical system functions , mostly in the user ring , although cross-ring signals were possible in certain cases involving paging or memory errors .
Historically , Multics was an " early " environment , but it was not , by any analysis , a toy .
Its condition system was carefully designed , heavily tested , and had many important characteristics that influenced the later design of Lisp :
It separated the notion of condition signaling from condition handling .
It offered the possibility , through program_interrupt conditions , of resuming an erring computation , presumably after correcting the offending situation .
It began to deal with the mediation of signaling and handling through not only a condition type but also a set of associated data appropriate to that type :
By using a system - defined operator called " signal_ " instead of the normal PL / I " signal " , a data block could be associated with the condition being signaled , a crude precursor to the idea of object - oriented condition descriptions that followed later in Lisp .
It began to deal with the notion of default handling , through the use of the unclaimed_signal pseudocondition .
In the early 1980's , some former users of the Multics system , including Daniel L. Weinreb , Bernard Greenberg and David Moon , harvested the good ideas of the Multics PL / I condition system and recast them into Zetalisp , a dialect running on the Symbolics Lisp Machines .
This redesign was called simply the " New Error System " ( or sometimes just " NES " ) .
Influence of Symbolics Zetalisp on Common Lisp
Key elements of the New Error System ( NES ) in Symbolics Zetalisp were :
NES had an object - oriented nature .
NES clearly separated the treatment of exceptional situations into three logically distinct programming activities : Establishing handlers .
Managing " proceed types " ( what Common Lisp later called " restarts " ) .
Detecting exceptional situations and signaling appropriate conditions .
NES provided for erring programs to be resumed either interactively or non-interactively , separating information about prompting for replacement data from the conduits that would carry such data so that programs wishing to do mechanical recovery could bypass the prompting but use the rest of the recovery pipeline .
NES directly and strongly influenced the design of the Common Lisp condition system .
In fact , one initial concern voiced by a number of vendors was that they were fearful that somehow the ideas of the condition system , being taken from the Lisp Machine environment , would not perform well on standard hardware .
It took several months of discussion , and the availability of a free public implementation of the ideas , before these fears were calmed and the Common Lisp community was able to adopt them .
Even so , numerous small changes and a few major changes were made in the process .
In both Zetalisp and Common Lisp , handlers are functions that are called in the dynamic context of the signaling operation .
No stack unwinding has yet occurred when the handlers are called .
Potential handlers are tried in order until one decides to handle the condition .
Probably the most conspicuous change between NES and the Common Lisp Condition System was the choice of how a handler function communicated its decision to elect a specific mode of recovery for the condition being signaled .
NES used a passive recovery mechanism .
That is , in all cases , the handler would return one or more values .
The nature of the return values would determine which recovery mode ( called a " proceed type " in Zetalisp ) was to be used .
If NIL was returned , the handler had elected no proceed type , and the next handler was tried .
Otherwise , the handler must return at least one value , a keyword designating the proceed type , and , optionally , additional values which were data appropriate to that manner of proceeding .
Common Lisp uses an active recovery mechanism .
That is , any handler that wishes to designate a recovery mechanism ( called a " restart " in Common Lisp ) must imperatively transfer control to that restart .
If the handler does not transfer control , that is , if the handler returns normally , any returned values are ignored and the handler is said to have " declined " ( i.e. , elected no restart ) , and the next handler is tried .
The Maclisp Experience
I am commonly credited with the " creation " of the Common Lisp Condition System , although I hope to show through this paper that my role in the design was largely to take the ideas of others and carefully transplant them to Common Lisp .
In doing this , I relied on my personal experiences to guide me , and many of my formative experiences came from my work with Maclisp [ Pitman 1983 ] , which originated at MIT 's Project MAC ( later renamed to be the Laboratory for Computer Science ) , and which ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) PDP10 , DEC TOPS20 and Honeywell Multics systems .
Maclisp , had a relatively primitive error system , which I had used extensively .
At the time I came to the Lisp Machine 's NES , I did not know what I was looking for in an error system , but I knew , based on my experience with Maclisp , what I was not looking for .
So what impressed me initially about NES was that it had fixed many of the design misfeatures that I had seen in Maclisp .
One important bit of background on Maclisp , at least on the PDP10 implementation that I used , was that it had no STRING datatype .
In almost all cases where one might expect strings to be used , interned symbols were used instead .
Symbols containing characters that might otherwise confuse the tokenizer were bounded on either end by a vertical bar ( | ) .
Also , since symbols would normally name variables , they generally had to be quoted with a leading single quote ( ' ) to protect them from the Lisp evaluation mechanism and allow them to be used as pseudostrings .
'| This is a quoted Maclisp symbol . |
Poor Separation of Signaling and Handling in Maclisp
Maclisp had two forms of the function ERROR .
In the simple and most widely used form , one merely called ERROR with one argument , a description of the error .
Such errors would stop program execution with no chance of recovery other than to transfer to the innermost ERRSET , the approximate Maclisp equivalent of Common Lisp 's IGNORE - ERRORS .
( error ' | YOU LOSE | )
It was possible , however , in a limited way , to specify the particular kind of error .
There were about a dozen predefined kinds of errors that one could identify that did allow recovery .
For example ,
( error '|VARIABLE HAS NO VALUE| ' A ' UNBND - VRBL )
The " keyword " UNBND - VRBL was a system - defined name that indicated to the system that this was an error of kind " unbound variable " .
A specific recovery strategy was permitted in this case .
One could , either interactively in a breakpoint or through the dynamic establishment of a handler for such errors , provide a value for the variable .
If that happened , the call to ERROR would then return a list of that value and the caller of ERROR was expected to pick up that value and use it .
This worked fine for the case where the programmer knew the kind of error and was prepared to recover from it .
But a strange situation occurred when one knew the kind of error but was not prepared to recover .
Sometimes one knew one had an unbound variable , and wanted to call ERROR , but was not prepared to recover .
In this case , the programmer was forced to lie and to say that it was an error of arbitrary type , using just the short form , to avoid the misperception on the part of potential handlers that returning a recovery value would be useful .
( error '| VARIABLE HAS NO VALUE| 'A )
One feature of the NES , which I personally found very attractive , was the notion that I could freely specify the class of error without regard to whether I was prepared to handle it in some particular way .
The issue of how to handle the error was specified orthogonally .
Error Message Identity In Maclisp
In PDP10 Maclisp , error messages were historically all uppercase , since the system 's primitive error messages were that way and many users found it aesthetically unpleasant to have some messages in mixed case while others were entirely uppercase .
At some point , however , there was pressure to provide mixed case error messages .
The decision made by the Maclisp maintainers of the time was not to yield to such pressure .
The problem was that many programs faced with an error message were testing it for object identity .
For example :
( eq msg '| UNBOUND VARIABLE | )
Had we changed the case of all of the error messages in the Maclisp system to any other case , lower or mixed , these tests would have immediately begun to fail , breaking a lot of installed code and costing a lot of money to fix .
The change would have been seen to be gratuitous .
The lesson from this for all of us in the Maclisp community , which became magnified later when we confronted the broader community of international users , was that the identity of an error should not be its name .
That is , had we to do it over again , we would not have used |unbound variable| nor | Unbound Variable | as the identity of the error , but rather would have created objects whose slots or methods were responsible for yielding the presented string , but whose identity and nature was controlled orthogonally .
This was another thing that NES offered that drew me immediately to it .
Terminological Influences
At the time of the Common Lisp design , Scheme did not have an error system , and so its contribution to the dialog on condition systems was not that of contributing an operator or behavior .
However , it still did have something to contribute : the useful term continuation .
For our purposes here , it is sufficient to see a continuation as an actual or conceptual function that represents , in essence , one of possibly several " future worlds " , any of which can be entered by electing to call its associated continuation .
This metaphor was of tremendous value to me socially in my efforts to gain acceptance of the condition system , because it allowed a convenient , terse explanation of what " restarts " were about in Common Lisp .
Although Scheme continuations are , by tradition , typically passed by explicit data flow , this is not a requirement .
And so I have often found myself thankful for the availability of a concept so that I could talk about the establishment of named restart points as " taking a continuation , labeling it with a tag , and storing it away on a shelf somewhere for possible later use . "
Likewise , I found it useful in some circles to refer to some of the concepts of reflective Lisps , such as Brian Smith 's " 3 Lisp " [ Smith 1982 ] , and later work inspired by it .
I feel that the condition system 's ability to introspect ( through operators such as FIND - RESTART ) about what possible actions are pending , without actually invoking those pending actions , is an important reflective capability .
Even though Common Lisp does not offer general - purpose reflection , the ability to use this metaphor for speaking about those aspects of the language that are usefully described by it simplifies conversations .
Abstract Concepts
Having now hopefully firmly established that the formative ideas in the Common Lisp Condition System did not all spring into existence with the language itself , and are really the legacy of the community using the continuum of languages of which Common Lisp is a part , we can now turn our attention to a survey of some of the important features that Common Lisp provides .
Separating Signaling and Handling
Traditionally , " error handling " has been largely a process of programs stopping and the only real question has been " how much of the program stops ? " or " how far out do I throw ? "
It is against that backdrop that modern condition handling can be best understood .
The proper way to think about condition handling is this :
The process of programming is about saying what to do in every circumstance .
In that regard , a computer has been sometimes characterized as a " relentless judge of incompleteness " .
When a program reaches a place where there are several possible next steps and the program is unwilling or incapable of choosing among them , the program has detected an exceptional situation .
The possible next steps are called restarts .
Restarts are , effectively , named continuations .
The process of asking for help in resolving the problem of selecting among the possible next steps is called signaling .
The independently contributed pieces of code which are consulted during the signaling process are called handlers .
In Common Lisp , these are functions contributed by the dynamic call chain that are tried in order from innermost ( i.e. , most specific ) to outermost ( i.e. , most general ) .
Each handler is called with an argument that is a description of the problem situation .
The handler will transfer control ( by GO , RETURN or THROW ) if it chooses to handle the problem described by its argument .
In describing condition handling , I tell the following story to help people visualize the need for its various parts :
Think of the process of signaling and handling as analogous to finding a fork in a road that you do not commonly travel .
You do n't know which way to go , so you make known your dilemma , that is , you signal a condition .
Various sources of wisdom ( handlers ) present themselves , and you consult each , placing your trust in them because you have no special knowledge yourself of what to do .
Not all sources of wisdom are experts on every topics , so some may decline to help before you find one that is confident of its advice .
When an appropriately confident source of wisdom is found , it will act on your behalf .
The situation has been handled .
In the case that the situation is not handled , the next action depends on which operator was used to signal .
The function signal will just return normally when a condition goes unhandled .
The function error is like signal , but rather than return , it enters the debugger .
The Common Lisp debugger might allow access to low - level debugging features such as examination of individual storage locations , but it is not required to .
Its primary role is to be an interactive handler ; that is , to present the human user interactively with various options about how computation might be resumed .
Conceptually , this is the same as if it were acting as the human user 's proxy in being the element on the list of handlers , so that the human user is the source of wisdom whose choice will determine how to proceed .
Other capabilities that the debugger might offer in support of that human 's decision are probably very important in practice , but are conceptually uninteresting to this understanding of the debugger 's role in signaling and handling .
Note , too , that in some possible future world , knowledge representation may have advanced enough that handlers could , rather than act unconditionally on behalf of the signaler , merely return a representation of a set of potential actions accompanied by descriptive information respresenting motivations , consequences , and even qualitative representations of the goodness of each .
Such information might be combined with , compared to , or confirmed by recommendations from other sources of wisdom in order to produce a better result .
This is how consultation of sources of wisdom would probably work in the real world .
Consider that even a doctor who is sure of what a patient needs will ask the patient 's permission before acting .
However , this last step of confirmation , which would allow more flexibility in the reasoning process , is not manifest in Common Lisp as of the time of writing this paper .
It is an open area for future research .
Some of these issues are discussed in much greater detail in my 1990 conference paper [ Pitman 1990 ] .
Generalized Conditions
It was mentioned earlier that the space of conditions that can be used in the Common Lisp Condition System is more general than the space of mere errors .
Here are some examples .
Serious , non-error Conditions
The superclass of error is serious - condition .
This kind of condition is a subclass of condition but is serious enough that conditions of this kind should generally enter the debugger if unhandled .
Serious conditions , which the Zetalisp NES called " debugger conditions " , exist as a separately named concept from " error conditions " to accommodate things that are not semantic errors in a program , but are instead resource limitations and other incidental accomodations to pragmatics .
Suppose one writes the following :
( ignore - errors ( open " some.file " ) )
This will trap errors during the file open .
However , what if a stack overflow occurs , not for reasons of infinite recursion , but merely because the call is nested very deeply in other code ?
The answer is that a stack overflow is considered a serious condition , but not an error .
The above code is equivalent to :
( handler - case ( open " some.file " ) ( error ( c ) ( values nil c ) ) )
And since any condition representing a stack overflow is going to be a kind of SERIOUS - CONDITION , but not a kind of ERROR , the use of IGNORE - ERRORS will succeed in trapping a file error but not a stack overflow .
If one wanted to catch serious conditions as well , one would write instead :
( handler - case ( open " some.file " ) ( serious - condition ( c ) ( values nil c ) ) )
Non-serious conditions
Some conditions are not at all serious .
Such conditions might be handled , but there is an obvious default action in the case of their going unhandled .
Consider a program doing line - at - a - time output to a console .
One might assume the screen to have infinite height , and the output might look like :
( defvar * line - number * 0 ) ( defun show - lines ( lines ) ( dolist ( line lines ) ( show - line line ) ) )
However , it might be useful to specify screen line height , and to have the console pause every so many lines for a human reader to confirm that it 's ok to proceed .
There are , of course , a number of ways such a facility could be programmed , but one possible such way is to use the condition system .
For example ,
( defvar * line - number * 0 ) ( defvar * page - height * nil ) ( define - condition end - of - page ( condition ) ( ) ) ( defun show - lines ( lines ) ( dolist ( line lines ) ( show - line line ) ; Oops .

( incf * line - number * ) ( when ( and * page - height * ( zerop ( mod * line - number * * page - height * ) ) ) ( restart - case ( signal ' end - of - page ) ( continue ( ) ) ) ) ) )
In the above , there is only one way to proceed .
A restart named CONTINUE is offered as a way of imperatively selecting this option ( imperatively bypassing any other pending handlers ) , but if the handler declines and the condition goes unhandled , the same result will be achieved .
A similar kind of facility could be used to manage end of line handling .
There , it 's common to allow various modes , and so a corresponding set of restarts has to be established , which handlers would choose among .
If no handler elected to handle the condition , however , no great harm would come .
Here 's an example of how that might look :
( defvar * line - length * nil ) ( define - condition end - of - line ( condition ) ( ) ) ( defun show - line ( line ) ( let ( ( eol ( or * line - length * - 1 ) ) ( hpos 0 ) ) ( loop for pos below ( length line ) for ch = ( char line pos ) do ( write - char ch ) when ( = hpos eol ) do ( restart - case ( signal ' end - of - line ) ( wrap ( ) ( write - char # \Newline ) ( setq hpos 0 ) ) ( truncate ( ) ( return ) ) ( continue ( ) ;; just allow to continue ) ) else do ( incf hpos ) ) ) )
Independent , Reflective Specification of Restarts
It has long been the case that Lisp offered the ability to dynamically make the decision to transfer to a computed return point using the special operator THROW .
However , without reflective capabilities , there has not been the ability for a programmer to determine if there was a pending CATCH to which control could be thrown other than relatively clumsy idioms such as the following :
( ignore - errors ( throw ' some - tag ' some- value ) )
The problem with the above idiom is that while it " detects " the presence or absence of a pending tag , it only retains local control and the ability to reason about this knowledge in the case of the tag 's non-existence .
The price of detecting the tag 's existence is transfer to that tag .
The Common Lisp Condition System adds a limited kind of reflective capability in the form of a new kind of catch point , called a restart , the presence or absence of which can be reasoned about without any attempt to actually perform a transfer .
A restart can also have associated with it a descriptive textual string that a human user can be shown by the debugger to describe the potential action offered by the restart .
Restart points that require transfer of control but no data can be established straightforwardly with WITH - SIMPLE - RESTART .
For example :
( defun lisp - top - level - loop ( ) ( with - simple - restart ( exit " Exit from Lisp . " ) ( loop ( with - simple - restart ( continue " Return to Lisp toplevel . " ) ( print ( eval ( read ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Restarts that require data can also be established using a slightly more elaborate syntax .
This syntax not only accommodates the programmatic data flow to the restart , but also enough information for the Common Lisp function INVOKE - RESTART -INTERACTIVELY to properly prompt for any appropriate values to be supplied to that restart .
For example :
( defun my - symbol - value ( name ) ( if ( boundp name ) ( symbol - value name ) ( restart - case ( error ' unbound - variable : name name ) ( use - value ( value ) : report " Specify a value to use . " : interactive ( lambda ( ) ( format t " ~& Value to use : " ) ( list ( eval ( read ) ) ) ) value ) ( store - value ( value ) : report " Specify a value to use and store . " : interactive ( lambda ( ) ( format t " ~&Value to use and store : " ) ( list ( eval ( read ) ) ) ) ( setf ( symbol - value name ) value ) value ) ) ) )
Code that inquires about such restarts typically makes use of FIND - RESTART to test for the availability of a restart , and then INVOKE - RESTART to invoke a restart .
For example :
( handler - bind ( ( unbound - variable #'( lambda ( c ) ; argument is condition description ;;
Try to make unbound variables get value 17 ( dolist ( tag '( store - value use - value ) ) ( let ( ( restart ( find - restart tag c ) ) ) ( when restart ( invoke - restart restart 17 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) (+ ( my- symbol - value ' this - symbol - has - no- value ) ( my- symbol - value ' pi ) ) ) ; pi DOES have a value ! =>
20.141592653589793
Absent such a handler , the restart would be offered interactively by the debugger , as in :
(+ ( my- symbol - value ' this - symbol - has - no- value ) ( my- symbol - value ' pi ) ) Error :
The variable THIS - SYMBOL - HAS -NO -VALUE is unbound .
Please select a restart option : 1 - Specify a value to use .
2 - Specify a value to use and store .
3 - Return to Lisp toplevel .
4 - Exit from Lisp .
Option : 1 Value to use : 19 => 22.141592653589793
Handling in the Context of the Signaler
A key capability provided by Common Lisp is the fact that , at the most primitive level , handling can be done in the dynamic context of the signaler , while certain very critical dynamic state information is still available that would be lost if a stack unwind happened before running the handler .
This capability is reflected in the ability of the operator handler - bind to take control of a computation before any transfer of control occurs .
Note that the Common Lisp operator handler - case , which is more analogous to facilities offered in other languages , does not allow programmer - supplied code to run until after the transfer of control ; this is useful for some simple situations , but is less powerful .
Consider a code fragment such as :
( handler - case ( main- action ) ( error ( c ) ( other - action ) ) )
In this example , the expression ( other - action ) will run after unwinding from wherever in ( main - action ) signaled the error , regardless of how deep into main - action that signaling occured .
By contrast , handler - bind takes control inside the dynamic context of the call to SIGNAL , and so is capable of accessing restarts that are dynamically between the call to SIGNAL and the use of HANDLER - BIND .
Consider this example :
( with - simple - restart ( foo " Outer foo . " ) ( handler - case ( with - simple - restart ( foo " Inner foo . " ) ( error " Lossage . " ) ) ( error ( c ) ( invoke - restart ' foo ) ) ) )
In the above , the outer FOO restart will be selected , as contrasted with the following , where the inner FOO restart will be selected :
( with - simple - restart ( foo " Outer foo . " ) ( handler - bind ( ( error #'( lambda ( c ) ( invoke - restart ' foo ) ) ) ) ( with - simple - restart ( foo " Inner foo . " ) ( error " Lossage . " ) ) ) )
This is important because error handling tends to want to make use of all available restarts , but especially those that are in that code region that HANDLER - BIND can see but HANDLER - CASE cannot .
Consider another example :
( handler - case ( foo ) ( unbound - variable ( c ) ( let ( (r ( find - restart ' use - value c ) ) ) ( if r ( invoke - restart r nil ) ) ) ) )
The above example will not achieve its presumed intent , which is to supply NIL as the default value for any unbound variable encountered during the call to FOO .
The problem is that any USE - VALUE restart that is likely to be found will also be within the call to FOO , and will no longer be active by the time the ERROR clause of the HANDLER - CASE expression is executed .
Use of HANDLER - BIND allows this example to work in a way that is not possible with HANDLER - CASE and its analogs in other programming languages .
Consider :
( handler - bind ( error #'( lambda ( c ) ( let ( (r ( find - restart ' use - value c ) ) ) ( if r ( invoke - restart r nil ) ) ) ) ) ( foo ) )
Default Handling
Zetalisp contained a facility not only for asserting handlers to be used for conditions , but also an additional facility for asserting handlers that should be provisionally used only if no normal handlers were found .
In effect , this meant there were two search lists , a handlers list and a default handlers list , which were searched in order .
In my use of Zetalisp 's NES , I became convinced that it was conceptually incorrect to search the default handlers list in order ; I felt it should be searched in reverse order .
I had reported this as a bug , but it was never fixed .
In all honesty , I 'm not sure there was enough data then or perhaps even now to say whether I was right , although I continue to believe that default handling is something that should proceed from the outside in , not the inside out .
Nevertheless , whether I was right or not is not so much relevant in this context as is the fact that it was a point of controversy that ended up influencing the design of Common Lisp 's condition system .
I was distrustful of the operator condition - bind - default that was offered by NES , and so I omitted it from the set of offerings that I transplanted to Common Lisp .
The Common Lisp Condition System does provide a way to implement the concept of a default handler , but it is idiomatic .
And , perhaps not entirely coincidentally , it has the net effect of seeking default handlers from the outside in rather than the inside out , as I had always felt was right .
The Zetalisp mechanism looked like this :
( condition - bind - default ( ( error #'( lambda ( c ) ... default handling ... ) ) ) ... body in which handler is in effect ... )
The corresponding Common Lisp idiom looks like this :
( handler - bind ( ( error #'( lambda ( c ) ( signal c ) ; resignal ... default handling ... ) ) ) ... body in which handler is in effect ... )
In effect , the Common Lisp idiom continues the signaling process but without explicitly relinquishing control .
If the resignaled condition is unhandled , control will return to this handler and the default handling will be done .
If , on the other hand , some outer handler does handle the condition , the default handling code will never be reached and so will not be run .
Unifying " Signals " and " Exceptions "
In some systems , such as Unix , " signals " are an asynchronous mechanism primarily used for implementing event - driven programming interfaces , but are not generally used within ordinary , synchronous programming .
While it is beyond the scope of the ANSI Common Lisp standard to address the issue of either interrupts or multitasking , most Common Lisp implementations have a convergent manner of coping with these issues that is sufficiently stable as to be worth some mention .
The approach has been to separate the notion of " interrupting " from the notion of " signaling " .
That is , in Common Lisp , all signaling is synchronous .
However , such synchronous behavior can be usefully coupled with a process interruption to produce interesting effects .
In this separation , process interruptions without signaling might be done for any reason that involved the need to read or modify dynamic state of another process .
Here is an example that merely reads the dynamic state of another process :
( defvar * my - dynamic - variable * 1 ) ( let ( ( temporary - process ( mp:process - run - function " temp " '() ;;
Launch a temporary process that ;; merely dynamically binds a ;; certain variable and then ;; sleeps for a minute .
#'( lambda ( ) ( let ( ( * my- dynamic - variable * 2 ) ) ( sleep 60 ) ) ) ) ) ( result - value nil ) ) ;;
Now interrupt our temporary process ; ; to see the value of the variable ( mp: process - interrupt temporary - process #'( lambda ( ) ( setq result - value * my - dynamic - variable * ) ) ) ;;
Now wait for the interrupt to occur ( mp: process - wait " not yet assigned " # '( lambda ( ) result - value ) ) ; tests for a non-null value ;;
If we get this far , the result - value has been assigned ;; and can be returned .
result - value ) => 2
Note that this merely examines the dynamic state of our temporary process , but does not invoke any signaling mechanism at all .
And while the process of interruption is inherently asynchronous , the actions to be done in the interrupted process are synchronous .
If we instead intertwine the notion of process interruption with signaling , we get what some systems might call " asynchronous signaling " , but which Common Lisp views as just the composition of two orthogonal facilities .
So , for example , a keyboard interrupt to a process might be accomplished by :
( define-condition keyboard - interrupt ( ) ( ( character :initarg : character : reader kbd- char ) ) ( : report ( lambda ( condition stream ) ( format t " The character ~@ : C was typed . " ( kbd - char condition ) ) ) ) ) ( defun keyboard - interrupt ( process character ) ( mp:process - interrupt process #'( lambda ( ) ;;
Offer the process a chance to handle the condition . ;;
If the condition is not handled , the call to SIGNAL returns ;; and the interrupt is completed .
Normal process execution ;; then continues .
( signal ' keyboard - interrupt : character character ) ) ) )
Using such a facility , a keyboard process ( itself a synchronous activity ) can asynchronously interrupt another process ( presumably , the window selected at the point an interrupt character is seen ) .
( defvar * selected - window * nil ) ( defun keyboard - process ( raw - keyboard - stream ) ( loop ( let ( ( char ( read - char raw - keyboard - stream ) ) ) ( when * selected - window * ( if ( is-interrupt - character ? char ) ( keyboard - interrupt ( window - process * selected - window * ) char ) ;; otherwise ... ( add- to- input - buffer * selected - window * char ) ) ) ) ) )
Although the KEYBOARD - PROCESS shown here will interrupt the window process , an understanding of what happens at that point does not require any special knowledge of asynchrony .
It merely requires observing that at the time of interruption , the other process was about to execute some expression ( exp ) and will now execute instead
( progn ( funcall interrupt - function ) ( exp ) )
This kind of structured approach removes much of the mystery and unpredictability normally associated with asynchronous interrupts in other systems , where the description of the effect is often not linguistic at all but deals in overly concrete terms of bits and registers in a way that only career experts can hope to navigate .
The sense in the Common Lisp community is that a correct conceptual treatment of these issues makes these sorts of capabilities something that " mere mortals " can safely and conveniently employ in their programming .
Open Issues
The Dylan language patterned its efforts after the Common Lisp Condition System , but made some interesting changes .
I probably lack the appropriate experience and surely the appropriate objectivity to conclude whether their changes are clear improvements over the Common Lisp approaches .
But it 's plain that by making divergent decisions in some places , the Dylan community has identified certain areas of the Common Lisp design as " controversial " .
Restarts vs Handlers
Common Lisp provides parallel but unrelated operators such as HANDLER - BIND and HANDLER - CASE for dealing with handlers , and RESTART - BIND and RESTART - CASE for dealing with restarts .
It was thought that these were orthogonal operations , requiring unrelated dataflow , that really did n't belong intermingled .
The Dylan community has sought to coalesce these by making restarts into a kind of condition , and eliminating special binding forms for them .
The " Condition Firewall "
Probably the most controversial semantic component of the Common Lisp condition system is what has come to be called the " condition firewall " .
The idea behind the condition firewall is that a given handler should be executed in an environment that does not " see " intervening handlers that might have been established since its establishment .
So , for example , consider this code :
( handler - case ( handler - bind ( ( error #'( lambda ( condition ) ( declare ( ignore condition ) ) ( error ' unbound - variable : name ' fred ) ) ) ) ( handler - case ;; Signal an arbitrary error : ( error " Not an UNBOUND - VARIABLE error . " ) ( unbound - variable ( c ) ( list ' inner c ) ) ) ) ( unbound - variable ( c ) ( list ' outer c ) ) )
This sets up two handlers for conditions of class UNBOUND - VARIABLE , one outside of the scope of the general - purpose handler for conditions of class ERROR and one inside of its scope .
At the time the " arbitrary " error signaled , both handlers are in effect .
This means that if the error being signaled had been of class UNBOUND - VARIABLE , it would have been caught by the inner HANDLER - CASE for UNBOUND - VARIABLE .
However , as the search for a handler proceeds outward , the handlers that are tried are executed in a context where the inner handlers are no longer visible .
As such , the above example yields
( OUTER #< ERROR UNBOUND-VARIABLE 12A39B87 >)
By contrast , the following code :
( handler - case ( handler - bind ( ( error #'( lambda ( condition ) ( declare ( ignore condition ) ) ( error ' unbound - variable : name ' fred ) ) ) ) ( handler - case ( error ' unbound - variable : name ' marvin ) ( unbound - variable ( c ) ( list ' inner c ) ) ) ) ( unbound - variable ( c ) ( list ' outer c ) ) )
yields
( INNER #< ERROR UNBOUND-VARIABLE 12A39B87 >)
It is interesting to note as an aside that the " resignaling trick " used earlier in the discussion of default handling relies implicitly on the condition firewall in order to avoid infinite recursion .
Without the condition firewall , a different mechanism for implementing default handling is needed .
The designers of the Dylan language chose to eliminate the condition firewall , perhaps out of necessity since the most useful restarts almost always occur in the dynamic space near the point of signal , and the handlers usually occur farther out .
If handlers could only see the restarts farther out than where they were established , they would not see the most useful restarts .
( I am personally doubtful of this argument , and am more inclined to believe that this is why restarts should not have been turned into a kind of condition in Dylan , but I could be wrong and time will tell . )
The Dylan notation is different in many ways from Common Lisp , but the approximately equivalent code to the above two examples would both , I believe , return
( INNER #< ERROR UNBOUND-VARIABLE 12A39B87 >)
Summary
Language features do n't originate spontaneously out of nowhere .
We have surveyed some of the origins of the Common Lisp Condition System in an effort to demonstrate how prior experiences , both good and bad , have influenced the present design .
Nor is this the end of the story .
The ideas in Common Lisp have had some influence on other languages and will , I hope , continue to do so , since there are a number of things the Common Lisp makes easy through its condition system that other languages do not .
We have also seen that good terminology is important both to the specification of a programming language and to its community acceptance .
Programming is not only a technical endeavor , but a social one .
So much of so many lives is spent doing programming , that it is critical that we have good terminology , beyond the terms of the language itself , for talking among each other about what we are doing within the language .
And we have surveyed some of the key features that distinguish Common Lisp 's condition system from those offered by other languages , and highlighted some open issues , where Common Lisp 's answers to certain problems have already met with challenges .
During the design of Common Lisp , I headed the committee that produced the design of the condition system .
At that time , there were many questions and doubts about the design :
Were the decisions sound ?
Were all of the alternatives explored , or were there better ways we might later wish we 'd tried ?
Were there problems lurking under the surface , waiting to bite someone when used under heavier stress ?
It was n't that people doubted our committee 's competence , but rather many would - be reviewers lacked the relevant experience to critically analyze our proposals .
Yet the design seemed mostly right to me , and my larger concern was that if we did n't at some point release it to a community of users to try , we'd be back at the same design table a few years later with the same questions and the same lack of community experience to answer them .
A leap of faith seemed to be required to move ahead .
So I and my committee nodded our collective heads and said we stood by the design .
Personally , I had some doubts about some details , but I found it counterproductive to raise them because I believed the risk of not trying these things out was higher than the risk of trying them .
In my experience , much of language design is like this .
We think we know how it will all come out , but we do n't always .
Usage patterns are often surprising , as one learns if one is around long enough to design a language or two and then watch how expectations play out in reality over a course of years .
So it 's a gamble .
But the only way not to gamble is not to move ahead .
I once saw an interview on television with a font designer from Bitstream Inc. about how he conceptualized the process of font design .
It is not about designing the shape of the letters , he explained , much to my initial surprise .
Then he went on to explain that it was really about the shape of words .
The font shapes play into that , but they are not , in themselves , the end goal .
Programming language design is like that , too .
It 's not about the semantics of individual operators , but about how those operators fit together to form sentences in programs .
Unlike the situation with fonts , where whole books can be viewed instantly in a new font to see how the design works , we do n't know in advance what sentences will be made in a programming language .
We have to wait and see what people choose to write .
Common Lisp took a step forward , and while we can quibble endlessly over whether any given design decision was right , the one design decision I 'm most certain was right was to offer the community a rich set of capabilities that would empower them not only to write programs , but also to have a stake in future designs .
Never again will I fear sending out e-mail to a design group asking for advice about what the semantics of HANDLER - BIND should be and finding that no one has an opinion !
To me , that kind of progress , the evolution of a whole community 's understanding , is the best kind of progress of all .

A Post By : Darren Rowse
In this post we want to give you 12 tips for taking great group photos .
One of the most common types of digital photographs is the ‘ group photo ‘ .
They happen everywhere from weddings , to camps , to parties , to sporting teams , to school etc .
There must be thousands of group photos taken each day around the world – however unfortunately many of the group photos that I see in my friendship group and on Flickr would leave their photographers disappointed with the results for a variety of reasons .
Common group photo mistakes and problems include :
one or more subjects always seem to be looking away or in different directions ( ie at different photographers )
subjects blinking ( there ’s always one )
someone being missing from the photo
different moods in the group ( some smiling , some serious , some playing up to the camera etc )
the group being too far away or not all fitting into the shot
While there will always be such challenges with Group Photos there are a number of things you can do to help improve your chances of getting the shot you ’re after :
1. Prepare
There is nothing that will make of people posing for a photograph turn upon you faster than you not being prepared .
People do n’t like to be kept waiting so think ahead about some of the following aspects of your photo :
scope out the location of your shot before hand
think ahead about how you will pose people and frame your shot
one of the group ’s head hiding behind another person
make sure everyone you want in the shot knows you want them a few minutes ahead of time
make your your camera is on and has charged batteries
2. Location
The place that you have your group stand is important to group shots for a number of reasons .
For starters it can give the photo context – for example a shot of a sporting team on their playing field means more than a shot of them in front of a brick wall .
The other reason that choosing locations carefully is important is that it can have distractions in it .

Choose a position where your group will fit , where there is enough light for the shot and where there is no distractions in the background .
Also avoid setting up a group shot directly in front of a window where the light from your flash might reflect back in a way that destroys your shot .
3. Take Multiple Shots
One of the best ways to avoid the problems of not everyone looking just right in a shot is to take multiple photos quickly .
I often switch my camera into continuous shooting mode when taking group shots and shoot in short bursts of shots .
I find that the first shot is often no good but that the one or two directly after it often give a group that looks a little less posed and more relaxed .
Similarly – shoot some frames off before everyone is ready – sometimes the organization of a group shot can be quite comical with people tell each other where to go and jostling for position .
Also mix up the framing of your shots a little if you have a zoom lens by taking some shots that are at a wide focal length and some that are more tightly framed .
4. Get in Close
Try to get as close as you can to the group you ’re photographing ( without cutting some members of it out of course ) .
The closer you can get the more detail you ’ll have in their faces – something that really lifts a shot a lot .
If your group is a smaller one get right in close to them and take some head and shoulder shots .
One effective technique for this is to get your small group to all lean their heads in close to enable you to get in even closer .
Another way to get in closer is to move people out of a one line formation and stagger them but putting some people in front and behind .
5 . Pose the group
In most cases your group will pose itself pretty naturally ( we ’ve all done it before ) .
Tall people will go to the back , short people to the front .
But there are other things you can do to add to the photo ’s composition :
If the event is centered around one or two people ( like a wedding or a birthday ) make them the central focal point by putting them right in the middle of the group ( you can add variation to your shots by taking some of everyone looking at the camera and then everyone looking at the person / couple ) .
For formal group photos put taller members in the group not only towards the back of the group but centered with shorter people on the edges of the group .
Try not to make the group too ‘ deep ’ ( ie keep the distance between the front line of people and the back line as small as you can ) .
This will help to keep everyone in focus .
If the group is ‘ deep ’ use a narrower aperture .
Tell everyone to raise their chins a little – they ’ll thank you later when they see the shot without any double chins !
6. Timing Your Shoot Well
Pick the moment for your shot carefully .
Try to choose a time that works with what is happening at the gathering that you ’re at .
I find it best to do a group shot when the group is already close together if possible and when there is a lull in proceedings .
Also towards the start of events can be a good time as everyone is all together , they all look their best and if there is alcohol involved no one is too under the weather yet .
7 . Think about Light
In order to get enough detail in your subjects you need to have sufficient light .
The way you get this varies from situation to situation but consider using a flash if the group is small enough and you are close enough for it to take effect – especially if the main source of light is coming from behind the group .
If it ’s a bright sunny day and the sun is low in the sky try not to position it directly behind you or you ’ll end up with a collection of squinting faces in your shot .
8. Take Control
I ’ve been in a number of group photos where the photographer almost lost control of his subjects by not being quick enough but also by not communicating well with their group of subjects .
It is important to keep talking to the group , let them know what you want them to do , motivate them to smile , tell them that they look great and communicate how much longer you ’ll need them for .
Also important is to give your subjects a reason to pose for the photograph .
For example at a wedding you might motivate people to pose by saying ‘( ( insert name of couple being married here ) ) have asked me to get some group shots ’ or at a sporting event ‘ lets take a group photo to celebrate our win’ .
When you give people a reason to pose for you you ’ll find they are much more willing to take a few minutes to pose for you .
Another very useful line to use with group is – ‘ If you can see the camera it can see you ’ .
This one is key if you want to be able to see each person ’s face in the shot .
If there are more photographers than just you then wait until others have finished their shots and then get the attention of the full group otherwise you ’ll have everyone looking in different directions .
Of course you do n’t want to be a dictator when posing your group or you could end up with lots of group shots of very angry people .
The best photographers know how to get people ’s attention , communicate what they want but also keep people feeling relaxed and like they are having fun .
9 . For large groups
Large groups of people can be very difficult to photograph as even with staggering people and tiering to make the back people higher you can end up being a long way back to fit everyone in .
One solution to this is to find a way to elevate yourself as the photographer .
If I ’m photographing a wedding and the couple wants one big group shot I ’ll arrange for a ladder to be present ( I ’ve even climbed up onto church roofs ) to take a shot looking down on the group .
In doing this you can fit a lot more people in and still remain quite close to the group ( you end up with a shot of lots of faces in focus and less bodies ) .
It also gives an interesting perspective to your shots – especially if you have a nice wide focal length .
10 . Use a Tripod
There are a number of reasons why using a tripod when taking photographs of groups can be useful .
Firstly a tripod communicates that you ’re serious about what you ’re doing and can help you get their attention ( it ’s amazing what a professional looking set up can make people do ) .
Secondly it gives you as the photographer more freedom to be involved in the creation of the posing of your subjects .
Set your camera up on your tripod so that ’s ready to take the shot in terms of framing , settings and focus and then it will be ready at an instant when you get the group looking just right to capture the moment .
11 . Use an Assistant
If you have a very large group and assistant can be very handy to get the group organized well .
An assistant is also incredibly handy if you are taking multiple group shots ( like at a wedding when you ’re photographing different configurations of a family ) .
In these cases I often ask the couple to provide me with a family or friend member who has a running sheet of the different groups of people to be photographed .
I then get this person to ensure we have everyone we need in each shot .
Having a family member do this helps to make sure you do n’t miss anyone out but also is good because the group is familiar with them and will generally respond well when they order them around .
12 . Smile
Yes YOU should smile !
There ’s nothing worse than a grumpy stressed out photographer .
Have fun and enjoy the process of getting your shots and you ’ll find the group will too .
I usually come home from a wedding which I ’ve photographed with an incredibly sore jaw - line from all the smiling because I find the best way to get the couple and their family to relax and smile is to smile at them .
It really does work .

「 " read " になることはできませんでした」のひみつ
" はじめ に "
コンピュータを使っているとたまに奇っ怪な日本語に出会うことがあります。
たとえば 、Windows NT や Windows 2000 を使っている人は次のようなウィンドウを 見たことがあるかもしれません :
この「 メモリが " read " になることはできませんでした 」 という文章を初めて見た人は、みんな目が点になると思います。
このコラムは、この 「謎の日本語」がどこからやってきたのかを解明しつつ、
国際化/ローカライゼーションの難しさについて考えてみたいと思います。
蓋然的な考 察
この変な日本語がどこからやってきたのかを考えてみると、
まず直感的に思いつくのは、 「 これは英語メッセージの直訳なのではないか。
そしてその訳が不適切だったのではないか 」 という仮定です。このことは、もともと
Windows という OS が アメリカ発祥であることと、read という英単語を そのまま使っていることからも正しいのではないかと推測できます。 コンピュータに詳しい人ならば、少しばかり推理を働かせることにより、 このメッセージがメモリ保護違反によって 引き起こされたエラーを通知するもので、 より日本語らしい日本語で言い直せ ば
「 メモリを読むことができませんでした 」 という意味になることが理解できると思います。
さて、こうなると、この文の原文がどうだったかが気になるところです。
日本語と英語との間の文法の違いや基礎語彙の包含関係のズレなどによって、
辞書に載っている意味で和訳すると、しばしば珍妙な日本語が生まれます。
逆にいえば、そのクセを見抜ければ元の文を復元できるとも言えます。
そこで、まずは和訳後の和文からもとの英文を推測してみることにします。
「なる」という意味の言葉として日本人にとってなじみの深い英単語は 「 become」なので、とりあえずこれを使ってこの文を英語に「直訳」すると、
The memory could not become " read " .
となります。しかし、これでは元の日本語と同じ奇っ怪さを持った
英文になってしまいます。 いくらなんでも和訳前のメッセージがこんなアホなメッセージなわけがありません。
ここで謎を解くヒントとなるのは、次のダイアログです:
ここでは、「 read」の代わりに「 written」という単語が使われています。 もうわかりましたか？
日本人はついつい忘れがちなのですが、 「 なる」という意味を含んだもっと一般的な動詞があります。
それはいわゆる be 動詞と呼ばれるものです。これを使って英訳すれば、
The memory could not be " read " .
となります。 この二重引用符で囲まれた 「 " read " 」 という単語を名詞として解釈すれば、 確かに 「 " read " になれない」という翻訳もできなくはありませんが、
普通はそうは訳しません。つまり、この「read」は過去分詞であり、
全体としては受動態の文章なのです。 直訳すれば、「そのメモリは読まれることができませんでした」となります。
もっと自然な日本語に直すなら、主語を省略した能動態に変えて
「そのメモリを読むことができませんでした」とするべきでしょうね。
これなら意味が通りますし、さきほど述べた
「メモリ保護違反によって引き起こされたエラーの通知 」 としての意味とも合致します。
答えあわ せ
さて、上の仮説は正しいのでしょうか。 これは実際に英語の
Windows を入れてみればわかります。 じゃじゃーん :
というわけで、まさにそのとおりでした。
さて、これを見てあなたはどう思うでしょうか？
「 MS は、なんでこんな中学生でもしないようなアホな間違いをするんだ？ 」 と思うかもしれません。あるいは、 「 MS は、メッセージを機械翻訳に通すだけでチェックをしないという 手抜きをしてるのではなか？ 」と思うかもしれません。 しかし、本当にこれはアホな間違いなのでしょうか？ あるいは本当にこれはそんな単純な手抜きの産物なのでしょうか？ 以下では、なんでこんなことになったのか検証してみます。
検証
Spy ++
この件の背景を探るためには、 まず 「 このウィンドウを誰が出しているのか」を突き止めるところから始めます。 このためには 、Visual Studio に付属する Spy++ というツールが便利です。 このツールを起動し、ウィンドウファインダというツールを使うと、
マウスカーソルで指定した任意のウィンドウの各種属性を知ることができ、
この中にはそのウィンドウを所有するプロセスの
ID が含まれています。 そして、プロセス ID がわかれば、そこからさらに実行ファイル名もわかります :
このようにして、このウィンドウを出しているのが
CSRSS というモジュールであるということが判明します。
CSRSS.EXE
CSRSS.EXE はタスクマネージャで見るといつも常駐しているプロセスです。 その実行ファイルは c:\winnt\system32 フォルダにあります。
さて、英語版の CSRSS.EXE の中身を grep などで検索してみると、 どこに も
「 The memory could not be " read " . 」 というような文字列がないことがわかります。 この場合、この EXE ファイル以外の何らかのファイルにこの文字列が あるということになります。 どのファイルにあるのかははっきりとはわからないのですが、 とりあえずはこの EXE ファイルと関係が深いファイルということで、 この EXE ファイルがリンクしている DLL を調べてみることにします 。
dumpbin
EXE ファイルがどんな DLL をリンクしているかを 調べる目的には 、Visual Studio に付属する dumpbin ユーティリティの / dependents オプションが便利です。これを使うと次のような出力が得られます :
c:\home > dumpbin / dependents \winnt\system32\CSRSS.EXE
Microsoft ( R ) COFF / PE Dumper Version 7.00.9466 Copyright ( C ) Microsoft Corporation .
All rights reserved .
Dump of file \winnt\system32\CSRSS.EXE
File Type : EXECUTABLE IMAGE
Image has the following dependencies : CSRSRV.dll ntdll.dll Summary 1000 .reloc 1000 .rsrc 1000 . text
これにより 、CSRSS.EXE が CSRSRV.dll と ntdll.dll という二つの DLL をリンクしていることが判明します。
ここでこの二つのファイルの中を検索すると、ntdll.dll
が 上記の文字列を含んでいることがわかります。
リソースエディ タ
より詳細に知るために、この DLL を Visual Studio の統合環境の リソースエディタで開いてみます :
( Visual Studio .
Net ではデフォルトでリソースエディタが開きますが、 古いバージョンの Visual Studio ではそうではないため、 プルダウンメニューで明示的にリソースエディタで開くよう指定します )
さて、開いてみると、ストリングテーブルなどはなく、
代わりに謎のバイナリファイルが埋めこまれていることがわかります:
これはおそらく 、Visual Studio の mc.exe というツールでコンパイルされた、 メッセージカタログのバイナリであると推測されます。 現在では通常、文字列を保持するためにはリソースのストリングテーブルを 使いますが、昔はこういう風にしてメッセージを保持していました。
さて、このカタログバイナリを検索すると、次のような箇所があります:
これが目的の文字列に他なりません。日本語版の ntdll.dll では、 次のように UTF - 16 で表現されています :
このように、メッセージをカタログファイルに分離しておき、
カタログファイルだけを入れ換えることによって、
プログラム本体のソースを変更することなしに表示言語を切り替えるという方法は、
国際化でよく使われる手法です。
この両者を観察すると、次のことがわかります:
これらの文字列は、C 言語の printf 形式のフォーマット文字列であり、 両方とも %lx と %s という二つの変換子を含む 。
この二つの変換子の登場する順番は同じである。
" read " や " written " はカタログ化されていない 。
このことから推測されることは、
このメッセージは、直接 printf ファミリ関数のフォーマット文字列として 渡されるのであろう。よって、このメッセージでは 英語版と同じ順序で %lx と %s の二つを登場させる必要がある 。
" read " や " written " は、 %s を置換する文字列としてソース中に直接記述されているようだ。 よって、プログラム本体のソースを変更することなしに これらの文言を変更することはできない 。
ということであり、このことから導かれる結論は、
日本語化担当者には、 プログラム本体のソースを変更する手段および権限が与えられていないか、 与えられていても非常に制限されている 。
ということですね。政治の世界ではよくあることです。
とどのつまり、 「 " read " になることはできませんでした」という珍妙な日本語は、
このような制限のもとで如何にしてこのメッセージを表示するかということに
頭をひねった日本語化担当者の苦肉の策だったといえます。
決して誤訳ではないのです。
結論
この話は、メッセージカタログという国際化の仕組みを利用しているにもかかわらず、
その利用法が不適切だったために ちゃんとしたローカライゼーションができなかった例ということになります ( 「 『gmake : 入りますディレクトリ』のひみつ 」 という文章はもう必要ありませんよね？ ) 。
ソフトウェアのローカライゼーションというのは、
政治的にも、技術的にも、いろいろと難しい問題を含んでいることがわかりますね。
このことは以前に BSD マガジンでも書きましたし、あるいは SRC が出してい る 「 ソフトウェアローカリゼーション実践ハンドブック 」
という本を読むと、先人の苦労を垣間見ることができます。

Smoke Rings
The tobacco industry duped both academic journals and the media .
By George Monbiot , published in the Guardian , 7th February 2006
Three weeks ago , while looking for something else , I came across one of the most extraordinary documents I have ever read .
It relates to an organisation called Arise , which stands for Associates for Research into the Science of Enjoyment .
Though largely forgotten today , in the 1990s it was one of the world ’s most influential public health groups .
First I should explain what it claimed to stand for .
Arise was founded in 1988 and seems to have been active until 2004 .
It described itself as “ a worldwide association of eminent scientists who act as independent commentators ” ( 1 ) .
Its purpose , these eminent scientists claimed , was to show how “ everyday pleasures , such as eating chocolate , smoking , drinking tea , coffee and alcohol , contribute to the quality of life . ” ( 2 )
It maintained that there were good reasons for dropping our inhibitions and indulging ourselves .
“ Scientific studies show that enjoying the simple pleasures in life , without feeling guilty , can reduce stress and increase resistance to disease .
…
Conversely , guilt can increase stress and undermine the immune system …
This can lead to , for instance , forgetfulness , eating disorders , heart problems or brain damage .
” ( 3) The “ health police ” , as Arise sometimes called them ( 4 ) , could be causing more harm than good .
Arise received an astonishing amount of coverage .
Between September 1993 and March 1994 , for example , it generated 195 newspaper articles and radio and television interviews , in places like the Wall Street Journal , the International Herald Tribune , the Independent , the Evening Standard , El Pais , La Repubblica , RAI and the BBC ( 5 ) .
Much of this coverage resulted from a Mori poll , called “ Naughty but Nice ” , that Arise claimed to have commissioned , into the guilty pleasures people enjoyed most .
Here is a typical example ( this one was written by Reuters ) :
“ Puritanical health workers who dictate whether people should smoke or drink alcohol and coffee are trying to ruin the quality of life , a group of academics said . …
“ Many of us hold the view that it is a person ’s right to enjoy these pleasures … , ” said Professor David Warburton , a professor of pharmacology at Reading University in England . …
“ Much of health promotion is based on misinformation .
It is politically driven ” . ” ( 6 )
The Today programme gave David Warburton an uncontested interview in the prime spot – at 8.20 am .
He extolled the calming properties of cigarettes and poured scorn on public health messages ( 7 ) .
Arise has also featured three times in the Guardian .
Coverage like this continued until October 2004 , when the Times repeated Arise ’s claim that we should stop “ worrying about often ill - founded health scares ” and “ listen to our bodies , which naturally seek to protect themselves from disease by doing the things we enjoy . ” (8 ) In hundreds of articles and transcripts covering its assertions , I have found just one instance of a journalist – Madeleine Bunting in the Guardian – questioning either Arise ’s science or the motivation of the scientists ( 9 ) .
The man who claimed to run the group , Professor David Warburton , was head of psychopharmacology at the University of Reading .
During the period in which it was active , he published at least a dozen articles on nicotine in the academic press .
In 1989 , in The Psychologist , he mocked the finding by the US Surgeon - General that nicotine is addictive ( 10 ) .
Most of his articles were published in the journal Psychopharmacology , of which he was a senior editor .
They maintained that nicotine improved both attention and memory .
I have read seven of these papers ( 11 ) .
On none of them could I find a declaration of financial interests , except for two grants from the Wellcome Trust .
In 1998 , as part of a settlement of a class action against the tobacco companies in the US , the firms were obliged to place their internal documents in a public archive .
Among them is the one I came across last month .
It is a memo from an executive in the corporate services department of Philip Morris – the world ’s largest tobacco company – to one of her colleagues .
The title is “ Arise 1994 - 95 Activities and Funding ” ( 12 ) .
“ I had a meeting , ” she began , “ with Charles Hay and Jacqui Smithson ( Rothmans ) to agree on the 1994 - 1995 activity plan for Arise and to discuss the funding needed .
Enclosed is a copy of our presentation . ”
This showed that in the previous financial year , Arise had received $ 373,400 .
Of this , $ 2000 had come from Coca - cola , $ 900 from other firms and the remainder from Philip Morris , British American Tobacco , RJ Reynolds and Rothmans ( 13 ) .
Over 99 % of its funding , in other words , had been provided by the tobacco companies .
For 1994 - 95 , Arise ’s budget would be $ 773,750 .
Rothmans and RJ Reynolds had each committed to provide $ 200,000 of this , and BAT “ has also shown interest ” .
She suggested that Philip Morris put up $ 300,000 .
Then the memo becomes even more interesting .
“ The previous ‘ Naughty but Nice ’ Mori poll proved to be very effective in getting wide media coverage .
The exercise will be repeated this year on the theme of ‘ Stress in the Workplace ’ …
A draft questionnaire was already submitted to T. Andrade and M. Winokur for comments . ” ( Tony Andrade was Philip Morris ’s senior lawyer ( 14 ) , and Matt Winokur its director of regulatory affairs ( 15 ) ) .
“ We decided to hold , ” it continued , Arise ’s next conference in Europe , because of the “ positive European media coverage ” ( 16 ) .
Philip Morris had appointed a London PR agency to run the media operation , set up Arise ’s secretariat and help to recruit new members .
Arise ’s “ major spending authorisation and approval would be handled by an ‘ informal ’ Budget Committee involving PM , Rothmans and possibly RJR and BAT . ” ( 17 )
The memo suggests , in other words , that Arise was run and managed not by eminent scientists but by eminent tobacco companies .
This impression is reinforced by another document in the tobacco archive , which explains how the group began .
“ In 1988 the US Surgeon General said : “ Nicotine was as addictive as heroin or cocaine . ”
The industry responded .
A group of academics was identified and called together to : – review the science of substance abuse , – separate nicotine from these substances ” ( 18 ) .
I sent a list of questions to Professor Warburton , but he told me that he did not have time to answer them ( 19 ) .
Reading University replied that it knew Professor Warburton ’s work had been sponsored by the tobacco companies .
Indeed , the university itself had received over £ 300,000 from Arise , though “ from the University ’s standpoint , the source of funding for Arise has always been vague ” ( 20 ) .
It revealed that “ Professor Warburton and the University of Reading were in receipt of BAT research funding between 1995 and 2003 . ”
But at no time had it questioned this funding or sought to oblige Warburton to declare his interests in academic papers .
Astonishingly , it suggested that this would amount to “ censorship ” and “ restricting academic freedom ” ( 21 ) .
The journal Psychopharmacology told me that it was unaware that Professor Warburton had been taking money from the tobacco companies .
“ It is an author ’s responsibilty to disclose sources of funding , and widely understood that journals themselves do not expect to police this declaration . ” ( 22 )
After a long career untroubled by questions about his interests or his professional ethics , David Warburton retired in 2003 .
He still lectures at Reading as Emeritus Professor .
How much more science is being published in academic journals with undeclared interests like these ?
How many more media campaigns against “ over - regulation ” , the “ compensation culture ” or “ unfounded public fears ” have been secretly funded and steered by corporations ?
How many more undeclared recipients of corporate money have been appearing on the Today programme , providing free public relations for their sponsors ?
This case suggests to me that both academia and the media have failed dismally to exercise sufficient scepticism .
Surely there is one obvious question with which every journal and every journalist should begin .
“ Who ’s funding you ? ”

A 40 - year - old woman who is being studied by neurobiologists because of her near - perfect memory says her ability to recall nearly every detail in her life is a gift that she would n't want to lose .
But like all the rest of us , when she goes to the store she sometimes forgets something she meant to buy .
The woman , called simply " AJ " by the researchers to protect her privacy , has become a bit of an international celebrity since her story was revealed a couple of weeks ago by scientists at the University of California at Irvine .
But she has declined numerous requests for interviews .
She did consent , however , to answer a few questions from ABCNEWS.com users that were forwarded to her through neurobiologist James L. McGaugh , a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a pioneer in memory research .
" AJ " has been studied for the past five years by McGaugh and two other scientists at Irvine , Elizabeth Parker , a clinical professor of psychiatry and neurology , and Larry Cahill , an associate professor of neurobiology and behavior .
So far , they have been unable to determine why she has such an extraordinary memory , but further studies , including brain scans , are planned .
She is quite different from some extraordinary individuals who are able to recall such things as the specific day that any date fell on , and major news events of that day .
In most cases , those with that kind of ability suffer some losses in other areas .
That includes the much celebrated case of a Russian patient called " S , " who had a terrific memory but suffered from a condition known as synesthesia , in which sounds have a distinct smell , and colors have a certain taste .
Synesthesia proved tragic for " S , " eventually making it difficult for him to function .
Interestingly , " AJ " says she has " a bit of this condition , " but it has not made her life more difficult .
Her life actually sounds pretty routine .
She goes to work like the rest of us , was n't particularly outstanding in school , and finds her gift a useful device for entertaining friends .
What seems to govern partly her ability to remember details of the past is whether she found them interesting .
She was n't a scholar , she says , because she found school boring .
But her memory is remarkable .
In 2003 , for example , she was asked by the researchers to write down all the Easter dates from 1980 on .
She wrote all 24 dates in 10 minutes and included what she was doing on each of those dates , but she was off by a couple of days on one of them .
Two years later , when she was asked without warning to do it again , she got them all right .
The most frequent question ABCNEWS.com received since first writing about " AJ " is how far back here memories go .
Did she remember her birth ?
No , she says .
" My first memory is of me , in the crib , about 18 months old , and being woken up by my uncle 's dog . "
Below are some of the questions that she answered through McGaugh .
Question :
This extraordinary ability has undoubtedly had a dramatic effect on your life .
Do you consider it a blessing or a curse ?
Answer : I think of it as my life 's burden , but as I have gotten older I have come to realize that I would not want to change it .
This is me !
Question :
How has it affected your relationship with others ?
Answer :
It does not have an effect on any of my relationships .
What it is , though , is a wonderful conversation piece and I also love to surprise people with my remembering ability .
Question :
We know from the research that you lead a normal life , but can you tell us something about your daily routine , like the type of work you do ?
Answer : I am an administrator in a private corporation and I work A LOT .
Question :
Are you married , and does this have an effect on your relationship with your husband , if there is one ?
Answer :
When I first met my husband he was a bit surprised and puzzled by this , especially when I told him what day his close relatives were born ( after he gave me their birth dates , of course ) , but he loves to brag to people about me .
Contrary to what I have read about myself in some blogs , I have never used my " memory " against my husband .
Question :
Does this ability make anything easier , or harder , for you ?
Did it , for example , affect your academic achievements ?
Answer : I was not an excellent student like everyone thinks I would be .
In fact , I was bored by school and never really liked it .
Question :
Are there some things you would like to forget , but can't ?
Answer : THERE SURE ARE !!!!!!!!!!
Question :
Are there some things you 've had difficulty remembering ?
If so , can you describe one or two ?
Answer :
When it comes to work , or even when I need to go to the store , I always have to make my lists , or I will not get everything done .
Question :
Are you conscious of making a special effort to remember some things ?
Answer : I do n't have to make an effort to remember .
I just do .
Question :
Why do you think you have this special ability ?
Answer : I HAVE NO CLUE !!!
Would love to know , and that is why I contacted the doctors in the first place .

Introduction
The purpose of this document is to share some ideas that I 've developed over the years about how to develop a certain kind of application for which the term " server " is only a weak approximation .
More accurately , I 'll be writing about a broad class of programs that are designed to handle very large numbers of discrete messages or requests per second .
Network servers most commonly fit this definition , but not all programs that do are really servers in any sense of the word .
For the sake of simplicity , though , and because " High - Performance Request - Handling Programs " is a really lousy title , we 'll just say " server " and be done with it .
I will not be writing about " mildly parallel " applications , even though multitasking within a single program is now commonplace .
The browser you 're using to read this probably does some things in parallel , but such low levels of parallelism really do n't introduce many interesting challenges .
The interesting challenges occur when the request - handling infrastructure itself is the limiting factor on overall performance , so that improving the infrastructure actually improves performance .
That 's not often the case for a browser running on a gigahertz processor with a gigabyte of memory doing six simultaneous downloads over a DSL line .
The focus here is not on applications that sip through a straw but on those that drink from a firehose , on the very edge of hardware capabilities where how you do it really does matter .
Some people will inevitably take issue with some of my comments and suggestions , or think they have an even better way .
Fine .
I 'm not trying to be the Voice of God here ; these are just methods that I 've found to work for me , not only in terms of their effects on performance but also in terms of their effects on the difficulty of debugging or extending code later .
Your mileage may vary .
If something else works better for you that 's great , but be warned that almost everything I suggest here exists as an alternative to something else that I tried once only to be disgusted or horrified by the results .
Your pet idea might very well feature prominently in one of these stories , and innocent readers might be bored to death if you encourage me to start telling them .
You would n't want to hurt them , would you ?
The rest of this article is going to be centered around what I 'll call the Four Horsemen of Poor Performance :
Data copies Context switches Memory allocation Lock contention
There will also be a catch - all section at the end , but these are the biggest performance - killers .
If you can handle most requests without copying data , without a context switch , without going through the memory allocator and without contending for locks , you 'll have a server that performs well even if it gets some of the minor parts wrong .
Data Copies
This could be a very short section , for one very simple reason : most people have learned this lesson already .
Everybody knows data copies are bad ; it 's obvious , right ?
Well , actually , it probably only seems obvious because you learned it very early in your computing career , and that only happened because somebody started putting out the word decades ago .
I know that 's true for me , but I digress .
Nowadays it 's covered in every school curriculum and in every informal how - to .
Even the marketing types have figured out that " zero copy " is a good buzzword .
Despite the after - the - fact obviousness of copies being bad , though , there still seem to be nuances that people miss .
The most important of these is that data copies are often hidden and disguised .
Do you really know whether any code you call in drivers or libraries does data copies ?
It 's probably more than you think .
Guess what " Programmed I/O " on a PC refers to .
An example of a copy that 's disguised rather than hidden is a hash function , which has all the memory - access cost of a copy and also involves more computation .
Once it 's pointed out that hashing is effectively " copying plus " it seems obvious that it should be avoided , but I know at least one group of brilliant people who had to figure it out the hard way .
If you really want to get rid of data copies , either because they really are hurting performance or because you want to put " zero - copy operation " on your hacker - conference slides , you 'll need to track down a lot of things that really are data copies but do n't advertise themselves as such .
The tried and true method for avoiding data copies is to use indirection , and pass buffer descriptors ( or chains of buffer descriptors ) around instead of mere buffer pointers .
Each descriptor typically consists of the following :
A pointer and length for the whole buffer .
A pointer and length , or offset and length , for the part of the buffer that 's actually filled .
Forward and back pointers to other buffer descriptors in a list .
A reference count .
Now , instead of copying a piece of data to make sure it stays in memory , code can simply increment a reference count on the appropriate buffer descriptor .
This can work extremely well under some conditions , including the way that a typical network protocol stack operates , but it can also become a really big headache .
Generally speaking , it 's easy to add buffers at the beginning or end of a chain , to add references to whole buffers , and to deallocate a whole chain at once .
Adding in the middle , deallocating piece by piece , or referring to partial buffers will each make life increasingly difficult .
Trying to split or combine buffers will simply drive you insane .
I do n't actually recommend using this approach for everything , though .
Why not ?
Because it gets to be a huge pain when you have to walk through descriptor chains every time you want to look at a header field .
There really are worse things than data copies .
I find that the best thing to do is to identify the large objects in a program , such as data blocks , make sure those get allocated separately as described above so that they do n't need to be copied , and not sweat too much about the other stuff .
This brings me to my last point about data copies : do n't go overboard avoiding them .
I 've seen way too much code that avoids data copies by doing something even worse , like forcing a context switch or breaking up a large I /O request .
Data copies are expensive , and when you 're looking for places to avoid redundant operations they 're one of the first things you should look at , but there is a point of diminishing returns .
Combing through code and then making it twice as complicated just to get rid of that last few data copies is usually a waste of time that could be better spent in other ways .
Context Switches
Whereas everyone thinks it 's obvious that data copies are bad , I 'm often surprised by how many people totally ignore the effect of context switches on performance .
In my experience , context switches are actually behind more total " meltdowns " at high load than data copies ; the system starts spending more time going from one thread to another than it actually spends within any thread doing useful work .
The amazing thing is that , at one level , it 's totally obvious what causes excessive context switching .
The # 1 cause of context switches is having more active threads than you have processors .
As the ratio of active threads to processors increases , the number of context switches also increases - linearly if you 're lucky , but often exponentially .
This very simple fact explains why multi- threaded designs that have one thread per connection scale very poorly .
The only realistic alternative for a scalable system is to limit the number of active threads so it's ( usually ) less than or equal to the number of processors .
One popular variant of this approach is to use only one thread , ever ; while such an approach does avoid context thrashing , and avoids the need for locking as well , it is also incapable of achieving more than one processor 's worth of total throughput and thus remains beneath contempt unless the program will be non-CPU - bound ( usually network - I/O- bound ) anyway .
The first thing that a " thread - frugal " program has to do is figure out how it 's going to make one thread handle multiple connections at once .
This usually implies a front end that uses select / poll , asynchronous I/O , signals or completion ports , with an event - driven structure behind that .
Many " religious wars " have been fought , and continue to be fought , over which of the various front - end APIs is best .
Dan Kegel 's C10 K paper is a good resource is this area .
Personally , I think all flavors of select / poll and signals are ugly hacks , and therefore favor either AIO or completion ports , but it actually does n't matter that much .
They all - except maybe select ( ) - work reasonably well , and do n't really do much to address the matter of what happens past the very outermost layer of your program 's front end .
The simplest conceptual model of a multi - threaded event - driven server has a queue at its center ; requests are read by one or more " listener " threads and put on queues , from which one or more " worker " threads will remove and process them .
Conceptually , this is a good model , but all too often people actually implement their code this way .
Why is this wrong ?
Because the # 2 cause of context switches is transferring work from one thread to another .
Some people even compound the error by requiring that the response to a request be sent by the original thread - guaranteeing not one but two context switches per request .
It 's very important to use a " symmetric " approach in which a given thread can go from being a listener to a worker to a listener again without ever changing context .
Whether this involves partitioning connections between threads or having all threads take turns being listener for the entire set of connections seems to matter a lot less .
Usually , it 's not possible to know how many threads will be active even one instant into the future .
After all , requests can come in on any connection at any moment , or " background " threads dedicated to various maintenance tasks could pick that moment to wake up .
If you do n't know how many threads are active , how can you limit how many are active ?
In my experience , one of the most effective approaches is also one of the simplest : use an old - fashioned counting semaphore which each thread must hold whenever it 's doing " real work " .
If the thread limit has already been reached then each listen - mode thread might incur one extra context switch as it wakes up and then blocks on the semaphore , but once all listen - mode threads have blocked in this way they wo n't continue contending for resources until one of the existing threads " retires " so the system effect is negligible .
More importantly , this method handles maintenance threads - which sleep most of the time and therefore dont ' count against the active thread count - more gracefully than most alternatives .
Once the processing of requests has been broken up into two stages ( listener and worker ) with multiple threads to service the stages , it 's natural to break up the processing even further into more than two stages .
In its simplest form , processing a request thus becomes a matter of invoking stages successively in one direction , and then in the other ( for replies ) .
However , things can get more complicated ; a stage might represent a " fork " between two processing paths which involve different stages , or it might generate a reply ( e.g. a cached value ) itself without invoking further stages .
Therefore , each stage needs to be able to specify " what should happen next " for a request .
There are three possibilities , represented by return values from the stage 's dispatch function :
The request needs to be passed on to another stage ( an ID or pointer in the return value ) .
The request has been completed ( a special " request done " return value )
The request was blocked ( a special " request blocked " return value ) .
This is equivalent to the previous case , except that the request is not freed and will be continued later from another thread .
Note that , in this model , queuing of requests is done within stages , not between stages .
This avoids the common silliness of constantly putting a request on a successor stage 's queue , then immediately invoking that successor stage and dequeuing the request again ; I call that lots of queue activity - and locking - for nothing .
If this idea of separating a complex task into multiple smaller communicating parts seems familiar , that 's because it 's actually very old .
My approach has its roots in the Communicating Sequential Processes concept elucidated by C.A.R .
Hoare in 1978 , based in turn on ideas from Per Brinch Hansen and Matthew Conway going back to 1963 - before I was born !
However , when Hoare coined the term CSP he meant " process " in the abstract mathematical sense , and a CSP process need bear no relation to the operating - system entities of the same name .
In my opinion , the common approach of implementing CSP via thread - like coroutines within a single OS thread gives the user all of the headaches of concurrency with none of the scalability .
A contemporary example of the staged - execution idea evolved in a saner direction is Matt Welsh 's SEDA .
In fact , SEDA is such a good example of " server architecture done right " that it 's worth commenting on some of its specific characteristics ( especially where those differ from what I 've outlined above ) .
SEDA 's " batching " tends to emphasize processing multiple requests through a stage at once , while my approach tends to emphasize processing a single request through multiple stages at once .
SEDA 's one significant flaw , in my opinion , is that it allocates a separate thread pool to each stage with only " background " reallocation of threads between stages in response to load .
As a result , the # 1 and # 2 causes of context switches noted above are still very much present .
In the context of an academic research project , implementing SEDA in Java might make sense .
In the real world , though , I think the choice can be characterized as unfortunate .
Memory Allocation
Allocating and freeing memory is one of the most common operations in many applications .
Accordingly , many clever tricks have been developed to make general - purpose memory allocators more efficient .
However , no amount of cleverness can make up for the fact that the very generality of such allocators inevitably makes them far less efficient than the alternatives in many cases .
I therefore have three suggestions for how to avoid the system memory allocator altogether .
Suggestion # 1 is simple preallocation .
We all know that static allocation is bad when it imposes artificial limits on program functionality , but there are many other forms of preallocation that can be quite beneficial .
Usually the reason comes down to the fact that one trip through the system memory allocator is better than several , even when some memory is " wasted " in the process .
Thus , if it 's possible to assert that no more than N items could ever be in use at once , preallocation at program startup might be a valid choice .
Even when that 's not the case , preallocating everything that a request handler might need right at the beginning might be preferable to allocating each piece as it's needed ; aside from the possibility of allocating multiple items contiguously in one trip through the system allocator , this often greatly simplifies error - recovery code .
If memory is very tight then preallocation might not be an option , but in all but the most extreme circumstances it generally turns out to be a net win .
Suggestion # 2 is to use lookaside lists for objects that are allocated and freed frequently .
The basic idea is to put recently - freed objects onto a list instead of actually freeing them , in the hope that if they 're needed again soon they need merely be taken off the list instead of being allocated from system memory .
As an additional benefit , transitions to / from a lookaside list can often be implemented to skip complex object initialization / finalization .
It 's generally undesirable to have lookaside lists grow without bound , never actually freeing anything even when your program is idle .
Therefore , it 's usually necessary to have some sort of periodic " sweeper " task to free inactive objects , but it would also be undesirable if the sweeper introduced undue locking complexity or contention .
A good compromise is therefore a system in which a lookaside list actually consists of separately locked " old " and " new " lists .
Allocation is done preferentially from the new list , then from the old list , and from the system only as a last resort ; objects are always freed onto the new list .
The sweeper thread operates as follows :
Lock both lists .
Save the head for the old list .
Make the ( previously ) new list into the old list by assigning list heads .
Unlock .
Free everything on the saved old list at leisure .
Objects in this sort of system are only actually freed when they have not been needed for at least one full sweeper interval , but always less than two .
Most importantly , the sweeper does most of its work without holding any locks to contend with regular threads .
In theory , the same approach can be generalized to more than two stages , but I have yet to find that useful .
One concern with using lookaside lists is that the list pointers might increase object size .
In my experience , most of the objects that I 'd use lookaside lists for already contain list pointers anyway , so it 's kind of a moot point .
Even if the pointers were only needed for the lookaside lists , though , the savings in terms of avoided trips through the system memory allocator ( and object initialization ) would more than make up for the extra memory .
Suggestion # 3 actually has to do with locking , which we have n't discussed yet , but I 'll toss it in anyway .
Lock contention is often the biggest cost in allocating memory , even when lookaside lists are in use .
One solution is to maintain multiple private lookaside lists , such that there 's absolutely no possibility of contention for any one list .
For example , you could have a separate lookaside list for each thread .
One list per processor can be even better , due to cache - warmth considerations , but only works if threads cannot be preempted .
The private lookaside lists can even be combined with a shared list if necessary , to create a system with extremely low allocation overhead .
Lock Contention
Efficient locking schemes are notoriously hard to design , because of what I call Scylla and Charybdis after the monsters in the Odyssey .
Scylla is locking that 's too simplistic and / or coarse - grained , serializing activities that can or should proceed in parallel and thus sacrificing performance and scalability ; Charybdis is overly complex or fine - grained locking , with space for locks and time for lock operations again sapping performance .
Near Scylla are shoals representing deadlock and livelock conditions ; near Charybdis are shoals representing race conditions .
In between , there 's a narrow channel that represents locking which is both efficient and correct ... or is there ?
Since locking tends to be deeply tied to program logic , it 's often impossible to design a good locking scheme without fundamentally changing how the program works .
This is why people hate locking , and try to rationalize their use of non-scalable single - threaded approaches .
Almost every locking scheme starts off as " one big lock around everything " and a vague hope that performance wo n't suck .
When that hope is dashed , and it almost always is , the big lock is broken up into smaller ones and the prayer is repeated , and then the whole process is repeated , presumably until performance is adequate .
Often , though , each iteration increases complexity and locking overhead by 20 - 50 % in return for a 5 - 10 % decrease in lock contention .
With luck , the net result is still a modest increase in performance , but actual decreases are not uncommon .
The designer is left scratching his head ( I use " his " because I 'm a guy myself ; get over it ) .
" I made the locks finer grained like all the textbooks said I should , " he thinks , " so why did performance get worse ? "
In my opinion , things got worse because the aforementioned approach is fundamentally misguided .
Imagine the " solution space " as a mountain range , with high points representing good solutions and low points representing bad ones .
The problem is that the " one big lock " starting point is almost always separated from the higher peaks by all manner of valleys , saddles , lesser peaks and dead ends .
It 's a classic hill - climbing problem ; trying to get from such a starting point to the higher peaks only by taking small steps and never going downhill almost never works .
What 's needed is a fundamentally different way of approaching the peaks .
The first thing you have to do is form a mental map of your program 's locking .
This map has two axes :
The vertical axis represents code .
If you 're using a staged architecture with non-branching stages , you probably already have a diagram showing these divisions , like the ones everybody uses for OSI - model network protocol stacks .
The horizontal axis represents data .
In every stage , each request should be assigned to a data set with its own resources separate from any other set .
You now have a grid , where each cell represents a particular data set in a particular processing stage .
What 's most important is the following rule : two requests should not be in contention unless they are in the same data set and the same processing stage .
If you can manage that , you 've already won half the battle .
Once you 've defined the grid , every type of locking your program does can be plotted , and your next goal is to ensure that the resulting dots are as evenly distributed along both axes as possible .
Unfortunately , this part is very application - specific .
You have to think like a diamond - cutter , using your knowledge of what the program does to find the natural " cleavage lines " between stages and data sets .
Sometimes they 're obvious to start with .
Sometimes they 're harder to find , but seem more obvious in retrospect .
Dividing code into stages is a complicated matter of program design , so there 's not much I can offer there , but here are some suggestions for how to define data sets :
If you have some sort of a block number or hash or transaction ID associated with requests , you can rarely do better than to divide that value by the number of data sets .
Sometimes , it 's better to assign requests to data sets dynamically , based on which data set has the most resources available rather than some intrinsic property of the request .
Think of it like multiple integer units in a modern CPU ; those guys know a thing or two about making discrete requests flow through a system .
It 's often helpful to make sure that the data - set assignment is different for each stage , so that requests which would contend at one stage are guaranteed not to do so at another stage .
If you 've divided your " locking space " both vertically and horizontally , and made sure that lock activity is spread evenly across the resulting cells , you can be pretty sure that your locking is in pretty good shape .
There 's one more step , though .
Do you remember the " small steps " approach I derided a few paragraphs ago ?
It still has its place , because now you 're at a good starting point instead of a terrible one .
In metaphorical terms you 're probably well up the slope on one of the mountain range 's highest peaks , but you 're probably not at the top of one .
Now is the time to collect contention statistics and see what you need to do to improve , splitting stages and data sets in different ways and then collecting more statistics until you 're satisfied .
If you do all that , you 're sure to have a fine view from the mountaintop .
Other Stuff
As promised , I 've covered the four biggest performance problems in server design .
There are still some important issues that any particular server will need to address , though .
Mostly , these come down to knowing your platform / environment :
How does your storage subsystem perform with larger vs. smaller requests ?
With sequential vs. random ?
How well do read - ahead and write - behind work ?
How efficient is the network protocol you 're using ?
Are there parameters or flags you can set to make it perform better ?
Are there facilities like TCP_CORK , MSG_PUSH , or the Nagle - toggling trick that you can use to avoid tiny messages ?
Does your system support scatter / gather I/O ( e.g. readv / writev ) ?
Using these can improve performance and also take much of the pain out of using buffer chains .
What 's your page size ?
What 's your cache - line size ?
Is it worth it to align stuff on these boundaries ?
How expensive are system calls or context switches , relative to other things ?
Are your reader / writer lock primitives subject to starvation ?
Of whom ?
Do your events have " thundering herd " problems ?
Does your sleep / wakeup have the nasty ( but very common ) behavior that when X wakes Y a context switch to Y happens immediately even if X still has things to do ?
I 'm sure I could think of many more questions in this vein .
I 'm sure you could too .
In any particular situation it might not be worthwhile to do anything about any one of these issues , but it 's usually worth at least thinking about them .
If you do n't know the answers - many of which you will not find in the system documentation - find out .
Write a test program or micro- benchmark to find the answers empirically ; writing such code is a useful skill in and of itself anyway .
If you 're writing code to run on multiple platforms , many of these questions correlate with points where you should probably be abstracting functionality into per-platform libraries so you can realize a performance gain on that one platform that supports a particular feature .
The " know the answers " theory applies to your own code , too .
Figure out what the important high - level operations in your code are , and time them under different conditions .
This is not quite the same as traditional profiling ; it 's about measuring design elements , not actual implementations .
Low - level optimization is generally the last resort of someone who screwed up the design .
DIGG THIS
I ’m wondering .
Help me wonder .
Either Georgie Bush is the minor , depressing , witless ferret I think he is , or I am .
It has to be one or the other .
If things do n’t start looking up pretty soon internationally , I ’m going to be pretty sure which .
As best as I can tell , what the Maximum Cipher lacks , among an inexhaustible list of other things , is a hop - toad ’s understanding of how people work .
Here we have the explanation of just about everything he does .
He ’s dealing with a world full of people , but has no idea what people are .
He probably could n’t recognize one .
So he does n’t take their predictable behavior into account .
Think about it .
When he went braying into Iraq like a learning - disabled jackass , he thought people would roll over , throw flowers , and have a democratic revolution .
This would start a domino effect that would make all the other Moslem countries want to be democracies too .
They would climb over each other to be democracies .
They would love us because democracies love each other .
He just knew it .
This makes perfect sense if you have no freaking idea how human beings work .
Of course , if you have read any history , which Bush has n’t , you will have noticed that people do not like being occupied by force .
They do n’t like having their cities bombed .
It galls them .
It can , under certain circumstances ( such as any circumstances ) make them hostile .
If you think in terms of abstractions too simple for Reader ’s Digest , you might reflect as follows :  Democracy good .
Iraqi people , love ’m democracy , so love ’m us .
Urrrg.
Then you might be real surprised when their gratitude was exiguous after you remorselessly wrecked their cities , killed their army ( which consisted of other people ’s husbands , brothers , and sons : ever think of that ? ) , groped their women when you did n’t have time to rape them , and left them without water and electricity .
I ’m not saying the Iraqis ought to dislike these things , only that pretty reliably they will dislike them .
The Afghans too , or either .
It ’s how people are .
Ungrateful .
Bush has no idea how people are .
This crackpot Boyscouterine outlook runs through everything the little man does , or more correctly tries to do .
He really believes it , I think :
The world is just waiting for us to bring it our favorite abstractions .
They hate us for our freedoms , and yearn to be bombed into having them .
People do n’t work that way .
Bush does n’t know it .
Remember when he had Kind - of - Twofer Rice publicly offer help to the Syrian opposition so they would overthrow their evil dictator and become wildly democratic ?
Same problem .
Nobody told her , the poor bat - brained thing , that people do n’t like being messed with by outsiders .
Nor , being Secretary of State , did she know how intensely the United States is detested by most of the world .
How would she know ?
It ’s a secret known only to eight billion select people .
Bush would n’t have a clue if you gave him another one .
Remember when Baffled Boy wanted all the Moslem countries to have elections and be democracies ?
And was all surprised when it worked , and he got Hamas and all ?
Let ’s ponder this .
The analysis will be difficult , but I have faith in my readers .
What happens when you have elections in a country in which most of the people hate you ?
We ’ll do this by multiple choice , to give everyone an even chance .
Answer : they elect a government that ( a ) loves you , loves Israel , and wants desperately to do everything you tell it to , or ( b ) hates your guts .
If you went for ( a ) , you are a Republican and have no idea how people actually work .
And you probably listen to ooom - pa music .
Nowadays our Keystone President , ever impervious to reason , experience , or the obvious , leers at Iran like a deviant in a nudie bar .
( He probably wears a raincoat when thinking about policy . )
He figures that the Iranians too want to be attacked in the name of unasked - for virtue .
It did n’t work in Iraq , or in Afghanistan , so it will work in Iran .
He wants to encourage Iranian dissidents so that they will overthrow the evil mullahs and set up a yes Democracy , and love us , and be our drinking buddies and sit the dog while we go on vacation .
How is he going to cause them to rise up in love for us ?
By massively bombing several hundred places in Iran , killing many thousands of its people , and humiliating them in the eyes of the world .
Why , what could make more sense ?
Sense anyway if you do n’t know enough about people to grasp that nationalism trumps internal divisions .
They will of course rally ’round the flag , because people do n’t like being messed with by outsiders .
Bush does n’t understand this .
He does n’t know about people .
Let us suppose that you do n’t like Bush .
If the Chinese bombed your home , and killed your sister , would that make you join the Chinese and want a puppet government ?
It is not how people work .
As we speak , the Israelis have pretty much destroyed Lebanon .
Bush keeps the UN from doing anything to interfere , and sends advanced bombs to the Israelis so they can blow up anything that ’s left .
He thought — get this — that since Hezbollah is Shiite , the Sunnis would join with ( yes ! Yes ! )
Israel to fight them .
Was there ever such a fruitcake ?
( I like to think of a fruitcake in a raincoat . )
He had no idea how people work .
It ’s breathtaking .
He has occupied and made rubble of two Moslem countries , and heavily supports Israel , hated by all Moslem countries , in turning Lebanon , a third Moslem country into rubble , and is threatening Syria and Iran , two more Moslem countries , with attack , possibly nuclear .
By doing this he is going to inspire Moslems with a passion for American democracy , change the Mid-East into Fifth Century Athens , and make them love us .
God Almighty , what a fool .
What a bus-station clown .
It is n’t how people work .
The same fertile stupidity shows in his relations with Latin America .
The first thing to recognize about the world below Laredo is that the countries there deeply , deeply resent American meddling .
Whether you think the resentment justified , or the meddling for that matter , is irrelevant .
Rule
One of diplomacy here is  do n’t get into Latin faces unless you really need to . 
So what does Befuddlement do ?
Some Cuban officials came to Mexico City and checked into a Sheraton .
He had the Sheraton eject them .
It was utterly childish , and utterly pointless ( you do n’t suppose there might be another hotel in Mexico City , do you ? ) and infuriated Mexico .
People are still angry .
And sympathetic to Cuba .
But Cuba does not practice democracy , and to Dudley Do-Right , or the Do-Right Dud , the abstraction is what counts .
Cuba bad , democracy good , urg .
Bow - wow .
He has no faint idea of how people work .
The man is an idiot .
An old reporter ’s saying holds that a burro is an ass , and a burrow is a hole in the ground .
A newsman , it is said , should know the difference .
Maybe presidents too .

The Best of Fred Reed
Want to go travelling on a long term backpacking trip but can’t find a friend at home who ’ll come with you ?
Worried about the idea of going travelling on your own but really want to see some places ?
Here ’s seven tips to give you some reassurance and to urge you to seize the moment and do it .
I left the UK in December 2002 and spent 18 months travelling solo in Australia and South East Asia , and eventually wound up settling down with my American girlfriend who I ’d met on the road in Thailand , where we still live today .
When I left the UK I was pretty much petrified at the idea of travelling alone , so this is what I wish someone had told me :
1 ) You wo n’t be alone for long
Do n’t think by leaving home on your own you are somehow going to condemn yourself to a six month trip of solitude and loneliness .
If you go backpacking anywhere in the world , you are going to meet likeminded people who are interested in travelling as much as you and who have gone travelling on their own too .
You get to meet people who actively want to do the things you do rather than having to cajole friends at home into an experience they might not enjoy or be ready for .
You need to be with people who are into it , not who need to be coerced into it .
The easiest way to meet people when travelling is to get involved in activities – go on an organised week long roadtrip in the Australian outback , for example , or go and do some scuba diving somewhere for a few days , or do a cooking course – whatever interests you .
In this way you will meet new people and be in a shared situation where conversation comes easily .
Similarly , in backpacker hostels and the like , simply strike up conversation with someone with a smile .
The old “ Hey guys , I ’m on my own , mind if I join you ? ” line rarely fails , although you need a bit of courage to say it first .
Not looking like an axe murderer is also useful .
Seek out hostels and hotels that have independent travellers in mind as their primary customers – these places are mindful that they have many solo travellers and so try to have communal areas and many organised activities – whether it ’s an evening barbeque or a daytrip – for you to join and so easily make connections .
A great example of this is Bangkok ’s Lub ’d hostel ( pronounced Lub Dee – it ’s Thai for “ good sleep ” ) which you can see from the numerous guest reviews is considered one of the most friendly places to stay in Thailand .
I ’ve written a short article about how to find other travel companions online through websites like CouchSurfing .com before you even leave your house .
You might as well increase your chances of meeting likeminded people before you go travelling , and it can be a good psychological boost to have a plan to meet other people abroad .
Female travellers might feel an understandable extra sense of trepidation about travelling solo , but millions of other women have travelled alone already , and there is plenty of great advice about solo travel for women to help you .
There ’s also specific advice about being a solo female traveller if you ’re heading to Bali .
You might also want to consider travelling in a small group with a reputable adventure specialist like G Adventures or Intrepid Travel if going solo is too much to begin with .
These companies specialise in bringing together solo travellers to enjoy travelling with a small group , so making new friends and sharing the journey .
Many people use these trips to bolster their self - confidence and then strike out on their own .
When I was in Australia I did several week - long trips like this and made some great friends as a result .
2 ) Cut loose from your life
Going travelling on your own lets you literally leave everything behind – work , family and friends .
This is what makes it scary and also what makes it so intensely liberating .
If you travel with a friend from home , you both travel in a bubble of familiarity with each other .
On your own , you have absolute freedom to do what you want and you do n’t have to conform to the expectations that work , friends and family inevitably put upon you .
Of course , you have email and cell phones that will let you stay in touch pretty much anywhere in the world , but you can still pick and choose when you have contact with home .
Unless you ’re massively serious about your boy / girlfriend , you should probably take a time out with them before you leave , otherwise it will only cause heartache when the inevitable travel romance occurs .
If you * are * massively serious about your boy / girlfriend , you need to come up with some ground rules about what ’s acceptable while you are apart from each other if you want things to pick up where they left off when you come home .
Trying to conduct a long distance relationship while travelling can be gruelling for both parties .
3 ) Know your own mind
Making the decision to travel solo is a great step , but it ’s important to know what it is you actually want to do while travelling .
Avoid falling into the trap of just doing what other backpackers do – there ’s a definite travel circuit in most countries for backpackers to follow , which is incredibly useful , but only if you are interested in the things included in that circuit .
There could be lots of other stuff in the country you are visiting that is a bit off the beaten track that is of much more personal interest to you .
Therefore it pays off massively to do some research and reading * before * you go .
[ I ’ve written How To Budget For A Backpacking Trip if you want some pointers on managing your money while planning your trip ] .
For example , I knew I wanted to do more scuba diving when I went to Australia .
After a couple of false starts , I really got into it .
Subsequently my travelling in
Oz was driven largely by visiting good places to dive and when I was in Thailand I eventually became a scuba diving instructor .
( Yes , I liked it that much ! ) .
Many of these diving locations were n’t really on the backpacker circuit so I had to make my own plans to get there .
In doing so , I met loads of great people who were into diving as well plus , of course , I got to dive some of Australia ’s most awesome sites .
If I ’d just stuck to the traditional backpacker route , I would n’t have gone to these places .
Of course , you can just go with the flow and see what happens – there ’s a definite danger of overplanning which you should avoid .
You do n’t need to stake out and book an entire day by day itinerary for your trip or anything so rigid .
My point is simply to think about the overall goals of where YOU ’D like to go and what YOU ’D like to do , irrespective of what other people say .
4 ) Become comfortable dealing with the unfamiliar
When I first left the UK , I stopped off in Bangkok , Thailand for 3 days en route to Sydney ( I could n’t face the 24 hour direct flight ) .
It ’s fair to say my first encounter with Bangkok scared the crap out of me .
( I recounted my first days in Bangkok if you want to know more ) .
Ironically , I now live in Bangkok these days .
( See my Thailand Backpacking : A Quick Guide for more info ) .
Travelling is hard for the first few weeks because you are dealing with constantly unfamiliar situations and surroundings – it is unavoidably stressful .
It ’s also what causes homesickness , because there is a yearning for the familiar .
Within the first week of travelling , though , you will simply start to relax into it as your mind grows accustomed to dealing with this constant input of new information .
You ’ll start to discern the patterns of travelling – find location , find transport , find hotel , repeat – and find the continual change of logistics as routine .
The great thing about humans – and a skill that does n’t seem to get much emphasis these days – is that we are incredibly adaptable .
We naturally adjust quickly to new surroundings , for all that we think we might not .
So if you ’re at home reading a travel guidebook and thinking , “ there is no way I figure out all of this on my own ” , do n’t worry .
You will .
When I left the UK , I was really lacking in self - confidence about travelling in a country where I did n’t speak the language .
Australia is the answer for US and UK travellers who feel the same – it ’s incredibly exotic and there are hundreds of fascinating things to do and see there , but the language barrier is not a problem .
Here you can get into the rhythm of meeting other people while you ’re travelling and trying out new things like scuba diving , skydiving and surfing .
Within a few weeks your confidence will have grown and you ’ll be ready to take on anywhere .
I went travelling in Thailand , Vietnam and Cambodia with some girls I ’d met in Australia and had a spectacular time – my worries about language dissolved because everyone in Asia speaks enough English for you to get by and I ’d developed the confidence to start a conversation , smile , and speak slowly and clearly .
( But not patronisingly , like they ’re stupid ) .
Treat people like people .
I have found this to be a winning formula everywhere I ’ve been .
It ’s important to not feel embarrassed or self - conscious about stepping up and speaking to the locals wherever you go .
They will invariably be friendly in return .
Have patience if they do n’t understand your English at first – they ’re the ones who speak a second language utterly alien to their own , unlike you .
State what you want simply and clearly – do n’t use slang .
Most of all , smile and be friendly .
Do n’t act all suspicious like you expect them to rip you off at any moment .
It really is true that 90 per cent of communication is body language .
5 ) Make new friends and be influenced by people
You will see and do some amazing things wherever you travel in the world – but what makes your trip truly spectacular is the people you meet along the way .
Solo travelling exacerbates this because you are much more open to talking to other people because you have no one else around .
Again , that can be a scary feeling sometimes , but the pleasure of meeting new people makes it worth it .
Not only are friendships made much quicker and are more intense while travelling , but sometimes the bond formed is more than just circumstance and can transform into lifelong friendships .
I am still in regular contact with numerous people I met while travelling .
Meeting other people exposes you to so many other points of view , ideas and opinions , which can set your mind off on paths you ’d never previously considered .
It ’s also a great excuse to get drunk and talk rubbish to each other all night .
A worthwhile caveat here is that you should n’t feel that every day has to be a party – admittedly I did spend most of my first two months in Sydney and Melbourne somewhat inebriated , but by about the fourth month I ’d calmed down a bit .
A quiet night in with a good book can still be fun – again , it ’s about doing what you want to do , not what you feel obliged to do , or what you think you * should * be doing .
People are terrified of being lonely , because it ’s equated with being a loser .
There are inevitably going to be evenings when you ’re travelling solo where you will feel a bit lonely .
It ’s then that you realise there ’s things that are a lot worse than being lonely and it also makes you appreciate your friends all the more .
If you ’ve got a good book , or a journal or a sense of purpose about your trip beyond just seeing the sights ( see below ) , the times you ’re alone do n’t have to be lonely , and indeed , can be a welcome respite from the intensity of travelling .
6 ) Do whatever you want ( as long as it ’s legal )
While it ’s true that you are on holiday when travelling , it ’s worth avoiding your brain atrophying .
Travel gives you the freedom to not only think about what you want to do with your life but also to go and do it right away .
Give yourself permission to investigate the stuff you ’re interested in , however whacky it may be .
Whether is clothes and fashion , archaeology , video games , conservation , elephants , sharks , religion , oranges , bugs , architecture – whatever it is , allow yourself to spend some time looking into it .
If you see your surroundings as more than just the backdrop to your holiday , as the stuff of real life and how other people live , you ’ll get a lot more out of them .
In a similar vein , give yourself permission to be creative too – many people like keeping a journal while they ’re travelling , or sketching what they see .
Reading a lot can be fun too , especially about the country around you .
Most people go snaphappy and get really good taking pics with their camera .
I wrote half a novel while I was travelling – I ’ll never do anything with it , but it was fun all the same .
By churning through ideas and trying out stuff – even if it does n’t go anywhere – you give yourself new ways of thinking about stuff .
This might come in useful for thinking about how things will be when you come home .
7 ) Bring a new perspective with you when you get home
The old cliché is that travel broadens the mind , but travel can also change your mind too , about your job , your circumstances and your general situation back home .
That might sound scary , but it ’s a good thing – you re-evaluate your life and feel ready to make some changes for the better .
Similarly , things can change at home too .
Usually they do n’t – while you have been living in hyperspeed intense travel mode , life back home continues as normal , which is what makes it so comforting to return to .
But be sensitive around your friends when you get back – do n’t just endlessly brag about your travel stories .
Pay attention to what ’s been going on with them and your friendships will pick up where they left off .
How long you decide to stay at home is up to you .
You may decide that your trip was great fun but you ’re ready to take on new challenges at home .
Or you may decide you want to save up some cash and get back on a plane as soon as possible .
Either way , once you ’ve gone travelling solo once , you ’ll bring home a whole load more confidence and perspective on your life that will help you in the future wherever you are .
The bottom line is , I have never , ever heard of anyone who went travelling solo and came back regretting that they ’d done it .
There ’s a lot more I could write , but I ’ve gone on long enough .
What do you think ?
For people who are thinking about solo travelling , are there issues I have n’t addressed here ?
For people who have been solo travelling , do you agree or disagree with any of the above ?
Please leave comments below .
Thanks !

VISTA , Calif . —
The largest skateboard ramp in the world can be found on a 12 - acre farm north of San Diego among the green foothills of the San Marcos Mountains .
Pilots routinely adjust their flight paths for a closer look , which is as good a way as any to sum up the scale of the Mega Ramp .
The wooden structure is longer than a football field , as tall as an eight - story building , with a creek bed running through a 70 - foot breach .
On a recent sunny afternoon , the ramp ’s owner , Bob Burnquist , a renowned 30 - year - old professional skateboarder from Brazil , peered over the side to treetops below and said : “ I ’m not afraid of falling .
I ’m afraid I might jump . ”
That mind - set helps on the Mega Ramp , where skaters reach speeds of up to 55 miles an hour and soar like stuntmen .
Are you stuck in middle management hell ?
A generation of workers can't get ahead - because aging boomers above them wo n't budge .
Here 's how to break through the gray ceiling .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Jon Ciampi had always thought of himself as a rising star .
A portfolio analyst for Wells Fargo in San Francisco , he had a solid job at a big company , pulled down an enviable salary , and scored top marks on his performance reviews .
Sure , he was stuck doing some grunt work , and , yeah , working till after midnight was n't unusual .
But he was only 29 !
He was doing everything his bosses asked him to !
How long could it be before he'd be running the place ?
Then he started doing the math .
The head of his division was 50 , easily a decade or more away from retirement .
The six managers who reported to the division head were all in their mid-40s and had settled into their jobs for the long haul .
Below them was Ciampi 's boss : an ambitious thirtysomething MBA who , even by Ciampi 's standards , put in incredible hours .
But even though he and his boss were killing themselves , neither seemed to be on a promotion track .
There was simply nowhere to promote them to .
Then came the final straw : Wells Fargo ( Charts ) installed another fifty - something at his boss 's level , who , Ciampi says , did n't know a thing about the business .
" It really ticked me off , " he says .
" I realized I 'm not going to move up until the people above me do . "
How long would it be before Ciampi 's star actually rose ?
" It looked like it was going to be never , " he says .
He was far from alone .
At Bank of America ( Charts ) , Ryan Bristol , 30 , was spinning his wheels .
Though his boss praised his work for the company 's private - banking group , it drove Bristol nuts that every move he made still had to be signed off on by an army of superiors .
" The people above me were all ages 45 to 65 and were n't about to leave .
It was clear to me I would n't get promoted no matter how good I was . "
On Madison Avenue , Brett Voris was similarly demoralized .
As an account manager at TBWA \Chiat \Day , he and the other thirty - something 's were coming up with the best ideas , and they were the ones fielding late - night client emergencies .
Yet they had zero authority to make decisions on their own .
" In advertising - and I saw this at more than one agency - youthfulness is valued because it 's seen as with - it and relevant , but it 's a paradox , " he says .
" The senior managers in their 40s and 50s are paranoid about keeping their own jobs , so they do everything they can to keep you down . "
The same goes for the media business .
One 36 - year - old finance manager at a broadcasting company got her last promotion four years ago .
" Since then , I 've just been stuck , and so has everyone else my age , " she says .
The next level up is vice president , and the six current VPs are n't retiring .
" I 'm under so much pressure here , but the rewards just are n't coming , " she says .
" I have to get out . "
Twenty - , thirty - , and even forty - something managers are in trouble .
Fifteen - hour days have become the norm .
Un tethering oneself from one 's BlackBerry is , in many fields , considered high treason .
And weekends ?
Those are for catching up on e-mail , right ?
Stymied
All this might not be so terrible if that big promotion - the one that catapults an up - and - comer out of middle - management hell and into the senior ranks - were around the corner .
But increasingly , younger workers are finding that no matter how many hours they put in or how much their bosses rave about their work , they 're just plain stuck .
An entire generation is bumping against something no amount of youthful vigor can match .
Call it the Gray Ceiling .
The Gray Ceiling is purely a function of mathematics .
Jon Ciampi , for example , was born in 1973 , when the birthrate hit a quarter - century low .
Just ahead of him and his peers is the anomaly known as the baby boom , the 77 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 .
Just behind him are the boomers ' children , known as Gen Y , who form a second bulge .
And sandwiched in between is the baby bust , or Generation X. Known variously as the laziest generation and the most entrepreneurial , they are unambiguously the smallest generation since the Great Depression .
Though that worked to the benefit of Gen Xers when it came to slots in elite schools - and will once again work to their benefit when the boomers finally leave the workforce - right now it 's holding them back .
For starters , the workplace makeup has changed dramatically from just a decade ago .
In 1996 there were 64 million U.S. workers between the ages of 30 and 39 and only 43 million ages 40 to 59 .
Now the situation has reversed .
As of June 2006 there were only 40 million ages 30 to 39 and 69 million workers 40 to 59 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Nobody is suggesting that all boomers have it easy .
For one thing , as Fortune reported last year in " 50 and Fired , " those tossed out the door in the latest recession are having a tough time getting back in .
That problem and the Gray Ceiling - a term that has been associated with age discrimination in the past but is taking on a new meaning - share a common cause :
In today 's leaner companies , executive jobs are fewer , and boomers who have hung on to them are in no hurry to let go .
When Korn / Ferry surveyed 2,000 senior - level managers at global companies recently , they found that 44 % said they plan to keep working past 64 .
Consider the legal profession :
In 1998 associates took an average of seven years to make partner , according to Vault.com 's annual survey of 19,000 attorneys .
By 2003 the average was 8� years .
Now it 's 9 � .
" The reason is simple " says Vault.com co-president Sam Hamadeh .
" Partners are n't retiring . "
Generation X , it would seem , is in danger of turning into the Prince Charles of the American workforce : perpetual heirs apparent awaiting the keys to the kingdom .
Why we work longer
And that , oddly enough , is exactly what employers had in mind when they helped build the Gray Ceiling during the late '90s .
Though at that time your 19 - year - old neighbor was a dot - com entrepreneur and anyone over 35 was considered a dinosaur , forward - looking companies were starting to panic about the " brain drain " that could result if the boomers retired en masse .
So began the campaign to keep older workers kicking around .
The Society for Human Resource Management reports that more than half ( 55 % ) of big U.S. companies are " giving managers the tools to increase retention of baby - boomers , " including flexible or reduced schedules and retention bonuses .
Other factors are coming into play too .
Thanks to federal and state laws against age discrimination enacted during the past 20 years , mandatory retirement has all but disappeared ( airline pilots and CEOs are about the only employees who can still be compelled to stop working ) .
Then there 's the financial squeeze :
The age at which seniors can receive full Social Security is inching north ( it 's now 66 ) at the same time that employer retirement benefits are heading south .
Finally - as the squash - playing , real - teeth - possessing sixty - something down the hall can attest - having six or seven decades under your belt does n't always seem that old .
But can't you just wait it out ?
After all , boomers have to retire eventually , right ?
Right ?
" I 'm not ever planning to retire , " says Janelle Shubert , a professor of management at Babson College in Wellesley , Mass. , who is turning 60 this October .
" My little joke is , ' I 'll try not to die in the classroom because it might upset the students . ' "
Shubert is also the associate director for Babson 's Center for Women 's Business Leadership , and in that capacity she does wonder how the boomer logjam will affect younger generations .
" The glass ceiling is being replaced by a Gray Ceiling of baby - boomers , " she says .
" Those of us who 've spent decades paying our dues are finally reaping the rewards , both psychological and financial , and we do n't see any reason to step aside now . "
Result : " We 're now the ceiling that our young colleagues are going to have to break through . "
What 's so wrong with that , boomers might ask ?
Quite a bit , actually , at least for companies that are thinking long term .
Bosses who are n't focused on how to keep Gen Xers happy will inevitably find that somebody else is .
So much for the " future of the firm . "
Unlike the glass ceiling and other forms of discrimination , the Gray Ceiling has no obvious legal or legislative remedy .
You can not sue boomers for being too numerous .
Breaking through
But during interviews with several dozen managers , Fortune zeroed in on companies that are making a sustained effort to fast - track the careers of Gen Xers , as well as half - a - dozen strategies that employees can use to crack through the Gray Ceiling on their own .
" You 'll never get ahead just by being really good at what you already do , " says Michelle Peluso , who is now the CEO of Travelocity .
" Top management will look at you and say , ' Hmmm , okay , just keep doing it . ' " Peluso , Ciampi , Bristol , Voris , and others all managed to get out from under the ceiling , and what they 've learned can help anyone who feels trapped .
Demography , it turns out , is n't destiny .
In a gray - walled conference room in Ridgefield , Conn. , 26 employees of Boehringer Ingleheim , a German pharmaceutical firm , are sitting through a new type of diversity training .
They 're about evenly divided between boomers and Gen Xers , and the moderator , Yael Sivi of the FutureWork Institute , has asked for a list of adjectives that describe the younger set .
" Arrogant , " one boomer offers .
Sivi bravely tries to turn the discussion in a more productive direction .
" Let 's say you 're a Gen X manager , and you think your boss is totally incompetent , " she says .
" Are you going to respect him or her just based on a title alone ?
No .
Is this different from your parents and grandparents ?
Yes . "
She looks around the room .
" Anybody here who was a latchkey kid growing up ? "
A 30 - ish man in khakis and a green polo shirt raises his hand .
" Okay , latchkey kid , what was your life like ?
What did you do when you came home from school ? "
He replies that he hung around the house waiting for his parents to come home from work .
" So you structured your own time , " says Sivi .
" Doing your homework , maybe making yourself a snack ?
Maybe you even started dinner ? "
She gestures to the group .
" Fast - forward 20 years .
How does this guy want to be managed ?
He does n't want to be micromanaged .
Hands off !
Because he 's been managing himself since he was 10 or 12 years old . "
The fact that the Gray Ceiling even exists is news to many boomers , says Margaret Regan , who runs the FutureWork Institute and works with clients that include American Express ( Charts ) , Citibank ( Charts ) , PepsiCo ( Charts ) , Pfizer ( Charts ) , and Kraft Foods ( Charts ) .
Gen Xers " do n't talk to their boomer bosses about it , " she says .
" Instead , they just quit . "
Even boomers who have hit the acceptance stage are n't exactly eager to publicize it .
Says one HR chief , who asked to remain nameless : " Admitting to outsiders that you have lots of boomers taking up all the great senior jobs is like hanging out a sign that says , DON'T COME TO WORK HERE .
YOU'LL NEVER GET PROMOTED . "
Or if you do get a promotion , it might not mean anything .
Title inflation , Xers say , is a strange new outgrowth of this era .
For this story , Fortune asked Korn / Ferry International to poll its executive network .
Among Gen Xers ages 30 to 42 , the findings were telling .
More than half ( 51 % ) have been given a fancier title in the past two years .
Yet almost half of those ( 47 % ) say they 're still doing the same job .
New job titles ranged from Chief Spiritual Officer to Process Change Manager to - our personal favorite - General Manager Reporting to the General Manager .
The addition of the word " special " or " specialist " to a title is particularly in vogue .
" The title Special Projects Specialist , " wrote one executive , " actually means , ' Keep the person in the fridge . ' "
Gen Xers , whose career expectations were shaped during the '90s boom , are not , however , a patient bunch .
That 's why more and more employers are adopting " unsiloing " as their newest HR buzzword .
Following the lead of GE , UPS , Exxon Mobil , and others , more companies are rotating young talent throughout the organization : A Sibson Consulting survey shows that more than half of Fortune 500 companies say they 've begun shuffling potential leaders around to give them broad experience .
Some companies have gone even further .
Several years ago an internal Lockheed Martin survey showed that 70 % of its workers were boomers or older .
So the company began a four - pronged Gen X retention drive .
They developed a program to rotate promising employees ( about 800 at a time ) through six functions over two years .
High - potential young managers now get to tackle a new challenge at least once every three years .
Lockheed made its tuition - reimbursement program so generous that many employees have earned multiple degrees on the company 's tab .
And the company made every boomer manager take on a Gen Xer to mentor and help with working out a career plan .
It 's working .
Since 2001 annual turnover has averaged 2.5 % - far below the norm in the industries where the company competes .
" Recruiters try to woo you by offering you more money , but it 's really about a combination of things this company does , especially the emphasis on learning , " says Ngina McLean , a 31 - year - old systems engineering manager in Greenbelt , Md. " It 's the only place I 've worked where I can see spending my whole career . "
Of course , developing younger workers is expensive , and what if they leave anyway ?
Many companies just choose not to do it , as Gen Xers trapped under the Gray Ceiling well know .
In that case the only way through the Gray Ceiling is to bust through it yourself .
" My father was a loyal corporate soldier who worked at the same company for 32 years , " says Ryan Bristol .
" But my generation is more interested in opportunities for fast growth than in security . "
On the day we 're talking , he 's speaking from his airy , glass - and - brushed - aluminum office building near the beach in Santa Monica .
Oh , and his new title is CEO .
It 's a far cry from his old gig toiling for Bank of America .
The fastest way out from under the Gray Ceiling , he realized , was to ditch the corporate ladder entirely .
He met Brett Voris , the refugee from TBWA \Chiat \Day , in the MBA program at UCLA 's Anderson School , and earlier this year they started PropPoint , a real estate investment firm .
Their first investor was an acquaintance of Bristol 's - they met at a Little League game where Bristol was coaching .
He in turn brought in a friend who runs a venture capital fund .
" It 's great to get away from all the corporate politics , " says Voris , even if " mistakes do n't get absorbed , the way they do when you work for a big company . "
Perhaps the easiest thing has been finding talented young hires :
One of their first employees is a 26 - year - old financial whiz from Bank of America who had also hit the Gray Ceiling there .
Not everybody has the stomach for a startup .
Even so , sometimes opportunity is lurking much closer than you imagine .
A few years ago , Denise Prince was just one of many thirtysomething senior vice presidents at Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania .
She thought Geisinger 's state - of - the - art system for electronic record - keeping of patient data could radically change the way new drugs are developed and tested .
She also saw a market for a new kind of quick , convenient medical care for minor injuries that could be delivered by nurse practitioners working out of retail stores .
" I had a lot of informal contact with our CEO , and I gradually talked him into letting me do it , " she says .
With her boss 's blessing , she started a new venture capital unit called Geisinger Ventures and has so far launched two businesses , with several more on the drawing board .
Prince , 43 , is Geisinger Ventures ' CEO .
Another strategy is to find a really big mess .
" If you really want to move up , you have to get out of your comfort zone , " says Michelle Peluso , 34 , from her office near Dallas , where the roaming gnome from Travelocity 's TV commercials looks down on her desk from a high shelf .
A dot - com vet whose Site59 was acquired by Travelocity in 2002 , Peluso joined the company but was eager to expand her role from senior vice president of product strategy .
So she dug into the hotel - booking business , which " was such a big mess that no one else wanted to touch it . "
First she found out what hoteliers hated about the way travel sites were run .
Then she built a new , hotel - friendly system to address their gripes .
" Think about what keeps your boss awake at night .
Is there something you can do to help ? " she says .
Her strategy worked so well that she got promoted to chief operating officer within a year , and then to CEO .
" When I 'm deciding whom to promote , I look for people who see the company as if they were wearing my hat , " Peluso says .
It may not sound strategic , but other Gen Xers have found that the route to the top sometimes heads , well , sideways .
In 2003 , Kurt Knackstedt , now 34 , was working for a Philadelphia travel - services provider .
In casual chats with people at Cendant , Knackstedt learned that the company wanted to hire someone to move to Hong Kong and pull together a scattered collection of Asian marketing efforts and new - product launches .
He recommended himself for the job .
Cendant hired him with his old title - " a lateral move in that sense , " he says - but with a staff three times bigger and a budget five times the size .
From there , it took Knackstedt just under two years to be promoted to his present job as senior director of corporate travel services worldwide , based at Cendant 's headquarters in London .
If you 're jockeying for a job overseas , Knackstedt and others say it helps enormously to be willing to go as a so - called local hire .
Rather than ask for a contract that guarantees you can come home in , say , two years , be ready to pull up stakes and assume you 'll be living abroad indefinitely .
The open - ended approach can help persuade higher - ups that " this is n't just a notch in your belt , " says Knackstedt .
Finally , being brutally honest about your industry is vital too .
Remember Jon Ciampi , the guy who was trapped under a veritable boomer army at Wells Fargo ?
Once he decided to start job hunting , he quickly realized he was looking in the wrong industry .
He had to make a leap .
Ciampi had just enough computer experience to get hired by Oracle , and now he works for SumTotal Systems , which makes online - learning software for clients including Microsoft and American Airlines .
Although he's had to scramble to develop new skills ( he once took Harvard Business School 's online course on new - product launches " two days before we were going to market " ) , he has scored four promotions and is now SumTotal 's vice president of marketing .
" If you want to get a bigger job , " he says , " you have to go where the growth is . "
Each of these strategies - be it jumping into a different industry or a foreign market or starting a new venture - takes an appetite for risk .
But here 's what many people forget : Staying put in a going - nowhere job may be an even bigger gamble .
Think about it .
Before long , Gen Xers will be competing for promotions with a whole new batch of fresh faces - 70 million of them , in fact .
Generation Y , after all , is growing up fast .

Careers or or Create Your Own Being able to remember names is a valuable asset in both the business and social arenas .
It helps you build instant rapport with new contacts , and , as many companies place a premium on interpersonal and relationship - building skills , it makes a decidedly good impression on employers , too .
So eliminate " whatshername " and " whatshisface " from your vocabulary .
The following techniques can help you remember the names of everyone you meet .
1 . Be interested : Many of us do n't even catch the other person 's name when they 're being introduced ; we 're too focused on ourselves .
So the first step to remembering a name is to pay attention as you are introduced .
2 . Verify it : Unless the person has introduced himself to you , verify what he or she wishes to be called .
At a conference or seminar , for example , the name tag may have been typed incorrectly or it may be a more formal or informal version of the name they like to go by .
Or someone else may have introduced you who does n't know the person well .
Asking what they prefer ( e.g . " Jeff introduced you as Debbie , is that what you prefer to be called ? " ) will not only cement the name in your mind , but ensure you are using the name that pleases them .
3 . Picture it written on their forehead : Franklin Roosevelt continually amazed his staff by remembering the names of nearly everyone he met .
His secret ?
He used to imagine seeing the name written across the person 's forehead .
This is a particularly powerful technique if you visualize the name written in your favorite color of Magic Marker .
4 . Imagine writing the name :
To take step three further , neural linguistic programming experts suggest getting a feel for what it would be like to write the name by moving your finger in micro-muscle movements as you are seeing the name and saying it to yourself .
5 . Use word association :
Try to connect a person 's name with a familiar image or famous person .
For example , if a woman 's name is Jacqueline , picture her as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in a pink suit and pillbox hat .
If a man 's name is Arnold , imagine him as the " Terminator " or striking a body - builder pose .
6 . Use it frequently :
Try to use the name three or four times during your conversation .
Use it when you first meet , when you ask a question and in your departure , e.g. , " Daniel , it was a pleasure talking to you .
Maybe we 'll get a chance to chat again sometime . "
7 . Record the name in a " new contacts " file :
Top sales representatives keep a record of new contact names and information , including where and when they met .
Review it now and then , especially when you will be attending a conference or meeting where you may see these individuals again .
Using these techniques will dramatically increase your ability to recall names , but it is inevitable that at one time or another you may slip up .
If you do happen to run into someone whom you previously met and can't remember his or her name , you have two options :
Look delighted to see the person , lock eyes and extend a warm " Good to see you again , " and then find out the name from a friend or guest list later .

When he reached college age , Mr. Ho ’s parents sent him to Chicago to study at Roosevelt University .
At 25 , he married a local chef , Jenny Smith , and a few years later the couple moved to the resort town of Lakeside , Mich. , where they successfully ran a restaurant together .
They built a big house in the Prairie School style , and Mr. Ho grew afflicted with the desire to add on and acquire .
He collected tools ; he traveled abroad to buy furniture .
“ You build a house , then you put in a pool , ” he said .
“ Then you need a peony garden .
Then you watch ‘ Martha Stewart ’ and you realize a peony garden needs a fence .
Then you think , ‘ I should also have a rose garden , too , and if I ’m going to have a rose garden , I have to have 30 varieties . ’
I once bought a $ 3,600 cedar tree because , you know , I needed something for the corner to create a transition from the oak tree to the anemone because the sedum on the brick walk just was n’t going to cut it .
People think like that , and I did . ”
And then , abruptly , he did n’t .
One evening in 1998 , while checking the stability of a ceiling fan in the restaurant , he suffered a seizure and slipped out of consciousness for 20 minutes .
“ The background went black and these white blades were taunting me with a kind of resolved madness , ” Mr. Ho said .
After a series of tests , doctors found nothing wrong with him , but the experience sent Mr. Ho into a depression , one result of which was the decision to live a less - encumbered existence .
He and his wife sold the Michigan house and much of what was in it .
He kept , for instance , only one of his six sofas .
In Maine , where they had enjoyed vacationing , he would write and his wife would make rugs .
Mr. Ho first tried to bring his anti-consumerist ideas into focus through stand - up comedy .
It was then that he changed his name from Dan Drilon to Dan Ho , because Ho , he felt , just sounded funnier .
He hoped to have a radio program , but that did n’t happen , so in 2003 he started a witty , sporadically published magazine called Rescue , which he funded himself .

He filled it with thoughts on food ( slice open a baguette and stick a chocolate bar in it ) , cleaning tips ( pass a paint brush over your computer keyboard every now and then ) and folksy admonitions : “ If you have enough sheets , towels and blankets to warrant an entire closet I can guarantee that you ’ve missed some really good opportunities to do something else . ”
I ’m furious about the fact that someone released this user data , regardless of their intentions ( which were good : to share data with the research communities ) .
This was a huge mistake , and people have to really think before they get all excited about sharing data or APIs .
I ’m all for being open , but user privacy trumps all the open ideals that we all share .
Frankly , I want us to NOT KEEP LOGS of our search data .
Yep , you heard that right … we should n’t even keep this data .
I know that ’s crazy , but I learned this week that Wikipedia turned off their log files .
They did this for tech reasons , but they now are keeping them off and not looking to solve the problem because of the huge upside of users knowing their searches on wikipedia DON ’T EVEN EXIST !
I think we should use this as a way to brand AOL Search :
We do n’t record your searches !
What do you folks think , should we turn off our log files and go for it ?

China may be half a world away from the United States and leagues apart when it comes to politics and pop culture , but the rising superpower is becoming increasingly entwined with the reigning superpower .
" We 're joined at the hip with people who have a very different political system than we do , " said New York Times columnist and best - selling author Tom Friedman .
" It 's a wonderful bargain , the Texas - Tiananmen bargain .
It 's so great and it seems to be just playing right along until it does n't .
And you never know when that 's going to happen . "
While American culture seeps into China in the form of television and chains like Starbucks , the two countries are reciprocally linked at their economic core , reports " GMA 's " Bill Weir .
For example , after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast , President Bush pledged tens of billions of relief dollars without raising taxes .
With the federal government already in debt , where will the money come from ?
Much of it will come from China , where a tradition of saving and lending has left the rising superpower with an $ 800 billion surplus that can be loaned back to the United States .
" They are funding a good part of our government right now , with money that we spend on their goods , " said Jim McGregor , author of " One Billion Customers . "
China has a lot of its savings because Americans continue to buy inexpensive Chinese products .
Chinese products remain cheap because , for years , the Chinese government has manipulated its exchange rate .
" It 's a little like that old joke .
If you owe the bank $ 1,000 , you 're in trouble .
If you owe the bank $ 1,000,000 , the bank 's in trouble , " said Richard Hass , president of the Council on Foreign Relations .
" That 's how the U.S. and China are .
We have like a mutual hostage situation . "
The Art of Being Ichiro
By Jim Caple
ESPN.com Senior Writer
SEATTLE --
We want to think of Ichiro as an enigma .
When his face is hidden behind the smoked windows of his Infiniti G35
coupe or when his eyes are masked behind his $ 495 Oakley Thump
sunglasses with the MP3 player inserted in the earpieces , we want to think of
Ichiro as impenetrable ( inscrutable , is n't that the old buzzword ? ) .
When we hear how a Japanese craftsman sews his gloves by hand or how
he stores his bats in a hard - cover case with a chemical rod to
control the humidity , we want to think of Ichiro as a mystic from
the Far East .
When he drops a quote on us as rarely as he does a flyball
and when he answers questions through a translator with his back turned
to reporters , we want to think of Ichiro as a Zen - like philosopher
sparingly dispensing wisdom .
We want to think of him as we do " Area 51 , " the nickname for the grassy
lawn he patrols in right field -- mysterious and alien .
But roll down those smoked windows and remove those sunglasses for a different
perspective .
Then we see an Ichiro who speaks English ( and Spanish ) but reveals
little in any language because he dislikes reporters and enjoys his privacy , someone
who listens to hip - hop and rap , wears a goatee and dresses as if he's on MTV , reads
comic books , likes " Star Wars " and loves playing with his dog .
And , of course ,
someone who hits the hell out of a baseball .
Even Phil Jackson would tell you that 's not Zen .
That 's American . [+]
For some years now the general uptake of IP v6 has appeared to be " just around the corner " .
Yet the Internet industry has so far failed to pick up and run with this message , and it continues to be strongly reluctant to make any substantial widespread commitment to deploy IPv6 .
Some carriers are now making some initial moves in terms of migrating their internet infrastructure over to a dual protocol network , but for many others it 's a case of still watching and waiting for what they think is the optimum time to make a move .
So when should we be deploying IP v6 services ?
At what point will the business case for IP v6 have a positive bottom line ?
It 's a tough question to answer , and while advice of " sometime , probably sooner than later " is certainly not wrong , it 's also entirely unhelpful as well !
I 'm not sure that anyone can provide a clearer date in response to that question , but what may be useful is to explore why IPv6 will be useful to have sometime in the near term future and how IP v6 and IP v4 are likely to interact .
And then the " when " of IP v6 may be a little clearer — or maybe not !
To start off with this exploration it may be useful to compare where we started with the Internet with where we are today , and then see how this relates to the IP v6 story .
The Evolution of the Internet Architecture
The original architectural model for IP was in many respects a very simple model , but also one that was very powerful .
Perhaps , in the spirit of William of Occam , the true strength of IP lay in what had been deliberately omitted from the specification , leaving in the form of the Internet a relatively simple and straightforward packet switching architecture .
William of Occam , ( 1285 -1349 ) , English philosopher and scholastic theologian .
Occam was born in Surrey , England .
He entered the Franciscan order and studied and taught at the University of Oxford from 1309 to 1319 .
Denounced by Pope John XXII for dangerous teachings , he was held in house detention for four years ( 1324 - 28 ) at the papal palace in Avignon , France , while the orthodoxy of his writings was examined .
Siding with the Franciscan general against the pope in a dispute over Franciscan poverty , Occam fled to Munich in 1328 to seek the protection of Louis IV , Holy Roman emperor , who had rejected papal authority over political matters .
Excommunicated by the pope , Occam wrote against the papacy and defended the emperor until the latter 's death in 1347 .
The philosopher died in Munich , apparently of the plague , while seeking reconciliation with Pope Clement VI .
Occam's Razor , " Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate " , has become a basic principle in science and philosophy , stating that entities should not be multiplied needlessly .
This principle underlies all scientific modeling and theory building .
In any given model Occam 's Razor helps to cut away those concepts , variables or constructs that are not really needed to explain the phenomenon .
Though such a process there is less chance of introducing inconsistencies , ambiguities and redundancies .
The network implemented an unreliable datagram delivery service .
Each datagram ( or packet ) , had information describing its source and intended destination .
Each network switch ( or router ) , either moved the packet closer to where it believed the destination was located , or it just dropped the packet .
In the latter case the switch may send a control notification packet back to the sender , depending on the reasons for the drop .
All the functionality that created various transport services , functionality to support mapping of application - level endpoint names to network addresses , and functionality to distribute available network resources across competing applications resided within the end systems rather than the network .
For a network it really does n't get much simpler than this .
But if you were to look for a faithful implementation of this simple architecture in today 's Internet networks you 'll be somewhat disappointed .
The concept of single packet forwarding plane , with a single addressing model spanning the entire network , and a uniform end - to - end transport level congestion control model , has largely disappeared from most production networks , and the basic concept of ' end - to - end ' is now perhaps more of an item of historic interest than a current pillar of networking architecture .
These days carrier internet networks come replete with multiple forwarding layers , thanks to MPLS , numerous active network elements , including firewalls NATs and application layer gateways , various forms of NAT traversal agents and of course application level gateways and application level switches , load balancers , dynamic application switches and various forms of context - sensitive dynamic environments .
We also have various forms of resiliency mechanisms , including path diversity elements , resource management systems , and QoS response systems .
We have active Distributed Denial of Service ( DDOS ) detection elements embedded in the network and even network level session and application tracking systems as one more level of network defense against the ever - escalating security problem .
This is no longer anything remotely similar to the concept of a simple unreliable datagram delivery service , and if you are looking for a simple dumb network with smart edges then you wo n't find it in production Internets .
What happened to the original Internet model ?
What was so wrong with a model of data communications that placed most of the functionality of the network into the devices themselves , and cast the network into a role of best effort packet switching ?
One sneaking suspicion is that the data communications industry itself , or at least the carrier part of the industry , is resisting this path to network simplicity , and in their continual quest to wring out every drop of value out of their networks the carrier ISP sector continues to be seduced by feature - packed network services that are intended to offer their customer higher value network solutions .
Another way of looking at this role is that the carrier industry is hooked on the complexity business , and has embarked on a business model of creating networking systems that are sufficiently complex that customers are supposed to baulk at doing it themselves .
After all any construction enterprise can hang wire on poles , bury wire in the ground , or drop wire to the bottom on the sea .
The highly complex operation of the resultant network is supposedly the unique value - adding role of the carrier enterprise .
Of course this complexity escalation works only as long as the solutions are not so complex that the carriers themselves start to baulk as well !
As a carrier industry we may have already crossed this particular complexity line , and we may have already managed to create a technology environment that is sufficiently complex that no player , not even the carrier , is able to manage the resultant interwoven mesh of disparate systems that make up a carrier Internet platform .
The question in my mind when looking at this rapid progression from architectural simplicity into often mind - boggling , and doubtless eye - wateringly expensive complexity for Internet networks is whether this is the outcome of a disordered process of entropy or one of a more ordered and directed process of evolution of the Internet ?
The case for entropy is certainly very strong .
What is evident is that the internet is besieged by various forms of local optimizations that intentionally alter the behaviour of parts of the network to suit the desired characteristics of certain classes of application .
Such incremental local actions tend to impose a cost on the entire system .
Whether the issue is one of adding network level support for mobility , support for various forms of address compression , support for differentiated service outcomes , resilience against various forms of hostile attack , or various forms of enhanced service availability , the typical outcome is one of increased network complexity and increased network cost with increasingly marginal returns in terms of overall service capability .
This is a drive to disorder and decay in that local changes are not uniformly adopted , and the network itself starts to alter its overall state from uniform simple order into visible chaotic disorder .
Of course it is also possible to view this change process as one of evolution , where an active system is under constant pressure to adapt in order to survive and thrive in a changing environment .
There 's no obviously intelligent design here , and the overall evolutionary process follows no particular planned path .
The outcomes are often chaotic and invariably unpredictable , but within the process is a driving discipline of a competitive environment where service providers are constantly challenged to adapt their service offering to meet the demands of customers .
Here it is the competitive market that imposes the evolutionary pressure to adapt and survive or wither away into commercial bankruptcy .
Herbert Spencer , 1820 – 1903 , British philosopher and sociologist , was a major figure in the intellectual life of the Victorian era .
He was one of the principal proponents of evolutionary theory in the mid nineteenth century .
It was Spencer who invented the phrase " survival of the fittest " , and originally applied it to the process of elimination of firms in the rather vicious cut and thrust of Victorian capitalism .
Upon the publication of Charles Darwin 's " On the Origin of Species " in 1859 Spencer quickly saw the parallels to natural selection and applied the phrase to the process of natural evolution .
As a result he became on the a group of philosophers known as " social Darwinists " , applying Darwin 's principles to human society .
It has often been considered a relatively harsh philosophy , espousing in its most extreme form that the fittest members of society naturally survived and prospered , while the weaker members of a society were doomed to perish .
Many of the incremental measures we see in today 's networks have been bought about by this reactionary response to market pressures rather than though a distinct planned process of technology development .
One could characterize firewalls , Network Address Translators ( NATs ) , Quality of Service ( QoS ) , Application Level Gateways ( ALGs ) , network caches , and a myriad of similar mechanisms as examples of this form of ad hoc response to market pressures for network services .
Whether they represent entropy or evolutionary change in the Internet model is perhaps left as a personal perspective .
One area of technology continues to sit outside this process of current technology churn in the Internet , and that 's IPv6 .
IP v6 is not an outcome of a reactive model of technology development , but is instead an example of a centrally planned development that was designed in anticipation of a market situation .
Curiously , the very conditions that IPv6 was intended to avoid , namely that of a chronic address shortage in the deployed network , have already manifested themselves in many ways and in many places , and yet the market demand for IP v6 services remains relatively insignificant , and certainly below a threshold for viable commercial services for many operators .
So what 's the problem ?
How will IP v6 services appear in the market ?
Is this an evolutionary process of orderly migration of IP v4 - based services into an IP v6 networking realm ?
Or is IP v6 going down a path of premature extinction , never to appear as part of the mainstream communications portfolio ?
Or will IP v6 play for high stakes here and take on IP v4 as its major competitor and win market share through a revolutionary process of defining price and performance points that are simply not sustainable with any other technology , including IPv4 ?
Lets now look at the potential futures for IPv6 , and in particular look at the options of extinction , evolution and revolution in the context of IPv6 and its struggle for market takeup in the coming years .
Extinction
Is IPv6 another case of OSIfication , or another example of a network technology that simply will never attain mainstream adoption ?
The Open Systems Interconnection ( usually abbreviated to OSI ) was a new effort in networking started in 1982 by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , along with the ITU - T. Prior to OSI , networking was completely vendor - developed and proprietary , with protocol standards such as SNA and DECnet .
OSI was a new industry effort , attempting to get everyone to agree to common network standards to provide multi-vendor interoperability .
It was common for large networks to support multiple network protocol suites , with many devices unable to talk to other devices because of a lack of common protocols between them .
However , the actual OSI protocol stack that was specified as part of the project was considered by many to be too complicated and to a large extent unimplementable .
Taking the " forklift upgrade " approach to networking , it specified eliminating all existing protocols and replacing them with new ones at all layers of the stack .
This made implementation difficult , and was resisted by many vendors and users with significant investments in other network technologies .
In addition , the OSI protocols were specified by committees filled with differing and sometimes conflicting feature requests , leading to numerous optional features .
Because so much was optional , many vendors ' implementations simply could not interoperate , negating the whole effort .
The collapse of the OSI project severely damaged the reputation and legitimacy of the organizations involved , especially ISO .
The worst part was that OSI 's backers took too long to recognize and accommodate the dominance of the TCP / IP protocol suite .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Systems_Interconnection
Will IPv6 act as a catalyst to take a step in some completely different technology direction that may be as radical in their nature as previous big leaps of technology in the communications sector ?
In the same fashion as the industry has already lurched though multiplexing solutions based on Frequency Division Multiplexing , Time Division Multiplexing and then Packet Switching , are we awaiting something far more radical than a realignment of some of the IP packet 's header fields ?
Is IPv6 a rather eloquent demonstration that packet switching has reached some basic set of limitations and that a successor technology to IP v4 needs to take a completely new approach to a shared communications environment ?
The original IP architecture , as a very simple adaptation layer between a broad collection of packet switching technologies and a similarly broad collection of services and application , is certainly dying at the moment , if not already dead .
The model of coherent and transparent end - to - end packet transmission is disappearing from today 's network , and is being replaced with a collection of packet header rewriters , a set of content sensitive packet forwarding systems and even entities than perform session interception and regeneration .
Any application that assumes a simple end - to - end model of packet delivery has no role in today 's Internet , and any popular internet application has to be able to invent its own identity space , and be able to allow its data streams to pass through NATS , ALGs and other middleware elements with impunity .
This may require multi-party interactions to complete the transaction were previously only two parties were necessary .
For peer - to - peer environments we are now looking at application mediators and agents to assist in setting up the necessary rendezvous points , as well as assisting in the identification of what forms of middleware behaviour exist in the network path ( STUN , ICE and TURN are good examples of this approach of application - level middleware discovery ) .
Efforts to impose overlay topologies , tunnels , virtual circuits , traffic engineering , fast reroutes , protection switches , selective QoS , policy - based switching on IP networks appear to have simply added to the cost and detracted from the end user utility
So , today , we are engineering applications and services in an environment where NATs , firewalls and ALGs are assumed to be part of the IP plumbing .
We now have constrained models of interaction that divide the work into clients and servers , and mandate that all transactions are initiated by clients and are directed to servers ..
We now have forced applications to invent their own per-application identity realms , and required applications to also require the deployment of active middleware in the form of agents in order to orchestrate multi-party rendezvous and referral .
By implication NAT states and other middleware states are now multi-party shared states , and what were considered to be local autonomously functioning entities now are faced with the complexities of supporting a signalling environment that is associated with distributed shared state .
All this complexity is not just a problem in the abstract sense , but a form of architecture that results in more fragile applications and higher operational costs .
The Internet , far from becoming simpler and cheaper , is under increasing pressure to take on increasing complexity and operate with escalating costs
Can IP v6 reverse this trend ?
We 've all heard the observations that IPv6 was a typical standardization conservatism .
IPv6 also represents an outcome of engineering compromise between making marginal changes and taking an entirely new approach to packet switching architecture , and the standards process is invariably one that tends to avoid making radical decision .
IP v6 represents a very marginal change in terms of design decisions from IPv4 .
IP v6 did not manage to tackle the larger issues of overloaded address semantics .
IP v6 did nothing to address routing scaling issues .
IP v6 has done little in terms of altering the semantics of packet switching , and what we are left with in IP v6 is a slightly larger address field :
One could be excused for thinking that the marginal changes in IPv6 over IP v4 represent such a small difference that no one would be interested in paying their share of the rather high price of worldwide transition .
Alex Lightman , chairman of the IPv6 Summit , was reported to have raised the question of who will actually pay for the transition to IPv6 .
As reported by internetnews.com , " There is an unreleased report by the Dept. of Commerce estimating it will take $ 25 - $ 75 billion to pay for the transition , according to one of our speakers , " Lightman said .
" So what part of that will the U.S. government pay for ? "

http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/3570211
But if IP v6 is indeed too small a change over IP v4 and its fate is really to be that of extinction , then what other approaches can we take to a successor to IPv6 ?
Is there anything else around today that takes a radically different view of how to multiplex individual transactions within a common communications system ?
The answer to this question appears to be " no " , or at least there appears to be nothing that has been developed beyond the initial conceptual stage , and certainly nothing that has been extensively evaluated for such a role .
So , for the near term , there does not appear to be any alternative technology waiting in the wings .
If we do n't appear to want to adopt IPv6 , and are happy to let it lapse into extinction , then we need to design and develop another protocol .
In that case how long would such a new design effort take ?
And if we embarked along such a path what is the likelihood that the effort would encounter precisely the same set of constraints as the IPv4 and IP v4 design efforts and what is the likelihood that the effort would end up in much the same place as IP v6 — taking a slightly different view of a common set of design trade - offs between a common set of basic constraints that were already encountered in IPv4 ?
Of course there is also the option of heading well beyond the current concepts of packet switching and look at entirely different communications architectures , but here the considerations of the design and development timelines become a significant inhibitory factor here .
So if we think that IPv6 is not the answer , and we believe that we should look elsewhere for a successor technology to IPv4 , then it is likely that any such effort would take at least a decade , or , more likely longer to generate a workable outcome .
And the other nagging consideration here is the question of whether such a design effort would end up as a marginal outcome in any case .
Would we be looking at no more than a slightly different set of design trade - offs within a common set of constraints ?
So in the near term , and possibly in a longer term of some decades to come " extinction " is not a very likely outcome for IP v6 — there is simply no other option on our horizon , so if we are to move away from IP v4 sometime soon then IPv6 is what we will be using instead .
Evolution
So if the premature extinction of IPv6 is highly unlikely , then can we made do with IP4 indefinitely , or should we be looking for some evolutionary path into IPv6 ?
Can we continue to use IP v4 indefinitely ?
There 's little doubt that the IP v4 network model is under relatively severe stress in terms of its address and routing scalability , and there is no confidence that IP v4 can be made to scale indefinitely to encompass larger and larger populations of users .
As we 've already noted the Internet is no longer a simple network , and as it continues to grow then its likely that at some point the cost of scaling the various components and their forms of interaction reach a point where its just no longer a viable proposition to continue to grow .
While increased volume usually implies lower unit cost , at come point the cost of complexity starts to become a significant factor in unit cost escalation , and the network reaches a scaling failure point .
The possible pressure points include the capability to scale NAT deployment indefinitely , the capability to scale routing systems , the capability to scale network middleware indefinitely , the capability to effectively ward off various forms of hostile attack on the network , and the capability for an ever larger ever more complex network to operate in a stable and useful fashion .
Whether this is a failure point of the capability of the technology , where the network itself reaches a size where it just cannot operate in a stable mode , or whether this is a failure point of the underlying economics of the network where the unit costs of the service escalate beyond the point of viability is an open question , but the common factor is that IP v4 is a technology platform with finite scaling bounds , and it cannot fuel an open - ended networking future .
Hopefully we should have evolved the network beyond these limitations well before reaching such a critical failure point , and the major lever here appears to be to head towards a simpler network that performs fewer functions within the network .
Simpler networks , simpler applications , simpler operation , better scaling properties .
This is certainly the core promise of IPv6 .
So if the question is " should we evolve the network to IP v6 ? " , then the general answer appears to be a resounding " yes " for most values of " we " .
However the precise motivations vary for each player .
IP v6 can allow for the resumption of a network model that uses unique global addresses for each connected endpoint , for endpoint populations that can scale into the hundreds of billions .
IP v6 is capable of embracing a device - dense world .
The per-address cost can be reduced dramatically through the elimination of various forms of dynamic address translation technologies , as well as the elimination of the scarcity premium factor in IP v4 address mechanisms .
Application complexity can also be reduced , and the diversity of application models can be broadened .
This model of universal addressing allows for many forms of peer - to - peer networking models as well as supporting communication transaction security models that reply on end - to - end coherence .
All these factors point to a networking model that supports simple and ubiquitous communications services which in turn supports utility device deployments .
So the desired outcomes appear to point to simpler networks , simpler applications , larger populations of connected devices , more efficient services , and a broader diversity of service models .
So the set of potentials presented by ubiquitous adoption of IP v6 presents a very compelling picture of benefits for a diversity of players in the industry .
However none of these potentials has managed to persuade the industry to take the plunge and undertake the transition to IP v6 so far .
The potential benefits of IP v6 appear to offer insufficient drive to the industry to get this transition underway .
Why is this ?
Perhaps its because the pressure points of the current IP v4 deployment do n't cause uniformly high levels of pain .
ISPs are neither application authors nor are they device manufacturers .
So ISPs do not directly incur the additional cost of complexity in the application or the cost of additional memory , additional software and additional configuration complexity in the device .
So the ISP feels insufficient levels of direct pressure to roll out a new network protocol .
What else would drive an ISP to deploy a new networking protocol ?
In crude terms there are two very basic business drivers — fear and greed .
Greed is the desire to enter new markets in a way that maximizes beneficial outcomes , while fear is a defensive response to emulate the business opposition to defend an existing market position .
So in these terms is there an " early adopter reward " for deployment of IPv6 ?
What is the fear or greed driver here that would propel the ISP industry into undertaking this transition ?
Unfortunately there appear to be no clear " early adopter " rewards for IPv6 .
Existing players currently have strong motivations to defer expenditure decisions because of strong shareholder pressure to improve the earnings per share position within the carrier industry .
This is not the time to support a business case to leap too far ahead of the existing business model and take a somewhat riskier longer term position in the market .
There is still some considerable uncertainty over the future of the voice industry as the competition with VOIP becomes more intense , and there is still a basic push by the industry to enter into value - added service markets that entail more complex network architectures , and IPv6 is seen as being a longer term direction that has little of relevance to the current ISP industry position .
The return on investment in the IPv6 business case is simply not evident in today 's ISP industry .
New players have no compelling motivations to leap too far ahead of their seed capital .
All players see no incremental benefit in early adoption .
And many players short term interests lie in deferral of additional expenditure .
So the short term industry response appears to be to defer expenditure on IPv6 - based deployments and await further developments .
So if the question is " when will this transition to IPv6 happen " , the general industry response appears to be " later " .
So the real question here is what is the nature of the trigger for change , or , at what point , and under what conditions , does a common position of " later " become a common position of " now " ?
So far we have no clear answer from industry on this question
This is not a case of where regulatory initiative would be all that helpful .
Our previous experience with OSI and various national and regional GOSIP programs has provided a convincing lesson that technology adoption though regulatory measures or administrative fiat are abject failures .
So we are forced to look back at the market interaction between services providers and consumers of the services to see where the leverage may lie .
Unfortunately there are few network differentials in the current consumer world that provide any great leverage — after all its still email and its still the web , ands the choice of protocol over which these applications operate should be a matter of supreme indifference to the end consumer .
Expecting the consumer to pay more for a supposedly seamlessly invisible network attribute is indeed a bad case of wishful thinking .
Indeed it is perhaps worse than this .
In recent years we have managed to create a secondary supply industry based on network complexity , address scarcity , and insecurity .
The prospect of further revenue erosion from simpler cheaper network models based on IP v6 deployment is one that this industry views with some suspicion and fear .
The business obstacles do n't stop here .
The concept of simpler networks leads to the concept of revenue erosion for provision of network services .
In an industry that has already undergone significant turmoil over the past decade , and where the current incumbents are looking at weak financial figures for their businesses the entire concept of outlaying more capital investment to deploy an IP v6 network is not exactly a glowing proposition .
Indeed the industry has already invested large sums in packet - based data communications over the past decade , and there is little investor interest in still further infrastructure investment at present .
When you add to this the consideration that IP v6 is a step back to a simpler , cheaper network , then this translates to an incremental investment that will reduce their revenue yield per customer .
This is not exactly a business - friendly proposition .
So its little wonder that the industry has been far more fascinated in the concept of MPLS , QoS and VPNs in an effort to increase the returns on their network investment through the quest for " value added services " and at the same time paid lip service to IP v6 without any major level of investment to match .
Oops !
So evolution , or an ordered migration from IP v4 to IP v6 , does not appear to be happening .
IP v6 is not seen in a highly positive light .
IP v6 promotion may have been too much too early , and these days IP v6 may be seen as tired rather than wired .
" Everything over HTTP " and the client - server model of networking has proved far more viable than perhaps it should have , and these days any decent application that gains popular attention can traverse NATs , ALGs and a myriad of other middleware barriers with consummate ease .
If it could n't be so agile then it simply would not gain popular attention .
So we now have an Internet where the service portfolio appears to be collapsing into a small set of applications that are based on an even more limited set of HTTP transactions between servers and clients .
Maybe it 's just deregulation of the industry , where short term business pressures simply support the case for further deferral of IP v6 infrastructure investment .
In this economic view of the Internet industry there is insufficient linkage between the added cost , complexity and fragility of deploying network middleware and associated traversal applications at the edge of the network and the costs of infrastructure deployment of IP v6 in the middle .
This leads to the observation that deregulated markets are often not perfect information markets , and the points of pain , or cost , become isolated from potential remedies , or savings .
It would appear that evolution is really not an option for IP v6 either .
Revolution
The transformation of IP v4 from a research experiment to a mainstream public communications environment is an interesting case of technology revolution .
IP v4 presented a portfolio of cheaper switching technologies , more efficient network usage , simpler networks with lower operational costs , and structural cost transfer from operational costs within the network to capital costs at the edge .
IP v4 represented a compelling and revolutionary business case of stunningly cheaper and more effective services to end customers .
This was the silicon revolution at its most effective .
The transformation has not been ordered and well planned .
Some of the giants of the older telephone world have lost vast amounts of money , some have gone bankrupt with others have been sold off as mere shadows of their former market presence .
Workforces are being realigned , investors have had to adjust their expectations and regulators have been confronted with an entirely new set of market behaviours and associated services .
Perhaps the most compelling view of IPv6 is in the same vein of being a revolutionary force with large scale disruptive implications to the industry .
The leverage here lies in the observation that IPv6 represents an opportunity to embrace the communications requirements of a device - dense world — an opportunity that is simply lacking in the IP v4 realm .
This device dense world is a world that is far larger than that of human - use devices , and encompasses a potential population that is at least some 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than today 's Internet .
This encompasses a world of embedded communications , smart tags and applications that can encompass many forms of active and passive monitoring .
In and of itself this sounds benign , of not innocuous for the Internet .
But how much money would you let your washing machine spend on communications services ?
Or your luggage tag ?
Or any one of thousands of chattering devices ?
The economics of a device - based communications world are vastly different fro that of a human - mediated communication .
In the voice world the value proposition shifted away from cost - based service tariffs towards value - based tariffs .
It was n't the cost of allowing two people to speak to each other , but the value people placed in being able to talk to each other .
Even the Internet so far has an inherent value in human - based communication .
The value of today 's Internet lies in people - to - people messaging , lies in web browsing , lies in downloading entertainment , and lies in other predominately human pastimes .
In a device world the value proposition is at a much lower level , and one way to look at the resolution of a device - based Internet is to think of a service environment that reduces the end consumer costs by a further 2 to 3 orders of magnitude .
Yes , that implies that the threshold for a device - rich communications world is an industry price benchmark of megabit per second access tariffs for between 2 to 30 cents a month , or being able to purchase gigabit per second internet access for the same $ 30 price benchmark we use today .
How to achieve these revised price benchmarks for Internet services is the critical question .
We 've already extracted massive improvements in transmission cost efficiencies in the move into wave division multiplexing on fibre cable .
We 've already extracted massive improvements in the efficiency of switching through the move from time to packet switches and the move from state - based circuit switches into stateless packet - based switches .
We 've already extracted further cost efficiency in the network by pushing many of the services and functionality out to the edge and attempting to follow a direction of simpler cheaper networks .
So what 's left ?
I suspect that the truly revolutionary message in IPv6 is a message about the extracting efficiencies in the business model of communications .
We appear to be looking at a transition from value to volume with IPv6 .
IPv6 's true leverage is about the ability to encompass world of tens of billions of chattering devices .
The service industry that provides the networking services to these tens of billions of devices will not be a bloated inefficient relic of a bygone era of monopoly service enterprises .
Indeed its likely that there will be nothing in common with the enterprises that operate in this industry today .
IP v6 appears to be carrying an implication of a quite dramatic shift in the service enterprise to an industry based on a commodity utility .
We are looking at an industry that will operate at a level of single digit operating margins and investment returns similarly phrased .
If we want IP to operate from anonymous sockets in the wall , or seamlessly over wireless , then we will be looking at service delivery systems that provide simple lowest common denominator networking service .
The search for value - added services and value - added networks have no logical role in such a commodity utility world .
This all sounds quite conventional , and the path to commoditization of many artifacts and services is a well trodden one in many industries and service sectors .
So why is this such a revolutionary message for the communications industry ?
I suppose that the observation here is that this is one industry which is continuing to live the myth that there is a pot of gold out there in value - added networking - land , and that the windfall profits made in successive waves of innovation in the telephone industry over the decades will continue to repeat itself , and there is a pervasive air of denial over a message that says that the value is going to be destroyed by volume .
In this industry the words " commodity " and " utility " remain taboo !
The IPv6 Condition
In taking an objective look at IP v6 , there are no compelling technical feature or revenue levers in IP v6 that are driving new investments in existing IP service platforms .
It does not appear that an industry - wide shift to IP v6 is going to be driven by the current value - added network service model and the associated current set of consumers of today 's services .
There is just insufficient marginal benefit to the end consumer to create a value proposition that will justify paying an increased tariff for having access to IP v6 as well as IP v4 — after all its still email and its still the web !
The current user base has managed to become wedged in a situation where there is not enough impetus to move away from the networking model of IP v4 , and we appear to be stuck within a client - server model of network - mediated relationships .
The network operators continues to push the network into undertaking a higher valued role in mediating communications and usage of the network continues with a largely human - directed set of services .
One could characterize this as an environment that places extracting maximal value from the network as the prime objective , over serving maximal volume
Interestingly , the underlying engine for digital communications , the silicon chip industry also started in a vein of attempting to place silicon chips in highly - valued devices , but this industry made the switch to a volume industry decades ago .
This is an industry that has significant cost differentials between design and fabrication , so it 's probably little surprise that they quickly appreciated the longer term value in a general approach to recouping the design cost in very high volume production runs .
It likely that IP v6 sits in this same situation , and will only gain widespread industry acceptance within a broader shift in the communications industry from value to volume .
It we are truly looking at an Internet of gadgets , of billions of chattering devices , then what will drive IP v6 deployment in a device rich world is a radical and revolutionary value to volume shift in the IP packet carriage industry .
In IPv6 we appear to be looking at a shift in the industry to that of an undistinguished commodity utility service provision industry .
An industry that will inevitably take on once more a very conservative profile and one that will no longer be able to afford further extensive and rapid innovation .
So if we take this step into such a world then we need to be pretty confident that we are comfortable with this step being a very long term one .
The IPv6 Revolutionary Manifesto
It is going to be unlikely that IPv6 is an evolutionary step for the Internet , but rather that of yet another revolutionary step for the communications industry .
It is likely that IPv6 will need to compete for market share with IPv4 , and the basic terms of the competition for the consumer will be price - based competition rather than feature or service - based .
IPv6 's basic potential is that of extraordinary volume , but to achieve this we will need to push down unit cost of packet delivery by orders of magnitude .
It appears that the major means of getting there is through commodity volume economics that will direct the industry towards even " thicker " transmission systems , simpler , faster switching systems , lightweight application transaction models , and an industry profile of a commodity utility sector .
This is definitely going to be a painful revolution , as it will be the industry itself that will offer the highest levels of resistance to such a radical agenda .

In June 2003 the following announcement was made by the US Department of Defense :
US Department of Defense adopts IPv6 Implementation of the next - generation Internet protocol that will bring the Department of Defense closer to its goal of net - centric warfare and operations was announced on June 13 , 2003 by John P. Stenbit , Assistant Secretary of Defense for networks and information integration and DoD Chief Information Officer .
The new Internet protocol , known as IPv6 , will facilitate integration of the essential elements of DoD's Global Information Grid — its sensors , weapons , platforms , information and people .
Secretary Stenbit is directing the DoD - wide transition .
The current version of the Internet 's operating system , IP v4 , has been in use by DoD for almost 30 years .
Its fundamental limitations , along with the world - wide explosion of Internet use , inhibit net - centric operations .
IPv6 is designed to overcome those limitations by expanding available IP address space , improving end - to - end security , facilitating mobile communications , enhancing quality of service and easing system management burdens .
" Enterprise - wide deployment of IPv6 will keep the warfighter secure and connected in a fast - moving battlespace , " Secretary Stenbit said .
" Achievement of net - centric operations and warfare depends on effectively implementing the transition . "
Secretary Stenbit signed a policy memorandum on June 9 that outlines a strategy to ensure an integrated , timely and effective transition .
A key element of the transition minimizes future transition costs by requiring that , starting in October 2003 , all network capabilities purchased by DoD be both IPv6 - capable and interoperable with the department 's extensive IP v4 installed base .
I was asked to provide a comment on this announcement , and at the time I made the following response :
The enduring value of IP v6 lies in the massive amount of coherent address space that allows literally billions of devices to be uniquely addressed .
Address uniqueness is a strong value proposition when you want an identifier space to cover a very large deployment space .
As an example of this , one of the two properties of the original Digital - Intel - Xerox Ethernet II specification that remains in today 's 10 Gigabit Ethernet specification is unique 48 bit MAC addresses .
All of that highly innovative CSMA / CD thinking that at the time we thought was the fundamental property of Ethernet has been dispensed with , and it's the address space that still defines " Ethernet " today .
The general observation is that any communications system requires any party to be able to uniquely identify any other party in order to initiate a private communication session .
If you cannot perform that most basic of communications functions , then you simply do not have a functional peer - to - peer communications network .
But does n't that mean that the stories of IP v4 address exhaustion have some substance ?
With the large amount of addressable devices hidden behind NATs , and the associated move to using domain names as the underlying identifier space for many communications applications , the pressure on consumption of IP v4 address space has been reduced considerably , but at the cost of increased network complexity .
This has implied that in a world of human - driven screens and keyboards we see some considerable lifetime left in the admittedly comfortable world of IP v4 as we know it .
To support this model we 've actually moved away from the IP address as the unique identifier token for many applications , and substituted an application model that is largely driven from domain names .
As a trivial example , look at the virtual hosting mechanism as implemented in web server implementations to see this shift in server identifiers from IP address to domain name .
So in the context of the current IP market , as both as consumers of the technology and as an industry , we can live with this identity split for some time yet , because we appear to concentrate our use IP addresses as a routing and forwarding framework identity and increasingly use the DNS as the identifier realm of applications .
Our world is a world where the device is subservient to the user , and the applications we associate with the Internet of today are applications that are essentially human pastimes , such as e-mail , web browsing , or high - value automated transactions , such as those commonly bracketed into the e-commerce area .
And we 've now established a highly valuable global industry upon these foundations .
In so doing we should recognize the emergence of a second set of communications realms populated by uniquely identified devices that number in their billions , where the inter - device traffic is not human mediated , and the value of the device transactions are , on an individual transactions value level , far lower than the value of the human - driven realm of IPv4 .
In other words , in a device rich communications realm , it 's likely that the human value we 'd ascribe on average to each packet is far lower than our current Internet IP v4 world of human - mediated communications .
And it's this extravagantly device - equipped world that we see the U.S. Department of Defense heading .
If your stock in trade is one of quite astounding feats of logistical deployment of large numbers of people and large numbers of items of equipment , then the communications requirement is of a different order of scale to that of the retail Internet markets , and , yes , I 'm sure that there are entirely effective arguments behind that decision to look forward to a communications realm with a uniform base protocol identifier domain in a scale that is 2 to the power 96 times larger than the entire IP address identifier domain of IPv4 .
I would be cautious about high levels of expectation that this immediately translates into an impetus in the market where you and I converse .
My host here where I 'm typing this message is already IP v6 capable , and if you are running a recent version of host software , then it's a reasonable assumption that yours is too .
But I 'll send this message over IP v4 and you 'll receive it over IP v4 , and between my mail sender and your mail receiver the transport channel will also be IPv4 .
Should we use IP v6 instead ?
Would I pay my provider additional money to compensate it for part of its additional expenditure to support a simultaneous IP v6 capable network between you and me ?
To send precisely the same message ?
In precisely the same time ?
Along the same path ?
Using the same transport TCP session ?
Obviously , to me , as a ( hopefully ) economically rational consumer of such services , and no doubt to you , in a similar role , there is no value in spending more money to achieve outcomes in IP v6 that are identical to what we can already do today in IPv4 .
And in the retail Internet world that remains the basic IP v6 conundrum .
Why should any provider spend additional resources to service the same market with identical services , and in so doing be unable to raise additional revenue to offset their additional service costs ?
One interpretation is that there is no natural motivation for such activities in today 's market , otherwise it would already be very widespread indeed .
What we 've seen in the mainstream Internet world is an emerging mythology about IPv6 that somehow this additional expenditure , ultimately on the part of the consumer , provides some additional benefit for the consumer , motivating them to switch from IPv4 - only services to some hybrid of mixed v4 and v6 and ultimately to a v6 world , and thereby funding the additional provider expenditure associated with such a massive transition .
The reality is more sobering in that in the retail Internet world there is so far nothing obvious in the " additional benefit " category .
I 'm using Network Address Translation ( NAT ) right now , using an ssh session back to my mail server that drives through NAT boxes to make a secure SMTP session , across a first step of 802.11 wireless in order to pass this message into a mailing list .
I 've auto - configured my laptop in the wireless world , and for me I 'm living in a plug - and - play world that supports my level of roaming access .
Would IP v6 make this session any more secure ?
Any different in terms of Quality of Service ( QoS ) ?
In plug - and - play models of roaming ?
Would there be any visible difference in terms of my ability to communicate with you ?
To all of these questions the basic answer is still " no . "
So , for you and I , we look inside the IP v6 technology box , and find nothing new there to motivate us to spend more money for our existing Internet - based communications services , and for some time to come it would appear that this limitation will still hold .
On the other hand there are circumstances where there is a need to operate in a much larger base protocol address space .
These include situations where one wants to take advantage of Internet applications that operate across a world of literally billions of devices , large and small .
The application space may want to gather constant reports on the characteristics of the " thing " it is attached to , from a ration pack to a component of a large naval vessel .
You may want to use supply channels for such devices such that the deployment is a plug - and - play world without a massive variety of detailed configuration processes .
You may be looking to an architecture that would be stable for many years .
In such circumstances you really want take advantage of a uniform set of Internet application technologies that potentially span massive numbers of addressable devices .
Here a large base address space is a definite asset .
And for such industry sectors in voicing such requirements where there is also a somewhat different ultimate value proposition for the supported communications activity , then it 's quite understandable that there can be an attractive proposition offered by immediate adoption of IPv6 .
But back in the communications realm where you and I currently exchange our messages , such requirements remain in a future framework that is still waiting for relevant value propositions that allow it to gain traction with you and me .
Maybe we just need to be patient .
Steam ships did not halt operation the first day a diesel powered vessel appeared .
It was a much slower process that led to an outcome of the change of the maritime fleet .
The next generation of mechanization of naval vessels offered cheaper services , and , as often happens , market price won in that commodity market .
Market price often wins in competitive commodity markets .
And the Internet retail market is , in many parts of the world and in many sectors , a strongly competitive space with all the characteristics of a commodity offering .
And there no doubt that if you and I could communicate in precisely the same fashion as we do today , with precisely the same applications and service environment , using precisely the same host devices and operating systems as we do today , but at some attractive fraction of today 's price , then I 'm sure that neither of us would care in the slightest that our data was encapsulated using a packet framing format and address tokens that used the IP v6 protocol specifications .
Professor Cappuccio on sleep which covers this new research go to
Research by Warwick Medical School at the University of Warwick has found that sleep deprivation is associated with an almost a two - fold increased risk of being obese for both children and adults .
Early results of a study by Professor Francesco Cappuccio of the University of Warwick 's Warwick Medical School were presented to the International AC21 Research Festival hosted this month by the University of Warwick .
The research reviewed current evidence in over 28,000 children and 15,000 adults .
For both groups Professor Cappuccio found that shorter sleep duration is associated with almost a two - fold increased risk of being obese .
The research also suggests that those who sleep less have a greater increase in body mass index and waist circumference over time and a greater chance of becoming obese over time .
Professor Cappuccio says : " The ' epidemic ' of obesity is paralleled by a ' silent epidemic ' of reduced sleep duration with short sleep duration linked to increased risk of obesity both in adults and in children .
These trends are detectable in adults as well as in children as young as 5 years .
" Professor Cappuccio points out that short sleep duration may lead to obesity through an increase of appetite via hormonal changes caused by the sleep deprivation .
Lack of sleep produces Ghrelin which , among other effects , stimulates appetite and creates less leptin which , among other effects , suppresses appetite .
However he says more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which short sleep is linked to chronic conditions of affluent societies , such as obesity , diabetes and hypertension .
Francesco Branca , the Regional Adviser for nutrition and food security in the World Health organisation ( WHO ) Regional Office for Europe said : " This is an interesting piece of research putting together different lifestyle aspects with food choices .
We need more research on the obese environment - the integration between medical research and socio-political research is something we should be exploring more ." to view a web version of this footage go direct to the link below and clickthe connection speed you want under the eyePeter Dunn , Press and Media Relations ManagerUniversity of Warwick Tel : 02476 523708 or 07767 655860 p.j.dunn@warwick.ac.uk PR53 PJD 12th July 2006
WEBVIEW : An Internet - Scale Program Using TAIGA
Overview
WebView is a visualization of how the web is currently being used .
It is designed to monitor the web sites that are currently being browsed and to accumulate this information by category into a meaningful ( and interesting ) display .
At the same time , it is a demonstration of the potential of the TAIGA programming system .
To make this visualization interesting and effective , we need to have people using it .
Thus we encourage you to download , install and run the software .
The Display
From the users ' point of view , webview is a simple script that puts up a categorized display of what people are currently browsing .
A sample display is shown below :
The display consists of concentric rings , each of which represents a time period ranging from one minute to several days .
Each ring is divided into regions reflecting a single category of web pages .
( We currently use the OpenDirectory classification , but any categorization would work ) .
The categories are arranged alphabetically , going around counterclockwise from the 3 o'clock position ( which makes sense for mathematicians at least ) .
Colors are arbitrary , but are chosen to maximize the difference between possibly adjacent categories .
Within each category area is a wavy line that encodes information about the the pages being viewed in that category .
The display is updated every minute or so .
The display provides the user with several types of information .
The arc span for each category is proportional to the number of views ( pages requested by a browser ) of pages of that category during the time span .
The hue of the region denotes the category ; the saturation of the coloring reflects the relative number of views .
Thus , if a span has relatively few views ( where relative is based on the amount of time covered by the span versus the overall history ) , then the region will be lighter ; if the span has a lot of views , the span will be darker .
The wavy line itself can encodes the relative number of distinct URLs during the time span in the frequence of the line .
Thus , if all the pages viewed for a single category were from a single url , the line would be flat ; if each was distinct , the line would be quite wavy .
The thickness of the line is used to reflect the relative number of users browsing pages of that category .
If all the browsing was done by a single user , the line would be quite thin ; if its corresponds to lots of distinct users , the line would be thick .
The display can also encode information in the brightness ( fade to black ) of the spans and in the amplitude of the lines .
The user has the option of changing the various display properties through appropriate dialog boxes .
This includes changing the statistic associated with each graphical property , changing the colors associated with the different categories , mapping categories , and changing the different spans .
Information Gathering
In order to display information about what is happening on the web , we need to gather the information .
Thus , this program is spyware .
It monitors your browsing history and reports the pages you browse to a central server where they are categorized and the categories are recorded .
However , the program records no identfying or personal information .
" Users " are represented by a unique random ID that is only used to get user counts .
The IDs are arbitrary and can't be traced back to the source ( as far as I know ) .
The spyware only works when you are running the viewer and only for the user who does the running .
Full source is provided if you do n't believe what is going on .
Note that our tool works on windows , linux , and Mac OS / X with safari , mozilla , IE , and Opera in various combinations .
If you want to contribute to the project data but do n't want to run the visualizer , we provide a script which runs only the history monitor .
Classification
The system never saves URLs or user ids .
Instead , as it learns about a page , it finds the appropriate category and periodically saves information about the number of pages , users and URLs for each category .
The system does not download or access a page in order to find its category .
Instead , it attempts to find the category only using the URL .
Using the TAIGA framework , we allow multiple implementations of classifiers .
We currently provide three different ones .
Our first categorizer used the Google web service , asking Google to search for the particular page and looking at the Open Directory classification that Google returns as part of the result .
This is limited both because Google does n't want us to call the web service more than 1000 times a day and because they do n't always report the classification even for relatively common pages .
An alternative is the MeURLin project .
We have a classifier that talks to their demonstration web page ( they do n't have a web service set up yet ) , and extracts the result .
This is quite effective ( with varying degrees of accuracy ) , but is still a bit too slow for our purposes .
Our third classifier reads the open directory database at start up and builds a classification tree for a URL .
Once the tree is built ( which takes 15 minutes and 2G of memory ) , the lookup is quite fast .
While all three classifiers are available , and TAIGA is free to choose whichever is best at a given time , the most likely one being used right now is the latter .
If anyone has a better classifier or one that they would like to try , I would be happy to quickly integrate it into the system .
Taiga allows the implementation to be a library , client - server type service , or web - service .
Data Storage
We are using the global file system properties of TAIGA to provide the initial information repository .
The accumulated results from information gathering are periodically appended to a current data file .
Because this file can potentially get rather large , we actually maintain a set of data files where files are linked from one to another .
A separate server is provided to identify the current file for a given starting time , to create new files as the data files get too large , and to link the files to one another .
This service will be started automatically ( if it is n't already running ) on a machine at Brown .
Network
At the heart of this project is the TAIGA system .
When you run the visualizer , you will also be running the TAIGA kernel on your machine .
Taiga uses the JXTA peer - to - peer package to provide communication among the various kernels and services .
At initial startup you will probably see ( at least for now ) a JXTA configuration dialog box .
If things are working , just clicking okay should be sufficient .
If you are familiar with jxta , feel free to modify the various settings .
Using JXTA , webview should be able to run inside firewalls and on arbitray machines .
If you want to get a log from the TAIGA kernel as it runs on your machine either set the environment variable TAIGASHOW ( on windows ) or set the environment variable TAIGALOG to the full pathname of an appropriate log file .
Papers
Nothing has been written about this project yet .
We value any experiences you have with it and welcome any and all feedback for when ( and if ) we do write a report .
Feedback
This software is ( very ) experimental .
We have attempted to do a variety of different installations , but have only a limited range of systems available .
There is a lot that can go wrong both in the kernel , in the application , and in the networking that glues everything together .
We want to fix things , but to do so we need to know what does n't work ( and possibly what does ) .
We welcome all feedback , bug reports , suggestions , comments , inquiries , etc. Send email to spr@cs.brown.edu .
Software
If you are in Brown computer science , the latest release of the software can be obtained at / home / spr/tryview ( Y : \home\spr\tryview on windows ) .
If you are outside of the Brown CS network , the software can be obtained from our ftp server in either ( tar.gz ) or ( zip ) format .
Installation is simple : download and expand the software .
Running it is simple as well : simple execute the runview script ( or runview . bat on windows ) to get the visualizer .
( To run only the monitoring software use the runspy scripts ) .

The announcement by North Korea that they have successfully tested a nuclear weapon in a remote region near the northernmost border with China  and may well explode another  was entirely predictable , given the course of the non-negotiations that have been going on since the 1990s .
The Clinton administration tried to engage Pyongyang , with notable lack of success , and the Bush administration has spent years ignoring the problem , convinced that if we talk to our enemies we ’ll have given them a " carrot " they can chew on to their heart ’s content without granting any concessions in return .
We talk to no one but our rapidly shrinking circle of " friends , " and hope for the best  that is U.S. policy , not only in North Asia , but everywhere and anywhere .
We have reaped what we have sown  and made the world a much less safe place .
Yet it is n’t really all about us , as much as the world ’s only superpower would like to believe it is : the pressures that brought about this signal event are multifarious and complex , having mostly to do with internal North Korean politics and the last Stalinist nation ’s largely hidden relations with its only remaining ally  China .
The rulers of the Hermit Kingdom have been planning this for some 50 - plus years , and the question is : why now ?
There is , of course , the Iraq factor : one North Korean general said to a visiting American academic , " We see what you ’re getting ready to do with Iraq , and you are not going to do it to us . "
The possession of a nuke is an insurance policy against regime change .
Yet the question is : why now ?
The answer is rising disaffection within North Korea , and a widening split with their Chinese allies .
As far as the former is concerned , the North Korean regime has its own built - in destabilizing factors .
When longtime " Glorious Leader " Kim Il - Sung died , there was , at first , some question as to who would succeed him : the father had made his intention clear that his son was to take the helm , but this was by no means foreordained  there was competition for the job , coming from the military and the various factions within the Workers Party of Korea , the one - party dictatorship that has ruled North Korea since the end of World War II .
Even after Kim Jong - Il had taken the reins of power , there was evidence of dissension in the ranks , coming from hardliners in the military , who , for example , were pissed off that the " Dear Leader " had apologized to Japan for the kidnapping of Japanese nationals .
North Korea is a remarkably opaque society , even as isolated neo-Stalinist dictatorships go , but there is solid evidence that the monolithic public unity of the ruling Workers Party of Korea is a façade behind which the usual scheming cliques clash in a struggle for power .
The succession struggle did not go unremarked in the foreign media , although indications of it were few and far between .
One example : a mysterious explosion last year sparked rumors of an attempted assassination of the " Dear Leader . "
Although we may never know the truth about the nature and extent of dissatisfaction with the somewhat erratic and reportedly highly eccentric Kim Jong - Il , such clues as we do have point to a " Dear Leader " forced to maintain a delicate balancing act between hardliners in the military and the old " guerrilla " faction associated with his late father on the one hand , and the vaguely pro-reform Yanan faction revived ( after being purged earlier ) by growing Chinese influence on the other .
What we do know is that a major split has developed between Pyongyang and Beijing .
The Chinese have been increasingly at odds with their troublesome allies , and the recent statements by Chinese officials that some sort of punitive action is necessary in response to North Korea ’s nuclear test is merely the culmination of a long divorce proceeding that really began before Kim Jong - Il came to power .
It began in 1956 , when Kim Il - Sung purged members of the Yanan faction inside the Workers Party of Korea .
The Yanan group was centered around individuals associated with Mao and the Communist Party of China , who took refuge with their fellow Commies during the war against the Japanese occupation .
The " Glorious Leader " distrusted them , and got rid of them right after the Korean War , but they bounced back under the rule of Kim Jong - Il and the country ’s growing isolation , as China was a vital source of economic and military aid .
The testimony of a high - ranking defector points to the revival of Yanan :
“ The most frightening prospect is not that North Korea will collapse .
What I fear most is that Kim Jong will bow down to China to get the help he needs , and North Korea will slip into the Chinese orbit .
He understands the need for reform .
But he wo n’t go beyond partial reform because he fears losing control , and halfway measures wo n’t solve the problems of food and industrial regeneration that North Korea faces . ”
It appears , however , that the fears of this defector  a former top member of the WPK  have not been borne out by events .
Indeed , quite the opposite has occurred : the Chinese , grown impatient with the antics of their orthodox Communist neighbors , have largely abandoned support for Pyongyang , in favor of lucrative trade deals with the West .
When the North Koreans launched their long - range missile test  which failed rather spectacularly  the Chinese , far from supporting their supposed allies in Pyongyang , actually authored the UN Security Council resolution condemning them .
This fascinating analysis holds that the Chinese have known about North Korean plans for a nuke test all along , and that explains the growing distance between the two ostensibly Communist regimes .
The Chinese reportedly sent a delegation to Pyongyang , asking that they cease and desist , but apparently Kim Jong - Il would n’t even see them .
This theory also explains why the primary roads linking China and North Korea are noticeably empty of trucks : the vital lifeline of food aid and oil deliveries has been cut , and the North Koreans  facing famine and worse  are hopping mad .
Backed up against the wall by unremitting U.S. hostility , and now the betrayal of their only allies , the Chinese , the North Koreans are falling back on the ideology of " Juche , " or self - reliance , that they have developed over the years : i.e. , economic autarky and complete isolation in every other sense .
They are doing as they have done throughout their history : when the external threats become too great , they simply retreat into the high mountains and live off the land , to return to the lowlands when danger passes .
The Korean question has been smoldering on the back burner for decades , and that it is now coming to a boil is a function of the passing of Communism as a force to be reckoned with .
The implosion of the Soviet empire , and the general rejection of Marxism - Leninism inside the Communist Party of China , eliminated two main pillars of support for the continuity of Communist rule in North Korea .
During the Cold War era , Pyongyang played Moscow off against Beijing rather successfully , while still managing to retain some real measure of independence .
The passing of the Marxist project put an end to that game , and they are fast running out of options .
The rule of the " Dear Leader " depends , in the end , on upholding the unusually fierce nationalism that animates the Korean mindset : they may be starving , but at least they ’re independent  this ultra-nationalist sentiment was consistently played to by Kim Il - Sung in order to cement his rule and maintain public support even in the face of increasing economic hardship .
His son is pursing the same path .
The end of that road may have been reached , however , as the ferocity of North Korean nationalism wilts in the face of widespread famine .
This is what the Chinese fear most : the collapse of the regime and a flood of refugees in their millions , who will pour into China without resources or anything to lose .
The South Koreans fear it , too , for the same reasons , and more : it will mean tremendous costs to be incurred , as well as endless political and social problems that they are ill - prepared to handle .
Both would greatly prefer a " soft landing " to the East German - style implosion that brought down the Berlin Wall .
The Chinese do not want to see a united Korea , in any case , especially one aligned with the United States .
Yet they cannot control their quarrelsome neighbor , and have aligned themselves with the Americans and the Japanese rather than defend them .
The South Koreans , prevented by their American overlords from implementing their " sunshine policy " of increasing ties to the North and eventually effecting a peaceful reunification , are now completely at a loss as to what to do , and fear of another war is endemic .
There have been a number of recent incidents in or near the DMZ , and everyone is very nervous .
As well they might be
The United States is the single greatest obstacle to a peaceful , reunified Korean peninsula .
The reason for this is , simply put , because Washington adamantly refuses to end its 50 - year - plus military occupation of the South .
The American presence is a relic of the Cold War at its height , and it has n’t been necessary for quite some time .
Such political support as the WPK has among Koreans North and South is due to the continuing depredations and humiliations suffered at the hands of the occupying forces , whose presence is an insult to Korean national pride no matter which side of the DMZ we are talking about .
Yet , for internal political reasons , as well as the economic interests of base - building military contractors , the American occupation has continued as part of the U.S. " forward " stance in the Pacific and around the world .
This has distorted the natural development of Korean society , politically deforming it from the very beginning and providing support for a series of military dictators who have only relatively recently relinquished power .
South Korea proceeded along the path to democracy in spite of , rather than with the assistance of , the American occupiers .
Today , in the name of " protecting " democracy and " liberating " the North , the U.S. government pursues a policy that virtually ensures the Korean peninsula will remain in a state of permanent stasis  frozen in the postures of a Cold War that has long since passed .
I have made the case for a permanent and complete U.S. withdrawal from South Korea in the past  see here , here , here , and here  and I wo n’t repeat myself in this column .
Suffice to say the government in Seoul presides over a state that is far wealthier and much more populous than the starved and rapidly failing regime still hanging on in Pyongyang .
The South is more than capable of defending itself from the North , and the military necessity of keeping American soldiers on the ground there has long since vanished ( if it ever existed ) .
With nuclear weapons in the hands of the North , however , the military requirement that our troops leave ASAP is more urgent than ever .
Do we really want some 30,000 U.S. troops held hostage by the mercurial moods of Kim Jong - Il , who might decide , at any moment , to go out in a blaze of glory ?
The American response to Kim Jong - Il ’s nuclear brinkmanship should be to immediately announce the complete withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula .
Let Seoul , Tokyo , and Beijing figure out what to do about their own regional problem .
Without the American presence , the entire political basis of the WPK ’s support dries up overnight , and the tremendous resources tied up in military production are freed up  solving the immediate humanitarian crisis now unfolding in the North .
In the end , the acquisition of nuclear weapons by North Korea has to be laid at the doorstep of the Americans , who made it clear that this is the only course open to a nation that fails to kowtow to the Imperial Hegemon .
The Iranians understand this , too , which is why they pointedly failed to condemn the test .
Having been singled out by George W. Bush ’s speechwriters as part of the " axis of evil "  and , remember , this was said by a president who claims [ . pdf ] the right to " preemptively " attack any nation on earth  it was inevitable that Pyongyang would carry out its promise to deter the U.S. at all costs .
The great danger now is that the crisis will escalate , and this would be greatly exacerbated by a UN - sanctioned blockade .
The U.S. is proposing this , along with a set of stringent sanctions , and if China goes along , all bets are off .
This would be seen by the North Koreans as an act of war , and it is only a matter of time before some incident sparks a full - fledged conflict .
The destruction of Seoul , the decimation of much of the South , and huge U.S. losses  this would be just the beginning of a second Korean War that could climax with the bombing of Tokyo , a Chinese " preemptive " invasion , and regional chaos .
What brought us to this moment is our refusal to recognize that the costs of global hegemony are far greater than the alleged benefits , including the dubious " benefit " of maintaining expensive and militarily unnecessary bases on the far frontiers of Empire .
It is not too late to rescue reason from habit and meet this crisis with fresh thinking , yet I fear that the War Party will take full advantage of North Korea ’s actions to push their program of confrontation and regime change .
The domestic political advantages to the Democrats of appearing " tough " on this issue outweigh the possibility of talking sense to the American people , and I ’m afraid that neither party has a monopoly on warmongering .
True , the Democrats are supportive of direct negotiations with Pyongyang : heck , even James Baker endorses that .
The question , however , is what the U.S. is willing to negotiate , and there is no indication that Washington would be willing to deal with fundamental issues regardless of which party happens to be in power .
Until and unless we are willing to reexamine the entire basis of American policy in North Asia and address the principal cause of conflict  the archaic and destabilizing American military presence  the war danger will remain .
Indeed , it will only increase as tensions rise and the pressures brought to bear on the North Korean regime culminate in tragedy  and , perhaps , a nuclear firestorm .
むちゃくちゃ遅まきですが 、StrongtalkのVMがオープンソースになったということについて。SunのJavaは、言語としては一気に人気が出たものの、とてつもなくしょぼいVMが使われていたころがありました。その時は、さまざまなSmalltalk VM作成経験のある人がSunに行って異なるJava VMを作っていた時代でもありました。今VMWareにいる(はずの)
Ole Agesen もExact VMというものを作っていましたが、本命はAnimorphicという会社が買収されて(主に)そのメンバーでHotSpot VMだったわけです。AnimorphicはStrongtalkという処理系を作っていましたが、Strongtalkは今GoogleのCTOをやっているUrs Hölzle がSelf VMでやっていた型フィードバックを使ったコンパイラを受け継いだものでもありました。HotSpotはStrongtalkを基にしたものの、Javaのためにほとんどのところは書き換えられたようではありますが(なので出てくるまでにそうとう余計に時間がかかっていた)
、Lars Bakなどのがんばりでなんとか世に出たわけですね。( LarsはSun LabsでJohnの同僚だったわけなので、彼がMontyを作っていたころに一度紹介してもらったことがあります。興奮すると、指をぱちぱち鳴らしながらしゃべるんだよ、とJohnがうれしそうに言っていましたが)
97年ごろから始まったこういう流れにより、爆速のSmalltalk処理系だったStrongtalk VMは誰も使うことができなくなってしまい、速い処理系が世の中で使われていないことから「動的言語はどうせ遅い」というような誤解を招くことにもなっていたわけです。ただ、HotSpotそのものもオープンソースになるとか言っているこのご時世、古いコードを抱えている必要もないので、「ばあさんは用済みだから」ということでオープンソースになったのでしょう。
というわけで 、David Griswoldが中心となって、StrongtalkのテクノロジーをいろいろなSmalltalk処理系、とくにオープンソースのものに注入しようという動きがあります。先日あったときには、Danもそのまま使うことにはならないということは理解したうえで、ある程度の興味を示していました。
というあたりが事実関係ですが、さて。
速くなる、というとそれだけで良いことのように聞こえますが、古めのC++で書かれた複雑なコードベースを使うのは、かなり危険だと思います。仮に5倍の速さで動くとしても、世界中で一握りの人しかメインテナンスのできないようなものは長い期間にわたって成長させていくべきオープンソース的活動にはそぐわないですからね。なにより動的言語というからには、VMのような固定化したレイヤーはなるべく小さくして、将来に渡って必要な変更をなるべく簡単に行えるようになっているほうが良いと思います。
Squeak VMの利点のひとつ はSqueak自身で書かれていることで、VMのデバッグやシミュレーションをSqueak内の対話的な環境で行えることでした。そのSqueakコードをCに変換してCコンパイラでコンパイルするので、20とか30とか(数え方もいろいろありますが)のプラットフォーム上でそこそこの速度で動くようなものにできたわけです。が、欠点はやっぱりレイヤーができてしまっているということで、VMそのものの振る舞いを実行時に変えられなくなってしまっていることです(ガーベージコレクションの途中で、ある特別なことをやって欲しくなったときに、アプリケーションがそれを変えたりできないとか ) 。
こういう問題を解決するための方向性のひとつは、なるべく小さなVMにしようという動きがあるわけですが、ちょっとブループレーン的に考えてみると、「VMなんてものはなくしてしまって、動的言語を使って、その言語からマシンコードに変換してそれをメモリに書き込むプログラムを書けばよい」ということになります。これが最近この日記に時々出てくる「Ianのやつ」というものがやろうとしていることです。
言語からマシンコードの変換をするためには言語を定義しなくてはいけませんが、その言語の定義というのも文法とそこに書かれた変換規則というBNFチックなというかyaccチックなもので書きます。が、そもそも「yaccの記述みたいなもの」もある文法定義に従った言語ですから、自分自身で記述すればよいことになります(アイディアそのものは例によって60年代からあって、実装もされているわけですが ) 。
これを使うと、例え ばJavaScript風の言語処理系が150行くらいの記述のみで定義できるようになります。そうしたければ、その記述内で使用されている変換規則の記述をJavaScript風の言語で行うようにすることもできます。こうやって150行くらいで書いたものが、広く使われているSafariとかのブラウザに入っている本物のJavaScript処理系より速くそして小さいメモリで動作するようになったりするわけです。もう何百行か足したりすると世界最速のJavaScript処理系になるでしょう。
そ の150行のほかには数千行程度で書かれた木の変換や、木のパターンからマシンコードの生成をするようなプログラムがあるわけですが、みそはそれらのコードの間には境界はないので、上から下がいつでも変更できるということです。
スピードは 「 最適化していないCくらい」を目指すべきでしょう。高速化を目指すためには、あらゆるところで細かな場合分けをしてそれぞれ専用のコードを書いて、フロー解析などもがんばって、ということも原理的には可能ではありますが、そうやって得られた速度と導入されてしまった複雑性とは常に天秤にかけなくてはいけません。動的言語界は遅くても許される場合が多いので、数百行という普通のプログラマでも全容が理解できる程度の記述で処理系を書いてしまって将来のユーザーの拡張を促すほうが良いのではないか、と思います。特に機械依存のところはなるべく小さいほうが良いですからね。
似たような話 はLuaとかでもあるわけですが、なるべくなら「言語」ということで終わらないで、「システム」として捉えられるものを、何百万行とか何千万行とかではなく何万行かで書いて、本当に使えるものにしてみたいものです。
The turtle only comes ashore to lay its eggs
The hawksbill turtle has suffered from poaching , fishing and loss of habitat , and is now critically endangered .
Research has revealed that females return to the same beach to lay eggs up to eight times in one season .
Scientists at the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) are hoping to find out where the turtles go the rest of the year to aid conservation efforts .
Visitors to ZSL 's website will be able to monitor the progress of several turtles on their long journeys across the Indian Ocean .
Migration mystery
The society 's marine turtle project was set up three years ago to protect nests in remote areas of northern Mozambique .
Nests are often raided for eggs , which are considered a delicacy by some , and the turtle is also hunted for its prized shiny shell .
Hawksbill turtle Hawksbills are listed by the IUCN as a critically endangered species Little is known about the migration patterns of this rare species Like most turtles , fishing , loss of habitat and disease are also major problems
A local team working for ZSL has already recorded and protected more than 300 nests of hawksbill and green turtles .
The project 's next step is to fit state - of - the - art satellite tags to the shells of a small number of female hawksbills - two or three initially - to see where they go when they leave the beaches .
" They are a critically endangered species - there is only a small population left - so it is imperative to try and protect the nesting areas as best as possible , " ZSL 's aquatic conservation manager Alison Shaw told BBC News .
A team in Mozambique has helped eradicate poaching
" By understanding the population dynamics , we will be able to work with partners to develop regional strategies to protect them . "
In a separate research effort , scientists are to take small samples of skin from the forelimbs of turtles for genetic analysis .
They hope to build up a better understanding of the relationship between different turtle populations and migratory routes .
Dear , Merlin ,
For someone so fond of lecturing other people about their problems , I have a lot of annoying tics ( I mean , duh ) .
One of my worst , at least back in the day , was seldom bothering to RTFM before demanding lots of time - consuming help from others .
For years , my court of first resort was almost always to email the smartest , often busiest person I knew about a given topic , alerting them as to their new role as the speed bump between me and solving my problem ( cf : the classic Balloon joke ) .
I 've gotten better at it over the years , for sure , and , in the age of Google , it 's a habit that 's easy enough to shed .
The funny thing I eventually realized was that I could and often did find the solution to my problem -- part way through writing the email in which I was asking for help .
I realize this sounds kind of silly , but the next time you 're having trouble figuring something out , try writing a note to yourself .
Seriously , open up your email program , type in your own email address , then choose a brilliant subject line that perfectly encapsulates your particular problem .
In the body of the message , start by typing a 2 - 3 sentence paragraph summarizing the trouble you 're having , with a focus not on your frustration or your dramatic need for immediate help -- instead concentrate on coolly describing exactly what you want to accomplish as well as what happens when you try the approach that has n't been working for you .
Remember : you 're theoretically writing this to the smartest , busiest person you know , so do n't waste their time with theatrics , melodrama , and passive - aggression ; just give them accurate information that describes where you 're getting hung up .
Next , explain the ways you 've already tried to solve this problem , including any alternate solutions , workarounds , hacks , reboots , etc .
Anything that will help this very smart friend rule out possible causes is useful .
And do n't be reluctant to use Google as you go ; fact - checking yourself , choosing precise language , and ensuring that you 've framed the right problem .
If you 're still typing at this point ( meaning you have n't stumbled upon 1 or 2 new solutions to try ) , outline 3 - 5 possible causes for the problem .
Bullet out any recent changes , new software , theoretically related problems -- anything that you think might be contributing to the primary hang - up .
Now go back and read your email like you 're the smartest , busiest person you know -- like it 's not actually your problem .
What 's missing ?
What would you suggest they try first ?
Is it plugged in ?
In an astonishing number of cases -- and at practically any point in this process -- one or several things are likely to occur to you :
You 're overlooking something fundamental .
There 's an insanely obvious solution you had n't thought of .
You forgot about a configuration change .
You missed a dependency .
You 're using an excellent solution ... for the wrong problem .
You were getting so worked - up and clicking so many things that you were actually making a trivial problem much worse .
You , um , had n't Googled for the Subject line of your message ( or your error message , etc. ) .
You got so emotionally invested in solving the wrong problem that you did n't realize there 's a simpler way to do what you ultimately need .
You do n't really need to be doing this at all .
It 's actually not plugged in .
This most definitely will not work for 100 % of your problems , but you may be surprised at how well it works for most of them .
Alan Watts once wrote that once we understand a problem we 've actually solved it -- that you make a dark room brighter by adding light , not by waving your arms around .
Next time you 're waving your arms around in the dark , make sure you understand the real nature of your problem -- and not just allow yourself to pout and stay fixated on the desire for your frustration to go away .
You probably already know the answer to your problem or you at least know where to find it .
Maybe you just do n't know you know it yet .
Love ,
Merlin
Fonts for the Web
Until font downloading technology is perfected , Web designers must normally restrict themselves to fonts that are available on most users ’ computer systems .
So which fonts are installed on everyone ’s computers ?
Your best bets are the ones that come with the Internet Explorer ( MSIE ) browser and the Windows and Macintosh operating systems .
For the last few years , the MSIE fonts have been installed on every new Windows and Macintosh PC , so they are your best “ cross - platform ” bet .

Nov. 23 , 2006  -- Roughly 3 million Americans live with epilepsy .
And a surprising number of them go to jail for it .
Why ?
Around the country , police officers and bystanders who see someone having a seizure mistake it for disorderly , criminal behavior .
That 's what happened to Daniel Beloungea of Pontiac , Mich .
On most days Daniel lives the normal life of a 48 - year - old single man .
But roughly once a week , he loses total control of his body and mind to an epileptic seizure .
A seizure took over Beloungea 's body while walking through his suburban Detroit neighborhood last April .
When an onlooker in a neighbor 's house saw Beloungea having the seizure , which includes rapid repetitive arm motion , she misinterpreted it as criminal conduct .
Specifically , she thought Beloungea was masturbating in public .
With that misconception in mind , she called the police .
When the Oakland County Sheriff 's Department arrived on the scene , Beloungea was still undergoing his seizure , acting disoriented and not responding to questions .
When officers could n't get through to Beloungea they drew their weapons , shocked him with a high - voltage taser , hit him with a baton and wrestled him to the ground .
They then handcuffed him and put him in a police car .
Oakland County Undersheriff Michael McCabe said that the officers tasered Beloungea because he lunged at one of them .
Beloungea and his lawyer say the more police got physical the more Beloungea got agitated and aggressive -- typical behavior , according to the Epilepsy Foundation of America , for a person restrained while having a partial complex seizure .
Beloungea 's wild motions and inability to communicate were not defiance or resistance , but classic symptoms of epilepsy
The officers put Beloungea in jail , citing assault of a police officer and resisting arrest .
Throughout the incident Beloungea , was wearing a medical alert bracelet identifying him as an epileptic , stating his name and the contact numbers of people who can be reached in case of an emergency .
Later , Michigan state psychologists who examined Beloungea would confirm that he was having a seizure at the time of his arrest and that he was no danger to himself or to others .
The Epilepsy Foundation of America said it sees cases like Beloungea 's around the country .
The foundation said it could cite more than a dozen cases of police violence toward people in the midst of a seizure over the past 10 years .
In 1999 , Joaquin Gonzales died after he was arrested and hog tied while having an epileptic seizure in a Taos County , N.M. , jail .
County officials fired the guards on duty that night and paid Gonzales ' family a $ 1.25 million settlement for his wrongful death .
Eric Hargis , the Epilepsy Foundation 's CEO , cites one common aspect in each of those incidents :
Police should have been better trained to recognize the seizure and not to use force on an epileptic .
" It 's fairly easy , really , with limited amount of training for a police or other emergency first responder to be able to spot a seizure … this did n't have to take place , " Hargis told ABC News .
" All [ Beloungea ] is guilty of is having a medical condition that resulted in a seizure . "
The foundation sent a short set of guidelines to police departments around the country to help officers recognize and deal with victims of such seizures , but the Oakland County Sheriff 's office claimed never to have heard of it until after Beloungea 's case .
Look and Learn
When most people think of epileptic seizures , they think of people shaking on the ground -- symptoms of what 's called a tonic - clonic or grand mal seizure .
What Beloungea goes through is called a partial complex seizure , and it 's actually more common .
A partial complex seizure does not come with the violent shaking symptoms most people associate with epilepsy .
It involves a spell of unorganized , unintentional behavior : picking at clothes , chewing motions , and wandering aimlessly .
The Epilepsy Foundation said that the best thing police or bystanders can do when they see someone undergoing a seizure is to not restrain the person .
Rather , they should simply let the seizure pass , watch to make sure the seizure sufferer is not in harm 's way , and comfort the person when it ends .
Call 911 if the episode lasts more than 5 to 7 minutes , the group advises .
Beloungea was ultimately found not guilty by reason of insanity .
Beloungea is not insane -- he 's simply epileptic .
But his lawyer , Otis Underwood , told ABC News there was no other way to get Beloungea off the charges than the insanity defense .
The catch :
He had to spend 20 days locked in a criminal mental facility .
Beloungea said he 's still waiting for an apology from the Oakland Sheriff 's Office .
What would Beloungea say if he could address them directly ?
" I would say , ' In a situation like mine , look for a medical bracelet .
Pay attention to what you 're doing , know your job .
Do n't just grab a taser gun … 50,000 volts in a situation like mine could kill a person . ' "
Beloungea 's case is closed , for now .
He 's just hoping police will know better next time his body betrays him .
November is National Epilepsy Awareness Month .

In case you were hoping to take advantage of the Amazon Customers Vote deal for a $ 100 Xbox 360 on Thanksgiving , Amazon.com was reportedly not reachable from least 2 -2:15 pm EST ( 11 am - 11:15 am PST ) .
Presumably , the traffic caused by the $ 100 Xbox seekers was simply too much .
Some people are complaining that they could n’t even load the Amazon homepage …
I tried to around 2:10 EST and could n’t get a response from the Web server .
Update :
There are over 500 comments in a thread on the Amazon Customers Vote Forum with disgruntled customers chiming in , in addition to other blogs which have noted the outage .
Plenty of people are not happy and some are filing Better Business Bureau complaints .
the 5 - in - 1 network admin 's cable
ethernet / crossover / modem / null modem / Cisco console
featured in the premiere edition of Make
There is nothing worse than showing up for an on - site visit without the correct cable you need for a job .
So what is a network admin to do , carry around several bulky cables everywhere ?
For quite some time I 've been carrying a single CAT5 ethernet cable in my laptop bag along with " the world 's shortest crossover cable " and an RJ45 coupler .
This allows me to turn my ethernet cable into a crossover cable and eliminates the need to carry around a second lengthy cable .
Handy , but nothing to write home about .
More recently I have been working with a lot of network devices with serial console ports , including Cisco routers and various other things .
This means lugging around a null modem cable in addition to the non-standard RJ - 45 to DB - 9 console cable required by most Cisco equipment .
But after putting together four simple custom adapters , I now have an ethernet cable , a crossover ethernet cable , a modem cable , a null modem cable , and a Cisco console cable all by carrying around just one standard ethernet cable .
An added benefit is that I can always extend my cable by finding a longer ethernet cable than the one I carry in my bag .
It is usually pretty easy to locate a long ethernet cable but not so easy to locate a long null modem cable .
Do you find yourself toting several of these cables everywhere you go ?
Do you often wish you had brought a different cable with you after you have arrived on - site ?
Are you as geeky as me and think that this is just plain cool even if you never expect to configure a router in your lifetime ?
Then you need the 5 - in - 1 network admin 's cable !
Here 's how to make your own :
Buy , beg , borrow or steal the tools and materials you will need : 2 DB9 female to RJ45 female modular adapters
These are the kind which you can pin however you want .
8 extra female pins for the DB9 connectors Plus have a few extras on hand unless you are much more dextrous than me .
4 RJ45 modular plugs Ditto on the extras just in case .
2 short lengths of CAT5 cable , preferably of different colors
You can cut up existing cables .
1 RJ45 coupler
The coupler must have all eight conductors .
Be aware that many ethernet couplers , such as the one shown here , only have four .
1 straight - through ethernet cable
It must be an eight conductor cable , not a four conductor cable .
a pair of RJ45 crimpers , wire strippers , and some kind of crimper for the DB9 pins ( needle nosed pliers would probably work )
Make " the world 's shortest crossover cable "
Note that this cable must cross the pairs that are not used by ethernet in addition to the pairs that are .
This is why you must perform this critical step and cannot use a standard crossover cable you may already own .
You can actually make this as long as you want , but the longer you make it the more you have to carry around .
The pinout looks like : 1 -> 3 2 -> 6 3 -> 1 4 -> 7 5 -> 8 6 -> 2 7 -> 4 8 -> 5 Crimp one of the RJ45 plugs on each end .
Order the wires on one end according to the 568B standard : white / orange orange white / green blue white / blue green white / brown brown
This is the most common order for ethernet cables , so you could get a head start by snipping off the end of an existing cable and then you only have to do the other end .
The other end should like like : white / green green white / orange white / brown brown orange blue white / blue
If you are as geeky as me , you 'll make sure that each pair has at least one twist .
Then you can prove people wrong if they scoff , " That 's not the world 's shortest crossover cable , that 's just an adapter ! " ( optional )
Make the Cisco console adapter :
This adapter works with the RJ45 serial port found on most Cisco routers .
It also works on some Sun servers .
This is pretty much just like the crossover cable but with a different pinout : 1 -> 6 2 -> 5 3 -> 3 4 -> 8 5 -> 7 6 -> 4 7 -> 1 8 -> 2
Make the first end according to 568B again : white / orange orange white / green blue white / blue green white / brown brown
And the other end : white / brown brown white / green green orange white / orange white / blue blue
It is important to note that this is not a symmetric adapter .
The 568B end will point away from the router and the other end will be inserted into the router .
I marked the router end of mine with a sharpie so I would n't forget .
Cisco's ( otherwise very helpful ) cabling page has RTS and CTS reversed on the DB9 / RJ45 console cable , which I verified by inspecting an actual Cisco cable .
They do n't really care anyway because their console ports do not use flow control , but doing it the right way enables interoperability with Sun servers and perhaps some other things .
Make two DB9 / RJ45 adapters :
This is the trickiest part .
In order to make your cable compatible with the largest number of serial devices possible , you need to combine a couple pins and split another one .
Here is the pinout : DB9 pin signal RJ45 pin color *
-------
------
--------
----- 1 DCD 8 white 2 RxD 3 black 3 TxD 1 blue 4 DTR 5 green 5 SG 2 and 6 orange and yellow 6 DSR 8 white 7 RTS 4 red 8 CTS 7 brown 9 RI none
So our ethernet turned serial cable will be pinned : 1 TxD pair one 2 SG pair one 3 RxD pair two 4 RTS pair three 5 DTR pair three 6 SG pair two 7 CTS pair four 8 DSR / DCD pair four *
My DB9F / RJ45 F modular adapters are colored blue , orange , black , red , green , yellow , brown , white ( RJ45 1 - 8 ) , but yours may not be .
If yours are different , ignore the colors in the above pinout .
DB9 pins 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 are easy .
Just push the appropriate pin in the back of the DB9 connector until it snaps .
Be careful not to get any of the pins mixed up because errors are a bit difficult to fix .
I seem to remember having a skinny little tool to pop the pins back out again some years back , but I can't find it anymore .
:-(
DB9 pin 5 needs two wires connected to it .
Snip the pins off of the wires coming from RJ45 pins 2 and 6 ( orange and yellow on mine ) , strip about 3 mm off the end of each , and crimp them together onto one of your spare pins .
RJ45 pin 8 has to connect to both 1 and 6 on the DB9 connector .
Snip the pin off of the white wire , strip the end , cut about an inch of scrap CAT5 and pull out two of the white wires , strip both ends off of them , crimp a pin on each one , and splice all three loose ends together .
You can break the end off of a spare pin and use it to crimp the three wires together .
You can use the other two white wires from the inch of CAT5 for the second adapter .
Both of the DB9 / RJ45 adapters should be wired exactly the same way , regardless of whether they will be used for DTE or DCE devices .
Here 's how to use it :
straight - through ethernet cable : no adapters needed crossover ethernet cable : ethernet - coupler - crossover modem cable : DB9 / RJ45 - ethernet - DB9 /RJ45 null modem cable : DB9 /RJ45 - ethernet - coupler - crossover - DB9 / RJ45
Cisco console cable : DB9 / RJ45 - ethernet - coupler - Cisco adapter Remember that the Cisco adapter is not reversible .
Notes :
This solution is somewhat similar to the Yost wiring standard which I have long found to be quite useful .
The only reason that I did not use the Yost standard for my DB9 / RJ45 adapters is that I wanted mine to work with any standard ethernet cable .
I did n't use Cisco 's pinout for the same reason .
Plus , Cisco generally irritates me .
I wanted the serial Transmit and Receive conductors each twisted with ground rather than with each other , which should cut down on cross - talk and allow longer cable lengths .
( I also think it is nifty to be able to use the same crossover cable for both ethernet and serial . )
I have n't done any length or reliability testing , but so far everything I have tried has worked just fine .
If you need a DB9 / RJ45 serial cable with different pinouts than the Cisco one , all you have to do is make another little CAT5 adapter .
Cable ends are cheap and plentiful .
When used as a serial cable , this is a hardware flow control ( CTS / RTS ) cable .
If you are using devices which both require hardware flow control , it should work .
If neither of your devices require hardware flow control , it should still work .
However , if one of your devices requires hardware flow control and the other does not support hardware flow control , then you need a cable that fakes flow control .
This could be done with an additional DB9 / RJ45 adapter or with another CAT5 adapter and some creative crimping ( my preference ) , both of which are left as exercises for the reader .
If you grab a random ethernet cable to use with your serial adapters , remember to make sure that it has all eight conductors .
Also keep in mind that most ethernet cables have only been tested for connectivity on four conductors ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 ) if they have been tested at all .
I used those conductors for the most important serial signals ( Transmit , Receive , and Ground ) just in case , but some serial devices wo n't talk without all eight working .
Extras :
Many additional adapters could easily be added to this set .
A few that leap to mind would be for other kinds of serial ports such as DB - 25 and various DIN and miniDIN ports for Macintoshes and other things .
If you come up with a useful one , send me the pinout ( as well as a link to an authoritative source regarding your device 's pinout if possible ) and I will post it here .
DB25 serial : DB25 pin signal RJ45 pin --------
------
--------
8 DCD 8 3 RxD 3 2 TxD 1 20 DTR 5 7 SG 2 and 6 6 DSR 8 4 RTS 4 5 CTS 7 loopback plug
You can use the leftover wires in that inch of CAT5 that you cut when making the DB9 adapters .
Pull four of them out and crimp both ends ( in little loops ) in a single RJ45 plug as follows : 1 TxD wire one 2 SG wire two 3 RxD wire one 4 RTS wire three 5 DTR wire four 6 SG wire two 7 CTS wire three 8 DSR / DCD wire four
The photograph depicts a three - wire RS - 232 loopback plug , not the four wire combination plug .
This works for RS - 232 loopback .
Alert reader , Bruce Bannach , pointed out that it also works for ethernet and that popping it into an ethernet port fools Windows into thinking it is attached to a network .
According to some Windows administrator friends of mine , this could be quite handy for things such as installing Windows 2000 Server .
Note that only wires one , three , and four are necessary for RS232 , and only wires one and two are required for ethernet .
I prefer to have them all for maximal multifunctionality . :-)
A handy use for this plug is to perform rudimentary cable testing .
To test an ethernet cable , for example , you can attach the loopback plug to one end of the cable with your coupler .
Then plug the other end of the cable into an ethernet port and see if you get link .
If you plug it into a Windows 2000 or XP box , it will notify you if there is link .
With Linux you can use mii-tool or mii-diag .
This works for both straight - through and crossover cables .
receive - only ethernet sniffer cable photo coming soon !
With a couple of splices , you can make the world 's shortest receive - only cable : target end : 1 wire one 2 wire two 3 wire one 4 5 6 wire two 7 8 sniffer end : 1 2 3 wire one 4 5 6 wire two 7 8 This cable provides loopback link ( just like the loopback adapter ) to a hub or other device while allowing a sniffer on the other end with 100 % assurance that no return traffic will be transmitted .
This follows the " Model B " design as described in Receive - only UTP cables and Network Taps .
the " throwing star " LAN tap
You can buy a clunky box for $ 100 or more that does nothing more than this simple and ultra-portable network tap .
Just use a coupler to insert the tap in - line on the end of an existing ethernet cable carrying the traffic that interests you , and then you can sniff one direction of traffic from one of the sniffer ends or the other direction of traffic from the other sniffer end .
You 'll need an extra coupler or two for this .
normal end one : 1 wire one 2 wire two 3 wire three 4 5 6 wire four 7 8 normal end two : 1 wire one 2 wire two 3 wire three 4 5 6 wire four 7 8 sniffer end one : 1 2 3 wire one 4 5 6 wire two 7 8 sniffer end two : 1 2 3 wire three 4 5 6 wire four 7 8 Like the sniffer cable above , the throwing star LAN tap provides receive - only sniffing , guaranteed to not interfere with network traffic .
This is great for inserting into crossover cable connections , such as a link between a firewall and a router .
This follows the basic design described in Receive - only UTP cables and Network Taps .
Some of the commercial alternatives have nice additional features but none is more portable .
See my blog for an even better version .
Ethernet and RS - 232 combination tap
If you like the throwing star LAN tap , you 'll love the Ethernet and RS - 232 tap .
Exercise for the reader : adapt this design to the throwing star form factor .
If all you ever use is an ethernet cable , everything starts to look like an RJ45 jack .

THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING .
By Joan Didion .
( Knopf , $ 23.95 . )
A powerful , persuasive account of the crisis of mortality after the sudden death of the author 's husband .
Yet we often imagine that the costs and benefits are unrelated , that we can somehow have 2006 health care at 1950 ( or even 1999 ) prices .
We think of health care as if it were gasoline , a product whose price and quality have nothing to do with each other .
There is no question that the American medical system does suffer from a lot of waste , be it insurance industry bureaucracy or expensive procedures that have n’t been proven effective .
But the No. 1 cause of the cost increases is still the one you can see at the hospital and in your medicine cabinet — defibrillators , chemotherapy , cholesterol drugs , neonatal care and other treatments that are both expensive and effective .
Not even most forms of preventive care , like keeping diabetes under control , usually save money , despite what many people think .
The care itself has some costs , and , more important , patients then live longer than they otherwise would have and rack up medical bills .
“ When I make this point , people accuse me of wanting people to die earlier .
But it ’s exactly the opposite , ” Dr. Jay Bhattacharya , a researcher at Stanford Medical School , told me .
“ If these expenditures are keeping people alive , it ’s money well spent . ”
As Dr. Mark R. Chassin of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York says , “ You almost always spend money to gain health . ”
Of course , the opposite is also true : the best way to reduce health care spending is to reduce health care itself .
Which is exactly what we ’re starting to do .
The growing number of families without health insurance are , in effect , families who have been kicked off the country ’s health care rolls .
Many will go without available treatment , will get sicker than they need to get — and will thereby save the rest of us money .
They are what now passes for a solution to the health care mess .
The current situation is indeed unsustainable , a point that the conventional wisdom has right .
The cost of health insurance can’t keep doubling every seven years , and wasteful spending — the brand - name drugs that are no better than generics , the treatments that have n’t been proved to extend lives or improve health — does need to be reined in .
But far too much of the discussion has been centered on this narrow idea .
Somehow , going to the mall to buy clothes has come to be seen as a vaguely patriotic way to keep the economy humming , and taking out a risky mortgage is considered to be an investment in one ’s future .
But medical care ?
That ’s just a cost .
It ’s easy to be against high costs , and it will no doubt be hard to come up with a broad health care solution .
But the way to start is by acknowledging that an affluent society should devote an ever - growing share of its resources to the health of its citizens .
“ We have enough of the basics in life , ” Mr. Cutler , the economist and author , points out .
“ What we really want are the time and the quality of life to enjoy them . ”
Even former members of the administration conceded they were tired of the muscle - bound style , longing for a more maternal approach to the globe .
“ We were exporting our anger and our fear , hatred for what had happened , ” Richard Armitage , the former deputy secretary of state , said in a speech in Australia , referring to the 9/11 attacks .
He said America needed “ to turn another face to the world and get back to more traditional things , such as the export of hope and opportunity and inspiration . ”
Talking about hope and opportunity and inspiration has propelled Barack Obama into the presidential arena .
His approach seems downright feminine when compared with the Bushies , or even Hillary Clinton .
He languidly poses in fashion magazines , shares feelings with Oprah and dishes with the ladies on “ The View . ”
After six years of chest - puffing , Senator Obama seems very soothing .
Because of the power of female consumers , some marketing experts predict we will end up a matriarchy .
This year , women also flexed their muscle at the polls , transformed into electoral Furies by the administration ’s stubborn course in Iraq .
On Tuesday , 51 percent of the voters were women , and 55 percent of women voted for the Democratic candidate .
It was a revival of the style of Bill Clinton , dubbed our first female president , who knitted together a winning coalition of independents , moderates and suburbanites .
According to The Times ’s exit polls , women were more likely than men to want some or all of the troops to be withdrawn from Iraq now , and 64 percent of women said that the war in Iraq has not improved U.S. security .
The Senate has a new high of 16 women and the House has a new high of at least 70 , with a few races outstanding .
Hillary ’s big win will strengthen her presidential tentacles .
Nancy Pelosi , who will be the first female speaker , softened her voice and look as she cracked the whip on her undisciplined party , taking care not to sound shrill .
When she needs to , though , she says she can use her “ mother - of - five voice . ”
At least for the moment , W. is n’t blustering and Cheney has lost his tubby swagger .
The president is trying to ride the Mommy vibe .
He even offered Madame Speaker help with those new drapes .
North Korea 's nuclear test is only the latest failure of the west 's proliferation policy .
And it demonstrates the need to return to the proven methods of multilateral disarmament .
Far from being crazy , the North Korean policy is quite rational .
Faced with a US government that believes the communist regime should be removed from the map , the North Koreans pressed ahead with building a deterrent .
George Bush stopped the oil supplies to North Korea that had been part of a framework to end its nuclear programme previously agreed with Bill Clinton .
Bush had already threatened pre-emptive war - Iraq - style - against a regime he dubbed as belonging to the axis of evil
The background to North Korea 's test is that , since the end of the cold war , the nuclear states have tried to impose a double standard , hanging on to nuclear weapons for themselves and their friends while denying them to others .
Like alcoholics condemning teenage drinking , the nuclear powers have made the spread of nuclear weapons the terror of our age , distracting attention from their own behaviour .
Western leaders refuse to accept that our own actions encourage others to follow suit .
North Korea 's action has now increased the number of nuclear weapon states to nine .
Since 1998 India , Pakistan and now North Korea have joined America , China , France , Russia , Israel and the UK .
The domino effect is all too obvious .
Britain wants nuclear weapons so long as the French do .
India said it would build one if there were no multilateral disarmament talks .
Pakistan followed rapidly .
In Iran and the Arab world Israel 's bomb had always been an incentive to join in .
But for my Iranian friends , waking up to a Pakistani bomb can be compared to living in a non-nuclear Britain and waking up to find Belgium had tested a nuclear weapon .
East Asia is unlikely to be different .
In 2002 Japan 's then chief cabinet secretary , Yasuo Fukuda , told reporters that " depending on the world situation , circumstances and public opinion could require Japan to possess nuclear weapons " .
The deputy cabinet secretary at the time , Shinzo Abe - now Japan 's prime minister - said afterwards that it would be acceptable for Japan to develop small , strategic nuclear weapons .
It was not supposed to be like this .
At the end of the cold war , disarmament treaties were being signed , and in 1996 the big powers finally agreed to stop testing nuclear weapons for the first time since 1945 .
The public , the pressure groups and the media all breathed a great sigh of relief and forgot about the bomb .
Everyone thought that with the Soviet Union gone , multilateral disarmament would accelerate .
But with public attention elsewhere , the Dr Strangeloves in Washington , Moscow and Paris stopped the disarmament process and invented new ideas requiring new nuclear weapons .
A decade ago , Clinton 's Pentagon placed " non-state actors " ( ie terrorists ) on the list of likely targets for US nuclear weapons .
Now all the established nuclear states are building new nuclear weapons .
The Bush administration made things worse .
First , it rejected the policy of controlling armaments through treaties , which had been followed by previous presidents since 1918 .
Second , it proposed to use military - even nuclear - force in a pre-emptive attack to prevent proliferation .
This policy was used as a pretext for attacking Iraq and may now be used on either Iran or North Korea .
More pre-emptive war will produce suffering and chaos , while nothing is done about India , Israel and Pakistan .
So we are left with a policy of vigilante bravado for which we have sacrificed the proven methods of weapons control .
Fortunately , there is a realistic option .
Max Kampelman , Ronald Reagan 's nuclear negotiator , has proposed that Washington 's top priority should be the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction on earth , including those possessed by the US .
At the ongoing disarmament meetings at the UN , the vast majority of nations argue for a phased process to achieve this goal .
They can point to the success of the UN inspectors in Iraq as proof that international inspection can work , even in the toughest cases .
The Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty that removed the missiles from Greenham is an example of an agreement no one thought possible that worked completely .
This , and other legacies from the cold war , can and should be applied globally .
A group of Britain 's closest allies , including South Africa and Ireland , are trying to broker a deal on global disarmament .
Tragically , Britain wo n't be helping .
Political parties and the media are deaf to these initiatives .
The three main parties all follow more or less the US approach .
They know that no US government will lease the UK a successor to Trident if London steps out of line on nuclear weapons policy .
The media almost never report on UN disarmament debates .
Disarmament has become the word that dare not be said in polite society .
Do we have to wait for another pre-emptive war or until the Japanese go nuclear before the British political class comes to realise that there can be a soft landing from these nuclear crises ?

Iraqi authorities are preparing an arrest warrant for the country 's former defence minister in connection with a massive fraud case involving the " disappearance " of more than $ 1bn from ministry coffers .
Judge Raid al - Radhi , who is head of Iraq 's commission on public integrity , said yesterday that he had given Iraq 's central criminal court a dossier of evidence against Hazim Shaalan , who was minister of defence under the former government of Ayed Allawi .
" What Shaalan and his ministry were responsible for is possibly the largest robbery in the world .
Our estimates begin at $ 1.3 bn [ £ 720 m ] and go up to $ 2.3bn , " Judge Radhi , who is Iraq 's senior anti-corruption official , told Reuters .
The " robbery " is believed to include the signing of multimillion - dollar deals with companies to supply equipment that was sometimes inappropriate for the new army or was years out of date .
It is also alleged that the ministry paid huge premiums for some military hardware .
Judge Radhi said he expected the court to issue warrants over the next week to 10 days for Mr Shaalan and for other senior defence ministry officials .
The judge said he had passed the file of evidence on the case to Iraqi authorities two months ago .
Mr Shaalan , who is understood to be living in Jordan , has denied complicity in the scandal , saying that his actions as defence minister were ultimately the responsibility of the US authorities in Iraq .
News of the warrant came after the Iraqi finance minister , Ali Allawi , claimed in an interview with the Independent newspaper that $ 1bn had been stolen from the defence ministry .
Mr Allawi said the rampant corruption and fraud at the defence ministry had left the new Iraqi army with second - rate weapons with which to confront the insurgency .
" Huge amounts of money have disappeared .
In return we got nothing but scraps of metal , " Mr Allawi said .
Ayed Allawi's government was in power from the end of June 2004 until late February this year .
The new Prime Minister Ibrahim al - Jaafari has repeatedly complained about the legacy of administrative and financial corruption .
Judge Radhi said there was also evidence against the transport , trade , interior , public works and labour ministries , and that up to 50 officials could be brought to justice .
Allegations of corruption at the defence ministry have been swirling around Baghdad for some time , but the scale of the fraud has shocked many .
A defence ministry source , who requested anonymity , told The Guardian yesterday that hundreds of millions of dollars had been wasted on unnecessary and overpriced equipment for Iraq 's military .
" There appears to be no oversights and accountability in the procurement , " he said .
Investigators have been investigating weapons and equipment deals struck by the former procurement officer Ziad Cattan and other officials .
The source said the most egregious case involved a $ 236 m contract last December to equip the Iraqi army with helicopters and other material .
" The money was paid upfront to a Polish company before we 'd even seen what we were buying .
It was very fishy , " he said .
" The helicopters turned out to be years old and not up to the job we required them to do in Iraq . "
Another contract for US machine guns , at a cost of $ 3,500 each , bought Egyptian copies worth $ 200 .
Judge Radhi said the ministry is alleged to have illegally signed contracts with intermediaries , rather than with foreign companies and governments , for the supply of defence equipment .
In other developments yesterday , the central Iraqi criminal court announced it had given a life sentence to a nephew of the former dictator Saddam Hussein , who was found guilty of funding the insurgency and bomb - making .
Ayman Sabawi , the son of Saddam 's half - brother Sabawi Ibrahim al - Hassan , was arrested by Iraqi forces during a raid in May .
His father , Al - Hassan , who served as a presidential adviser before the US - led invasion , was captured there two months earlier .
It was the first court decision against a family member of the former Iraqi ruler .
The trial of Saddam is due to start on October 19 .
Iraqi authorities had not announced that Sabawi 's trial was under way but said he would face a second trial at the beginning of November for other , unspecified crimes to which he allegedly confessed during interrogation .
A government statement said the UN had indicated the Sabawi family stole " millions of dollars from the Iraqi people " under his uncle 's rule .
Meanwhile , in the relatively calm southern city of Basra , journalist Fakher Haider was found shot dead yesterday morning after being abducted from his house by four masked men claiming to be intelligence officers .
Mr Haider worked in Basra as a stringer for the New York Times and occasionally for The Guardian .
He was the second journalist to be killed in Basra in recent months .
The US journalist Steven Vincent and his Iraqi translator was kidnapped and shot by an unknown gang in early August .

Submitted by Teephphah at 2005-02-02 14:27:47 ESTRating : 1.9 on 88 ratings ( 88 reviews ) ( Review this item ) ( V There was a guy who worked here , Paul was his name .
He worked just down the hall from me .
He was a pretty quiet guy .
Did n’t talk much to most people .
When I passed him in the hallway , or happened to be coming in a door that he was going out , I was always met with the same remark .
“ Hey , there he is . ”
Paul would say .
Every day this happened at some point , and always the same phrase .
At first I was mildly impressed with this little quasi-acknowledgement .
Not only did it remind me a bit of Austin Powers , International Man of Mystery ( “ There you are ! ” “ Do I know you ? ” “ No , but that ’s where you are , you ’re THERE !
Yeah ! ” ) but it was also an expression I had n’t really ever heard anyone else ever use .
But really , that was the only thing Paul ever said to me .
Maybe that was because I was a “ new guy , ” I did n’t have the decades of experience he did working here .
I ’d hear him come to talk to the lady in the office next to me at least once a week , though .
I ’d hear them discuss whatever book Paul was reading , or whatever movies he had rented that weekend .
He never seemed to quite “ get ” the humor in a movie like Napoleon Dynamite , or Dodge ball , but nevertheless , he was a dedicated video renter .
So I got to listen to him tell the lady in the office next to mine about all the movies he did n’t quite get .
His taste in books seemed favor the historical .
Right now , nothing he ever mentioned reading is tripping any mental triggers for me , so I ca n’t provide any character details there .
But from what I can tell , he ’d read the new best sellers , the DaVinci Codes , or whatever came out , but he would always end up comparing them to the real history he preferred .
Paul was a life - long bachelor .
At first I thought that this screamed “ ghey , ghey , GHEY ! ” but as time went on , and I heard him talk about the actresses in whichever he had watched the preceding weekend , I began to doubt that instinct a little .
I suppose I ’ll never have the chance to get to the bottom of that little mystery .
Paul died sometime between last Friday and yesterday .
He did n’t come in to work on Monday , and he did n’t call in to say that he was sick .
When he did n’t come in to work on Tuesday either , his boss asked one of Paul ’s co-workers to go to his apartment and check in on him .
Joe , the co-worker , went to Paul ’s apartment and got the Super to let him in .
They found Paul facedown in the toilet .
We found out today that Paul had had an Aortic Aneurysm .
Men over the age of 50 who have EVER smoked at all should be checked for them .
Once they rupture , most people do n’t make it to the emergency room .
So , I ’m sitting here , thinking about Paul , thinking about “ there he is ” and history books .
Thinking about how it must have felt to have a major artery rupture behind your stomach , and what ?
Think you had to suddenly puke or something ?
I do n’t know .
What would it have been like to kneel there before the stool as the lights went out ?
Did he know what was coming ?
Did his life flash before his eyes ?
Did he regret the life he had lived ?
Did he spend all of his 63 years waiting for his life to begin ?
Or , was he happy with the life he had crafted for himself ?
Was it exactly what he had always wanted ?
I do n’t know .
And no one around here does .
It turns out that Paul really had no friends , and no family nearby .
He had one sister somewhere back East .
He had n’t spoken to her in ten years .
I spoke with the lady in the office next to me about it today .
I chose not to yesterday because she seemed really broken up about the whole thing .
She said that it was really sad to her , because Paul was set to retire in about three months .
She said that it was the first thing she had ever heard him really excited about .
But she also confessed that she thought part of the reason she was taking this so hard , was because there was no one else to do it .
There was no one else to grieve for Paul .
Paul was an invisible man .
A ghost .
It is almost like he never existed at all .
And that scares the shit out of me .
Not the ghosts thing , but just concept of a life so . . . wasted .
I know , maybe Paul did n’t feel that way .
Maybe he really did always want to die alone .
I ca n’t say , and I ca n’t judge if he did , but I ca n’t fathom anyone wanting that .
So , I ’m not going to let him go silently into that goodnight without some sort of tribute , some sort of recognition .
Well , here you go Paul .
This is for you .
It is n’t much , but at least it is something .
I ’m sorry we did n’t have the chance to talk more .
I ’m sorry I did n’t make more of an effort .
I ’m sorry you had to go before you got the chance to retire , but I hope that all your dreams were n’t pinned on that potential future day .
I hope you had some happiness while you were here .
I hope you enjoyed the ride while you were on it .
Suisun City parents Benjamin and Tanya Marshall are part of a new homeschooling movement led by African American families fed up with the public school system .
Nine years ago , the couple put their oldest son , Trevaughn , in kindergarten after discussing teaching him at home .
When he had a substitute teacher several times in his first six weeks , they pulled him out .
" We felt like it was n't the right environment , especially for an African American boy , " said Tanya Marshall , 36 .
" The teachers were young and nervous .
Black males were not being challenged and ending up in special ed . "
Trevaughn , now 14 , has been taught at home ever since .
The couple also homeschools their two younger sons , 11 and 9 , and their daughter , 12 .
" We wanted to be the main and driving influence in our children 's lives , " said Benjamin Marshall , 37 .
" We did n't want them socialized with marijuana smokers and pregnant teens . "
The Marshalls , who had both worked as teachers ' aides , feared public school would contradict their Christian beliefs , and they wanted to avoid having their sons labeled as violent or hyperactive or seeing them pressured by peers to drink , do drugs and have sex .
A desire for more rigorous academics and greater emphasis on black history also has led black families into homeschooling , educators say .
Although homeschoolers often are stereotyped as white and evangelical Christians , in 2003 about 9 percent of homeschooled students were black , and 77 percent were white , compared with a total student population nationwide that was 16 percent black and 62 percent white .
Homeschoolers numbered 1.1 million in 2003 , compared with about 49.5 million students in public and private schools , according to the most recent federal statistics from the U.S. Department of Education .
The numbers of black and white homeschoolers rose about a third from 1999 to 2003 to encompass about 1.3 percent of U.S. black students and 2.7 percent of whites .
Researchers say the number of black parents who are homeschooling their children may now be growing even faster .
More than half the students who are homeschooled come from families with three or more children , and more than one - quarter from families making less than $ 25,000 in 2003 , when the nation 's median family income was $ 56,500 .
More than half of homeschooled students came from families making between $ 25,000 and $ 75,000 .
Among black , white and Latino students , Latinos are least likely to be homeschooled , at less than 1 percent in 2003 ; no other ethnic groups are measured .
The growth among African Americans can be seen in the increasing number of networking groups , blogs and Internet sites directed at black homeschoolers -- and in who is showing up at conventions .
" There was a time when the conferences were all white , " said Brian Ray , president of the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem , Ore .
" In the '90s , you saw a little more color , and by 2000 , a substantial number of black families started showing up .
" In some cities , the majority of those attending conferences are African American . "
Many say they left public schools because their children were n't expected to learn at an equal pace or being coached on getting into college , the schools were unsafe , or the curriculum lacked black history .
" Over the last couple of years , especially in places like D.C. and Cincinnati , there have been a growing number of black homeschooled students , " said Michael Apple , a professor at the University of Wisconsin who studies the issue .
" You will find more in areas where the black middle class can afford to do it . "
Monica Utsey of Washington , D.C. , said she decided to homeschool so she had as much say as possible in 6 - year - old son Zion 's life .
" I did n't want him put on the road to obesity , with junk food , or to be obsessed with commercialized clothing , " Utsey said .
" I also do n't want my son to think that slavery was our only contribution .
I want to give him a world view , a cultural perspective , and assure he understands his place and his heritage . "
Many black homeschoolers worry that their children will be labeled in a public school .
Black public school students are three times as likely as white students to be categorized as needing special education services , a 2002 study by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University found .
" My son is high - energy , and I did n't want him to end up on Ritalin or feel bad about himself , " Utsey said .
" There is an assumption that black boys are violent if they are too energetic . "
Public schools have been a focus of the civil rights struggle , but many homeschooling parents said they are disillusioned with the system 's failure to improve .
" Some educators and families think that because blacks fought so hard to get equal access , we should n't abandon it , " said Jennifer James , a North Carolina mother who in 2003 started the National African - American Homeschoolers Alliance , a 3,000 - member , nonreligious group that provides information for homeschoolers .
" But times have changed .
It was a great step , but we have to think about our kids . "
Parents say the most common concern about homeschooling -- that their kids will be socially isolated -- is n't a problem .
" My children know how to socialize , especially with adults , " Benjamin Marshall said .
" In the real world , my children are not always going to be surrounded by people their own age . "
The Marshalls not only teach their children math , religion and vocabulary , but also take them on field trips to places like the Lawrence Hall of Science , the state Capitol , the San Francisco Symphony and the Museum of the African Diaspora .
" It is kind of rough in the beginning , but as time goes on , you learn , " said Benjamin Marshall , who works as a dispatcher on the graveyard shift at the Valero refinery in Benicia and teaches his kids during the day .
The Marshalls also have started Seeds of Truth Academy in Suisun City , where parents interested in Christian - based homeschooling can bring their children on Tuesdays and Thursdays for counseling , sports and field trips .
Brianna Marshall , 12 , said she likes homeschooling but thinks about other options .
" I think homeschooling is better than public school because there are no bullies and you do n't have to listen to all the stuff your friends say , " she said .
" But I am curious about what school is like .
I have never been inside a school , and sometimes I get tired of being at home . "

Jackass of the Week : Rob Glaser
I ’m never quite sure what to make of Rob Glaser , CEO of Real Networks .
As his company ’s digital media technologies fall further behind Apple ’s and Microsoft ’s ( at least in terms of popularity ) , he frequently pipes up in the press with ridiculous statements about Apple and its products — statements so patently false that I ’m always left with the impression that he ’s either a moron or a liar .
( My money is on liar . )
I ’m willing to cut him some slack because it ’s his job as CEO to be an advocate for his company and its shareholders .
I certainly do n’t expect him to stand up and admit that Apple has them licked .
But that ’s no justification for just making shit up .
Which brings us to this interview with Glaser in The Guardian , by Kate Bulkley .
A few choice snippets :
TG : One could look at Real and say you are becoming the Sun Microsystems of players , i.e. you do n’t have the critical mass to make sure you get the right content and the right number of users .
RG : I think that is mathematically not true .
I do n’t think it is going to be a winner - takes - all game .
I think we ’ll have good share and Microsoft will have good share , and there may be one or two others .
I think particularly as we move into a time where consumers want content to work on multiple platforms , the strong early position we have built on the mobile media market will help us on the PC as well .
I wonder who might be included in those “ one or two others ” ?
Hmm …
Glaser has a habit of positioning Microsoft as Real ’s only worthy rival .
But one thing that these journalists and interviewers never seem to mention is that Glaser spent 10 years at Microsoft , working his way up to a position as “ vice president for multimedia systems ” , according to this 1997 profile in Wired .
Not to mention that Real signed a bunch of vaguely - defined “ partnerships ” with Microsoft this past October .
TG : Apple has 65 % of music downloads in Europe according to Jupiter Research .
How can you compete ?
Rob :
We assume that this failure of other companies besides Apple to create really compelling portable devices is not a long - term phenomenon .
[ But ] before that happens it would be jumping the gun to push a portable subscription service in Europe .
Translation : “ We ’re fucked , because there are n’t any cool gadgets that play our DRM - protected audio formats . ”
TG : Because you ca n’t compete with Apple ’s iTunes ?
RG :
We can compete but is n’t it better to wait until you have a slam dunk solution in the portable context ?
Just keep waiting .
The longer Real waits , the more iPods Apple sells , and , uh , somehow that ’ll make it easier to succeed at some unspecified point in the future .
TG : So you will be facing a situation where you are way behind Apple ?
RG : Compare our strategy to Napster ’s where they got into Europe in some markets before Apple but I do n’t think with a service that was compelling .
Apple is using the iPod as a pull for track sales and for Mac sales , and since the track purchase business is not a primary business for us our attitude is , let ’s focus on our core business and build up from there .
And Real ’s core business is what ?
“ Waiting ” ?
TG : But Apple ’s model is to make money on the sale of devices , using music to drive that — and it is working .
RB : Apple has gotten away with this approach to a greater degree than we thought they would .
The music industry has made a mistake , not by agreeing to Apple ’s fixed - price level ( 79 p per track ) , which is what gets all the attention , but by allowing Apple to create devices that are not interoperable .
And the music industry could have stopped this how ?
No , really : how ?
By , what ?
Not allowing their music to be sold through the ITMS in FairPlay - protected format ?
That would have slowed iPod sales how ?
iPod sales are driving people to use the ITMS , not the other way around — and Glaser himself admits this just two paragraphs earlier .
The music industry has had no role in the success of the iPod .
And , they ( that is , the music industry ) already sell music in a popular interoperable format : the compact disc .
This is not rocket science .
( Glaser , continued ) :
If you want interoperable music today , there is a very easy solution : it ’s called stealing .
Looks like someone still reads the “ iPod Talking Points ” memos from Redmond .
( Glaser , continued ) :
The average number of songs sold for the iPod is 25 , and there are many more songs on iPods than 25 .
About half the music on iPods is music obtained illegitimately either from an illegal peer - to - peer networks or from ripping friends ’
CDs , which is illegal .
But it ’s the only way to get non-copy protected , portable , interoperable music .
And these so - called “ friends ” are probably shoplifting their CDs , right ?
1
As for peer - to - peer networks being the “ only way ” to get non-copy - protected music , that ’s just patently false .
There are plenty of online music stores that are completely interoperable with all portable players — because they do n’t inflict their customers with DRM .
E.g. emusic.com , where the downloads are in plain - jane MP3 format .
These stores may not have music from most mainstream recording acts , but that ’s because the major record labels refuse to sell downloadable music in non-copy - protected formats .
I ’m intrigued by Glaser ’s strategy of accusing millions of prospective customers of being dishonest thieves .
I ’ll bet it ’ll work out just as well as Real ’s “ let ’s wait another couple of years ” portable player strategy .
Reviews Waking Up from the American Dream : A Review of Sprawl Kills Joel Hirschhorn spreads the word about the dangers of sprawl and encourages people to demand healthy places to live .
By Ryan McGreal
Published September 15 , 2005
I do n't like to exercise .
I never have .
There was one summer when I managed to jog every day ( and actually sort of enjoyed it ) , but that was fifteen years ago .
Fitness centre business models depend on people who share my attitude toward exercise .
Drive on down to the gym , pay your three - month membership up front , and make a solemn vow never to return .
If exercising was the only way I ever got exercise , I would be 400 pounds right now .
Fortunately , I live in a dense , hundred - year - old neighbourhood adjacent to downtown Hamilton .
Walking five minutes in one direction takes me to a network of woodland trails ; five minutes in the other takes me to a business district with an organic grocer , a bakery , a deli , a neighbourhood library branch , and a number of galleries and antique dealers .
I walk ( or bicycle ) to work , local stores , the park , and my son 's school to pick him up .
It 's not exercise - it 's transportation , and that makes all the difference .
My daily commute ( five minutes each way by bicycle , or twenty minutes on foot ) compares favourably with most automotive commutes .
It 's also more convenient and vastly less expensive than driving .
I 've even mastered the art of reading while walking .
It probably looks dorky , but this form of multitasking is less stressful and dangerous than talking on a cellphone while driving , and less absurd than watching TV while riding a stationary bike .
In his new book Sprawl Kills : How Blandburbs Steal Your Time , Health , and Money ( Sterling & Ross , 2005 ) , author Joel S. Hirschhorn dispenses with moralistic entreaties to consumers to sacrifice for the common good .
Instead , he calls on consumers to demand better homes and neighbourhoods for their own good .
( See also : Land Gluttony , by Joel Hirschhorn , in the August 22 issue of RTH . )
Hirschhorn draws a sharp distinction between exercise and what he calls " active living " .
Exercise - movement for movement 's sake - consumes precious time , requires ongoing will - power , and must often be performed in unfriendly environments : fitness centres , basement workout rooms , or the gravel shoulders of streets with no sidewalks .
Most North Americans can't or wo n't exercise , despite the steady warnings of surgeons - general that lack of regular activity invites obesity , high blood pressure , heart disease , diabetes , and cancer .
Active living , by contrast , does not need to be squeezed in between work , commutes , and other activities .
Instead , it serves as the very connective tissue that holds busy lives together : walking to work ( or to a nearby train station ) , walking to the store , cycling to a meeting or appointment , hiking with family and friends through an urban forest , playing in the park .
Hirschhorn documents all the ways that the physical environment of sprawl developments - low - density houses in car - dependent subdivisions , separated from stores and offices and connected by highways - directly affects residents ' quality of life , from poorer health to wasted time , much higher transportation and health care expenses , social isolation and impaired development , even premature death .
How does sprawl kill thee ?
Hirschhorn counts the ways .
He digs deeply into the complex interplay between sprawl land use and poor health , peeling back layer after layer of risk factors and noting the myriad collisions between them :
Long hours spent sitting in cars , the risk of car accidents , stress , traffic gridlock , and road rage ;
Time pressures and chronic stress ; declining social participation , loneliness , depression and mental illness ;
Higher consumption of unhealthy " fast food " due to lack of time to cook ;
Overconsumption of starchy , fatty " comfort foods " to treat stress and loneliness ;
Air pollution , leading to asthma , emphysema , and lung cancer ;
Noise pollution from traffic ;
Large , bureaucratic , alienating ' warehouse ' schools with lower academic performance and higher rates of violence ;
Missed childhood opportunities to walk , run , play outside , and get to know neighbours ;
Unhealthy addictions to TV , video games , and shopping ;
Abuse of both prescription and non-prescription drugs ; and
Exhaustion from lack of sleep .
His conclusion : sprawl kills , literally , by forcing its residents into dangerous lifestyle and transportation arrangements , whereas " healthy places " encourage and support the activities people need to enjoy rich , full lives - free time , social contacts , self - powered transportation , healthy environments , and community engagement .
Unfortunately , as Hirschhorn notes , a huge and influential industry has been built around perpetuating sprawl development , and it uses every propaganda and lobbying resource at its disposal to ensure that zoning regulations , public infrastructure funding , and advertising continue to push sprawl at the expense of healthy places .
Hirschhorn calls its agents " sprawl shills " , and he 's not afraid to name names or identify tactics .
After years working as an advisor to the U.S. National Governors ' Association , he has seen their efforts up close , and wants everyone to know what happens in back rooms to manipulate the so - called ' free market ' for homebuilding .
People deserve real choice in where to live , but the complex system of highway subsidies , zoning restrictions , unfair tax codes , and underinvestment in transit means that developers make the most money from buying cheap rural land and building large , flimsy houses far from all amenities .
As Hirschhorn demonstrates amply , that building pattern is deadly .
My one big complaint about Sprawl Kills is the absence of proper references .
In some cases , Hirschhorn refers to reports by name , but in many other cases , he simply claims " a study showed ... " or " researchers found ... " without citing his sources .
He does provide a bibliography and a long list of web links , but I would have liked to look more deeply into some of his facts and figures .
I strongly encourage Hirschhorn and the book 's publisher , Sterling & Ross , to include this in the next edition of the book .

ON A HOT JULY DAY AT A FOOD PACKAGING COMPANY in Vernon Hills , Illinois , Henrik Gustavsson sat at his workstation tweaking electrical drawings for an industrial juice - making machine .
He looked up and noticed an odd haze at the far end of the office .
A coworker shouted , " Hey , there 's a fire ! "
Gustavsson rushed over to join the crowd gathering around a Dell Latitude laptop sitting on a desk in its docking station .
" There was smoke coming out of the sides , " the 26 - year - old engineer recalls .
" As I got close it actually started popping , and a flame shot straight up into the air . "
To Gustavsson , the closed , burning laptop looked like an overheated George Foreman grill .
It smelled horrible – not surprising , since it was cooking up an LCD - keyboard - melt sandwich .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Gustavsson snapped some photos as colleagues sprayed the burning Dell with foam from a fire extinguisher .
" That thing did not want to go out , " he says .
" We had to zap it three or four times . "
They then carefully carried the laptop out to the front sidewalk and waited for the fire department to arrive .
When nobody was looking , Gustavsson pried the smoldering , melted carcass open to find a 5 ‑inch hole where the lithium - ion battery had been .
" It was pretty awesome , " he says .
That night , he posted his pictures to the nerdy Web site Tom 's Hardware .
The images received more than 80,000 hits over the next week .
It was a long , hot summer for lithium - ion batteries this year .
Stories of Dell laptops spontaneously combusting dominated tech news .
One computer set fire to a Ford pickup in Nevada ; another ignited in the overhead compartment of a Lufthansa flight as it sat on the tarmac at Chicago 's O'Hare airport .
A video of a Dell that exploded spectacularly during a business meeting in Osaka began making the rounds on the Internet .
In mid-August , the US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced that Dell had agreed to recall 4.1 million Li-ion batteries – the largest battery recall in history .
Nine days later , Apple asked its users to return 1.8 million more Li-ion packs .
Then , in September , Toshiba recalled 340,000 batteries .
Sony , which manufactured the batteries for all three companies , will spend an estimated $ 250 million replacing them .
The technical term for these bizarre incidents is thermal runaway .
It occurs when the touchy elements inside a Li-ion battery heat up to the point where the internal reaction accelerates , creating even more heat .
A sort of mini China Syndrome of increasing temperature builds until something must give .
In the case of a laptop flameout , the chemicals break out of their metal casing .
Because lithium ignites when it makes contact with the moisture in the air , the battery bursts into flame .
Exploding notebook computers are , of course , extremely rare .
There are just a handful of documented cases , even though an estimated 1.8 billion Li-ion cells are in circulation .
Sony claims the latest conflagrations were caused in part by trace amounts of metal accidentally left inside the batteries during the manufacturing process .
The company adds that problems are also caused by laptop makers placing batteries too close to internal heat sources like CPU chips .
But such technical excuses sidestep the fact that flammability and heat intolerance are long - standing problems that have plagued Li-ion batteries since they were invented almost 30 years ago .
And as devices have gotten smaller in size but richer in features , things have only worsened .
Forced to produce more energy in less space , Li-ions die faster ( as early iPod owners found when their batteries wore out long before their players did ) , and their propensity for thermal runaway greatly increases .
Lithium -ion technology may be approaching its limits .
Batteries conform to technical restrictions set by nature and do n't obey Moore 's law like most of the digital world .
In the last 150 years , battery performance has improved only about eightfold ( or less , depending how it 's measured ) .
The speed and capacity of silicon chips , of course , improves that much every six years .
" Li-ion is an extremely mature technology , and all of the problems are known by everybody , " says Art Ramirez , the chief of device physics at Bell Labs .
" They are n't going to change . "
If Li-ion technology is at , or even near , its maximum potential , gadget makers ( and users ) are in trouble .
Li-ion – with its high power , fast recharge times , and steady voltage – is the best battery the consumer electronics industry has .
It powered the 50 million laptops , 800 million cell phones , and 80 million digital cameras sold in 2005 .
If the technology stagnates without a viable replacement , so will every kind of portable device , from ThinkPads to Game Boys .
So the hunt is on for a better battery .
And it 's just not the usual Asian giants – Sanyo , Sony , Toshiba – on the prowl .
Tyco , Lucent , Intel , and venture capital firms like Draper Fisher Jurvetson are among those pumping millions of R&D dollars into battery startups and research labs .
Of course , kicking the lithium habit wo n't be easy .
Possible successors like fuel cells have been heralded for decades , but design , implementation , and cost issues have prevented them from reaching our Nokias and MacBooks .
Yet , to get the juice they need , gadgets will almost certainly require something totally new .
We 'll need more than just better batteries ; we 'll need to rethink the way all portable electronics are designed and made .
IN THE MID - 1800S , French inventor Raymond Gaston Planté created the first rechargeable battery , a combination of sulfuric acid and strips of lead foil .
People thought of Planté 's creation as a " box of electricity " or an electric fuel tank .
It 's an analogy we make to this day :
The scientific symbol for a battery is still a fuel - tank - like box .
But the metaphor is not apt .
You do n't fill a battery with electrons that are sucked out later , only to be replaced ( " Fill 'er up . " ) with more electrons .
A battery is more like a complicated and finicky chemical pump that exploits what happens when certain materials ( mostly metals ) are placed together in an electrolyte solution .
All batteries – watch , flashlight , cell phone , car – work basically the same way .
Negatively charged electrons are chemically stolen from a metal anode and flow rather desperately toward a positively charged metal cathode at the other end of the circuit .
Voltage is a measure of the force pushing the electrons from pole to pole , while current is the number of electrons speeding by a given point .
Together these attributes establish the power of a battery .
Current can be altered by changing a battery 's size , but voltage is determined ( and fixed ) by the atomic makeup of the materials used .
Those attributes , recorded in the good old periodic table of elements , were configured shortly after the big bang and are not subject to clever human modifications .
In " Building a Better Battery " ( issue 14.11 ) , a Rayovac flashlight battery was pictured above text about computer batteries bursting into flames .
The layout was not intended to suggest that Rayovac batteries have caused computers to explode or that they are defective in any way .
We regret any inference created by the photo .
The first widely produced batteries were lead acid .
Used in early cars , they got the automobile to start as reliably as the horse .
By the 1960s , engineers had developed lighter , single - use alkaline and mercury batteries , making portable transistor radios and two - way communication devices possible .
In the 1980s , compact rechargeable batteries were developed using nickel and cadmium .
Originally used by the military and NASA , NiCads eventually reached the consumer market , giving us video cameras , the first laptops , and cordless power tools .
The power cells were reliable but suffered from an annoying glitch dubbed the memory effect :
If users did n't fully charge the batteries on initial use , the cells could " remember " only their original partial charge .
This was fixed by the development of nickel metal hydride .
NiMH packed more power , had less memory effect than NiCads , and recharged faster .
Scientists long knew that lithium would make an excellent anode .
Most battery chemical combinations deliver 1.2 to 2 volts .
But when paired with the right cathode , lithium atoms practically spew electrons , delivering the highest nominal voltage of any element in the periodic table : 3.6 volts per cell .
( Multiple low - voltage cells can be strung together to achieve the same punch – that 's how you get 9 - volt batteries – but this adds weight and bulk . )
Lithium tends to explode on contact with air , however , which made research difficult .
In the 1970s , a US scientist with the ironic name John Goodenough ( batteries never are ) finally figured out how to tap the electron potential of lithium : Combine it with cobalt .
Then all it took was a manufacturer willing to spend the money required to safely mass - produce the new batteries .
Sony grabbed the opportunity in the ' 80s , producing a rechargeable lithium - ion pack for a video camera .
These batteries were the first rechargeable cells to exceed the energy of single - use alkalines .
They had no memory effect , four times the energy of NiCads , and twice the energy of nickel - metal - hydride cells .
A new era had begun .
Throughout the '90s , Li-ions enabled a host of advances .
Laptops could be made lighter and were able to power backlit screens and bigger hard drives .
Cell phones could be smaller .
The MP3 player was born .
But these new devices hungered for more and more power .
While a flashlight or a car starter places simple demands on a battery , powering a computer or camcorder is much more complicated .
These devices contain dozens or even hundreds of individual components , and LCD screens have different voltage and current needs than , say , hard drives or Wi -Fi chips .
So voltages are stepped up or down using transformers and other circuits , resulting in enormous losses in efficiency .
The more complex a device , the harder the battery has to work .
Furthermore , because digital calculations require steady voltages to maintain memory , power fluctuations can be disastrous .
So modern batteries are designed to operate in a narrow range where they can deliver constant output .
To keep voltage steady and at effective levels , a battery must be packed with lots of extra power .
There 's really no such thing as a dead battery anymore ; even when a cell registers empty , it still has plenty of juice in it – just none in the usable range .
Battery - industry veteran Mike Mahan puts it this way : " It 's like you have a 20 - gallon tank and you can use only 5 gallons , but you still have to drive around with 15 gallons anyway . "
Squeezing enough power into compact Li-ion cells to deal with these issues requires serious safety equipment .
Today , most Li-ion cells contain at least two – and sometimes three – separate countermeasures to keep the reaction from getting out of control .
According to Glen Wensley , chief polymer chemist at batterymaker Solicore , these safeguards can represent as much as 30 percent of the engineering and perhaps half the cost of a standard lithium - ion battery .
" It 's an extremely unstable system , and so you need a voltage limiter , a current fuse , and a third safety system , which is actually internal to the battery .
It 's called a separator , which physically separates the battery to prevent thermal runaway . "
The first two systems keep the battery from overcharging or over - discharging .
The third is a kill switch :
All batteries have a porous separator between the anode and cathode to keep the reaction from happening too quickly .
In most Li-ion cells this component completely solidifies if it gets too hot .
It 's a kind of electrical suicide that destroys the battery to cool it down .
These defenses are one reason that thermal runaway is extremely rare .
FLAMING LAPTOPS may be dramatic , but to Sony they are mostly a PR headache .
The company 's main concern is still squeezing more power out of smaller Li-ion battery packs .
Case in point : the company 's ultraslim family of digital cameras .
Product designers managed to cram an advanced imaging sensor , processor , and LCD into a 0.9 - inch - thick shell .
And the battery ?
" One of the most difficult things about that camera was the damn battery , " says Mike Kahn , a senior product manager at Sony .
" It had to be thin , and it had to be powerful . "
Eventually , Sony solved the problem by giving the battery its own chip .
" The battery constantly talks with the processor to minimize power use and avoid waste , " Kahn says .
Sony sees its success with cameras as a sign that lithium - ion technology still has more than a little life left in it .
Last year , Sony unveiled the Nexelion , a so - called lithium hybrid that pairs lithium with tin for the first time and claims a 30 percent capacity increase over previous lithium - ion cells .
The batteries were first offered in new Sony Handycams last summer .
Keeping pace , Toshiba also announced a higher - powered Li-ion battery last year .
These improvements , however , wo n't really keep up with consumer demand for more power .
Nowhere is this more apparent than in laptops .
" The industry wants dual - core processors and an eight - hour run time with no increase in size and weight , " says Valence Technology 's Jim Akridge .
" It does n't look like that 's going to happen . "
One way to keep up with power demands is to go back to the periodic table .
Lithium offers the highest voltage of any element , but lower - voltage metals do n't explode and may ultimately be able to hold more power .
Among the companies betting on tamer elements is Zinc Matrix , a startup run by Ross Dueber – a former Air Force major who used to design advanced nickel - cadmium batteries for the military 's Strategic Defense Initiative .
Dueber and his team have come up with a power cell that runs on silver and zinc and uses stable , nontoxic water as an electrolyte .
The company claims it has solved manufacturing difficulties associated with previous silver - zinc efforts and boasts that its cell offers a 50 percent increase in run time over lithium ion , with none of the safety issues .
But because silver - zinc has a lower voltage , these batteries must pack lots of cells together to achieve the industry standard of 3.6 volts .
This makes the batteries heavy – a serious drawback .
Dueber 's plan for overcoming this is to convince devicemakers to retool their products to run at lower voltages .
" Our first battery will simulate lithium ion , but eventually we hope to be designed into the future , " he says .
In September , Zinc Matrix demonstrated a six - hour prototype for an Intel - based laptop .
If all goes well , Dueber says , that battery could be on the market by the end of next year .
Among those funding the effort are Tyco Electronics and Intel .
Dueber says he has received about $ 36 million to date .
At best , though , Dueber 's battery is only a sort of electrochemical methadone – same addiction , just slightly longer - lasting , with no flameout .
No matter how much the industry toys with a single box of electrons , it will eventually encounter the same predictable roadblocks : too many components demanding too much power for any one battery .
That 's why Solicore decided to think small .
Based in Lakeland , Florida , Solicore is developing Li-ion batteries in ultracompact forms that can sneak into places batteries have never gone before .
This might allow Solicore 's cells to act as secondary batteries in a device .
For example , one could be slipped behind a laptop 's screen , where it would power just the backlight , taking some of the load off the main battery .
To make such versatile Li-ion cells , Solicore has developed a new type of lithium polymer .
Lithium - polymer batteries use an advanced gel rather than a liquid to separate the cell 's positive and negative poles .
Solicore 's proprietary polymer restricts electron flow so it can't be disrupted by heat or even a violent blow from a hammer , which means the batteries wo n't get caught in a thermal runaway cycle .
This lets engineers make batteries without standard safety features , which means they can be made in virtually any shape or thickness .
Some of the early models are as thin as sheets of paper , essentially printed and cut like credit cards .
In fact , they are already being used to power a new breed of smartcards , which come with their own onboard display and may someday even have wireless capability .
Solicore is working with Visa and others to bring the cards to market next year .
STANDING AMONG THE VOLT meters , electrical wiring , and beakers full of various electrolytes in his Bell Labs research facility , physicist Tom Krupenkin holds a partially etched disc of silicon .
Nearly all of its surface is empty .
In one corner , there 's a micron - scale pattern of posts that , under a microscope , looks like a hyper - orderly lawn .
It 's called nanograss .
Krupenkin , a Russian - born scientist with PhDs in materials science and in physics , is one of a growing number of researchers who think consumers and gadgetmakers need to take a more radical approach to battery design .
In his eyes , playing around with new chemistry or mysterious polymer goop wo n't deliver the kind of exponential growth the industry needs .
" In the traditional battery world , there is nothing new anymore , " Krupenkin says .
" There has to be a different way to think about these devices , different processes brought to bear . "
Krupenkin thinks he has found such a process – something that will be more than just a quick fix .
Instead of sealing an unstable reaction in a big box , he and his team – a combination of Bell Labs scientists and researchers at a startup called m Phase Technologies – are designing tiny batteries out of nanograss that can be turned on and off chemically .
Such precise control , they argue , would let them take the idea of multiple batteries a step further .
Krupenkin 's vision is that future gadgets would behave like biological systems , in which cells carry their own power instead of relying on a single primary energy source for the whole organism .
Nanograss , Krupenkin explains , is superhydrophobic , or massively water resistant .
Fluids deposited on the tiny silicon posts are practically frictionless .
A droplet of water remains spherical on the nanograss .
But when Krupenkin applies an electric charge between the droplet and the silicon , the droplet disappears .
The current has disrupted the water 's surface tension , causing it to fall into the nanograss , where it 's held firm by the tiny posts .
Krupenkin calls this " electrowetting . "
Apply another tiny current across the conductor and the water molecules heat up , causing the droplet to rise back to the top of the nanograss , where surface tension once again keeps it in a nearly perfect sphere .
The idea is to marshal this electrowetting to fine - tune a battery 's internal reaction – regardless of what the battery is made of .
The nanograss would hold a battery 's electrolyte away from the reactive metal when no power is needed , then release it when it 's time to turn on .
This type of structure would free device manufacturers to distribute fields of tiny batteries deep into their products .
Components could pop on and go to sleep as needed .
Rechargeable nanograss would be controlled by the microprocessor , which would manage exactly how much power each system needs .
And because each component would have its own power bank , the built - in inefficiencies of the single - voltage , single - power design would vanish , driving down costs and potentially increasing battery life by an order of magnitude for the first time in 100 years .
The problem is that product makers would have to retool and redesign almost all their devices to take advantage of these minute , chip - controlled batteries .
It 's a hurdle that Krupenkin and his team know could take years to get over .
But they also know that sooner or later , gadgetmakers will want more than lithium - ion batterymakers can provide .
As Bell Labs ' Ramirez puts it , current battery problems point to the end of the " silicon road map . "
As computers shrink to the molecular level , the whole architecture of portable devices needs to change .
" The end of the silicon road map will show that there have to be other ways of doing things .
At some point , it will become economically viable to invest in radical new strategies , " he says .
Sooner or later , solutions like nanograss are going to look awfully good .
A hundred years ago , just down the road from Krupenkin 's lab in northern New Jersey , Thomas Edison struggled to mass - produce batteries that would be safe and reliable .
Reportedly , he was so stymied by uncooperative chemistry that he once asked a psychic to tell him the best chemistry for a storage battery .
In a prickly comment to a colleague at General Electric in 1900 , he said , " I do n't think nature would be so unkind as to withhold the secret of a good storage battery if a real earnest hunt for it is made .
I 'm going to hunt . "
The hunt is still on .
The things you can do with a little script !
A Wired reporter is telling the story of how a Perl script he wrote led to the arrest of an online sex offender .
The magazine is set to release the script under an open - source license in the near future , so you can refine it and help making MySpace a tougher playground for those flagitious felons .
Wired writer Kevin Poulsen put together about 1,000 lines of Perl code that match data from the National Sex Offender Registry to MySpace user profiles , looking for perpetrators arrogant or witless enough to sign up for a MySpace account under their real names .
Poulsen ran his script , got back at least 2,000 results , and started sifting through the data to sort out the false positives .
Some of the verifiable matches bore the signs of a repeat - offender mentality , like a 33 - year old man convicted for molesting a child under the age of 13 who set his MySpace motto to " Love knows not age . "
The reporter narrowed his list down to one target , Andrew Lubrano of Centereach , NY , with three previous convictions , nine years served behind bars for molesting young boys , and a penchant for calling 16 - year - old boys " sex toy " in public MySpace posts .
Local police , grateful for the tip , let Poulsen sit in on the proceedings of running a sting on Lubrano , and the man was soon under custody although he could only be charged with a misdemeanor of endangering the welfare of a child .
It 's a success story , albeit somewhat muted by the limited result , but it also highlights many of the problems inherent in scripting a search like this .
For one , many offenders likely sign up under assumed names , making them invisible to this sort of script .
Further , it takes a trained human eye to carry out visual matching of photographs in order to ensure a valid match — again assuming that the MySpace photo is the real deal .
Also , the privacy rules that are meant to protect users like our children also serve to protect criminals , making it easier for them to carry out their depraved deeds out of the public eye .
Currently , MySpace says its privacy policies will have to do until we get laws that force sex offenders to place their e-mail accounts in a central registry , making them easier to ban .
But you do n't need to show ID to get a Hotmail account , nor GMail , or Yahoo Mail , or start up your own mail server on a Linux box and use that e-mail to sign up with MySpace .
Poulsen suggests that MySpace would be smart to set up a screen for objectionable traffic through its systems , public or private , to catch offenders in the virtual act of propositioning teenagers or worse .
Looking for people with a shameful past will lead to the occasional hit , sure , but not every sex offender is a repeat customer .
And there 's no point in signing up under false names and temporary e-mail addresses if your actual immoral acts can be tracked .
I 'm all for that , and in the meantime I 'll apply my regex - fu to that Perl script once it 's published , to see if there 's some public good to be done here .
And then , I 'll replace myself with a small shell script .

The Casual Game Revolution
By Carlo Longino
Mobile games are already big business , with 16 million US cellphone users downloading them in August alone , up from 12 million in January .
The vast majority of those are action or sports games , often times repurposed console games or based on movie franchises .
But there 's a growing movement of simpler , smaller , much less flashy games that do n't require long periods of deep gameplay , called casual games , that promise to be even bigger .

Casual games have a few general principles , but the most important is simplicity .
They 're games that are easy to learn , easy to play , and are well - suited to short bursts of gameplay rather than long sessions .
They 're also suited to the physical characteristics of mobile handsets .
Analyst firm NPD Group , which referred to mobile gaming recently as a " digital snack , " says the limited screen size and navigation options of phones make casual games a good fit .
Navigation is something that mobile game developers have struggled with in creating action games and console retreads , but for casual games , it 's not a problem .
Being able to quickly move around the screen is n't as much of a concern in , say , a crossword , as in a first - person shooter .
The key for video game developers and mobile operators is casual games ' wide appeal across demographics ; these are games that appeal to pretty much everybody .
According to M: Metrics , which tracks consumer consumption of mobile content and applications , says in August , about a third of US phone users played a game on their device .
Their data shows that 60 % more people had casual games like puzzles , quizzes or word games installed on their phones than other more involved types of games , while 20 % more people downloaded casual games during the month .

" It 's safe to say that my mother has never been a fan of Quake , but she and I both enjoy crosswords , " says Tom Hume , director of British mobile development company Future Platforms , which is working with the UK's Puzzler Media to create mobile versions of its puzzle catalog .
Hume says casual games ' appeal is down to peoples ' typical interactions with their mobile phones .
He says most of our interactions with our phone are casual : the device is constantly available , and we interact with it in quick bursts — looking to see if anybody 's called , typing out a text message , and so on rather than for extended periods of time .
" Good casual games do n't require lengthy focus of attention : you can dip into and out of them easily , " he says .
One of Future Platforms ' first results of its work with Puzzler was a mobile version of the Japanese number puzzle game Sudoku .
Hume says it 's a great example of the genre , because while it can be learned quickly , the game has a lot of depth , and as players become more experienced , they learn more nuances of the game and get more involved .
It 's like some of the solitaire games that come with Windows — they 're pretty simple to learn , but can quickly become addictive as you better learn how to play .
Business models , or how companies charge , is changing for casual games as well .
Instead of paying a big upfront fee , for instance , Mobile Sudoku just charges users 25 p ( about 45 cents ) per puzzle .
The idea is to keep everything — including the purchasing easy and casual : " Purchasing should n't be a difficult decision , the buying of a puzzle should be as casual as the playing of it , " Hume says .
" We 're trying to encourage people to play regularly and make it a part of their lives , not squeeze them for as much as they are willing to spend today . "

Other companies are getting into the frame as well .
Digital Chocolate is one .
It was started by Trip Hawkins , who also formed Electronic Arts , so you 'd expect it to be creating flashy , involved games pushing the boundaries of what mobile phones can do with graphics and sound .
That could n't be further from the truth , really , as the company 's mobile games are , for the most part , simple affairs built on casual gameplay .
Digital Chocolate 's released a few new games that take the idea of casual gaming one step further , built upon Hawkins ' belief that games are little more than an excuse to be social .
At the recent CTIA trade show , he talked about how when Trivial Pursuit came out , it spawned game - playing parties across the country .
The game was simple enough that anybody could play , and provided a reason for people to get together with their friends .
The company 's new games , which include things like a sports prediction league people can set up with their friends , or a virtual dating game ( Hawkins says one other surefire way to succeed with a game is to give people the potential to hook up ) , are more about interaction than strictly about gameplay — another common thread that runs through all of us , not just video gamers .

We all like to play games to some degree , but generally the idea of a " video game " conjures up the PlayStation 2 rather than a crossword puzzle .
And while a word game might not be the most exciting example of mobile gaming , it 's one with a far bigger potential market than a tiny version of Grand Theft Auto .
And the mass market is what casual games are about , finding the gamer in everybody .
" The other thing to consider is that play is a very natural thing for any mammal , " Hume says .
" We all play , where it 's hopscotch , bingo , scratchcards or CounterStrike .
My cats are casual gamers . "

( CNN ) --
The next time you are deciding between ice cream and cake , buying a car or taking a trip to Europe , accepting a new job or keeping your old one , you should remember two things :
First , your decision is rooted in the desire to become happy -- or at least happier than you are now .
Second , there 's a good chance the decision you make will be wrong .
Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert summed up our failings this way : " People have a lot of bad theories about happiness . "
It 's not for lack of trying .
The Declaration of Independence affirms that we have an inalienable right to pursue happiness , and it 's something we do with a vengeance .
Americans will spend $ 750 million on self - help books this year and more than $ 1 billion on motivational speakers .
More than 100 colleges now offer classes in positive psychology -- the science of happiness .
With all those resources focused on achieving happiness , we should all be brimming with joy .
( Watch paralyzed man describe how he stays so happy -- 2:12 )
So where do we go wrong ?
Gilbert , author of the recent book " Stumbling on Happiness , " blames our culture , our genes and our imagination .
Our culture implores us to buy bigger , newer , better things , but research shows " stuff " does not buy happiness .
By and large , money buys happiness only for those who lack the basic needs .
Once you pass an income of $ 50,000 , more money does n't buy much more happiness , Gilbert said .
Our genes hardwire us to reproduce , but children have a small negative effect on happiness , research shows .
If you 're a parent reading this , you 're most likely shaking your head .
But Gilbert said the findings are clear when parents are asked about their level of happiness in the moment .
" When you follow people throughout their days , as they 're going about their normal activities , people are about as happy interacting with their children , on average , as when they 're doing housework .
They 're much less happy than when they 're exercising , sleeping , grocery shopping , hanging out with friends , " Gilbert said .
" Now , that does n't mean they do n't occasionally create these transcendent moments of joy that we remember as filling our days with happiness . "
Finally , our imaginations fail us , Gilbert said , because when we envision different futures we see either perpetual gloom or happily ever - after scenarios .
In fact , neither unhappiness nor joy last as long as we expect .
As you 've probably guessed , winning the lottery will not guarantee a life of bliss .
By the same token , becoming disabled does not relegate one to a life of unhappiness .
The disabled spend their days about as happy as the general population , according to Gilbert .
So what makes us happy ?
In general , the older you get the happier you get -- until you reach very old age .
According to a Pew Research Center survey , the happiest age group is men 65 and older ; the least happy : men 18 to 29 .
The survey also found :
Married people are happier than singles .
College grads are happier than those without a college degree .
People who were religious are happier than those who are n't .
Sunbelt residents are happier than other U.S. residents .
Republicans are happier than Democrats -- but both are happier than independents .
Nancy Segal , a professor at California State University , Fullerton , has spent her professional career studying twins and happiness .
We all have an innate level of happiness , Segal said .
The best we can do is boost our happiness a little bit above this natural " set point . "
With that in mind , Segal said we should pass on buying lottery tickets and find small things we can do every day that bring us joy , whether it 's going for a walk or cooking a meal or reading a book .
Robert Biswas - Diener is called the Indiana Jones of positive psychology because he has traveled the globe looking at happiness in different cultures .
" There is good evidence that people express at least some fundamental emotions like disgust , anger and happiness in a very similar way all around the world , " Diener said .
Diener , who also is a life coach , says happiness from the most traditional cultures to the most modern depend heavily on close family and other human relationships .
If you want to do a better job predicting how happy something will make you , said Gilbert , the Harvard professor , you need to remember we are not so different when it comes to happiness .
" If I wanted to know what a certain future would feel like to me I would find someone who is already living that future , " he said .
" If I wonder what it 's like to become a lawyer or marry a busy executive or eat at a particular restaurant my best bet is to find people who have actually done these things and see how happy they are .
" What we know from studies is not only will this increase the accuracy of your prediction , but nobody wants to do it , " he said .
" The reason is we believe we 're unique .
We do n't believe other people 's experiences can tell us all that much about our own .
I think this is an illusion of uniqueness . "
And if you 're trying to decide between the new car and the trip to Europe , Gilbert said take the trip .
" Part of us believes the new car is better because it lasts longer .
But , in fact , that 's the worst thing about the new car , " he said .
" It will stay around to disappoint you , whereas a trip to Europe is over .
It evaporates .
It has the good sense to go away , and you are left with nothing but a wonderful memory . "

British scientists have grown the world 's first artificial liver from stem cells in a breakthrough that will one day provide entire organs for transplant .
The technique that created the ' mini - liver ' , currently the size of a one pence piece , will be developed to create a full - size functioning liver .
Described as a ' Eureka moment ' by the Newcastle University researchers , the tissue was created from blood taken from babies ' umbilical cords just a few minutes after birth .
As it stands , the mini organ can be used to test new drugs , preventing disasters such as the recent ' Elephant Man ' drug trial .
Using lab - grown liver tissue would also reduce the number of animal experiments .
Within five years , pieces of artificial tissue could be used to repair livers damaged by injury , disease , alcohol abuse and paracetamol overdose .
And then , in just 15 years ' time , entire liver transplants could take place using organs grown in a lab .
The development provides fresh hope for the hundreds of Britons in dire need of a new liver each year .
There are currently 336 patients waiting for a liver transplant - the type of operation performed on George Best .
However , in 2004 , 72 people died waiting for a suitable donor .
The liver tissue is created from stem cells - blank cells capable of developing into different types of tissue - found in blood from the umbilical cord .
Working in collaboration with experts from the US , the Newcastle scientists succeeded in separating out the stem cells from blood removed from the umbilical cord minutes after birth .
They are then placed in a ' bioreactor ' - a piece of electrical equipment developed by NASA to mimic the effects of weightlessness .
Inside this , the freedom from the force of gravity allows them to multiply more quickly than usual .
Then , various hormones and chemicals are added to coax the stem cells into turning into liver tissue .
So far , tiny pieces of tissue , less than an inch in diameter have been created .
However , in time , it should be possible to create larger and larger pieces of tissue , eventually creating sections capable of being transplanted into sick patients .
The Newcastle scientists believe that within two years the tissue could be used to test new drugs .
Currently , new drugs are tested in the test tube , before being tried out first on animals and then on humans .
However , the procedure is not foolproof , as was made painfully clear by the Northwick Park drugs trial earlier this year in which six healthy young volunteers were left fighting for their lives .
Using lab - grown human tissue could iron out any difficulties before new drugs are given to humans .
Colin McGuckin is professor of regenerative medicine at Newcastle University .
He said : " We take the stem cells from the umbilical cord blood and make small mini-livers .
" We then give them to pharmaceutical companies and they can use them to test new drugs on .
" It could prevent the situation that happened earlier this year when those six patients had a massive reaction to the drugs they were testing . "
Using mini-livers could also cut down on the number of animal experiments .
Within five years , the artificial liver could be used to directly benefit people 's health .
The researchers envisage sections of artificial liver being used to keep patients needing liver transplants alive - in much the same way as a dialysis machine is used to treat kidney failure .
This technique would take advantage of the liver 's remarkable ability to quickly regenerate itself .
The patient would be hooked up to an artificial liver which would take over all the functions usually carried out by their own liver .
With several ' dialysis ' sessions a day over a period of several months , the patient 's own liver would be afforded enough resting time to regenerate and repair any damage .
Alternatively , vital months could be bought in search for a suitable donor for transplant .
It is hoped that within 15 years , it will be possible to create sections of liver suitable for transplant into the body of those whose livers have been damaged beyond repair .
In many cases , this would replace the need for an entire liver transplant .
However , it would then be several more years before whole livers could be created in a lab for transplant .
While other researchers have created liver cells from stem cells from embryos , the Newcastle team are the first to create sizeable sections of tissue from stem cells from the umbilical cord .
They believe their technique is better suited to growing larger sections of tissue .
Use of cord stem cells is also more ethically acceptable than the use of embryonic stem cells - a process that leads to the death of the embryo .
The Newcastle researchers foresee a time when cord blood from millions of babies born each year is banked , creating a worldwide donor register for liver dialysis and transplant .
Computerised registers could then be created to match the cord blood with tissue type or immune system of patients with liver problems .
Already used to treat leukaemia , more than 11,000 British parents have so far chosen frozen their children 's cord blood in a dozen such banks around the UK .
Prof McGuckin said : " One hundred million children are born around the world every year - that is 100 million different tissue types .
" With that number of children being born every year , we should be able to find a tissue for me and you and every other person who does n't have stem cells banked . "
Co-researcher Dr Nico Forraz said : " Our dream is that every metropolitan city would have such a bank .
" If you could type the blood all , you would have to do is dial it up on your computer and fly it from Bristol to Newcastle or even Newcastle to Kuala Lumpur . "
The breakthrough has been welcomed by liver experts .
However , they caution much more work is needed before the research is transferred from the lab to the operating theatre .
Professor Nagy Habib , of London 's Hammersmith Hospital , said : " The stem cell is going to change the way we deliver treatment .
However , it wo n't happen tomorrow . "
Alison Rogers , Chief Executive of the British Liver Trust , said : " Stem cell technology represents a huge leap forward in treating many diseases .
" With liver disease in particular it has the potential for tremendous advances . "
A spokesman for UK Transplant , which runs the country 's organ donor register , said : " There is lots going on in research that may have benefits for transplant patients .
" But , in the here and now , the obvious way to help these people is by more people adding their names to the organ donor register and to make their wishes known to their family . "
APPENDIX E : Introduction to the Scientific Method
The scientific method is the process by which scientists , collectively and over time , endeavor to construct an accurate ( that is , reliable , consistent and non-arbitrary ) representation of the world .
1. Observation and description of a phenomenon or group of phenomena .
2. Formulation of an hypothesis to explain the phenomena .
In physics , the hypothesis often takes the form of a causal mechanism or a mathematical relation .
3 . Use of the hypothesis to predict the existence of other phenomena , or to predict quantitatively the results of new observations .
4. Performance of experimental tests of the predictions by several independent experimenters and properly performed experiments .
If the experiments bear out the hypothesis it may come to be regarded as a theory or law of nature ( more on the concepts of hypothesis , model , theory and law below ) .
If the experiments do not bear out the hypothesis , it must be rejected or modified .
What is key in the description of the scientific method just given is the predictive power ( the ability to get more out of the theory than you put in ; see Barrow , 1991 ) of the hypothesis or theory , as tested by experiment .
It is often said in science that theories can never be proved , only disproved .
There is always the possibility that a new observation or a new experiment will conflict with a long - standing theory .
As just stated , experimental tests may lead either to the confirmation of the hypothesis , or to the ruling out of the hypothesis .
The scientific method requires that an hypothesis be ruled out or modified if its predictions are clearly and repeatedly incompatible with experimental tests .
Further , no matter how elegant a theory is , its predictions must agree with experimental results if we are to believe that it is a valid description of nature .
In physics , as in every experimental science , " experiment is supreme " and experimental verification of hypothetical predictions is absolutely necessary .
Experiments may test the theory directly ( for example , the observation of a new particle ) or may test for consequences derived from the theory using mathematics and logic ( the rate of a radioactive decay process requiring the existence of the new particle ) .
Note that the necessity of experiment also implies that a theory must be testable .
Theories which cannot be tested , because , for instance , they have no observable ramifications ( such as , a particle whose characteristics make it unobservable ) , do not qualify as scientific theories .
If the predictions of a long - standing theory are found to be in disagreement with new experimental results , the theory may be discarded as a description of reality , but it may continue to be applicable within a limited range of measurable parameters .
For example , the laws of classical mechanics ( Newton 's Laws ) are valid only when the velocities of interest are much smaller than the speed of light ( that is , in algebraic form , when v/c << 1 ) .
Since this is the domain of a large portion of human experience , the laws of classical mechanics are widely , usefully and correctly applied in a large range of technological and scientific problems .
Yet in nature we observe a domain in which v/c is not small .
The motions of objects in this domain , as well as motion in the " classical " domain , are accurately described through the equations of Einstein 's theory of relativity .
We believe , due to experimental tests , that relativistic theory provides a more general , and therefore more accurate , description of the principles governing our universe , than the earlier " classical " theory .
Further , we find that the relativistic equations reduce to the classical equations in the limit v/c << 1 . Similarly , classical physics is valid only at distances much larger than atomic scales ( x >> 10 -8 m ) .
A description which is valid at all length scales is given by the equations of quantum mechanics .
We are all familiar with theories which had to be discarded in the face of experimental evidence .
In the field of astronomy , the earth - centered description of the planetary orbits was overthrown by the Copernican system , in which the sun was placed at the center of a series of concentric , circular planetary orbits .
Later , this theory was modified , as measurements of the planets motions were found to be compatible with elliptical , not circular , orbits , and still later planetary motion was found to be derivable from Newton 's laws .
Error in experiments have several sources .
First , there is error intrinsic to instruments of measurement .
Because this type of error has equal probability of producing a measurement higher or lower numerically than the " true " value , it is called random error .
Second , there is non-random or systematic error , due to factors which bias the result in one direction .
No measurement , and therefore no experiment , can be perfectly precise .
At the same time , in science we have standard ways of estimating and in some cases reducing errors .
Thus it is important to determine the accuracy of a particular measurement and , when stating quantitative results , to quote the measurement error .
A measurement without a quoted error is meaningless .
The comparison between experiment and theory is made within the context of experimental errors .
Scientists ask , how many standard deviations are the results from the theoretical prediction ?
Have all sources of systematic and random errors been properly estimated ?
This is discussed in more detail in the appendix on Error Analysis and in Statistics Lab 1 .
As stated earlier , the scientific method attempts to minimize the influence of the scientist 's bias on the outcome of an experiment .
That is , when testing an hypothesis or a theory , the scientist may have a preference for one outcome or another , and it is important that this preference not bias the results or their interpretation .
The most fundamental error is to mistake the hypothesis for an explanation of a phenomenon , without performing experimental tests .
Sometimes " common sense " and " logic " tempt us into believing that no test is needed .
There are numerous examples of this , dating from the Greek philosophers to the present day .
Another common mistake is to ignore or rule out data which do not support the hypothesis .
Ideally , the experimenter is open to the possibility that the hypothesis is correct or incorrect .
Sometimes , however , a scientist may have a strong belief that the hypothesis is true ( or false ) , or feels internal or external pressure to get a specific result .
In that case , there may be a psychological tendency to find " something wrong " , such as systematic effects , with data which do not support the scientist 's expectations , while data which do agree with those expectations may not be checked as carefully .
The lesson is that all data must be handled in the same way .
Another common mistake arises from the failure to estimate quantitatively systematic errors ( and all errors ) .
There are many examples of discoveries which were missed by experimenters whose data contained a new phenomenon , but who explained it away as a systematic background .
Conversely , there are many examples of alleged " new discoveries " which later proved to be due to systematic errors not accounted for by the " discoverers . "
In a field where there is active experimentation and open communication among members of the scientific community , the biases of individuals or groups may cancel out , because experimental tests are repeated by different scientists who may have different biases .
In addition , different types of experimental setups have different sources of systematic errors .
Over a period spanning a variety of experimental tests ( usually at least several years ) , a consensus develops in the community as to which experimental results have stood the test of time .
In physics and other science disciplines , the words " hypothesis , " " model , " " theory " and " law " have different connotations in relation to the stage of acceptance or knowledge about a group of phenomena .
An hypothesis is a limited statement regarding cause and effect in specific situations ; it also refers to our state of knowledge before experimental work has been performed and perhaps even before new phenomena have been predicted .
To take an example from daily life , suppose you discover that your car will not start .
You may say , " My car does not start because the battery is low . "
This is your first hypothesis .
You may then check whether the lights were left on , or if the engine makes a particular sound when you turn the ignition key .
You might actually check the voltage across the terminals of the battery .
If you discover that the battery is not low , you might attempt another hypothesis ( " The starter is broken " ; " This is really not my car . " )
The word model is reserved for situations when it is known that the hypothesis has at least limited validity .
A often - cited example of this is the Bohr model of the atom , in which , in an analogy to the solar system , the electrons are described has moving in circular orbits around the nucleus .
This is not an accurate depiction of what an atom " looks like , " but the model succeeds in mathematically representing the energies ( but not the correct angular momenta ) of the quantum states of the electron in the simplest case , the hydrogen atom .
Another example is Hook 's Law ( which should be called Hook 's principle , or Hook 's model ) , which states that the force exerted by a mass attached to a spring is proportional to the amount the spring is stretched .
We know that this principle is only valid for small amounts of stretching .
The " law " fails when the spring is stretched beyond its elastic limit ( it can break ) .
This principle , however , leads to the prediction of simple harmonic motion , and , as a model of the behavior of a spring , has been versatile in an extremely broad range of applications .
A scientific theory or law represents an hypothesis , or a group of related hypotheses , which has been confirmed through repeated experimental tests .
Theories in physics are often formulated in terms of a few concepts and equations , which are identified with " laws of nature , " suggesting their universal applicability .
Accepted scientific theories and laws become part of our understanding of the universe and the basis for exploring less well - understood areas of knowledge .
Theories are not easily discarded ; new discoveries are first assumed to fit into the existing theoretical framework .
It is only when , after repeated experimental tests , the new phenomenon cannot be accommodated that scientists seriously question the theory and attempt to modify it .
The validity that we attach to scientific theories as representing realities of the physical world is to be contrasted with the facile invalidation implied by the expression , " It 's only a theory . "
For example , it is unlikely that a person will step off a tall building on the assumption that they will not fall , because " Gravity is only a theory . "
Changes in scientific thought and theories occur , of course , sometimes revolutionizing our view of the world ( Kuhn , 1962 ) .
Again , the key force for change is the scientific method , and its emphasis on experiment .
While the scientific method is necessary in developing scientific knowledge , it is also useful in everyday problem - solving .
What do you do when your telephone does n't work ?
Is the problem in the hand set , the cabling inside your house , the hookup outside , or in the workings of the phone company ?
The process you might go through to solve this problem could involve scientific thinking , and the results might contradict your initial expectations .
Like any good scientist , you may question the range of situations ( outside of science ) in which the scientific method may be applied .
From what has been stated above , we determine that the scientific method works best in situations where one can isolate the phenomenon of interest , by eliminating or accounting for extraneous factors , and where one can repeatedly test the system under study after making limited , controlled changes in it .
There are , of course , circumstances when one cannot isolate the phenomena or when one cannot repeat the measurement over and over again .
In such cases the results may depend in part on the history of a situation .
This often occurs in social interactions between people .
For example , when a lawyer makes arguments in front of a jury in court , she or he cannot try other approaches by repeating the trial over and over again in front of the same jury .
In a new trial , the jury composition will be different .
Even the same jury hearing a new set of arguments cannot be expected to forget what they heard before .
The scientific method is intricately associated with science , the process of human inquiry that pervades the modern era on many levels .
While the method appears simple and logical in description , there is perhaps no more complex question than that of knowing how we come to know things .
In this introduction , we have emphasized that the scientific method distinguishes science from other forms of explanation because of its requirement of systematic experimentation .
We have also tried to point out some of the criteria and practices developed by scientists to reduce the influence of individual or social bias on scientific findings .
Further investigations of the scientific method and other aspects of scientific practice may be found in the references listed below .

1. Software can not be patented .
If there is any doubt as to whether a patent is a software patent , it is .
2. Business methods can not be patented .
As before , if there is any doubt as to whether or not it is a business method patent , it is .
3. Obviousness and novelty should be decided by experts in the field who , as much as possible , have no stake in the matter .
4 . You cannot re-patent a new application of the same idea in solely order to extend the life of the patent .
5 . You must include a working model with your patent .
6 . The patent office gets the same fees whether they grant patents or not .
7 . The patent office employees get a bonus every year .
For every overturned patent in court , the legal fees of the winner come out of the bonuses of those who were involved in granting the bad patent .
( Bonus can be 0 , but not negative ) .
8 . Funding for the patent office stays with the patent office and cannot be diverted by congress or others for other purposes .
Excess funding beyond a working threshold goes towards bonuses .
9 . Patents are limited to 5 years .

You cannot patent life , or life processes .
First of all , you must understand the underlying principle s of how a traffic jam works .
Traffic jams are essentially the result of delayed action and / or slow human reflexes .
For example , when you are driving and the person ahead of you slows down for a bit before speeding back up again , how long does it take for you yourself to also tap the brakes to slow down then speed up again ?
Clearly , you and the driver ahead of you do not slow down and speed up again in unison .
The usual sequence of events usually follows this pattern :
The driver ahead of you slows down .
You see the driver ahead slow down .
A second later you press down on your brakes to slow down .
The driver ahead of you speeds up .
You see the driver ahead of you speed up .
A second later , you press down on your accelerator to speed up .
Now what of the driver behind you ?
And the driver behind that driver ?
All those precious seconds will add up !
Each and every car behind the original driver who slowed down must follow the sequence of events described above .
Some drivers may take more time to respond and make the situation nastier .
Can you see how all this can be a problem ?
Every time a driver stomps on the brakes , he is creating a zone of compression on the road .
Cars in this zone will likely squish closer together and slow down to avoid hitting each other .
This is the traffic jam .
Now for every zone of compression , there is also a zone of rarafiction , where cars are more sparse and tend to speed up to take advantage of all that open road ahead of them .
Now here 's the fun part .
To start a traffic jam , gently press down on the brakes and slow down on the freeway .
Make sure the car behind you does not attempt to switch to another lane to pass you up .
Speed up again and weave between lanes and slow down again if you have to .
It helps to have a friend help you out here .
What you are trying to do is to get the cars behind you to slow down enough to get the cars behind them to slow down , and the cars behind those cars ... etc .
Now use that zone of rarafiction to speed up and make your getaway .
If you have a few friends to help you out , weave between lanes like crazed ferrets , slowing down and speeding up at random .
Drivers behind you will slow down to avoid you .
Of course , if you or any of your friends gets into a really nasty car accident at this point , the car wreck alone will be enough to start a big traffic jam , but that was what you were trying to accomplish all along , right ?
Upon sucessfully initiating a traffic jam that would no doubt infuriate countless commuters , soccer moms , and delivery boys , it is important that you make it known that your traffic jam was a result of planned and deliberate actions as opposed to other traffic jams which are caused by mere random stupidity or Acts of God .
Call your local traffic news radio station and tell them something to the effect of " Interstate 666 is backed up from Somewhereville to Someotherville because the hypocritical swine of this county have failed to do their part to Save the Whales .
We hope this traffic jam will offer then them opportunity to contemplate and reevaluate their stance on saving our planet ! "
You could also declare your traffic jam a piece of abstract performance art .
Bayesian Filtering Defined
Just a few short years ago , Bayes ’ Formula was found mostly in university - level statistics textbooks .
This whitepaper gives a basic explanation of what Bayes ’ Formula is , and how it can be used to keep spam out of your Inbox .
In its simplified form , Bayes ’ Formula is :
So what does that formula do in simple terms ?
It lets us combine the probability of multiple independent events into one number .
For example , suppose I know that when my car makes a loud clicking sound , there ’s a 75 % chance it ’s going to break down .
I also know that if it ’s more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit outside , my car only has a 15 % chance of breaking down .
If it ’s more than 80 degrees outside and my car is making a loud clicking sound , I can use Bayes ’ Formula to figure out how likely it is that I ’m going to be walking to work that morning ( 34.6 % , if you ’re curious ) .
Since most people get rid of a car when it breaks down as much as mine does ( rather than figuring out how often it ’s going to break down ) , we ’re going to use the formula to figure out the probability that a message is spam based on the words appearing in it .
Our goal is to have our filter :
List every word in an incoming mail message Determine the odds of each word appearing in a spam message , and Use those odds as input to Bayes ’ Formula to determine if the message is spam or not .
The first thing we need to do is teach our filter the difference between spam and non-spam messages .
When we humans accidentally read a spam message , we almost immediately recognize it as spam because of certain key words ( such as “ viagra ” and “ mortgage ” ) or phrases ( such as “ Get your free porn here ! ” ) .
Instinctively , we know that a message containing these words or phrases is spam because of our experience in dealing with junk mail .
The opposite is true as well – we can almost instantly look at a message from our mother ( containing phrases such as “ When are you going to get married so I can have grandchildren ? ” ) or our boss ( containing phrases such as “ Less computer solitaire and more work if you want a paycheck this Friday ” ) and know they ’re not spam .
Our filter does n’t have the benefit of our years of experience , so we have to teach it what spam messages look like , and how they differ from non -spam messages .
We “ train ” the filter by showing it a bunch of mail messages , and telling it whether the message is spam .
Whenever we show a message to the filter , it finds every word in the message and stores it ( along with how many times it occurred ) in a database .
Separate databases are kept for spam and non-spam messages .
The filter uses a looser definition of a word than humans do – a word ( more properly called a token ) can also be an IP address , a host name , an HTML tag , or a price ( such as “ $ 99.99 ” ) .
The things a token ca n’t be are random strings , words less than three characters long , and numbers .
As a simple example , let ’s train the filter on these three very short spam messages :
Get Viagra here without a prescription .
Click here to get your free porn !
Free mortgage consultations available now .
Our spam token database should now look a little like this :
# PreciseMail Token Database Msg Count : 3 available 1 click 1 consultations 1 free 2 get 2 here 2 mortgage 1 now 1 porn 1 prescription 1 viagra 1 without 1 your 1
Now let ’s train it on these three short non-spam messages :
Important meeting today at noon .
When is the next time you ’re coming home to visit ?
Let ’s all meet at the diner for breakfast .
After we do that , our non -spam token database should look a little like this :
# PreciseMail Token Database Msg Count : 3 all 1 breakfast 1 coming 1 diner 1 home 1 important 1 let ’s 1 meet 1 meeting 1 next 1 noon 1 time 1 today 1 visit 1 when 1 you ’re 1
At this point , the filter is very minimally trained – using it to filter spam would be like letting a 3 - year old drive on a major highway .
( In real life , our filter is smart enough to know when it ’s been sufficiently trained . )
It ’s important that you train the filter with approximately equal amounts of spam and non-spam messages , as we ’re doing in this example .
Many people ( including several software vendors that really should know better ) tend to train their Bayesian filter only on spam messages .
There ’s an old saying that goes something like : “ If the only tool you have is a hammer , every problem looks like a nail . ”
With a Bayesian filter , if it ’s only been trained with spam messages , every message looks like spam .
It ’s also important that the Bayesian filter be trained on spam and non-spam messages from your site , and your site only .
If a Bayesian filter is pre-trained on messages from another site , it wo n’t be able to identify features specific to messages destined for your site .
This can easily lead to large numbers of false positives and a low spam detection accuracy .
Even with this knowledge , many people choose to use pre-trained products because they do n’t want to take the time and effort to properly train their own Bayesian filter .
To counter this , several new products on the market , including Process Software ’s PreciseMail Anti-Spam Gateway , can automatically train the built - in Bayesian filter on spam and non-spam messages .
This lets the systems administrator “ install and forget ” the Bayesian component of the spam filtering system .
Now we ’re going to let the filter try to decide if a message is spam or not , based on what we ’ve told it about what spam looks like and how it differs from non-spam .
Let ’s pretend a mail message is sent to the filter , which looks like this :
Hi , Just a reminder : do n’t forget your allergy prescription when you visit New York City today .
Mom
The filter scans through the message , creating a list of every word it knows about ( in other words , every word in the message that ’s also in the token databases ) .
In this example , the words it knows about are “ prescription ” , “ when ” , “ today ” , “ visit ” , and “ your ” .
Once the filter has the list of words it knows about , for each word it calculates the probability that the word appears in spam based on the frequency data in the token databases .
This probability value assigned to each word is commonly referred to as spamicity , and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 .
A spamicity value greater than 0.5 means that a message containing the word is likely to be spam , while a spamicity value less than 0.5 indicates that a message containing the word is likely to be ham .
A spamicity value of 0.5 is neutral , meaning that it has no effect on the decision as to whether a message is spam or not .
In simplest terms , the spamicity is based on the number of times a word occurs in spam messages as opposed to the number of times it occurs in non-spam messages .
For example , if a word has occurred 50 times in spam messages but only 2 times in non-spam messages , a message that contains it has a good chance of being spam .
The opposite is true as well – if a word appears 50 times in non-spam messages but only 2 times in spam messages , a message that contains it is n’t very likely to be spam .
Common words , such as “ for ” and “ what ” , tend to occur about equally often in both spam and non-spam messages , so they have neutral spamicities .
Back to our example : after looking at the token databases , our filter comes up with the following spamicities for each of the known words in the incoming message :
prescription 0.990000 today 0.010000 when 0.010000 visit 0.010000 your 0.990000
Now that we have a spamicity value for each word , the filter is going to use Bayes ’ Formula to combine them all together to get an overall spamicity for the whole message .
In the case of our example , the overall spamicity is 0.00 .
Since this is certainly less than 0.5 , the filter has decided that the message is n’t spam , and allows the mail server to deliver it to the intended recipient .
A key point to take away from this example is that a couple words with a high spamicity do n’t automatically doom an incoming message to be branded as spam – there have to be enough words with a high spamicity to outweigh the words with a low spamicity .
This means that a message from your spouse discussing taking out a second mortgage on the house to finance some kitchen remodeling will most likely make it through , as will a message from your best buddy talking about how happy he is now that he ’s starting taking Viagra .
To make sure we do n’t accidentally mark a non -spam message as spam , we double the weight of non-spam words in our calculations .
This means that it takes two words with a high spamicity to outweigh one word with a low spamicity .
Doing this does n’t have much of an effect on the filter ’s spam detection accuracy ( spam messages tend to contain lots of words with high spamicities ) , but it does significantly lower the false positive rate .
Bayesian Filtering Examples
Now that we have a basic understanding of how Bayesian filtering works , I ’m going to use my personal email account for some real - world examples of what Bayesian filtering looks like .
The token databases used in the below examples have been trained with around a thousand spam messages and a thousand non-spam messages .
The first example below is the output from running the Bayesian filter on a message from a friend who just moved to the Los Angeles area .
Most of the message is complaints about smog and traffic , followed by his new contact information .
SPAMICITY : 0.002844 final 0.378383 leave 0.327315 area 0.683825 New 0.740312 info 0.786698 here 0.786764 I 'll 0.201614 contact 0.846948 his 0.148226 left 0.853779 transit 0.121959 maybe 0.112914 ext 0.978168 capped 0.010000 smog 0.010000
This particular message has a mix of spam and non-spam words , but the non-spam words outweigh the spam words .
You ’ve probably noticed that the output from the filter only contains 15 words – my friend hates typing , but he does n’t hate it so much he only uses 15 words per message .
Our Bayesian filter uses only the 15 most “ interesting ” words to calculate the message ’s overall spamicity .
These 15 words are the words in the message that have either the highest or lowest spamicity ( i.e. are closest to 0 or 1 in value ) .
We ignore these other words in the message because they do n’t have any real impact over and above the 15 most “ interesting ” words .
This keeps the Bayesian filter running quickly , even if somebody feels the urge to send you the complete text of the first act of Hamlet .
The next example output is from a spam message so obscene it would make anyone blush .
And that does n’t even cover the photos that the spammer thoughtfully included .
This was one of those messages that you delete as quickly as possible so someone walking by does n’t see it on your screen and report you to Human Resources .
SPAMICITY : 1.000000 great 0.649814 64.119.221.136 0.990000 Thank 0.744272 our 0.766728 you 'll 0.819132 understanding 0.102168 offer 0.948124 SIZE 0.957696 privacy 0.989979 enjoiy 0.990000 teenies 0.990000 e.gif 0.990000 FF0000 0.990000 TeenParadiso 0.990000 TEEN 0.990000
This example demonstrates some interesting features of Bayesian filtering .
Since we look at everything in the message , things like IP addresses , HTML attributes , and even image file names are included in the Bayesian analysis .
Interesting things of note in this message are :
The misspelled word “ enjoiy ” has a very high spamicity .
As a whole , spammers are shockingly bad spellers so misspelled words tend to have high spamicities .
( If you ’re a really lousy speller , this might be a good time to get in the habit of using a spell checker . )
FF0000 is the HTML attribute for the color red .
The human eye is unconsciously drawn to the color red , a fact of which spammers are well aware .
Most people never use red text in an email message , but spammers use the color more often than sports car manufacturers .
The IP address 64.119.221.136 is referenced by the message .
This particular address is used by a spammer that sends several messages a day in my direction , so it ends up being a handy way to quickly identify a spam message .
Even if the spammer sends me a message that contains no words with a high spamicity , the IP address will give him away .
An external image file is referenced ( e.gif ) .
Embedded links to images on a web server are almost never found in non-spam email , so they quickly become a way for the Bayesian filter to differentiate spam messages .
It ’s important to remember that the Bayesian filter adapts itself to your site .
For example , just because I never receive non-spam mail containing red text does n’t mean everyone does n’t .
If red text is common at your site , then the Bayesian filter will learn that and not use it as a way to identify spam .
The final example is the output from running the Bayesian filter against an email from another friend , who ’s a medical student .
She ’s training to be a forensic pathologist , and likes sending me email describing horrible medical conditions in an attempt to make me nauseous .
As a result , mail from her tends to contain mostly medical terminology that the filter has never seen before .
As an example , here ’s the output from running the filter against an email describing how the Ebola virus destroys your internal organs :
SPAMICITY : 0.000000 Antigen 0.400000 aerosols 0.400000 re-insertion 0.400000 Nosocomial 0.400000 virus 0.647605 PCR 0.333311 isolation 0.080738 reaction 0.070790 polymerase 0.010000 health - care 0.010000 secretions 0.010000 hypothesized 0.010000 amplification 0.010000 primates 0.010000 chimpanzees 0.010000
This output from the filter contains medical terms that most people have probably never heard before , even if they religiously watch medical dramas on television .
Most people do n’t casually drop words like “ antigen ” and “ nosocomial ” in their conversations , and they do n’t use them in email messages .
As a result , the Bayesian filter has no idea what to do with the word .
This particular message presents a unique problem to a Bayesian filter – it ’s almost nothing but medical terms and very common words that have neutral spamicities .
Since the Bayesian filter does n’t have any training data available for these words , it assigns them a default spamicity of 0.4 .
This value is slightly non-spam , since it ’s unusual for a spam message to contain a significant number of words that have n’t appeared in previous spam messages .
If a spammer uses uncommon words , he ’s going to confuse his target audience ( namely those who respond to spam messages ) .
As we ’ve seen , when properly used a Bayesian filter can be an extraordinarily accurate way to identify and discard spam messages .
Large - scale spammers are starting to learn how effective it is the hard way , and they ’re busily working on ways to circumvent it .
The first circumvention technique spammers tried was a modification of the one that rendered checksum - based message signature filtering useless : including strings of random text in the message .
The theory was that enough of these random character strings would increase the size of the token databases to the point where they made the filter so slow that it was useless .
In response , smart developers of anti-spam filters ( i.e. the “ Good Guys ” ) implemented a system that removed infrequently used tokens from the token database .
Even though all of the random strings from spam messages would be placed in the token database , they would be removed as soon as it was obvious that they did n’t appear in other messages .
The current circumvention technique the spammers are trying is to include obviously non-spam words in their spam messages .
For example , last week a spammer sent me an advertisement for “ penile growth supplements ” that included the words “ congresswoman ” and “ soybean ” in the subject and message body .
The Bayesian filter promptly marked it as spam since the words “ penile ” and “ supplements ” pretty much condemn any message sent to my account as spam , but the spammer had two goals in sending me this message .
The first ( and obvious ) goal was to see if the spammer could sneak the message past the Bayesian filter by including obviously non-spam words .
In this , he failed .
The secondary goal was to try to get the filter to start recognizing the words “ congresswoman ” and “ soybean ” as words with a high spamicity .
If spammers can get the filter to assign a high spamicity to enough words that commonly appear in non-spam messages , they can render the filter useless .
Luckily , while spammers may be smart enough to come up with these circumvention ideas , they ’re not very good at coordinating their efforts .
As long as every spammer that sends me mail does n’t start including the words “ congresswoman ” and “ soybean ” in their spam messages , they wo n’t appear often enough in spam to significantly increase their spamicities .
( In my case , I ’ve never received a mail message containing the words “ congresswoman ” or “ soybean ” , so the filter ignored them altogether . )
This circumvention method also has limited utility for another good old - fashioned marketing reason .
If spammers start including a large pile of legitimate text ( such as an article from the CNN website ) in each message , they ’d confuse their target audience .
A spam message advertising penile growth supplements that also contains an article about the relative value of the Euro is going to confuse the audience so much they just ignore the message .
Summary
While other filtering methods may be as effective for now , Bayesian filtering includes an element of changeability that makes it very difficult for spammers to circumvent .
Savvy spammers with a lot of resources try to buy every anti-spam filtering product they can get their hands on , and test their spam messages against it so they can be sure the spam will get through to the recipient .
Since every site with a Bayesian filter installed has a different set of tokens in their database , it makes it impossible for the spammer to deliberately craft a message that will bypass a site ’s Bayesian filter .
Because the Bayesian filter is constantly being updated , every sneaky change in message wording made by spammers will be quickly identified and rendered ineffective .
This makes Bayesian filtering the bane of every spammer , and something every site serious about stopping spam should have .
September 11 , 2006
It 's true .
It 's weird .
It 's nuts .
The Department of Homeland Security , after a five - year hunt for Osama , has finally brought charges against … Greg Palast .
I kid you not .
Send your cakes with files to the Air America wing at Guantanamo .
Though not just yet .
Fatherland Security has informed me that television producer Matt Pascarella and I have been charged with unauthorized filming of a “ critical national security structure ” in Louisiana .
Click here to Read the full story .
Click here for the first part and here for the second part of the Democracy Now ! report .
On August 22nd , for LinkTV and DemocracyNow !
we videotaped the thousands of Katrina evacuees still held behind barbed wire in a trailer park encampment a hundred miles from New Orleans .
It 's been a year since the hurricane and 73,000 POW 's ( Prisoners of W ) are still in this aluminum ghetto in the middle of nowhere .
One resident Pamela Lewis said , “ It is a prison set - up ” — except there are no home furloughs for these inmates because they no longer have homes .
To give a sense of the full flavor and smell of the place , we wanted to show that this human parking lot , with kids and elderly , is nearly adjacent to the Exxon Oil refinery , the nation 's second largest , a chemical - belching behemoth .
So we filmed it .
Without Big Brother 's authorization .
Uh , oh .
Apparently , the broadcast of these stinking smokestacks tipped off Osama that , if his assassins pose as poor Black folk , they can get a cramped Airstream right next to a “ critical infrastructure ” asset .
So now Matt and I have a “ criminal complaint ” lodged against us with the feds .
The positive side for me as a journalist is that I get to see our terror - busters in action .
I should note that it took the Maxwell Smarts at Homeland Security a full two weeks to hunt us down .
Frankly , we were a bit scared that , given the charges , we would n't be allowed on a plane into New York last night .
But what scared us more is that we were allowed on the plane .
Once I was traced , I had a bit of an other - worldly conversation with my would - be captors .
Detective Frank Pananepinto of Homeland Security told us , “ This is a ‘ Critical Infrastructure ' … and they get nervous about unauthorized filming of their property . ”
Well , me too , Detective .
In fact , I 'm very nervous that this potential chemical blast - site can be mapped in extreme detail at this Google Map location .
What also makes me nervous is that the Bush Terror Terriers have kindly indicated on the Internet that this unprotected critical infrastructure can be targeted — I mean located — at 30 29 ′ 11 ″ N Latitude and 91 11 ′ 39 ″ W Longitude .
After I assured Detective Pananepinto , “ I can swear to you that I 'm not part of Al Qaeda , ” he confirmed that , “ Louisiana is still part of the United States , ” subject to the First Amendment and he was therefore required to divulge my accuser .
Not surprisingly , it was Exxon Corporation , one of a handful of companies not in love with my investigations .
[ See “ A Well - Designed Disaster : the Untold Story of the Exxon Valdez . ” ]
So I rang America 's top petroleum pusher - men and asked their media relations honcho in Houston , Marc Boudreaux , a simple question .
“ Do you want us to go to jail or not ?
Is it Exxon 's position that reporters should go to jail ? ”
Because , all my dumb-ass jokes aside , that is what 's at stake .
And Exxon knew we were journalists because we showed our press credential to the Exxon guards at the refinery entrance .
The Exxon man was coy : “ Well , we 'll see what we can find out …
Obviously it 's important to national security that we have supplies from that refinery in the event of an emergency . ”
Really ?
According to the documents our team uncovered from the offices of Exxon 's lawyer , Mr. James Baker , the oil industry is more than happy to see a limit on worldwide crude production .
Indeed , the current squeeze has jacked the price of oil from $ 24 a barrel to $ 64 and refined products have jumped yet higher — resulting in a record - busting profit for Exxon of nearly $ 1 billion per week .
So this silly “ criminal complaint ” has nothing to do with stopping Al Qaeda or keeping the oil flowing .
It has everything to do with obstructing news reports in a way that no one would have dared attempt before the September 11 attack .
Dectective Pananepinto , in justifying our impending bust , said , “ If you remember , a lot of people were killed on 9/11 . ”
Yes , Detective , I remember that very well : my office was in the World Trade Center .
Lucky for me , I was out of town that day .
It was not a lucky day for 3,000 others .
Yes , I remember “ a lot ” of people were killed .
So I have this suggestion , Detective — and you can pass it on to Mr. Bush :
Go and find the people who killed them .
It 's been five years and the Bush regime has not done that .
Instead , the War on Terror is reduced to taking off our shoes in airports , hoping we can bomb Muslims into loving America and chasing journalists around the bayou .
Meanwhile , King Abdullah , the Gambino of oil , whose princelings funded the murderers , gets a free ride in the President 's golf cart at the Crawford ranch .
I guess I should n't complain .
After all , Matt and I look pretty good in orange .
*******
A personal request to readers .
Many have written to ask what can be done to protect Matt and me from becoming unwilling guests of the State .
First , this ain't no foolin ' around : Matt and I are facing these nutty charges .
So spread the info .
We believe that getting the word out is the best defense .
Second , call Homeland Security and turn us in .
They seem to have trouble finding us .
If you get a reward , you may choose to donate it to the Palast Investigative Fund , a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) educational foundation which supports our work and pays our legal fees .
Third , ask your local library to order our book , Armed Madhouse : Who 's Afraid of Osama Wolf ?
Homeland Security now reserves the right to read over your shoulder at the library ; therefore , the more our agents are forced to read this subversive material , the more likely we can convince them to come in out of the cold .
All kidding aside , we do ask you to request your library order the book : not everyone can afford to purchase this hardbound edition .

Mom was right about those veggies : Vegetables can help fend off age - related memory loss
Study : Vegetables May Keep Brains Young
Oh really ?
The news tell us that eating our veggies can keep us sharp as we grow older but is there any evidence for that claim ?
A British man who allegedly crippled US defence systems in the " biggest military computer hack of all time " could be sent to Guantanamo Bay if he is extradited , his lawyer claims .
Edmund Lawson told Bow Street Magistrates Court in central London that Washington wanted " administrative revenge " on his client , Gary McKinnon , because he had exposed embarrassing weaknesses in its IT security .
McKinnon , who was described by his lawyer as a " 40 - year - old computer nerd " , is wanted in the United States for allegedly infiltrating systems at the Pentagon , Army , Navy and space agency NASA from his bedroom in north London .
Almost a week later , and after a downgrading of the terrorist threat , what do ordinary voters now think of those excitable early briefings by John Reid , the home secretary , and Scotland Yard 's dramatically voiced belief that it had foiled " mass murder on an unimaginable scale " ?
Are people still sceptical ?
As it turns out , the prime minister would be heartened by the views of the individuals on his doorstep .
Unfortunately , the largely sympathetic crowds outside Downing Street are overwhelmingly made up of non-voter tourists .
A Brazilian who has lived in London for five years mentions his innocent countryman , Jean Charles de Menezes , shot dead after botched intelligence following 7/7 last year , but says that , relatively speaking , he trusts the authorities more here than in his home city of Sao Paulo .
Similarly , American visitors to the capital say they are impressed with the " very British , very discreet " security and the post - alert calm of the population .
But they are bewildered by the sceptical reaction of some Britons to what they see as a war .
" We 've been looking at your museums , " says John LeClaire , from Boston , holidaying with family and friends .
" In the first world war there 's this blindly patriotic joining of this war that is in a sense pointless .
In the second world war there is uniform support for the government once Chamberlain is got rid of .
Now you have , what , about 20 % of the people who think terror plots are a conspiracy ?
That 's an extraordinary evolution . "
" It did n't cross my mind that this was a conspiracy , " says Dogan Arthur , also from Boston .
" It would show that terrorism is working if people think it 's a conspiracy . "
He adds : " It 's remarkable how international a city London is .
It 's interesting what a presence the Middle East has in London .
I do n't remember that 10 years ago .
There 's nowhere in the US where you would get that sense of being in a sea of Muslims . "
Thirty five miles north of Downing Street and the average American tourist really would be startled by Bury Park in Luton , a quintessential 1920s English suburb now predominantly populated by British Muslim families .
Halal butchers , grocers selling piles of fresh watermelons and fashion stores offering " wedding sarees , langhas and fabrics " line the main street .
" In my opinion it is a cover - up because of what 's going on in Lebanon , " says Munir Khan .
" When you turn on the TV you see innocent people getting killed .
This [ plot ] distracts from that . "
A moderate Muslim who has been a member of the Labour party for nearly 20 years , Khan quit about eight months ago to join the Lib Dems .
He does not trust the evidence coming out of Pakistan in relation to this latest alleged terror plot .
" The Pakistan government will say anything for money , " he says .
" If the UK government gives them money to say something , they will say it . "
Suspicion and ( often internet - fuelled ) talk of conspiracies is no longer the prerogative of the young , it seems .
According to Khan , it has been noticeable that older Muslims , traditionally engaged in mainstream politics in a way that their children are not , have talked openly of their anger and distrust of the government in recent months .
Scepticism about the plot is shared by many in the area and not just by Muslims , says Qurban Hussain , a local resident and the deputy leader of Luton borough council .
" People are definitely sceptical .
They are not sure whether these claims are just to clamp down on British Muslims .
Is it scaremongering tactics by the government or another reason to harass more innocent people ?
" It 's a perception held by a lot of my constituents of all backgrounds .
When you look back on the WMD , the information was wrong .
Then we have the case of Jean Charles de Menezes .
We picked up the wrong person altogether .
Then the raid in Forest Gate in which a man was shot .
There are so many cases people can refer to .
It makes them feel they cannot trust the government . "
Reassuringly for Labour , the overwhelming majority of people of all faiths I speak to in London , Luton and further up the M1 , give a pragmatic , sensible - sounding " wait and see " response to questions about whether they believe that this alleged terror plot is a genuine threat .
" It is in the government 's best interests to look after the people of this country .
If they hear of a threat , they have every right to close things down , " says Usman Hussain , 21 , inside a barber 's in Bury Park .
On the window is a poster advertising a talk on the " crisis in Lebanon " .
The star guest speaker is billed as a member of Hizb ut - Tahrir , the radical Islamist group .
Does Usman believe there was a terrorist plot to blow up planes ?
" I do n't really know .
We 've been given no evidence yet .
It could go either way . "
But this general pragmatism is heavily steeped in scepticism everywhere I go , and not just among British Muslims .
Jerry Thornton , from Wiltshire , is with the tourists outside Downing Street .
" There is so much we do n't know .
It [ the government ] is such a secretive organisation .
They are all colluding together .
Some of it's for our own protection , but I believe a lot of it is spin .
I accept during the investigation they can't tell the whole truth but we'd like to know exactly what happened and how it was foiled . "
Stopping at the motorway services just north of Luton , John Jeffreys is unsure whether he trusts the government 's line .
" It 's difficult to know .
A lot of these terror alerts seem to coincide with an announcement about ID cards for instance .
This time there obviously was some sort of plot but we do n't know how significant it was .
I do n't trust the government at all .
There 's no doubt that Blair lied about the weapons of mass destruction before Iraq . "
" It 's propaganda , is n't it ? " chips in his mate , Mick Perrone , 31 .
" It gets the whole nation on alert . "
What can the government do to restore trust ?
In a time of endlessly slippery conspiracy theories , how can it show that the terror plot was genuine ?
" They must come up with the proof , " says Khan .
Other Muslim voters argue that the first step the government must take to restore levels of trust is to reform its foreign policy .
Again and again , Muslim voters point to what they see as the government 's " double standards " in dealing with other Islamic countries and disputes in Iraq , Afghanistan , Palestine , Kashmir and now Lebanon .
Muslim voters say they are also angered by the government 's - and George Bush 's - use of the term " Islamic terrorism " .
" Why Islamic ?
Look at Northern Ireland .
Who was saying ' Christians ' there ? " says Khan .
By chance an Irish family on holiday from Belfast pull into the services on the M1 while I 'm there .
" This [ plot ] could be make - believe , so the government can say , ' Look what we 're doing to fight the terrorists , ' " says Joanne Burrows .
" There must have been something to arrest 23 people , but plenty of people have done time in Northern Ireland for doing nothing " .
After very careful consideration , I 've come to the conclusion that my current understanding of Digg and Reddit can be expressed in the form of an SAT analogy and terms of a pair of " community " sites from the previous generation .
Digg is to Slashdot , as Reddit is to Kuro5hin
Yeah , I kinda gave it away in the title of this post , did n't I ?
Oh , well .
Now , I suppose you want evidence for this odd claim .
Unfortunately , a lot of it boils down to qualitative things : the " feel " of each site and the type of content that surfaces there most often .
Slashdot and Digg are tech heavy , while Kuro5hin and Reddit seem to cast a wider net that captures more of science and culture ( and occasionally some politics ) .
Slashdot and Digg both drive a lot of traffic and experience a lot of churn , while Kuro5hin and Reddit are a bit more stable and have smaller ( but by no means " small " ) audiences .
See also : Because You Asked which takes a cursory look at one site 's experience appearing on both .
Thoughts ?
What other similarities do you see , assuming you 've been a user of or participant in each of them for a non-trivial amount of time ?

Fox crew shot at in Israel RAW STORY
Published : Thursday July 13 , 2006 Print This | Email This New to RAW STORY ?
Be sure to check out our front page for all the latest breaking news .
After revealing detailed information about the movement of Israeli troops , a Fox News crew has been shot at on live television .
Partial transcript follows video .
FOX HOST : Palestinian Prime Minister , Mahmoud Abbas , says , " Israeli 's incursion into Lebanon could start a regional war . "
We got David Lee Miller there , live , in central Gaza .
David Lee , I see you have your flak jacket on .
What 's happening ?
DAVID LEE MILLER : Right now , Brian , fortunately , not a great deal .
We 're on the outskirts of Abala[ sic ] but yesterday at this very location -- in the city here -- some 12 Palestinians were killed .
At least half of them , according to local sources , were militants .
One of them was also a policeman and this is normally a very busy roadway .
This is Sala Adini[ sic ] street .
This is the main artery that cuts through the Gaza strip .
It goes from the very bottom to the very top of the script .
As you can see for yourself , it is a ghost town at this hour .
Not a single car is on this road .
The reason for that , the Israelis have effectively now , they have cut Gaza in half .
There is a strong Israeli presence here .
This is the first time that there Israeli troops in Gaza since the withdrawal last summer .
And just over my shoulder , off in the distance -- you can't see it in camera range -- there are Israeli tanks .
There are Israeli tanks and there has been some military activity from shelling and for that reason , as you point out , we are wearing the flak jackets . [..]
MILLER : ... and despite this action in Gaza City , targeting the Foreign Ministry building that is all but gutted at this hour , militants in Gaza today did continue to launch rockets from the northern part of the strip , over the border into nearby Israeli towns and ... whoa !
We just go fired at .
That 's the end of this [ broadcast ] , I think .
I do n't know if you guys can still hear us .
HOST : Go ...
Do what you need to do .
MILLER : I guess we 're still on the satellite here .
HOST : David , do what you need to do to be ...
MILLER : someone ... fire at us .
HOST : Where ...
Where ...
MILLER : Yes ?
HOST : [ unintelligible ]
MILLER :
You see the camera shot do n't you guys ?
HOST : Right .
Get into a safe place .
MILLER : I think ...
It sounded ...
Yeah , we 're actually hunkered down behind our vehicle ... it 's difficult to ascertain who fired that shot .
A single shot but ...
HOST : It 's ok .
MILLER : Oh , someone 's firing .
I think we are going to boogie out of here .
I ... but as we do that -- before we just rush into the car , we do n't want to make any sudden movements here .
We 're going to get into the vehicle guys .
HOST : Ok .
Hold on ...
David , David , get in the car .
Get in the car .
Go .
We 'll come back to you later .
MILLER : We 're going to get into the vehicle guys .
Get in the vehicle ...
We 're in the ...
You know ...
Ok , it 's difficult to tell who 's firing at us .
Again , I do n't know if we 're still up on the satellite .
HOST : David , is that an armored car ?
MILLER : Overhead we can , over ...
We 're in an armored car .
That affords us a great degree of protection .
Another concern that we do have in this location , is that overhead , we can hear off in the distance -- again , it 's difficult to ascertain how far in the distance -- an Israeli drone aircraft .
And it is from those aircraft that the Israelis have launched a number of airstrikes .
So , that is an additional concern that we have broadcasting from this location .
So , again , I do n't know how far away that gun fire was .
If it was Israeli gunfire it 's difficult for us to say .
It could just be someone with a weapon .
For the most part , the area we 're talking to you from is deserted .
We still have that camera picture up and there is no one in sight here in front of us .
The road is complete empty the buildings are abandoned .
On the left side of your screen , just out of camera range , is one of the abandoned Israeli settlements .
There is absolutely no one , no one that we can detect .
So , at this time what I 'd like to do is communicate with my photographer and see if we can get him to safety ....
Pierre , are we going to get in the vehicle here and very slowly but deliberately leave the area .
Ok , that said ...
We still hear shots ...
We 're going to take our camera down , guys , and we 're going to talk to you from a safer position .
We 're going to go .
HOST : Ok .
An Interview with A. Stepanov
Question :
May you introduce yourself ?
Answer :
I was born in Moscow , USSR , on November 16 , 1950 , and studied Mathematics at the Moscow State University .
But I never became a mathematician .
I could not really get excited about Tamagawa numbers , Coxeter groups and other things that I was supposed to specialize in .
Hardy 's hope that his mathematics is never going to be applied is not for me .
I need to do something a little bit more real .
I was fortunate , however , to see some great mathematicians at work and became totally immune to a pseudo - mathematical rigor that unfortunately is so common in Computer Science .
So becoming a programmer was a really good thing for me .
In 1972 I became a member of a team developing a new minicomputer to be used to control large hydroelectric power stations .
I participated in all parts of the design , from architecture and hardware testing to OS ( my first published paper was on real - time operating systems ) and programming tools .
I learned first hand about both software reliability - power stations are hard to reboot - and efficiency - the water is coming down in real time .
At that time I also discovered books of two great computer scientists from whose work I learned the scientific foundation of my trade : Donald Knuth and Edsger Dijkstra .
Knuth taught me the answers .
Dijkstra taught me the questions .
Time and time again I come back to their works for new insights .
My next important career step was spending 5 years at the Computer Science Branch of General Electric Research Center in Schenectady , NY .
I worked on a very high level language called Tecton and read a lot : from a plethora of papers on programming language design to Logical Summa of William of Occam - Aristotle and medieval logicians knew a lot about different kinds of logical structures that appear in the natural languages and their formal properties .
At that time I started a fruitful research collaboration with Dave Musser which is still going on .
In 1984 I became an assistant professor at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn , NY .
Teaching Computer Science did me a lot of good - I managed to teach all kinds of graduate courses , learning a lot of new material in the process .
I also developed a large library of algorithms and data structures in Scheme .
This work led to a development ( together with Dave Musser ) of Ada Generic Library .
After a brief stint at Bell Labs , where I worked on a library of algorithms in C++ , I moved to HP Labs in Palo Alto ( 1988 ) .
I spent the next 4 years working on storage systems : I had to learn how to program disk controllers .
In 1993 I was given a brief opportunity to return to my research on generic programming .
STL is a result of this .
In 1995 I moved on to Silicon Graphics , where I have been trying to establish a group to work on further development of STL .
At that time I also discovered books of two great computer scientists from whose work I learned the scientific foundation of my trade : Donald Knuth and Edsger Dijkstra .
Knuth taught me the answers .
Dijkstra taught me the questions .

Question :
You mentioned William of Occam .
William of Occam used to say " Entia non sunt multiplicanda " - I could translate that as " [ abstract ] objects are unnecessary " .
It seems that you have applied the razor of Occam to OOP .
Starting from algorithms rather than from objects kinds of reminds me the medieval quarrel on universals .
Is it right ?
Answer :
It is a pretty analogy , but I do not think it is right .
I never thought of OO as related to a realist philosophy and I am not a nominalist at all .
As a matter of fact , the Franciscan school : Alexander of Hales , Bonaventure and Scotus are much closer to Augustinian / Platonist tradition .
Occam was a strange fellow anyways .
As the editor of his Opera Omnia Gideon Gal used to say : " But the fellow was really mad ! "
Question :
For most Italian readers , the name " Stepanov " goes in pair with STL .
Does STL mean Standard Template Library or Stepanov and Lee ?
And what was the role of D.Musser and A.Koenig in STL history ?
Answer :
Well , it does really mean Standard Template Library .
I did make a joke in my interview with Dr. Dobb 's journal about STL standing for " Stepanov and Lee , " but it was a joke .
I have been collaborating with Dave Musser for almost 20 years .
Our collaboration has been so close that it is difficult to say who contributed what .
His is not on the list of the official STL authors only because in the short period of time when the proposal for the standard had to been written , he was busy doing something else .
Andy Koenig is responsible for explaining to me the structure of the abstract C machine .
STL , in a sense , is an application of generic programming techniques that Dave Musser and I have been developing to a C machine model .
If it were not for Andy , I would be still dealing with boxed , heap - allocated objects and pining for garbage collection .
And , of course , Andy and Bjarne Stroustrup are responsible for putting STL into the standard .
Meng Lee was a perfect collaborator at the stage when it was necessary to move from beautiful ideas to a complete implementation .
She kept me focused - I tend to lose interest after the problem is solved - if I know the solution , why bother making it known to the rest of the world .
She was putting grueling hours into the code and the document .
In a sense , she was the only person who believed that something practical could come out of the stuff ; I think , that at that point both Dave Musser and I actually lost hope that we could explain to anybody what we had been doing for quite a while .
Question :
What is the origin of STL ?
Has STL been conceived to be what it is now , that is " the " C++ Standard Library , or does it come from some other project ?
Could you tell us a history of STL ?
Answer :
In 1976 , still back in the USSR , I got a very serious case of food poisoning from eating raw fish .
While in the hospital , in the state of delirium , I suddenly realized that the ability to add numbers in parallel depends on the fact that addition is associative .
( So , putting it simply , STL is the result of a bacterial infection . )
In other words , I realized that a parallel reduction algorithm is associated with a semigroup structure type .
That is the fundamental point : algorithms are defined on algebraic structures .
It took me another couple of years to realize that you have to extend the notion of structure by adding complexity requirements to regular axioms .
And than it took 15 years to make it work .
( I am still not sure that I have been successful in getting the point across to anybody outside the small circle of my friends . )
I believe that iterator theories are as central to Computer Science as theories of rings or Banach spaces are central to Mathematics .
Every time I would look at an algorithm I would try to find a structure on which it is defined .
So what I wanted to do was to describe algorithms generically .
That 's what I like to do .
I can spend a month working on a well known algorithm trying to find its generic representation .
So far , I have been singularly unsuccessful in explaining to people that this is an important activity .
But , somehow , the result of the activity - STL - became quite successful .
Question :
I used to think at complexity requirements in STL as mere constraints on the efficiency of the implementation .
You seem to imply that complexity is a true functional requirement .
Is it so ?
Answer :
You select different algorithms depending on complexity of the fundamental operations provided by the data structure .
Disk and tape are functionally equivalent as SCSI storage devices , but woe to the software designer who would attempt to use the tape as if it were a disk .
In terms of STL - you can always implement p + n for forward iterators , so why bother providing random access iterators ?
Question :
What about Generic Programming ?
I only found some columns by A.Koenig in JOOP on " generic programming " .
Generic programming is definitively absent in most C++ programming books , including Coplien , Meyer , Stroustrup , Lippman and so on .
I think STL could be described as " Programming C++ the way you would never thought possible " .
Do you agree ?
Answer :
STL , at least for me , represents the only way programming is possible .
It is , indeed , quite different from C++ programming as it was presented and still is presented in most textbooks .
But , you see , I was not trying to program in C++ , I was trying to find the right way to deal with software .
I have been searching for a language in which I could express what I wanted to say for a long time .
In other words , I know what I want to say .
I can say it in C++ , I can say it in Ada , I can say it in Scheme .
I adapt myself to the language , but the essence of what I am trying to say is language independent .
So far , C++ is the best language I 've discovered to say what I want to say .
It is not the ideal medium , but I can do more in it than in any other language I tried .
It is actually my hope that someday there will be a language designed specifically with generic programming in mind .
Question :
Could you explain to a modest C++ programmer what Generic Programming is , what is the relation of Generic Programming with C++ and STL , and how did you come to use Generic Programming in a C++ context ?
Answer :
Generic programming is a programming method that is based in finding the most abstract representations of efficient algorithms .
That is , you start with an algorithm and find the most general set of requirements that allows it to perform and to perform efficiently .
The amazing thing is that many different algorithms need the same set of requirements and there are multiple implementations of these requirements .
The analogous fact in mathematics is that many different theorems depend on the same set of axioms and there are many different models of the same axioms .
Abstraction works !
Generic programming assumes that there are some fundamental laws that govern the behavior of software components and that it is possible to design interoperable modules based on these laws .
It is also possible to use the laws to guide our software design .
STL is an example of generic programming .
C++ is a language in which I was able to produce a convincing example .
Question :
I think STL and Generic Programming mark a definite departure from the common C++ programming style , which I find is almost completely derived from SmallTalk .
Do you agree ?
Answer :
Yes .
STL is not object oriented .
I think that object orientedness is almost as much of a hoax as Artificial Intelligence .
I have yet to see an interesting piece of code that comes from these OO people .
In a sense , I am unfair to AI : I learned a lot of stuff from the MIT AI Lab crowd , they have done some really fundamental work : Bill Gosper 's Hakmem is one of the best things for a programmer to read .
AI might not have had a serious foundation , but it produced Gosper and Stallman ( Emacs ) , Moses ( Macsyma ) and Sussman ( Scheme , together with Guy Steele ) .
I find OOP technically unsound .
It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type .
To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras - families of interfaces that span multiple types .
I find OOP philosophically unsound .
It claims that everything is an object .
Even if it is true it is not very interesting - saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all .
I find OOP methodologically wrong .
It starts with classes .
It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms .
You do not start with axioms - you start with proofs .
Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs , can you come up with axioms .
You end with axioms .
The same thing is true in programming : you have to start with interesting algorithms .
Only when you understand them well , can you come up with an interface that will let them work .
Question :
Can I summarize your thinking as " find the [ generic ] data structure inside an algorithm " instead of " find the [ virtual ] algorithms inside an object " ?
Answer :
Yes .
Always start with algorithms .
Question :
This mean a radical change of mind from both imperative and OO thinking .
What are the benefits , and the drawbacks , of this paradigm compared to the " standard " OO programming of SmallTalk or , say , Java ?
Answer :
max .
I do not know how it can be done .
Using generic programming I can write : template < class StrictWeakOrdered > inline StrictWeakOrdered& max ( StrictWeakOrdered& x , StrictWeakOrdered& y ) { return x < y ? y : x ; } and template < class StrictWeakOrdered > inline const StrictWeakOrdered& max ( const StrictWeakOrdered& x , const StrictWeakOrdered& y ) { return x < y ? y : x ; } My approach works , theirs does not work .
Try to implement a simple thing in the object oriented way , say , .
I do not know how it can be done .
Using generic programming I can write : ( you do need both & and const & ) .
And then I define what strict weak ordered means .
Try doing it in Java .
You can't write a generic max ( ) in Java that takes two arguments of some type and has a return value of that same type .
Inheritance and interfaces do n't help .
And if they cannot implement max or swap or linear search , what chances do they have to implement really complex stuff ?
These are my litmus tests : if a language allows me to implement max and swap and linear search generically - then it has some potential .

Question :
Java is a very new language , still it lacks templates , so it prevents using Generic Programming .
Everything must be a class .
What do you think of Java ?
Answer :
I spent several months programming in Java .
Contrary to its authors prediction , it did not grow on me .
I did not find any new insights - for the first time in my life programming in a new language did not bring me new insights .
It keeps all the stuff that I never use in C++ - inheritance , virtuals - OO gook - and removes the stuff that I find useful .
It might be successful - after all , MS DOS was - and it might be a profitable thing for all your readers to learn Java , but it has no intellectual value whatsoever .
Look at their implementation of hash tables .
Look at the sorting routines that come with their " cool " sorting applet .
Try to use AWT .
The best way to judge a language is to look at the code written by its proponents .
" Radix enim omnium malorum est cupiditas " - and Java is clearly an example of a money oriented programming ( MOP ) .
As the chief proponent of Java at SGI told me : " Alex , you have to go where the money is . "
But I do not particularly want to go where the money is - it usually does not smell nice there .
Question :
Do you think template - based programming and Generic Programming will be adopted by the majority of C++ programmers , or will they be confined to STL , somewhat like manipulators , which were never used outside the iostream library ?
Answer :
I do not know .
It will take a long time before the ideas behind STL enter the mainstream .
We will know in about 10 - 15 years if anything comes out of all this .
Question :
One thing has always amazed me , is how quickly STL was adopted by the C++ standardization committees .
I mean , these committees are known to be very cautious and conservative .
How do you explain that ?
Answer :
The support of Bjarne Stroustrup was crucial .
Bjarne really wanted STL in the standard and if Bjarne wants something , he gets it .
He is as stubborn as a mule .
He even forced me to make changes in STL that I would never make for anybody else - I am also stubborn , but he is the most single minded person I know .
He gets things done .
It took him a while to understand what STL was all about , but when he did , he was prepared to push it through .
He also contributed to STL by standing up for the view that more than one way of programming was valid - against no end of flak and hype for more than a decade , and pursuing a combination of flexibility , efficiency , overloading , and type - safety in templates that made STL possible .
I would like to state quite clearly that Bjarne is the preeminent language designer of my generation .
Question :
STL is full of creative uses of templates , such as symbolic types exported from classes , or the pattern matching of a set of overloaded algorithms onto iterator tags .
Surely enough , no standard C++ Programming book speaks about those idioms .
How did you come to these C++ code idioms ?
Answer :
I knew exactly what I was trying to accomplish .
So I tweaked the language until I was able to get by .
But it took me many years to discover all the techniques .
And I had many false starts .
For example , I spent years trying to find some use for inheritance and virtuals , before I understood why that mechanism was fundamentally flawed and should not be used .
I am very happy that nobody could see all the intermediate steps - most of them were very silly .
It takes me years to come up with anything half decent .
It also helped that Bjarne was willing to put certain features in the language just to enable some of my idioms .
He once refered to it as " just in time language design . "
Question :
What do you think is the best way to teach Generic Programming and STL to C++ programmers ?
Do you think inheritance and other OO techniques should be learnt before , after or at the same time as STL ?
Answer :
I plan to teach a course on Generic Programming at SGI .
I do hope that it will lead to a book , but I am a notoriously lazy writer - I never finish papers unless I have a collaborator who does .
Question :
I have done a search on Lycos for your papers and I only found two titles : the STL manual and a resume of you presentation of STL to the standardization committee .
Answer :
Well , I am lazy , but not that lazy .
I probably published 20 papers and a book .
Many of them are on different STL sites .
( Dave Musser 's site probably has several . )
Question :
Which book ?
Answer :
The book is " The Ada Generic Library : Linear List Processing Packages " , by David R. Musser and Alexander A. Stepanov , Compass Series , Springer - Verlag , 1989 .
It is not really worth reading .
Question :
STL pushes C++ compilers to their limits .
Contemporary C++ compilers are still unable to correctly compile some STL code .
How could you develop and test STL ?
Answer :
I do have a lot of gray hair as a result of trying to compile STL .
The unfortunate reality is that a lot of code in the present implementation of STL is suboptimal because of the compiler limitations and bugs of the compilers I had to use when I was developing STL .
Fortunately , I had help from Bjarne in figuring out what certain unimplemented features are supposed to do .
It does help a lot if you can ask the language designer what a given construct really does .
Question :
How did allocators come into STL ?
What do you think of them ?
Answer :
vector < int , alloc1 > a (... ) ; vector < int , alloc2 > b(... ) ; I invented allocators to deal with Intel 's memory architecture .
They are not such a bad ideas in theory - having a layer that encapsulates all memory stuff : pointers , references , ptrdiff_t , size_t .
Unfortunately they cannot work in practice .
For example , you cannot now say : find ( a.begin ( ) , a.end ( ) , b[ 1 ] ) ; you can not now say : b [ 1 ] returns a alloc2 : : reference and not int& .
It could be a type mismatch .
It is necessary to change the way that the core language deals with references to make allocators really useful .

Question :
Could this point out a serious drawback of C++ templates ?
I can customize a class using a template argument , but different specializations are not type compatible .
Instead , different subclasses ( in OO sense ) of a class are type compatible with the root class .
Answer :
I think that the problem is deeper than that .
T* is hardwired into the language .
In general , I believe that it is necessary to design a programming language from the ground up to enable generic programming in a consistent way .
I wish that somebody would hire me to do just that .
Question :
I find two hash table implementations in the D.Musser site , and they were both working and quite smart - much smarter than hash tables commonly found in class libraries .
Why were hash tables not included into STL ?
Answer :
Politics .
They have to be in .
Our new implementation of STL does contain them .
In general , we need to develop a mechanism for adding things to STL .
After all , STL is an extensible framework , it begs to be extended .
There are many data structures that are missing , for example , singly linked lists , matrices , and graphs .
SGI is willing to lead the way in extending STL .
Question :
Are you still working on STL ?
Doing what ?
Answer :
My group at SGI , - Matt Austern , Hans Boehm and myself , - just finished a new version of STL .
It includes hash containers , thread safe memory allocation and spectacular web documentation .
SGI released it into the public domain ( http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL ) .
We hope that we will be able to keep STL growing .
Multidimensional data structures , persistence , multithreading are among the things that we plan do add .
Well , it is not clear how long we can keep doing this stuff .
There are no support from my management for any of the STL / generic programming activities .
It is very hard to explain to them why SGI should pay for extensions .
( It was equaly hard to explain it to HP management .
They canceled my project 5 months after STL was accepted into the standard . )
Question :
It seems that STL has still some drawbacks .
First , HP STL is not thread safe .
Then , templates cause a lot of code to be put into header files .
You cannot have true template libraries , nor DLLs or shared libraries of ( uninstantiated ) templates : STL is mostly a compile - time library .
The last drawback is that almost no CASE tool and no OOD methodology effectively supports Generic Programming .
For instance , no CASE tool lets you define generic functions .
Also , only the Booch notation is somewhat able to express templates , but resulting diagrams are not intuitive ( to me , at least ) .
Answer :
SGI STL is thread safe .
The acceptance of separate compilation into the standard - designed by my SGI collegues John Wilkinson , Jim Dehnert and Matt Austern solves your second problem .
It was voted into the standard , but it will take a while before there are compilers that can do separate compilation .
I do believe that separate compilation would eventually require shipping shared libraries of templates .
That was the main reason I initiated SGI work on separate compilation .
It is not that difficult to design tools that will deal with Generic Programming .
And I am quite sure that if there is some market for it , Grady Booch will change his notation to handle generic programming .
Question :
One painful thing for the C++ programmer is that standardization committees seem to be unaware of each other .
OMG has just defined a standard for distributed programming ( CORBA ) , but the mapping of CORBA to C++ is unaware of STL .
They define their own set of classes , such as Sequence < T > and CORBA :: String .
The same problem arises for ODMG and its ODMG - 93 standard for Object Databases .
Why does this happen ?
Are things going to change ?
Answer :
I am old enough to remember all the networking standards that were coming out in the seventies .
Who remembers them now ?
Question :
What could Generic Programming be in a distributed environment ?
Generic Programming is based on the idea that the compiler " knows " all possible types at compile time .
This is not realistic in a distributed environment .
Should we think at a kind of ORB integrated with a compiler ?
Or is Generic Programming simply not suited to Distributed Programming - in that case , Java would be right ?
Answer :
max : T x T -> T Generic Programming has nothing to do with run time vs. compile time .
The problem that I find with OOP is not just that it is slow , but that it does not allow me to express simplest possible algorithms .
Again , the signature of max is :
It is not expressible in Java , because the inheritance from some class or interface T changes it into : max : T' x T -> T
It is not expressible in Java , because the inheritance from some class or interfacechanges it into :
You need covariant signature transformation and an ability to obtain types from types , a notion of a virtual type if you like , a v-table containing type descriptors .

Question :
What is an iterator ?
Answer :
operator * ) .
We call it Trivial Iterator theory in our site .
In addition to the dereferencing , it has equality defined that satisfies the following axiom : i == j iff &*i == &*j
An iterator is a union of two theories .
The first theory is a theory of name ( handle , cookie , address ) .
A name is something that points to something else . ( ) .
We call it Trivial Iterator theory in our site .
In addition to the dereferencing , it has equality defined that satisfies the following axiom :
That is , two iterators are equal if and only if they point to the same object .
( Equality , of course , needs to satisfy all the standard axioms . )
The second theory is the theory of successor operation ( ++i ) with its refinements : successor - predcessor ( ++ and -- ) and addition ( ++ , -- , + and - ) with the standard axioms .
And , of course , pointer is just a model of random access iterator .

And , of course , pointer is just a model of random access iterator .
Question :
Some argue that a pointer is a way to hack any conceivable horrible and weird thing into memory .
Java and Delphi made it right when they disallowed pointers .
Answer :
Disallowing pointers that allow you to do pointer arithmetic is a good thing .
Pointer arithmetic should be allowed only where it is really allowed in C and C++ , namely , for pointers into arrays .
But disallowing pointers in general is a very silly thing .
You can not get generic swap unless you have pointers or references in the language .
Question :
" category " is an overloaded word in the C++ community .
How do you call iterator categories ?
Answer :
I often call these things concepts .
Question :
I have tried to develop a STL - like singly linked list .
But I chose not to implement the size ( ) member function , because I did not want the overhead of keeping a counter just to implement size ( ) in a constant time , as stated by the C++ CD .
Was it the right decision ?
Answer :
size ( ) used to be linear time in case of STL lists .
It was the right decision since if a user wants to keep a count it is easy to do , but usually you do not need it and it makes splice linear time ( it used to be constant ) .
But the standard committee insisted that I change it to constant time .
I had no choice .
We will have to change this requirement eventually .
Question :
I am studying how to express a tree into STL and I have some problems : every node has one father but two sons .
Moving to the father could be represented as operator -- , but I would need two different operator ++ to move to the sons .
How can iterators deal with not linear structures , such as trees o graphs ?
Answer :
Even on a sequence you have different iterators .
Reverse iterators are just one example .
Stride iterators are very important and will have to be put into STL eventually .
Question :
I must confess my ignorance .
What are stride iterators ?
Answer :
Go from i to i+5 to i+10 .
Question :
What 's the difference with random iterators ?
Answer :
Stride iterator is an iterator adaptor that takes a random access iterator range and provides a ( random access iterator ) such that ++ on it goes through a stride ( a sequence of iterator n steps apart ) .
Question :
How does this relate with the problem of traversing a tree ?
Answer :
I did not mean to say that stride iterators or reverse iterators have anything to do with tree traversal , but that there could be multiple iterator types on a data structure for different iteration orders - in case of trees pre , in and post order traversals .
Question :
A frequent dilemma for me was : should I design this function as a member function or as a generic ( global ) function ?
what has been the rationale of this decision in STL ?
Answer :
operator * was global with the default definitions : template < class T> T& operator *( T& x ) { return x;} template < class T > const T& operator *( const T& x ) { return x;}
Make it global if it at all possible .
It would be much nicer if begin and end were global - it would allow us to define them for C arrays .
It would be so much nicer ifwas global with the default definitions :
It would allow us to write : copy( 0 , 25 , ostream_iterator < int > ( "
" ) ) ;
It would allow us to write :
In general , for non-iterator objects operator * should return the object itself , the " meaning " of a non-naming thing is a thing itself .
I would even love to write constructors and destructors as global functions .
You could do some amazing stuff if this is allowed in the language .

Question :
operator * your way , and in my program I define : template < class T > class SmartPtr { T* ptr ; public : SmartPtr ( T* _ptr = 0 ) : ptr( _ptr ) {} T* operator *( ) const {return ptr;} // ... } ;
If I define a genericyour way , and in my program I define : than should n't I get ambiguity in this code : int i=0 ; SmartPtr<int > sp( &i ) ; int j= * i ; // apply SmartPtr<int >::operator * or // operator < SmartPtr<int >?
both are user defined than should n't I get ambiguity in this code :
Answer :
No , you do not .
Your definition matches better ( the unification is deeper ) than the global one .
That is what partial specialization is all about .
Question :
Now , a bunch of curiosities of mine : why does not STL have something like a " sorted container " adaptor ?
Answer :
Set is a sorted container .
Question :
Set is not an adaptor .
Why was it possible to write a heap , but not a sorted container , out of any container supporting random access iterators ?
Answer :
Remember that it was very hard to push through STL because of its size .
I had to throw away dosens of useful components .
( Think what happened to hash tables . )
Question :
Why is the function __adjust_heap in < heap .h > not documented ?
This function is necessary to use the heap in the Dijkstra algorithm .
Answer :
I had great difficulty pushing heap functions into the standard .
Originally , I wanted all auxiliary functions in STL to be visible , but it was not politically possible .
Question :
It is hard for me to figure something political about a heap functions .
Answer :
It was not any particular function , but the number of them .
Bjarne is personally responsible for reducing the number of components in STL by a factor of two .
He was trying to make it as small as possible to placate the opposition .
Question :
Have your ever been in Italy , for business or for pleasure ?
Answer :
Yes , I spent 10 days in Pisa , visited Florence and Lucca .
I dream of going to Assisi - I am a Franciscan at heart .
I cry during the second act of Tosca and the third act of La Traviata .
I keep Dante ( in Italian ! ) on my bed stand .
I love pasta , prosciutto and Chianti , - while I am a traditionalist , I look much more like John XXIII than Pius XII .
Question :
You must know Italian very well if you can read Dante in its original version : very few Italians could !
Answer :
Well , my Italian is very poor .
The way I do read Dante in Italian is by having an English translation in front of me .
I read a stanza aloud in Italian and then read the translation .
Graziano :
Thank you very much , Alex .
I hope you will be able to come to Italy and see Assisi soon , reading Dante in the old town of Assisi - maybe the most charming medieval town in Italy .

ALISO VIEJO , Calif . —
Move over , Roswell .
South Orange County is recording its own share of UFO sightings .
Several residents have reported the sightings to the Orange County Sheriff 's Department in recent months .
And word has even reached a Canadian UFO researcher who has posted information about the sightings on his Web site .
In one case , witnesses reported seeing glowing discs zigzagging through trees and hovering above the Aliso Viejo Town Center at night .
About a yard in diameter and studded with flashing lights , the four UFOs dance around one another in the night sky .
These flying saucers are n't a top - secret military project .
But they are n't being piloted by Martians , either .
The saucers are made in the garages of Gaylon Murphy and Steve Zingali , who get their kicks shocking people and hope to earn a few bucks hawking their remote - controlled saucers .
After all , a few UFO sightings can only be good for business .
" We fly them in formation .
It 's pretty funny , " said Murphy , a cardiovascular surgeon .
" People stop , people scream , one cab driver ran his car up off the road . "
Nick Peterson was stunned when he saw one of the discs fly past his girlfriend 's apartment .
" I thought , ' That ca n't be a UFO , can it ? ' " he said .
" It 's pretty weird . "
The discs are made of foam and weigh about a pound .
Each runs on a 7.4 - volt lithium battery and has a propeller .
On weekends , Murphy flies the discs in Aliso Viejo , Newport Beach , Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel .
He and Zingali , a facilities engineer , have sold four of the gizmos at $ 1,000 each and concede that their streaking light show is part hobby , part promotion .
" It 's good marketing , " he said .
The Canadian UFO
Web site , which logs oddities from supposed saucer sightings to alleged alien abductions and offers an assortment of paranormal literature , indicates that the homemade discs have captured the attention — and the imagination — of both skeptics and believers .
The discs sparked a confrontation between Murphy and Erik Strong , a manager at an Aliso Viejo restaurant and bar .
Strong said Murphy was spooking his staff by hovering his disc near the restaurant .
" It looked like something right out of a movie , a little too real , " Strong said .
" I would n't say I made the determination that they were actual UFOs , but it did pique my curiosity enough to see where it was coming from . "
Strong followed the UFOs to nearby Grand Park , where Murphy and Zingali were standing with their remote controls .
He told the pair they were going to create hysteria if they continued to fly their discs around Town Center .
Murphy told Strong he should be more concerned about his bar patrons getting rowdy .
But the restaurant manager said he had n't seen a disc since .
Murphy confessed that he had also had a few encounters with law enforcement .
He attracted some local notoriety in November when one of his saucers got stuck on the roof of a Barnes & Noble .
Murphy asked store owners if he could climb up to retrieve it , but they resisted because " they thought he was crazy , " according to the sheriff 's report .
When the deputy showed up , the store manager allowed Murphy to retrieve his toy , said Lt. Richard Paddock , police services chief for Aliso Viejo .
Paddock said deputies could n't do much about complaints .
" To my knowledge , this man has violated no law while flying this craft in Aliso Viejo , " he said .

P.S. If you are bored , you 'll get a kick out of Luxor game
" Wi - Fi is in the air , and it is a very low curb , if you will , to step up and use it , " said Mike Wolf of ABI Research , a high - technology market research company in Oyster Bay , N.Y .
This is especially true , Mr. Wolf said , because so many users do not bother to secure their networks with passwords or encryption programs .
The programs are usually shipped with customers ' wireless routers , devices that plug into an Internet connection and make access to it wireless .
Many home network owners admit that they are oblivious to piggybackers .
Some , like Marla Edwards , who think they have locked intruders out of their networks , learn otherwise .
Ms. Edwards , a junior at Baruch College in New York , said her husband recently discovered that their home network was not secure after a visiting friend with a laptop easily hopped on .
" There 's no gauge , no measuring device that says 48 people are using your access , " Ms. Edwards said .
When Mr. Wolf turns on his computer in his suburban Seattle home , he regularly sees on his screen a list of two or three wireless networks that do not belong to him but are nonetheless available for use .
Mr. Wolf uses his own wired network at home , but he says he has piggybacked onto someone else 's wireless network when traveling .
" On a family vacation this summer we needed to get access , " Mr. Wolf recalled , explaining that his father , who took along his laptop , needed to send an e-mail message to his boss on the East Coast from Ocean Shores , Wash ..
" I said , ' O.K. , let 's drive around the beach with the window open . '
We found a signal , and the owner of the network was none the wiser , " Mr. Wolf said .
" It took about five minutes . "
Jonathan Bettino , a senior product marketing manager for the Belkin Corporation , a major maker of wireless network routers based in Compton , Calif. , said home - based wireless networks were becoming a way of life .
Unless locking out unauthorized users becomes commonplace , piggybacking is likely to increase , too .
Here are 7 ways to get rid of bad breath naturally .
You can get that material easily .
Many are available in traditional markets , supermarkets , or grocery stores .
The price is also cheap .
How to make a potion to get rid of bad breath is not difficult either .
You can do it yourself as described below .
1. How to Overcome Bad Breath with Chewing Gum
You can get rid of bad breath by chewing gum .
Many shops , supermarkets , online stores that serve chewing gum .
You just choose which one , what brand , at what price .
Yes , just choose sugarless gum .
Do not taste sweet gum ( with added sugar ) .
In addition , chewing gum also tastes minty which will leave your mouth feeling fresh .
Chew sugar - free gum regularly for about 20 minutes after each chew .
Chewing gum can help produce saliva or saliva ( saliva ) .
Saliva is effective in removing bacteria from teeth .

Workers at Gemsstock believe others will copy their technique
The Gurschen glacier , nearly 3,000 m ( 10,000 ft ) above sea level , is melting like many others worldwide , with the worst damage done in summer .
The thin protective layer of foil covers an area of 3-4,000 sq m ( about 43,000 sq ft ) .
Officials at the Gemsstock resort think others may follow their lead .
" We think it will become common practice to cover parts of the glaciers , " said Urs Elmiger of Andermatt Gotthard Sportbahnen , the cable car operator carrying out the project .
Short - term measure
The Gurschen glacier has sunk 20 m ( 66 feet ) in the last 15 years , making Andermatt 's ski slopes very inaccessible .
The protection was laid over a ramp of snow that is built up at the beginning of each season but then melts again each summer .
Scientists said that while the technique might help preserve snow cover in small areas , it would not address the problem of vanishing ice fields around the world .
" It may be useful very locally , but it would be totally unfeasible - economically and ecologically - to cover completely even a small glacier , " geography Professor Wilfried Haeberli , of the University of Zurich , told Reuters .
Researchers at the university say 70 % of Switzerland 's glaciers will disappear in the next 30 years , due to the effects of global warming .
Environmental groups protested as the glacier was covered , saying a fundamental change in climate policy - not short - term measures - was required .
Martin Hiller , of the WWF International group , said : " The solution is to switch to clean energy ; we need to cut down on harmful pollutants , such as CO2 . "
Wednesday , March 14 , 2007 Before they hatch Mr. Birkhead ....
Anna Nicole Smith 's former boyfriend Larry Birkhead claims he 's the father of Smith 's baby daughter , Dannielynn – and is so confident about it , he 's already getting his home ready for her .
" I 've been putting a nursery together , so I 'm smiling , " Birkhead said Tuesday after the latest hearing in Los Angeles in a paternity battle over the 6 - month - old little girl .
" I 'm in a good mood . "
In a private session , a judge refused to grant Birkhead 's request that Smith 's companion at the time of her death , Howard K. Stern , take a paternity test .
But Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider said he would review the matter and scheduled a follow - up hearing for March 27 .
Birkhead 's lawyer , Debra Opri , said after the hearing , " Put up or shut up , that 's what we 're asking for . "
Smith died at age 39 on Feb. 8 of unknown causes and was
A number of men have claimed paternity of Dannielynn , who stands to inherit potentially tens of millions of dollars from the estate of Smith 's late husband , Texas oil tycoon J. Howard Marshal II .
At a press conference Tuesday , attorneys in the paternity dispute between Birkhead and Stern confirmed that there had been private talks in the Bahamas , but Birkhead insisted : " My daughter is not for sale .
The only discussions were over whether there will be a DNA test . "
He added that he was happy to have
" It was one of the greatest things in my life , " he said .
" It was magic . "
Stern , who is listed on the baby 's birth certificate as the father , argued that he did n't have to take a paternity test .
" Howard K . Stern is the presumed father until one of the 12 or whatever people claiming to be Dannielynn 's father can come in and prove it , " said his attorney , James Neavitt .
Paternity may ultimately be decided by a court in the Bahamas , and the issue could be put on hold while the courts sort out Smith 's will , lawyers said .
" This is going to take months , " Neavitt said .

Do n't Count Your Hens ....
A practical way to master information from Web pages is so important that new programs for this purpose keep appearing .
Those I have described in recent months ( and still like ) include Microsoft OneNote , with its attractive look and its integration with other Microsoft programs ; Zooter from Zootsoftware and ADM from Advanced Data Management , which offer extensive ways to organize data once they have been captured ; and Surf Saver from AskSam , with fast searches of stored pages .
( Unless noted , all software can be found at Web sites with the name of the company or product . )
Three more to consider are EverNote , Onfolio and Net Snippets .
In functions , they are similar .
With any of them , you can easily store a full Web page , or selected passages or any other material on your computer screen ; you can apply a label or classifying information or just send the data to a general slush pile for later review ; and you can search and reclassify the stored material at any time .
The programs are also designed for journal entries , to - do lists and anything else you may want to jot down .
All offer 30 - day free trials .
After that , basic versions of Net Snippets and Onfolio are free ; EverNote 's basic version costs $ 29.95 .
More advanced versions of each program are available at higher prices .
The programs work with most major browsers , notably Internet Explorer and Firefox , but they run on the Mac only under the Virtual PC utility .
Their differences are in style .
EverNote 's big idea is the time band , a kind of chronological ruler that runs down one side of the screen .
As each bit of information is stored , it is attached to its specific point in the great river of time .
The underlying insight , similar to the work of David Gelernter , a computer scientist at Yale , is that sequence of arrival is one of the brain 's fundamental organizing concepts .
EverNote has a variety of other unusual features , many aimed at people who take notes in handwriting on tablet computers .
Onfolio's comparative advantage is in handling feeds of R.S.S. , for really simple syndication , and other regular inflows of information .
Its professional version also has many tools for publishing the information you 've organized , in a blog or other formats .
Net Snippets , in its basic version , is the simplest of the three .
A little square icon sits on one side of the screen .
You click on it or drag information to it whenever you want to store something , which you can dig up later with a search .
I usually end up using Net Snippets , precisely because it is so easy .
But all are worth trying .
While this stage of computing has n't given us the ideal program , if offers something to appeal to most tastes .
PHYSICISTS like everything neat and tidy .
They assume that the universe must be governed by a single set of rules and are thus disturbed that , at the moment , they have to rely on two sets .
One , called quantum mechanics , describes the small , fundamental particles of which matter consists and the forces by which those particles interact .
The other , called general relativity , describes the force of gravity , which holds big objects together .
Reconciling these two universal descriptions has exercised some of physics ' most brilliant minds , but has yet to provide an uncontested result .
Until recently , the widespread expectation was that some version of an idea called string theory would prevail .
But string theory has been around for decades without delivering the goods , and that failure has encouraged the protagonists of an alternative explanation to push themselves forward .
Getting knotted
Loop quantum gravity , as this rival is known , was dreamed up in 1986 by Abhay Ashtekar , of Pennsylvania State University .
He rewrote the equations of general relativity to make them compatible with quantum mechanics .
It really took off as an alternative to string theory , though , when it was picked up by Lee Smolin , now of the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo , Ontario , and Carlo Rovelli , of the Université de la Méditerranée in France .
Together , they developed Dr Ashtekar 's idea to show that it implies that space and time are not smooth , as general relativity requires , but come in tiny , distinct chunks .
This granularity emerges from what is the most important difference between the two theories .
String theorists think that the world is made of matter that exists independently of space and time .
The matter in question consists of particles that are formed from different vibrations of “ strings ” .
( Strings are so called because they vibrate in a way that is similar , mathematically at least , to the vibrations of the strings of a musical instrument . )
According to string theory , space and time are a fixed background that has a geometric structure — an unchanging stage on which nature 's play takes place .
Loop quantum gravity is , in the jargon , background independent .
This means that theorists working on it believe the laws of nature can be stated without making any prior assumptions about the geometry of space and time .
Space and time are mere consequences of these laws .
Loop quantum gravity can be visualised , as its name suggests , as a mesh of loops .
According to its rules , it is meaningless to ask where in space and time this mesh exists , because the mesh is the stuff of which space and time are composed .
That is significant because it radically alters physicists ' understanding of reality .
Space is no longer the stage on which the pageant of existence is played out ; it becomes part of the drama .
Indeed , theorists working on loop quantum gravity think that matter itself is merely the result of twisting and braiding ribbons of space - time .
A fundamental particle is created when three ribbons are joined in a plait .
If one of the ribbons in the plait is twisted , it gives the resulting particle an electric charge .
If it is twisted in the opposite direction , the particle has the opposite charge .
And if it is twisted twice , the particle gains double the charge .
So far , the theorists have described how three of the 16 particles in the Standard Model of particle physics may be created in this way .
String theory is the more established of the two ; some 90 % of theoretical physicists are engaged in developing it .
But both it and loop quantum gravity harbour unresolved problems .
Most important , neither has been tested experimentally .
Nor , despite hopeful talk to the contrary , is there much prospect of an experiment being devised .
While particle - physics colliders and space - based observatories could rule out some of the more exotic versions of each , no one has been able to suggest a way to decide between them in general .
Having two candidates for a theory of everything is almost as upsetting to physicists as their inability to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity in the first place .
They would far rather have just one .
This could be achieved by finding which one is right and which one is wrong , by finding that both string theory and loop quantum gravity are wrong and a third theory is right , or by finding that the two theories can be unified .
Unfortunately , 20 years down the line , exactly how this may be done remains elusive .

The diamonds can be created from the carbon in human remains
But bosses at LifeGem - the first UK firm to offer to turn cremated human remains into diamonds - say it all comes down to personal choice .
The company , operating in Hove , Sussex , but with a US parent , charges up to £ 11,000 to take a sample of ashes , extract the carbon and create a " memorial " diamond .
It has already signed up its first customers , the Tandy family from Reading , Berkshire , who contacted the firm through its website .
Some people may think it morbid or gimmicky .
That is their choice , we think it 's wonderful

She said : " I miss dad every single day and I see having a part of his ashes made into a diamond as a way of keeping him close to me .
" We are not cranky people or looking for our five minutes of fame .
" We believe that this sort of thing is very personal and very personal to our family .
" Some people may think it morbid or gimmicky .
" That is their choice , we think it 's wonderful . "
Her mother , Lin , 51 , said : " Brian was only 56 when he died suddenly in his sleep .
" When Gayle first mentioned the idea I was wary but the more you think about it , the more wonderful the idea becomes .
Mr Hampson is confident LifeGem will find a market in the UK
A sample of Brian 's ashes is currently in the US undergoing the six - month process needed to create the synthetic diamond .
During that process , the company says , the ashes are heated to produce graphite which is then placed into a diamond press and subjected to high pressures .
The diamond that comes out of the press is a raw crystal that is then polished and shaped .
The company guarantees that the diamond produced comes only from the relatives ' ashes , which are dispatched by secure courier to America and given a 16 - digit tracking number .
' Personal choice '
The managing director of LifeGem in the UK , David Hampson , told BBC News Online : " It 's all about personal choice .
" Some people may think that it 's not for them and we expect a lot of people will feel like that .
" But it really is a 21st Century version of Victorian mourning jewellery , of chopping off a piece of hair and putting it in a locket .
" People visit headstones and memorials because they act as a focal point .
" This gives people a mobile focal point .
It 's something that will never have to leave their sight . "
Tim Morris , chief executive of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management , told BBC News Online : " The institute promotes choice and if this is something a bereaved person wants to do , who are we to say they should n't .
" We leave it to their discretion . "
ノー トPCユーザー必携！ 目からウロコのマルチコンセント
「 メネガレット 」
ムーンズのノー トPC用マルチコンセント「 メネガレット」。ノートPCなどのACアダプターのメガネプラグ部分に装着することで、ACコンセントを2口拡張することができる メネガレットは、ACアダプターのメガネプラグ部分に装着して使う。ACアダプターのACケーブルは、直角方向に接続する（この写真では手前右側）
筆者は仕事柄、海外や国内で開催される展示会などの取材に行き、速報レポートを書く機会も多い。東京で開催される展示会なら、基本的には自宅に戻ってから原稿を書いているが、海外や国内でも遠くの場所で開催される展示会なら、ホテルやプレスルームなどで原稿を書くことになる。
こうした場合に困るのが、ACコンセントの数が足りないことだ。最低、ノートPCのACアダプター、デジタルカメラの充電器、ケータイのACアダプターで3つは欲しいのだが、ホテルの部屋などで使えるACコンセントは1つしかない場合が多い。しかも、ACコンセントの位置も机の下など、アクセスしにくい場所にありがちだ。これまでは、ケーブル付きのテーブルタップやトリプルタップを使って、ACコンセントを増やしていたのだが、最近もっと便利なものを手に入れた。
それが、世界初のノートPC用マルチコンセント「メネガレット」（Moenegallet）である。メネガレットは、ノートPCなどのACアダプターに装着して、ACコンセントを2口拡張するための製品だ。通常のACアダプターでは、ACケーブルのコネクタとしてメガネプラグと呼ばれるプラグが採用されている。メネガレットは、このメガネプラグ部分に装着して使うことが特徴だ。メガネプラグは世界で標準的に使われている規格であり、ほとんどのACアダプターで利用できる。メガネプラグを利用してACコンセントを手元で増やすというのは、今までにありそうでなかった製品であり、まさにコロンブスの卵的というか、非常に優れたアイデアだ。
トリプルタップは、ACコンセントに装着してその場所でACコンセントを増やすため、机の下などにACコンセントがある場合、他の機器の電源コードを抜き差しするたびに、いちいちしゃがんだりする必要がある。しかし、メネガレットを使えば、手元に追加のACコンセントが確保できるので、スマートに電源コードの抜き差しが可能だ。例えば、ノートPCを利用しつつ、ケータイを充電しながら通話をするといったことも、メネガレットなら簡単だ。
メネガレットは、薄くて軽いことも利点だ。トリプルタップは、ACプラグの金属部分がむき出しになっているので、カバンなどに無造作に入れておくと他のモノを傷つけてしまう恐れがある。しかし、メネガレットなら金属部分が露出していないので、そうした心配はない。出張用のカバンなどに1つ入れておけば、きっと役に立つだろう。家庭やオフィスなどでもメネガレットを使えば、足下の電源コードを減らせるので、デスク周りがすっきりしてコードに足をひっかけるといったトラブルも防げる。
また、会議室などでACコンセントが足りないときでも、メネガレットを使えば、隣の人にACコンセントをおすそ分けしてあげられる。複数のメネガレットを利用すれば、デイジーチェーン式にACコンセントを拡張していくことも可能だが、これなどはトリプルタップではできない芸当だ。
入力端子に金メッキが施されているなど、品質にもこだわりがある。もちろん、125V/7Aの電気用品安全法（PSE）の認証も取得済みだ。
このように、ノー トPCを使いながら携帯電話やデジタルカメラのバッテリーを充電でき、ケータイをそのまま使うこともできる
メネガレットを複数使えば、デイジーチェーン（数珠繋ぎ）式に、ACコンセントを増やしていくこともできる。例えば、会議室などで大勢がノートPCを使う場合でも、それぞれのACアダプターにメネガレットが装着されていれば、ACコンセントを奪い合う必要はなくなる
「メネガレット」というちょっとユニークな製品名にも、実は秘密が隠されている。メガネプラグを利用したマルチタップを普通に設計すると、メガネプラグをストレートに出して、両サイドにACコンセントを設けるというデザインになる。しかしその場合、マルチタップ部分を小さく作ってしまうと、ACアダプター本体とタップのコンセントの位置が近くなりすぎ、タップのコンセントに別の大きなACアダプターを接続すると、ACアダプター同士が干渉してしまう可能性がある。
そこでメネガレットでは、メガネプラグの方向を90度変えてACコンセントを直角に配置させた。つまり、「メガネ」の入力と出力の方向を直角に捻って配置したので字を入れ替えて「メネガ」にし、コンセントは英語でアウトレット（outlet）と呼ばれるので、「メネガ」と「let」を繋げて「メネガレット」という造語を作ったのだそうだ。
メネガレットのサイズは55×37.3×12.5mmと小さく、重量もわずか23gしかない。常にACアダプターに装着しておいても、邪魔にならない。出張などの機会が多いヘビーモバイラーなら、メネガレットの便利さはきっと理解していただけるだろう。筆者も常に携帯しており、いろいろな場面で役に立っている。

On Bots
Contents
Introduction
In the previous edition - Binary Search Tree 2 - a large scale experiment on search engine behaviour was staged with more than two billion different web pages .
This experiment lasted exactly one year , until April 13th .
In this period the three major search engines requested more than one million pages of the tree , from more than hundred thousand different URLs .
The home page of drunkmenworkhere.org grew from 1.6 kB to over 4 MB due to the visit log and the comment spam displayed there .
This edition presents the results of the experiment .
^
Setup
2,147,483,647 web pages ( ' nodes ' ) were numbered and arranged in a binary search tree .
In such a tree , the branch to the left of each node contains only values less than the node 's value , while the right branch contains only values higher than the node 's value .
So the leftmost node in this tree has value 1 and the rightmost node has value 2,147,483,647 .
The depth of the tree is the number of nodes you have to traverse from the root to the most remote leaf .
Since you can arrange 2n+1 - 1 numbers in a tree of depth n , the resulting tree has a depth of 30 ( 231 = 2,147,483,648 ) .
The value at the root of the tree is 1073741824 ( 230 ) .
For each page the traffic of the three major search bots ( Yahoo ! Slurp , Googlebot and msnbot ) was monitored over a period of one year ( between 2005 - 4- 13 and 2006 - 4-13 ) .
To make the content of each page more interesting for the search engines , the value of each node is written out in American English ( short scale ) and each page request from a search bot is displayed in reversed chronological order .
To enrich the zero - content even more , a comment box was added to each page ( it was removed on 2006 - 4 - 13 ) .
These measures were improvements over the initial Binary Search Tree which uses inconvenient long URLs .
Every node shows an image of three trees .
Each tree in the image visualises which nodes are crawled by each search engine .
Each line in the image represents a node , the number of times a search bot visited the node determines the length of the line .
The tree images below are modified large versions of the original image , without the very long root node and with disconnected ( wild ) branches .

Overall results
From the start Yahoo !
Slurp was by far the most active search bot .
In one year it requested more than one million pages and crawled more than hundred thousand different nodes .
Although this is a large number , it still is only 0.0049 % of all nodes .
The overall statistics of all bots is shown in the table below .
overall statistics by search engine Yahoo !
Google MSN total number of pageviews 1,030,396 20,633 4,699 number of nodes crawled 105,971 7,556 1,390 percentage of tree crawled 0.0049 % 0.00035 % 0.000065 % number of indexed nodes 120,000 554 1 indexed / crawled ratio 113.23 % 7.33 % 0.07 %
The growth of the number of pageviews and the number of crawled nodes over the year the experiment lasted , is shown in figure 1 and 2 .
The way the bots crawled the tree is visualised in detail with the animations for each bot in the sections below .
Fig. 1 - The cumulative number of pageviews by the search bots in time .
Fig. 2 - The cumulative number of nodes crawled by the search bots in time .
The graph below ( fig. 3 ) shows how many nodes of each level of the tree were crawled by the bots ( on a logarithmic scale ) .
The root of the tree is at level 0 , while the most remote nodes ( e.g. node 1 ) are at level 30 .
Since there are 2n nodes at level n ( there is only 1 root and there are 230 nodes at level 30 ) crawling the entire tree would result in a straight line .
Fig. 3 - The number of nodes crawled after 1 year , grouped by node level .
Google closely follows this straight line , until it breaks down after level 12 .
Most nodes at level 12 or less were crawled ( 5524 out of 8191 ) , but only very few nodes at higher levels were crawled by Googlebot .
MSN shows similar behaviour , but breaks down much earlier , at level 9 ( 656 out of 1023 nodes were crawled ) .
Yahoo , however , does not break down .
At high levels it gradually fails to request all nodes .
The nodes at high levels that were crawled by Yahoo , were requested quite often compared to the other bots : at level 14 to 30 each page was requested 10 times at average ( see fig . 4 ) .
Fig. 4 - The average number of pageviews per node after 1 year , grouped by node level .

Yahoo !
Slurp
Fig. 5 - The Yahoo !
Slurp tree .
Yahoo !
Slurp was the first search engine to discover Binary Search Tree 2 .
In the first hours after discovery it crawled the tree vigorously , at a speed of over 2.3 nodes per second ( see the short animation ) .
The first day it crawled approximately 30,000 nodes .
In the following month Slurp 's activity was low , but after exactly one month it requested all pages it visited before , for the second time .
In the animation you can see the size of the tree double on 2005 - 05 - 14 .
This phenomenon is repeated a month later : on 2005 - 06 - 13 the tree grows to three times it original size .
The number of pageviews is then almost 90,000 while the number of crawled nodes still is 30,000 .
Figure 6 shows this stepwise increment in the number of pageviews during the first months .
Fig. 6 - The cumulative number of pageviews by Yahoo !
Slurp in time .
After four months Slurp requested a large number of ' new ' nodes , for the first time since the initial round .
It simply requested all URLs it had .
Since it had already indexed 30,000 pages , that each link to two pages at a deeper level , it requested 60,000 pages at the end of August ( the number of pageviews jumps from 100,000 to 160,000 pages in fig .
6 ) and it doubled the number of nodes it had crawled ( see the fig . 7 ) .
After 5 months Yahoo !
Slurp started requesting nodes more regularly .
It still had periods of ' discovery ' ( e.g. after 10 months ) .
Fig. 7 - The cumulative number of nodes crawled by Yahoo !
Slurp in time .
Yahoo reported 120,000 pages in it 's index ( current value ) .
This may seem impossible since it only visited 105,971 nodes , but every node is available on two different domain names : www.drunkmenworkhere.org and drunkmenworkhere.org .
Note : the query submitted to Google and MSN yielded 35,600 pages on Yahoo .
Yahoo is the only search engine that returns results with the query used above .
^
Googlebot
Fig. 8 - The Googlebot tree .
In comparison with Yahoo's tree , Google 's tree looks more like a natural tree .
This is because Google visited nodes at deeper levels less frequently than their parent nodes .
Yahoo only visited the nodes at the first three levels more frequently , while Google did so for the first 12 levels ( see fig . 4 ) .
The form of the tree follows from Google 's PageRank algorithm .
PageRank is defined as follows :
" We assume page A has pages T1 ... Tn which point to it ( i.e. , are citations ) .
The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1 .
We usually set d to 0.85 .
There are more details about d in the next section .
Also C( A ) is defined as the number of links going out of page A . The PageRank of a page A is given as follows :
PR ( A ) = ( 1 -d ) + d ( PR ( T1 ) / C( T1 ) + ... + PR ( Tn ) /C( Tn ) ) "
Since most nodes in the tree are not linked to by other sites , the PageRank of a node can be calculated with this formula ( ignoring links in the comments ) :
PR ( node ) = 0.15 + 0.85 ( PR ( parent ) + PR ( left child ) + PR ( right child ) ) /
3
The only unknown when applying this formula iteratively , is the PageRank of the root node of the tree .
Since this node was the homepage of drunkmenworkhere.org for a year , a high rank may be assumed .
The calculated PageRank tree ( fig. 9 ) shows similar proportions as Googlebot 's real tree , so the frequency of visiting a page seems to be related to the PageRank of a page .
Fig. 9 - A binary tree of depth 17 visualising calculated PageRank as length of each line , when the PageRank of the root node is set to 100 .
The animation of the Googlebot tree shows some interesting erratic behaviour , that cannot be explained with PageRank .
The rightmost branch From the start Googlebot crawled more nodes on the right hand side of the tree .
On 2005 - 07 - 04 it tries to visit the rightmost node , i.e. the node with the highest value .
After selecting the right branch starting at the root for 20 levels Googlebot stopped .
This produced the arc at the right end of the tree .
Searching node 1
On 2005 - 06 - 30 Googlebot visited node 1 , the leftmost node .
It did not crawl the path from the root to this node , so how did it find the page ?
Did it guess the URL or did it follow some external link ?
A few hours later , Googlebot crawled node 2 , which is linked as a parent node by node 1 .
These two nodes are displayed as a tiny dot in the animation on 2005 - 06 - 30 , floating above the left branch .
Then , a week later , on 2005 - 07 - 06 ( two days after the attempt to find rightmost node ) , between 06:39:39 and 06:39:59 Googlebot finds the path to these disconnected nodes by visiting the 24 missing nodes in 20 seconds .
It started at the root and found it 's way up to node 2 , without selecting a right branch .
In the large version of the Googlebot tree , this path is clearly visible .
The nodes halfway the path were not requested for a second time and are represented by thin short line segments , hence the steep curve .
Yahoo - like subtree On 2005 - 07 - 23 Google suddenly spends some hours crawling 600 new nodes near node 1073872896 .
Most of these nodes were not visited ever again .
This subtree is the reason the number of nodes crawled by Googlebot , grouped by level , increases again from level 18 to level 30 in fig .
3 .
Over the last six months Googlebot requested pages at a fixed rate ( about 260 pages per month , fig . 10 ) .
Like Yahoo !
Slurp it seems to alternate between periods of discovery ( see fig .
11 ) and periods of refreshing it 's cache .
Fig .
10 - The cumulative number of pageviews by Googlebot in time .
Fig .
11 - The cumulative number of nodes crawled by Googlebot in time .
Google returned 554 results when searching for nodes .
The first nodes reported by Google are node 1 and 2 , which are very deep inside the tree at level 29 and 30 .
Their higher rank is also reflected in the curve shown above ( Searching node 1 ) , which indicates a high number of pageviews .
They probably appear first because of their short URLs .
The other nodes at the first result page are all at level 4 , probably because the first three levels are penalised because of comment spam .
The current number of results can be checked here .
^
MSNbot
Fig .
12 - The msnbot tree
The Msnbot tree is much smaller than Yahoo's and Google's .
The most interesting feature is the disconnected large branch to the right of the tree .
It appears on 2005 - 04 - 29 , when msnbot visits node 2045877824 .
This node contains one comment , posted two weeks before :
I hereby claim this name in the name of ... well , mine .
Paul Pigg .
A week before msnbot requested this node , Googlebot already visited this node .
This random node at level 24 was crawled because of a link from Paul Pigg 's website masterpigg.com ( now dead , Google cache ) .
All three search engines visited the node via this link , and all three failed to connect it to the rest of the tree .
You can check this by clicking the ' to trunk ' links starting at node 2045877824 .
Msnbot crawled from the disconnected node in upward and downward direction , creating a large subtree .
This subtree caused the upward line between level 18 and 30 in figure 3 .
The second large disconnected branch , at the top in the middle , originated from a link on uu-dot.com .
Both disconnected branches are clearly visible in the Googlebot tree as well .
Fig .
13 - The cumulative number of pageviews by msnbot in time .
Fig .
14 - The cumulative number of nodes crawled by msnbot in time .
As the graphs above show , msnbot virtually ceased to crawl Binary Search Tree 2 after five months .
How the number of results MSN Search returns , relates to the above graphs is unclear .

Spam bots
In one year 5265 comments were posted to 103 different nodes .
32 of these nodes were never visited by any of the search bots .
Most comments ( 3652 ) were posted to the root node ( the home page ) .
The word frequency of the submitted comments was calculated .

July 2006
I 've discovered a handy test for figuring out what you 're addicted to .
Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend 's house on a little island off the coast of Maine .
There are no shops on the island and you wo n't be able to leave while you 're there .
Also , you 've never been to this house before , so you can't assume it will have more than any house might .
What , besides clothes and toiletries , do you make a point of packing ?
That 's what you 're addicted to .
For example , if you find yourself packing a bottle of vodka ( just in case ) , you may want to stop and think about that .
For me the list is four things : books , earplugs , a notebook , and a pen .
There are other things I might bring if I thought of it , like music , or tea , but I can live without them .
I 'm not so addicted to caffeine that I would n't risk the house not having any tea , just for a weekend .
Quiet is another matter .
I realize it seems a bit eccentric to take earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine .
If anywhere should be quiet , that should .
But what if the person in the next room snored ?
What if there was a kid playing basketball ?
( Thump , thump , thump ... thump . )
Why risk it ?
Earplugs are small .
Sometimes I can think with noise .
If I already have momentum on some project , I can work in noisy places .
I can edit an essay or debug code in an airport .
But airports are not so bad : most of the noise is whitish .
I could n't work with the sound of a sitcom coming through the wall , or a car in the street playing thump - thump music .
And of course there 's another kind of thinking , when you 're starting something new , that requires complete quiet .
You never know when this will strike .
It 's just as well to carry plugs .
The notebook and pen are professional equipment , as it were .
Though actually there is something druglike about them , in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better .
I hardly ever go back and read stuff I write down in notebooks .
It 's just that if I can't write things down , worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next .
Pen and paper wick ideas .
The best notebooks I 've found are made by a company called Miquelrius .
I use their smallest size , which is about 2.5 x 4 in .
The secret to writing on such narrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space , like a Latin inscription .
I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints , partly because their gluey ink does n't seep through pages , and partly so I do n't worry about losing them .
I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago .
Before that I used whatever scraps of paper I could find .
But the problem with scraps of paper is that they 're not ordered .
In a notebook you can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages around it .
In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I 'd written years before that might say something I needed to remember , if I could only figure out what .
As for books , I know the house would probably have something to read .
On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of them , because I find new books to read en route .
Really bringing books is insurance .
I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good — that what I need them for is distraction .
The books I bring on trips are often quite virtuous , the sort of stuff that might be assigned reading in a college class .
But I know my motives are n't virtuous .
I bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be able to slip into another distilled by some writer .
It 's like eating jam when you know you should be eating fruit .
There is a point where I 'll do without books .
I was walking in some steep mountains once , and decided I 'd rather just think , if I was bored , rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce .
It was n't so bad .
I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead of reading other people 's .
If you stop eating jam , fruit starts to taste better .
So maybe I 'll try not bringing books on some future trip .
They 're going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold , dead ears , however .

ExxonMobil is the world 's most profitable corporation .
Its sales now amount to more than $ 1bn a day .
It makes most of this money from oil , and has more to lose than any other company from efforts to tackle climate change .
To safeguard its profits , ExxonMobil needs to sow doubt about whether serious action needs to be taken on climate change .
But there are difficulties : it must confront a scientific consensus as strong as that which maintains that smoking causes lung cancer or that HIV causes Aids .
So what 's its strategy ?
The website Exxonsecrets.org , using data found in the company 's official documents , lists 124 organisations that have taken money from the company or work closely with those that have .
These organisations take a consistent line on climate change : that the science is contradictory , the scientists are split , environmentalists are charlatans , liars or lunatics , and if governments took action to prevent global warming , they would be endangering the global economy for no good reason .
The findings these organisations dislike are labelled " junk science " .
The findings they welcome are labelled " sound science " .
Among the organisations that have been funded by Exxon are such well - known websites and lobby groups as TechCentralStation , the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation .
Some of those on the list have names that make them look like grassroots citizens ' organisations or academic bodies : the Centre for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change , for example .
One or two of them , such as the Congress of Racial Equality , are citizens ' organisations or academic bodies , but the line they take on climate change is very much like that of the other sponsored groups .
While all these groups are based in America , their publications are read and cited , and their staff are interviewed and quoted , all over the world .
By funding a large number of organisations , Exxon helps to create the impression that doubt about climate change is widespread .
For those who do not understand that scientific findings cannot be trusted if they have not appeared in peer - reviewed journals , the names of these institutes help to suggest that serious researchers are challenging the consensus .
This is not to claim that all the science these groups champion is bogus .
On the whole , they use selection , not invention .
They will find one contradictory study - such as the discovery of tropospheric cooling , which , in a garbled form , has been used by Peter Hitchens in the Mail on Sunday - and promote it relentlessly .
They will continue to do so long after it has been disproved by further work .
So , for example , John Christy , the author of the troposphere paper , admitted in August 2005 that his figures were incorrect , yet his initial findings are still being circulated and championed by many of these groups , as a quick internet search will show you .
But they do not stop there .
The chairman of a group called the Science and Environmental Policy Project is Frederick Seitz .
Seitz is a physicist who in the 1960s was president of the US National Academy of Sciences .
In 1998 , he wrote a document , known as the Oregon Petition , which has been cited by almost every journalist who claims that climate change is a myth .
The document reads as follows : " We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto , Japan , in December 1997 , and any other similar proposals .
The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment , hinder the advance of science and technology , and damage the health and welfare of mankind .
There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide , methane , or other greenhouse gases is causing or will , in the foreseeable future , cause catastrophic heating of the Earth 's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth 's climate .
Moreover , there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth . "
Anyone with a degree was entitled to sign it .
It was attached to a letter written by Seitz , entitled Research Review of Global Warming Evidence .
The lead author of the " review " that followed Seitz 's letter is a Christian fundamentalist called Arthur B Robinson .
He is not a professional climate scientist .
It was co-published by Robinson 's organisation - the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine - and an outfit called the George C Marshall Institute , which has received $ 630,000 from ExxonMobil since 1998 .
The other authors were Robinson 's 22 - year - old son and two employees of the George C Marshall Institute .
The chairman of the George C Marshall Institute was Frederick Seitz .
The paper maintained that : " We are living in an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals as a result of the carbon dioxide increase .
Our children will enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life than that with which we now are blessed .
This is a wonderful and unexpected gift from the Industrial Revolution . "
It was printed in the font and format of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences : the journal of the organisation of which Seitz - as he had just reminded his correspondents - was once president .
Soon after the petition was published , the National Academy of Sciences released this statement : " The NAS Council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the National Academy of Sciences and that the manuscript was not published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences or in any other peer - reviewed journal .
The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy . "
But it was too late .
Seitz , the Oregon Institute and the George C Marshall Institute had already circulated tens of thousands of copies , and the petition had established a major presence on the internet .
Some 17,000 graduates signed it , the majority of whom had no background in climate science .
It has been repeatedly cited - by global - warming sceptics such as David Bellamy , Melanie Phillips and others - as a petition by climate scientists .
It is promoted by the Exxon - sponsored sites as evidence that there is no scientific consensus on climate change .
All this is now well known to climate scientists and environmentalists .
But what I have discovered while researching this issue is that the corporate funding of lobby groups denying that manmade climate change is taking place was initiated not by Exxon , or by any other firm directly involved in the fossil fuel industry .
It was started by the tobacco company Philip Morris .
In December 1992 , the US Environmental Protection Agency published a 500 - page report called Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking .
It found that " the widespread exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) in the United States presents a serious and substantial public health impact .
In adults : ETS is a human lung carcinogen , responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths annually in US non-smokers .
In children : ETS exposure is causally associated with an increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia .
This report estimates that 150,000 to 300,000 cases annually in infants and young children up to 18 months of age are attributable to ETS . "
Had it not been for the settlement of a major class action against the tobacco companies in the US , we would never have been able to see what happened next .
But in 1998 they were forced to publish their internal documents and post them on the internet .
Within two months of its publication , Philip Morris , the world 's biggest tobacco firm , had devised a strategy for dealing with the passive - smoking report .
In February 1993 Ellen Merlo , its senior vice - president of corporate affairs , sent a letter to William I Campbell , Philip Morris 's chief executive officer and president , explaining her intentions : " Our overriding objective is to discredit the EPA report ...
Concurrently , it is our objective to prevent states and cities , as well as businesses , from passive - smoking bans . "
To this end , she had hired a public relations company called APCO .
She had attached the advice it had given her .
APCO warned that : " No matter how strong the arguments , industry spokespeople are , in and of themselves , not always credible or appropriate messengers . "
So the fight against a ban on passive smoking had to be associated with other people and other issues .
Philip Morris , APCO said , needed to create the impression of a " grassroots " movement - one that had been formed spontaneously by concerned citizens to fight " overregulation " .
It should portray the danger of tobacco smoke as just one " unfounded fear " among others , such as concerns about pesticides and cellphones .
APCO proposed to set up " a national coalition intended to educate the media , public officials and the public about the dangers of ' junk science ' .
Coalition will address credibility of government 's scientific studies , risk - assessment techniques and misuse of tax dollars ...
Upon formation of Coalition , key leaders will begin media outreach , eg editorial board tours , opinion articles , and brief elected officials in selected states . "
APCO would found the coalition , write its mission statements , and " prepare and place opinion articles in key markets " .
For this it required $ 150,000 for its own fees and $ 75,000 for the coalition 's costs .
By May 1993 , as another memo from APCO to Philip Morris shows , the fake citizens ' group had a name : the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition .
It was important , further letters stated , " to ensure that TASSC has a diverse group of contributors " ; to " link the tobacco issue with other more ' politically correct ' products " ; and to associate scientific studies that cast smoking in a bad light with " broader questions about government research and regulations " - such as " global warming " , " nuclear waste disposal " and " biotechnology " .
APCO would engage in the " intensive recruitment of high - profile representatives from business and industry , scientists , public officials , and other individuals interested in promoting the use of sound science " .
By September 1993 , APCO had produced a " Plan for the Public Launching of TASSC " .
The media launch would not take place in " Washington , DC or the top media markets of the country .
Rather , we suggest creating a series of aggressive , decentralised launches in several targeted local and regional markets across the country .
This approach ... avoids cynical reporters from major media : less reviewing / challenging of TASSC messages . "
The media coverage , the public relations company hoped , would enable TASSC to " establish an image of a national grassroots coalition " .
In case the media asked hostile questions , APCO circulated a sheet of answers , drafted by Philip Morris .
The first question was :
" Is n't it true that Philip Morris created TASSC to act as a front group for it ?
" A : No , not at all .
As a large corporation , PM belongs to many national , regional , and state business , public policy , and legislative organisations .
PM has contributed to TASSC , as we have with various groups and corporations across the country . "
There are clear similarities between the language used and the approaches adopted by Philip Morris and by the organisations funded by Exxon .
The two lobbies use the same terms , which appear to have been invented by Philip Morris 's consultants .
" Junk science " meant peer - reviewed studies showing that smoking was linked to cancer and other diseases .
" Sound science " meant studies sponsored by the tobacco industry suggesting that the link was inconclusive .
Both lobbies recognised that their best chance of avoiding regulation was to challenge the scientific consensus .
As a memo from the tobacco company Brown and Williamson noted , " Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ' body of fact ' that exists in the mind of the general public .
It is also the means of establishing a controversy . "
Both industries also sought to distance themselves from their own campaigns , creating the impression that they were spontaneous movements of professionals or ordinary citizens : the " grassroots " .
But the connection goes further than that .
TASSC , the " coalition " created by Philip Morris , was the first and most important of the corporate - funded organisations denying that climate change is taking place .
It has done more damage to the campaign to halt it than any other body .
TASSC did as its founders at APCO suggested , and sought funding from other sources .
Between 2000 and 2002 it received $ 30,000 from Exxon .
The website it has financed - JunkScience.com - has been the main entrepot for almost every kind of climate - change denial that has found its way into the mainstream press .
It equates environmentalists with Nazis , communists and terrorists .
It flings at us the accusations that could justifably be levelled against itself : the website claims , for example , that it is campaigning against " faulty scientific data and analysis used to advance special and , often , hidden agendas " .
I have lost count of the number of correspondents who , while questioning manmade global warming , have pointed me there .
The man who runs it is called Steve Milloy .
In 1992 , he started working for APCO - Philip Morris 's consultants .
While there , he set up the JunkScience site .
In March 1997 , the documents show , he was appointed TASSC 's executive director .
By 1998 , as he explained in a memo to TASSC board members , his JunkScience website was was being funded by TASSC .
Both he and the " coalition " continued to receive money from Philip Morris .
An internal document dated February 1998 reveals that TASSC took $ 200,000 from the tobacco company in 1997 .
Philip Morris 's 2001 budget document records a payment to Steven Milloy of $ 90,000 .
Altria , Philip Morris 's parent company , admits that Milloy was under contract to the tobacco firm until at least the end of 2005 .
He has done well .
You can find his name attached to letters and articles seeking to discredit passive - smoking studies all over the internet and in the academic databases .
He has even managed to reach the British Medical Journal : I found a letter from him there which claimed that the studies it had reported " do not bear out the hypothesis that maternal smoking / passive smoking increases cancer risk among infants " .
TASSC paid him $ 126,000 in 2004 for 15 hours ' work a week .
Two other organisations are registered at his address : the Free Enterprise Education Institute and the Free Enterprise Action Institute .
They have received $ 10,000 and $ 50,000 respectively from Exxon .
The secretary of the Free Enterprise Action Institute is Thomas Borelli .
Borelli was the Philip Morris executive who oversaw the payments to TASSC .
Milloy also writes a weekly Junk Science column for the Fox News website .
Without declaring his interests , he has used this column to pour scorn on studies documenting the medical effects of second - hand tobacco smoke and showing that climate change is taking place .
Even after Fox News was told about the money he had been receiving from Philip Morris and Exxon , it continued to employ him , without informing its readers about his interests .
TASSC 's headed notepaper names an advisory board of eight people .
Three of them are listed by Exxonsecrets.org as working for organisations taking money from Exxon .
One of them is Frederick Seitz , the man who wrote the Oregon Petition , and who chairs the Science and Environmental Policy Project .
In 1979 , Seitz became a permanent consultant to the tobacco company RJ Reynolds .
He worked for the firm until at least 1987 , for an annual fee of $ 65,000 .
He was in charge of deciding which medical research projects the company should fund , and handed out millions of dollars a year to American universities .
The purpose of this funding , a memo from the chairman of RJ Reynolds shows , was to " refute the criticisms against cigarettes " .
An undated note in the Philip Morris archive shows that it was planning a " Seitz symposium " with the help of TASSC , in which Frederick Seitz would speak to " 40 - 60 regulators " .
The president of Seitz 's Science and Environmental Policy Project is a maverick environmental scientist called S Fred Singer .
He has spent the past few years refuting evidence for manmade climate change .
It was he , for example , who published the misleading claim that most of the world 's glaciers are advancing , which landed David Bellamy in so much trouble when he repeated it last year .
He also had connections with the tobacco industry .
In March 1993 , APCO sent a memo to Ellen Merlo , the vice - president of Philip Morris , who had just commissioned it to fight the Environmental Protection Agency : " As you know , we have been working with Dr Fred Singer and Dr Dwight Lee , who have authored articles on junk science and indoor air quality ( IAQ ) respectively ... "
Singer 's article , entitled Junk Science at the EPA , claimed that " the latest ' crisis ' - environmental tobacco smoke - has been widely criticised as the most shocking distortion of scientific evidence yet " .
He alleged that the Environmental Protection Agency had had to " rig the numbers " in its report on passive smoking .
This was the report that Philip Morris and APCO had set out to discredit a month before Singer wrote his article .
I have no evidence that Fred Singer or his organisation have taken money from Philip Morris .
But many of the other bodies that have been sponsored by Exxon and have sought to repudiate climate change were also funded by the tobacco company .
Among them are some of the world 's best - known " thinktanks " : the Competitive Enterprise Institute , the Cato Institute , the Heritage Foundation , the Hudson Institute , the Frontiers of Freedom Institute , the Reason Foundation and the Independent Institute , as well as George Mason University 's Law and Economics Centre .
I can't help wondering whether there is any aspect of conservative thought in the United States that has not been formed and funded by the corporations .
Until I came across this material , I believed that the accusations , the insults and the taunts such people had slung at us environmentalists were personal : that they really did hate us , and had found someone who would pay to help them express those feelings .
Now I realise that they have simply transferred their skills .
While they have been most effective in the United States , the impacts of the climate - change deniers sponsored by Exxon and Philip Morris have been felt all over the world .
I have seen their arguments endlessly repeated in Australia , Canada , India , Russia and the UK .
By dominating the media debate on climate change during seven or eight critical years in which urgent international talks should have been taking place , by constantly seeding doubt about the science just as it should have been most persuasive , they have justified the money their sponsors have spent on them many times over .
It is fair to say that the professional denial industry has delayed effective global action on climate change by years , just as it helped to delay action against the tobacco companies .

“ Everything we see says that these populations have done nothing but increase , ” he said in a telephone interview .
In August , schools of tilapia began showing up in the Monongahela River , to the delight of anglers and the consternation of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission , which tried unsuccessfully to net and destroy them .
How tilapia wound up in the Monongahela is somewhat of a mystery , although a local fish market sells them , and federal wildlife officials say the live release of exotic species  in religious rituals or by immigrants wanting to establish familiar food sources  is a growing problem .
“ There ’s a lot of anecdotal information that this goes on , ” said Greg Conover , the chairman of the Asian Carp Workgroup for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .
“ There ’s an effort to reach consumers with brochures in Chinese and other languages , but the cultural barriers are there , and more outreach is needed if we are to change behavior . ”
Mainstream and ethnic markets sell exotic species , from mud eels to green crabs , according to Walter Courtenay , a retired Florida Atlantic University biology professor who works as a volunteer fishery research biologist with the United States Geological Survey .
“ We ’ve seen silver carp in live markets in Ontario that show gillnet scars from having been captured in the wild , ” he said .
“ So we know they ’re being transported beyond where they were caught , which was probably in the Mississippi Basin . ”
Chinese mitten crabs  an Asian delicacy outlawed 20 years ago because of their impact on riverbanks in the San Francisco Bay watershed  are still surfacing in live markets in New York and were recently discovered in Baltimore Harbor .
Purveyors are subject to federal regulations for importation and interstate trade , as well as widely varying state laws about possession and use .

O tem sem pisal tukaj ( intelektualna lastnina ) , tukaj ( kraja intelektualne lastnine ) , tukaj ( kraja fotk ) in nazadnje par dni nazaj tukaj ( kraja fotk ) .
O moralno spornih fotografijah sem pisal tukaj .
In danes zjutraj me preseneti komentar na Vecerovem blogu , kjer mi Veky pove , da je opazil dve moji fotografiji v Slovenskih novicah v Bulvarju .
Seveda nisem niti pomislil , da bi bilo to lahko res , kajti vseeno sem mislil , da so novinarji tisti , ki spostujejo intelektualno lastnino in avtorske pravice .
Pa vendar , sem se moral prepricati na svoje oci .
Skok do kioska in nakup Slovenskih novic ( jeap , naredil sem to ) .
Odprem Bulvar in pred seboj zagledam dve fotografiji , moje delo na Avto motor showu v Ljubljani .
In gledam , ce bom kje videl watermark , ki je na vseh mojih fotografijah .
In ugotovim , da ga ni .
Obrezano ravno toliko , da ni napisa www.had.si in objavljeno brez imena in priimka avtora v komercialne namene .
Klic na urednistvo Slovenskih novic .
Glavnega urednika g. Bauerja na zalost ni bilo , sem se pa pogovoril s prijazno ( verjetno ) tajnico in ji razlozil problem , oz .
krajo fotografij .
Pustil sem ji podatke , ona pa mi je obljubila , da me poklice g. Bauer v ponedeljek .
S.H. , tako kot je podpisan avtor clanka ( oz. prispevka ) verjetno bere tale blog .
Ker je verjetno opazil , da me zelo moti , ce mi nekdo ukrade mojo lastnino in da sem isto stvar poudaril ze zbljt - ic , bi lahko vedel , da ne bom ostal ob tem ravnodusen .
V bistvu sem imel precej lahko delo , kajti o Direktovi kraji z Jonasovega bloga sem ze pisal .
Prav tako je tudi Jonas napisal , kako bo na hitrico zasluzil .
Takrat sem ga tudi jaz delno kopiral ( upam , da me ne tozi ) in ocitno sem naredil dobro delo .
Kaksen bo dogovor s Slovenskimi novicami , pa bom tudi napisal .
" Stink Beam " projector A large , hollow - ended cylinder is attached to a bass loudspeaker .
The open end of the cylinder is covered with a flat plate , and a 3in.
hole is put in this plate .
This forms a vortex launcher , and when a pulse is applied to the speaker , an invisible ring - vortex or " smoke ring " of air will be launched .
Pulses can be repetitive , so a continuous beam of vortices is projected .
Pulse waveform can be tailored to produce robust , fast , silent vortices .
Each vortex incorporates air from within the cylinder , and carries this air along as it travels .
If a scent is placed in the cylinder , you have a " stink gun " which can target a distant nose without being intercepted by others , or can surround a distant object with any desired scent .
If specific gases are added , then when the " stink beam " encounters a distant source of ignition , such as a cigarette , the vortices ( and maybe the launcher device ! ) will explode .
A computer , video grabber , IR camera , and some stepper motors could be assembled into an IR - seeking cigarette - targeting acetylene gasball launcher .
No Smoking !
Yucky ions
If a sharp point is attached to the dome of a VandeGraaff generator , the point will spew charged wind .
If you stand in this air stream , it will charged your clothing and hair , which will start clinging to your body .
Ewwww ! , feels like you 've been dipped in vegetable oil .
So , bolt a VDG upside - down within the ceiling , with ion-needles pointing downwards , and a " stand here " sign on the floor below .
( only works in fairly low humidity , the lower the better . )
" Free energy " hoax
Fake device is composed of complex structures and materials , a tiny battery - powered spark generator , and in the distance , a hidden , " stink beam projector device " rigged for acetylene .
The projector shoots gas pulses which cause occasional loud and unexplained explosions within the device .
If both an ion projector and an acetylene launcher are used , it may even be possible to create sparks and explosions in a distant device which contains no power supply at all !
Even better " Free energy " hoax Use the ' Energy sucking receiver ' effect to gather power from a special transmitter .
The receiver has an array of tuned circuits with the coils acting as loop antennas .
The transmitter has an identical array .
The tuned frequencies are scattered all over the band , and will seem like low - level white noise .
However , since the transmitter and receiver are coherent , each tuned circuit provides significant energy , and if all of them are passed through rectifier diodes , the total energy might be enough to run a small motor .
At the same time , the EM field of the transmitter would be almost immesurably small .
Elvis Miracle
Use my whitelight abrasion hologram method to encode an image of Elvis or other religious icon holographically into an everday surface , ( car hood ? )
Announce the miracle , charge admission , and even befuddle the experts who come to debunk it .
Impossible ! , a real hologram , but encoded into a crude painted surface !
Roadside Kilovoltage Source .
Build a sturdy VandeGraaff generator into a metal and plastic column , with a handcrank on the top metal terminal and a large label saying " TURN . "
When the crank and stepup gearing is turned , the generator operates .
Place it outdoors , and surround it with a thick plastic insulating plate .
Anyone who cranks it will feel a prickling sensation , their hair will stand up , and the next person they touch will get a huge " static zap . "
Better still : win the lottery and have thousands of them built and distributed around the country unannounced .
Permanent Infamy !
4 - Lane dot matrix printer A truck - mounted device spits a row of paint dots under computer control .
Drive along the Interstate while printing out political diatribes .
Make our highways look like Usenet rants .
Use high - pressure water sprays instead of paint for temporary , less illegal road gibberish .
Can you be arrested for CLEANING little spots on the highway ?
Colored dyes would work well on packed snowy roads ( a little carbon copier toner or fluoroceine dye goes a long way . )
Rent out ad space in fields near airports , then do your printing in water / seed slurry for variously colored crops .
Hang a stretched - out version of one of these devices as a long cable between widely - separated power boats to make an ocean graffitti printer ( On water surfaces on windy days , tiny bits of oil make enormous blotches ! )
Also : lunar dust is supposedly dark grey , so electrostatically shoot charged magnesium oxide ( white ) downwards from lunar orbit for a more noticable and long - lasting advertising sign on the moon .
" CHAIRFACE ! "
These guys independently invented the GraffittiWriter !
Also a bike - carried chalk - spray road printer
Look at : BikeWriter
And now here 's a Graffitti machine using winches and a single spray can .
That reminds me .
I first visualized the spray - can dot matrix printer around 1978 while looking at the frat - boy graffitti along the top edge of the huge brick chimney at the power plant for the University of Rochester campus / hospital complex .
The frat symbols were 6ft tall , yet they appeared tiny and barely visible on the giant chimney .
I realized that the vandals were doing it wrong .
Put a hundred spray cans on a horizontal metal rod , then rapidly lower the rod with ropes .
Keep it horizontal as a computer pushes on the paint can tips with solenoids .
Make chimney - graffitti that 's thirty feet across and several hundred feet tall !
Kindergarten Solar - powered Death Squad
Take a large crowd of children out into the sunshine and give each one a 20 cm square mirror .
Show them how to aim all of their little spots of sunlight at the same distant object , then stand back and see what they do .
Better yet , run away .

Ball - lightning incident Ed Harris on usa - tesla has discovered that argon gas lets you make a large ' plasma globe ' effect at ambient pressure .
Build a battery - powered Tesla Coil , clip it to your belt , and run a wire out to an argon - filled mylar sphere .
When turned on , the tip of the wire will grow a large blazing white ball of lightning filaments .
Run screaming through the night , chased by a ball - lightning in a hardly - noticable clear bag .
Charred , smoking clothes would be good too .
Ahhhhhhg !
It 's biting me !
Build a Borg The Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram discovered what he called the " Cyrano Effect " , and experimented with strange group - organism he dubbed " Cyranoids . "
Build one as follows : provide the " brain person " with a radio transmitter .
Give a radio receiver and earphone to a second or " body person , " then have the ' body ' agree to carry out all orders spoken by the distant ' brain . '
Even better would be a video RF link so the ' brain ' can see and hear through the ' body 's ' eyes , and maybe add a radio channel which controls vibrating transducers on the ' body ' person , so that the ' brain ' can silently command their movements with a joystick rather than verbally .
If one ' brain ' runs several ' bodies , ' you 've got the start of a small Borg civilization !
If you could rent the equipment for cocktail parties , would you pay more to be an amoral central controller , or a brainless puppet who might do ANYTHING ?
The same psychologist discovered the power of this closed causality loop common in World War II : NOT MY FAULT , ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS .
ONLY GAVE ORDERS , DID NOTHING MYSELF .
This can be used to convert a pair of people into a psychopath .
Responsibility for actions becomes a closed loop and evaporates .
Ordinary " good " people can be convinced to give lethal shocks if a superior authority figure gives the orders and SEEMS to take responsibility .
If anything bad happens , both people are certain it was the OTHER person 's fault .
As a consequence , the radio - controlled ' Cyranoid ' pair is very dangerous .
So David Letterman has built himself one ?
Just wait until Dave gives an unwise order to his puppet and finds that the person ACTUALLY CARRIES IT OUT !
The ' slave ' trusts the ' master ' to give only benign orders and stops thinking , but the ' master ' may order something terrible , just to see how far the ' slave ' will go .
When Letterman 's slave commits a crime , whose fault will it be , the one who only followed orders , or the one who did nothing himself ?
Phaser Weapon
If pure argon is injected into a laminar stream of air , the argon stream will support sparks of enormous length .
If connected to a fair - sized Tesla coil , the argon stream should produce linear arcs many feet long .
This would be easily disrupted by wind or by a small fan .
Indoors use only ?
Reach out zap someone !
A similar effect can be had by running an argon stream through a hose connected to a distant tesla coil .
Hot dangerous arc - plasma will pour from the hose end .
" Do n't unplug that rubber hose , its not full of water ! "
Fill a bowl with cold argon , place a tesla coil underneath , then stick your hand in the bowl .
Lightning shoots out of your fingertips .
Fill an entire small room with Argon or even Neon .
Hook yourself to a small tesla coil and enter the room , and you 'll look like something inside an " Eye of the Storm " plasma globe .
( Hold your breath , of course ! )
Finally accomplished by KVA Effects : Argon cannon
Mike 's Electric Stuff : Fun with argon
Longrange Defacement Ray CO2 lasers of hundreds of watts rating are very small and not that expensive .
With a large - diameter beam and the proper collimator you could create a " woodburner " which leaves a charred black mark several hundred feet away .
Mount it in an old rusty van along with computer and XY scan mirrors ( might have to install pneumatic jacks to keep the van steady . )
Drive to a spot with a clear view , use your joystick to set the anamorphed position of your artwork on yon billboard , then hit the return key and slooooowly the original propaganda is modified or replaced by that of your own design .
Duck - plunge Mechanical Fountain
When a large rock is flung into a pond , the waves spread into a series of ripples of descending wavelength , as if the water has " Fourier Transformed " the splash signal .
It has !
The water surface is not a linear medium , therefore any signal becomes " chirped " in a similar way to the " whistlers " produced in ELF radio sets by distant lightning pulses .
If you could wiggle an underwater object and produce an " antichirp " series of ripples , ( a temporally - reversed version of the ripples from a big splash , ) then as the ripples moved , they would slowly compress together and finally create a line or circle with a little explosion of spray .
Ripples also take the form of an expanding circle .
Rather than just reversing the " chirp " , we could also reverse their direction .
If water ripples could be created as inwards - curving rings , so that they focussed themselves to a point , so much the better .
Therefore build a bicycle - powered wave generator which can be placed at the shore of a pond .
It would slowly vibrate a long , curved wall which floats half - immersed in the water .
When aimed at a distant unwary duck , a series of ripples is created .
The duck sees the distant ripples approaching , and contracting , and concentrating , then ...
DOOOSH !
WAAAK - Aaak quaaak quackquack ...
Or build the device onto a large fountain pool .
Design the wave - generator to produce several superimposed " antichirp " patterns per revolution of the flywheel .
Then , if you pedal at the right speed , a mysterious zone of violent splashing would appear out in the middle of the pool .
Do this in a lake by using a very long , very weak wave generator .
The waves would remain invisible except at the focus which was hundreds of feet away from the wiggling boards .
RATS , SOMEONE BEAT ME TO IT
Suppose the wave - generator was adjusted to produce a * line * of splashing , and every so often the antichirp waves would contract and produce a long burst of " chop " .
This line might act to reflect other water waves , especially if the event was repeating at the same frequency as the waves .
Perhaps we could trap a standing wave in the space between the shore and a nonlinear barrier made from " chop . "
Or design the wave generator to create a square * hole * in the water temporarily .
Make a really big one , so all the small 3rd - world countries can tickle the ocean for awhile and have it swallow approaching aircraft carriers .
Soliton waves can exist on the surface of water .
The " tidal bore " is one such soliton wave .
Perhaps a soliton can be assembled from many smaller waves .
( This probably occurs in nature , where freak waves sink large ships . )
If freak waves can exist , then cranking a bicycle - powered wave generator for a couple of minutes could create the smaller waves which contract together , then sum nonlinearly to build a gigantic travelling soliton .
Very cool museum exhibit !
Hidden images on videotape
This one is n't so useful .
A cool trick for techies ?
If you view a television signal on an oscilloscope , you see a froth of squiggly shapes .
Also , as objects move around on the TV screen , the squiggly shapes on the oscilloscope move and flow .
Suppose you write software that changes the TV signal so the reverse happens ?
Then the television picture will be a mass of wavy moving shapes .
But if you observe that video signal using an oscilloscope , the signal will contain a perfectly clear television picture .
DOH !
The musician Aphex Twin figured out a use for this .
But do n't apply it to TV signals and scopes .
Instead apply it to sound and spectrum analyzers !
That way you 'll get weird swervy noise , but when the noise is viewed with a spectrum analyzer , you 'll see some clear images .
The results were recently posted on memepool , see usefulcontent and cleth pages .

How the Django team handles security
In the wake of the Ruby on Rails mandatory security patch and its awkward handling , we 've been discussing how we can avoid such a problem in the Django community .
In case you have n't seen it , our How to contribute to Django document has a Reporting security issues section , which describes our policy .
Take the 30 seconds to read that .
In addition to that policy , which we 've had for a while , today we created a django - announce mailing list .
It 's a low - traffic , announcement - only mailing list .
We 'll send a message to it for new Django releases , significant feature additions and security alerts .
If you 're a Django user , it'd be a good idea for you to sign up for this list .
A few months ago , Americana officials decided to remove the St. Andrew 's cross -- the bars in the Confederate flag - - from the town crest .
Residents of Italian descent , who make up most of the population in this industrial city of more than 200,000 , have argued that neither the size nor influence of confederados has earned them a place on the crest .
They number just a few dozen here now , although hundreds are scattered among several nearby cities , and in Sao Paulo , 75 miles northwest of here .
But others say Americana is seeking to avoid the controversy that burdens the flag , even 5,000 miles from its original home .
Thomas Steagall , 23 and a resident of Sao Paulo , says he 's careful about revealing his heritage to fellow Brazilians because , as one person told him :
" The flag means racism in the United States , and it represents lots of bad things in the United States .
And I say , we 're not in the United States , we 're in Brazil . "
Steagall traveled to the United States for the first time in 1997 .
The Sons of Confederate Veterans invited him to explain to people that the Confederacy stood for more than racism and slavery .

In Kennesaw Mountain , Ga. , he confronted the underbelly of the Confederate legacy .
At a store that sold " everything from flags to buttons to guns , " Steagall recalled , a sign in the front window read : " No Jews , No Blacks , No Dogs . "
Steagall , stunned , told his hosts , " If you do this in my country , you 'd be arrested .
It 's a crime . "
And yet the computer science student refuses to condemn ancestors who supported slavery .
" We can't condemn them because they were living in a place and under a constitution that said [ slavery ] was right , " he said .
And Thomas 's brother , Washington , is quick to note that the Steagalls and many other American Southerners did not take slaves when they settled in Brazil , even though the country did not fully outlaw slavery until 1888 .

Web Hosting - A Market for Lemons
David N. Welton

In this article , I claim that the market for web hosting services is a market for lemons .
What , exactly , is a " market for lemons " ?
The term comes from a paper by economist George Akerlof dealing with information asymmetry .
If that 's a dry sounding term , the concept is actually simple : in some markets , the seller knows more than the buyer does , or vice - versa .
Consider the classic example of buying a used car - you can't tell just by looking at it whether it's worth what the seller is trying to get for it .
Shady dealers will try and sell low - quality products at a higher price , and sellers with high - quality products will face buyers who are less willing to pay high prices because of the risk they might get a " lemon " .
This " adverse selection " makes for a less efficient market , meaning , in the end , that value is lost .
Everyone knows that once you drive a car off the lot , for instance , that its resale value just went down far out of proportion to how much it 's been used .
It also creates problems for buyers , who have to take a risk , rather than simply being able to select the quality of product they want to buy , and paying the corresponding price .
Of course , it 's impossible to eliminate this disparity of information , but as we shall see later , there are ways of lessening its impact , so that trade does happen , even though it may not be under ideal conditions .
This same principle applies to many markets where information is " asymmetrical " - the seller knows more than the buyer about the quality of what they are selling .
This is certainly true in the market for web hosting .
If you put " web hosting " , " dedicated servers " and similar terms in Google , the search engine will come back with a huge quantity of pages advertising these services .
Clicking on most of them will reveal a fancy looking page extolling the offerings of the provider .
They give you a very good idea of what type of system with exactly what characteristics you can get for a particular price .
However , what you , the consumer , can't really know is the quality of service offered .
It 's easy to write " 24x7 " , " 99.999 % " , and other such terms , but what really happens when you can't ping your machine at 1 AM Sunday morning ?
How fast will they respond ?
Is the technician knowledgeable enough to fix the problem if it 's something that you can't do yourself remotely , or will they just suggest that on Monday , you can have a reinstall done for free .
Many " web hosting companies " are just some guy reselling space from a big data center , others are serious professionals that know their stuff and can help you out in a pinch .
This information is much more difficult to obtain - at best , you might find some comments in a forum from people using aliases like S0M3D00D saying " these guys are ok " , or " these guys suck " , but that 's not very sound information to base a business decision on .
Of course , you can always shell out a lot of cash and go with one of the big outfits , but often the prices are far higher for the same hardware .
That might be worth it if you are a big company that can afford the price , and is willing to do anything for some peace of mind .
But if you 're willing to do most of the work of running a system yourself , and are looking for a deal , things get trickier .
Anecdotal Evidence
A year ago , I was looking around for someplace to place my domains .
I wanted a dedicated system , so that I could manage the machine myself .
After having been slashdotted a couple of times , I also did n't want to run on a ' virtual ' system where the hosting provider might be cramming so many virtual servers on one machine that a bit of traffic makes them fall over .
I do n't need much in the way of assistance - just a minimal Debian install , and a guarantee that techs are on call to deal with anything that can't be handled over ssh , such as the occasional reboot , or hardware problems .
The first outfit I found seemed ok .
They responded to my email enquiries quickly and professionally , and after receiving payment , got a server on - line for me very quickly .
Nice !
The problems started when the machine 's disk started to go a few weeks later .
It happened on a weekend , and apparently no one was around that was able to fix it , because the machine was not back on line until the following Monday .
No email and all my websites down for a weekend ... very stressful !
After another misstep on their part , I decided that I 'd signed up with a Lemon , and went looking for another provider .
The second place I found is my current hosting provider , layeredtech.com .
They provide the same basic services on generic hardware that 's ok for what I need , but the real difference is to be found when problems arise .
They 've always been on it right away , even in the middle of the night their time ( I'm in Italy , they 're in Texas ) .
As another example , a company I did some work for offered hosting services on their web pages .
They were a real company , not just some guy with a phone number .
However , they had no people or plans in place to deal with nighttime or weekend emergencies .
And yet they charged more or less the same prices as other hosting providers .
As can plainly be seen , though , it is difficult or impossible to determine the quality of service prior to signing on .
Same providers may wave a " service level agreement " or guarantee at you , but realistically , if they do n't live up to it , your only option may be to find another place , if they simply say they are n't going to refund your money .
Other Explanations - Moral Hazard
While discussing this article with some economists of my acquaintance , they leaned towards another explanation of problems people encounter with web hosting services , something economists call " moral hazard " - briefly explained as one party choosing to live up to their obligations , or not , after payment of the service .
I do not believe this is the case , because it appears that some hosting providers simply are not able to provide the same quality of service as others .
They are not equipped to do operate 24/7 , and respond to problems in a timely fashion , so it is not necessarily a question of " getting lazy " once they have your money , but of hoping that things generally go well , which may be enough for some of their clients .
If the price to the consumer for the service is the same , the provider spends less on personnel , and only loses a few clients who are unhappy with the service , while acquiring new clients at a rate more or less equivalent to other , higher quality providers , there is certainly a profit motive for this behavior .
Whereas , if you have the capability to provide good service ( you are already paying employee salaries ) , why would you not put that to use ?
Not doing so would lead to unsatisfied clients , and you would still be out the money spent on maintaining a 24/7 capable facility .
Conclusions and Remedies
How does one mitigate the effect of a market for lemons ?
The best way is to eliminate the disparity of information .
If it were known that one provider cannot respond to emergencies during the night , and another can , you would expect their prices to vary accordingly , which would be good for consumers - those wishing to save some money , and who are ok with the fact that their site (s ) might be down for hours at a time in the worst case , would gravitate to cheaper services , and those needing more reliability would know that they were getting it when paying a bit more .
How to shine some light on the situation then ?
Currently , the combination of various forums dedicated to the topic , plus the ability to search with Google , provides an easy way to gather information - although it 's not a very effective method .
It is easy to post false information on forums - a sneaky ' lemon ' provider could say nasty things about a good provider , or he could write off accusations against his own operation as the work of the competition , casting himself as the victim .
In general , " reputation " is one way of getting around the problem of information asymmetry , and indeed , in the hosting market if you are willing to shell out a lot of money , you can go with one of the big , well known providers .
You will be relatively safe there , but if your budget is tight , it might hurt to pay out that much more money .
Guarantees - a service level agreement in this case , are another way to deal with the problem .
However as mentioned above , not much money is involved , so you 're not going to get your money back if the provider decides they do n't want to give you a refund .
For other , more mature markets , a good solution is often to utilize a neutral third party who can verify the quality of a given product .
If you buy a used car without a guarantee , for example , it 's usually a good idea to have a trusted mechanic check it out .
The money spent is well worth it if it saves you hundreds or thousands of dollars in repair fees later on down the road .
Unfortunately , I am not aware of any monitoring services that can tell you much information about the quality of a hosting provider 's service - unlike a car , it 's something you only see with time , and when problems come up .
In conclusion , we find that there really are n't any good solutions to the lemons problem in the web hosting market at the moment .

1 & 2 . Action Comics # 1 ( June 1938 ) and Superman # 1 ( 1939 )
This is it , the comic book Holy Grail , the one that introduced the world to Superman .
The cover bears the famous - if somewhat crude - drawing of Superman smashing a car against a rock .
Written and drawn by Jerome Siegel and Joe Shuster , the comic introduced Superman as " Champion of the oppressed , the physical marvel who had sworn to devote his existence to helping those in need ! "
The last survivor of the doomed planet Krypton ( duh ) , Superman could " leap 1/8th of a mile ; hurdle a 20 - story building ... raise tremendous weights ... run faster than an express train ... and nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin ! "
Superman was so popular , he became the first character to get his very own comic book .
Superman # 1 hit newsstands in the summer of 1939 .
The Man of Steel has held up pretty well , you could say .
Action Comics # 1
Cover price in 1938 : 10 ¢
Estimated top value today : $ 350,000 Superman #
1
Cover price in 1939 : 10 ¢
Estimated top value today : $ 210,000 3 .
Detective Comics # 27 ( May 1939 )
Less than a year later , an artist named Bob Kane decided to create a caped superhero of his own , one much darker , more mysterious , and more " human " than the squeaky - clean Superman .
His creation : Batman .
Unlike the campy ' 60s TV version of the character , the Batman in this first issue was a dark , vengeful crusader who stalked the night ( he watches as a bad guy plunges into a vat of acid ) , presaging the hero 's reemergence in the 1980s in The Dark Knight Returns .
Perhaps this darkness was a reflection of the dread of war looming on the horizon in 1939 ?
The cover proclaimed , " Starting this issue :
The amazing and unique adventures of THE BATMAN ! " and promised " 64 pages of action ! "
Cover price in 1939 : 10 ¢
Estimated top value today : $ 300,000 4 . Marvel Comics # 1 ( October 1939 )
In 1939 a comic book house called Funnies Inc. approached pulp fiction publisher Martin Goodman with a proposal to provide him with ready - made comic book artwork .
All he had to do was publish it .
Seeing the kind of cash Action Comics and others were raking in , he agreed , and Marvel Comics was born .
The first issue introduced three legendary Marvel characters : the Sub - Mariner of Atlantis , prince of the Deep ; the Human Torch ( a different Human Torch than the one that would become part of the Fantastic Four 22 years later - let 's not get them confused ) ; and Ka - Zar the Great , a man who lived in the jungle among apes ( strangely similar to another popular ape man whose name had a lot of teh same letters ) .
Cover price in 1939 : 10 ¢
Estimated top value today : $ 250,000 5 . Batman # 1 ( Spring 1940 )
After appearing in 13 issues of Detective Comics , Batman and his new sidekick - Robin the Boy Wonder ( introduced in Detective Comics # 38 ) - were so popular , they got their very own comic book .
Batman began as a quarterly , but that was n't enough for fans .
Neither was a bimonthly .
So , before long , readers could get a new Batman adventure every month .
The first issue introduces two of Batman 's most legendary nemeses : the Joker and Catwoman .
More than 63 years and over 600 issues later , Batman is still fighting villains - as well as his own demons - on the streets of Gotham City .
Cover price in April 1940 : 10 ¢
Estimated top value today : $ 100,000 6 .
All - American Comics # 16 ( July 1940 )
How many times has this happened to you ?
Man finds alien metal lantern .
Man makes ring out of lantern .
Man presses ring to lantern .
Man has incredible superpowers over everything .
Except wood , obviously .
That 's the story in All - American Comics # 16 , a book published tangentially under the DC Comics umbrella .
When regular guy Alan Scott made his ring , the superhero created was , of course , the Green Lantern .
The idea of an everyday schmoe just lucking into superhero - ness proved incredibly popular .
A similar idea struck gold in 1962 when a young nerd named Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider ( see below ) .
Cover price in 1940 : 10 ¢
Estimated top value today : $ 115,000 7 .
Amazing Fantasy # 15 ( August 1962 )
The word bubbles on the cover say it all : " Though the world may mock Peter Parker , the timid teen - ager ... it will soon marvel at the awesome might of ... SPIDER - MAN ! " And writer Stan Lee ( pseudonym of Stanley Martin Lieber ) and artist Mike Steve Ditko could not have been more right .
Spider - Man was the first comic book hero to be a regular teenager , going through the same thigns his readers were dealing with : shyness , insecurity , a crush on a pretty girl , and trouble with the popular jock ( Flash Thompson ) .
No wonder people of all ages are still true believers .
Cover price in 1962 : 12 ¢
Estimated top value today : $ 42,000

Microsoft Windows still dominates the desktop .
But in many other areas , including Web servers and supercomputing , Microsoft is just one player among many , and often a weak player at that .
On the gaming side , despite the latest xBox getting all kinds of media buzz as " the " console to buy , Sony 's Playstation outsells the xBox at least two to one , and many analysts expect Sony to widen that gap even more when Playstation 3 comes out in the Spring of 2006 .
On the Internet , MSN and MSN Search are so far behind AOL and Google that it is n't funny .
And even on the desktop , Linux keeps getting stronger , while Mac OS X is commonly accepted as more reliable , secure , and user - oriented than Windows .
So why do we keep saying Microsoft is a monopoly ?
Depending on which way you drive to Lego ’s headquarters in Enfield , Connecticut , you ’ll pass by either cornfields or concertina wire , or both .
Every brick of every
Lego set that will end up in the hands of any kid in North America passes through this mammoth facility , nestled among farms and three state prisons .
It ’s also the setting for Lego ’s newest initiative , a program that brings mass customization to a product that , by its very nature , is already mass customized .
Beginning in late August , some of the bricks arriving at this 450,000 - square - foot warehouse will travel to a small corner cordoned off by conveyor belts .
That ’s the home of Lego Factory , a new initiative that lets fans decide what they ’d like to build and then lets them buy the necessary bricks .
Customers create any structure they can imagine using Lego ’s freely downloadable Digital Designer software .
If they then decide to actually build their creation , the software , which keeps track of which pieces are required , sends the order to this corner of the Enfield warehouse .
There , employees put all the pieces ( which are grouped in standardized bags ) into a box , along with instructions , and ship it off .
“ We ’ve been toying with this idea for a long time , ” says Steven Hawco , vice president of Lego ’s Shop at Home division , which is overseeing the project .
“ And now technology is giving us the ability to actually do this . ”
Lego put Digital Designer on its site last November .
Although the company was initially mum about whether users would be able to purchase their designs , the software has proven popular , especially because users have been able to share their creations with others in the Lego community , one of the traditional building blocks of the company ’s customer loyalty .
Some of the most creative models have been renderings of the Danish Parliament building and M.C. Escher ’s “ Another World . ”
Deciding how much latitude to give users is an essential part of any mass - customization program , says B. Joseph Pine , the author of Mass Customization : The New Frontier in Business Competition ( Harvard Business School Press , 1993 ) .
“ Fundamentally , ” he says , “ customers do n’t want choice .
They just want exactly what they want .
Your job is to help them figure out what it is they want , because often they do n’t know or ca n’t articulate it . ”
One of the early lessons , for example , was that Lego could n’t offer every piece in its inventory .
Limiting the number of bricks also brought down fulfillment costs , which vary little from the traditional process .
“ In terms of production , we ’re not adding layers of complexity , ” says Michael McNally , Lego ’s senior brand - relations manager .
“ We ’ve already produced these elements .
So it ’s just a matter of rejiggering our fulfillment process and our packing process . ”
Lego tried an earlier , less - complex version of this initiative in late 2000 , with Lego Mosaic .
Customers would submit a digital photograph , which would be Lego - fied into hundreds of little tiles used to create a black - and - white mosaic .
Despite a brief surge in popularity in 2004 after being featured in O , the Oprah Magazine , it never really caught on , and a few leftover mosaic sets gather dust in the corner of the warehouse where Lego Factory resides .
McNally does n’t think Lego Factory will share a similar fate , pointing to the 77,000 models that have already been designed using the software .
“ And that was before they even knew they would be able to buy them , ” he says .
While he does n’t expect Lego Factory to turn the company around overnight —
Lego lost $ 310 million last year on revenue of $ 1.1 billion — “ it ’s something that has huge potential for the company , and strategically , we ’re looking to see where it hits and how deeply . ”
Executives hope that it could amount to as much as 10 % of online sales .
GENDER differences are a topic of endless discussion for parents , teachers and social scientists .
The only place where they cannot be talked about seems to be Harvard .
Luckily , some academic researchers still find the topic important enough and interesting enough to study .
A noteworthy case in point is a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by a Stanford economist , Muriel Niederle , and Lise Vesterlund , a University of Pittsburgh economist , titled , " Do Women Shy Away From Competition ?
Do Men Compete Too Much ? "
( A nontechnical description of the paper may be found at www.nber.org/digest/feb06/w11474.html.)
It is widely noted that women are not well represented in high - paying corporate jobs , or in mathematics , science and engineering jobs .
As the authors observe , the " standard economic explanations for such occupational differences include preferences , ability and discrimination . "
To this list the authors add a new factor : attitudes toward competitive environments .
If men prefer more competitive environments than women , then there will be more men represented in areas where competition is intense .
Of course , discussions of gender differences of any sort can only be statements about averages ; it is clear that there are women who thrive in competitive environments and men who do not .
Furthermore , attitudes toward competition may be ingrained or a result of factors like social stereotyping .
Is there any evidence that the hypothesis is true ?
Do men really prefer more competitive environments than women ?
One could cite anecdote after anecdote , but the authors took a much more direct approach : they ran an experiment .
By using an experiment , the authors were able to determine not only whether men and women differ in their willingness to compete , but more important , whether they differ in their willingness to compete conditioned on their actual performance .
The economists asked 80 subjects , divided into groups of two women and two men , to add up sets of five two - digit numbers for five minutes .
The subjects performed the task first on a piece - rate basis ( 50 cents for each correct answer ) and then as a tournament ( the person with the most correct answers in each group received $ 2 per correct answer , while other participants received nothing ) .
Note that a subject with a 25 percent chance of being a winner in the tournament received the same average payment as in the piece - rate system .
All participants were told how many problems they got right , but not their relative performance .
After completing the two tasks , the subjects were asked to choose whether they preferred a piece - rate system or a tournament for the third set of problems .
There were several interesting findings in this experiment .
First , there were no differences between men and women in their performance under either compensation system .
Despite this , twice as many men selected the tournament as women ( 75 percent versus 35 percent ) .
Even if one accounts for performance by comparing only men and women with the same number of correct answers , the women have a 38 percent lower probability of choosing the tournament compensation .
Why were the men much more likely to choose the tournament ?
Perhaps it was because they felt more confident about their abilities .
The data support this hypothesis , with 75 percent of the men believing that they won their four - player tournament , while 43 percent of the women thought they were best in their group .
Though both groups were overconfident about their performance , the men were much more so .
So , women were less likely than men to choose the tournament compensation system even when actual or believed performance was considered .
The authors looked at a number of possible explanations for this finding , one being different risk aversion between men and women .
But they rejected this explanation since the difference in risk aversion required to explain the results would have been implausibly large .
The results of this experiment are consistent with the finding by a Berkeley finance professor , Terry Odean , that men trade stocks excessively , apparently because they ( wrongly ) feel that they have exceptional ability to pick winners .
Women trade less , but do better on average , because they are more likely to follow a buy - and - hold strategy .
The authors summarized their experimental results by saying , " From a payoff - maximizing perspective , high - performing women enter the tournament too rarely , and low - performing men enter the tournament too often . "
The low - performing men and the high - performing women are both hurt by this behavior but , in this experiment at least , the costs to the women who did not choose the tournament when they should have exceeded the costs to the men who should have avoided the tournament .
One should not read too much into one study .
But if it is really true that women choose occupations that involve less competition , then one may well ask why .
Sociobiologists may suggest that such differences come from genetic propensities ; sociologists may argue for differences in social roles and expectations ; developmental psychologists may emphasize child - rearing practices .
Whatever the cause , Ms. Niederle and Ms. Vesterlund have certainly raised a host of interesting and important questions .
Looking up old flame ?
Think twice
It sounds innocent .
You get to wondering whatever happened to that special someone you dated in high school or college , so you track her , or him , down online and send an e-mail .
Your old flame is thrilled to hear from you .
You chat online , talk on the phone , meet for coffee .
And faster than you ever imagined , everything gets out of hand and someone 's marriage is ruined .
It happens a lot more often than you 'd think .
" It starts with e-mails , " says Nancy Kalish , a psychology professor at Cal State Sacramento who has studied the phenomenon .
" It goes to IMs ( instant messages ) , and the hotel room follows pretty soon afterward . "
C'mon , we 're not talking about people looking for an affair , just a cup of coffee with an old friend .
That may be the plan , but Kalish says that 's not how it often works out .
She 's been charting hookups between lost loves since 1993 , and says the Internet has changed how such stories unfold .
Back in the 1990s , it was rare for a married person to reach out to a first love .
Nowadays , about 8 in 10 people who contact a former lover are married , Kalish says , based upon the findings of her own Web site , Lostlovers.com .
Of course , most of them do n't intend to get into trouble when they log on , and not all of them do .
" People are just surfing the Internet on a whim , " Kalish says .
" They may see some lost love and they say , ' What the heck ' and send an e-mail . "
Sound familiar ?
If so , you are not alone .
Reunion.com was created in 2002 , says site spokeswoman Shari Cogan , and its growth has been " just unbelievable . "
The site has profiles for 34 million people , and is gaining as many as 40,000 daily , she says .
And Reunion.com is just one of several sites that make it easier than ever to track down an old friend .
Classmates.com allows users to " leap through a portal to the best of your past " and boasts a database of 60 million people who graduated from more than 200,000 schools .
So it 's never been easier to look up and hook up with an old crush .
But if you 're in a relationship , Kalish has three words for you .
Do n't do it .
" I would n't touch it if you are married , " she says .
" Some of these people have no idea what they are getting into . "
Kalish has made " rekindled romances " her specialty .
Her research on the subject , which began in 1993 , led to her 1997 book , " Lost & Found Lovers . "
She has appeared with Oprah Winfrey and on " 20/20 , " and frequently presents her findings at psychological conventions .
If there 's one thing she 's learned , it 's that hooking up with an old flame rarely ends well .
Take Amy Altschul , a 54 - year - old freelance editor who contacted an old flame after at least 30 years .
The two exchanged e-mails , then phone calls .
" Then we got together , and we started seeing each other every single day , " Altschul says .
" It was like instant trust , instant like , instant friendship .
It was like an addiction or something . "
That 's not uncommon , says Kalish .
Old flames often rekindle , she theorizes , because a physical , chemical imprinting occurs when we meet our first love .
It typically happens when we are young and impressionable .
" What we find is that once those emotional memories get started , those feelings are strong and resilient , " Kalish says .
Kalish says her research has shown that a vivid dream about an old flame is the most common trigger of the urge for a reunion .
Her subjects often interpret such dreams as a sign that they should contact their first love , but Kalish says such dreams speak to the power of those memories .
" These are good people mostly , " she says of those who looked up past loves and wound up pursuing a renewed relationship .
" They are n't looking for trouble .
It seems safe .
Very few people expected a romance . "
But often , that 's exactly what happened .
Old flames meet , they reconnect instantly and powerfully , and before long the situation has run away from them .
Old flames rekindling is nothing new , of course .
But the typical story used to be of high school sweethearts , perhaps widowed or divorced , finding each other after decades apart .
That was before the Internet .
In those days , Kalish says , tracking down a lost love was hard work , requiring hours on the telephone calling old friends , friends of friends , relatives .
The digital revolution changed all that .
What used to take days can be done in minutes , and anonymously .
Between 1993 and 1997 , Kalish says , about 30 percent of those who reached out to an old flame were married .
Today that figure is 82 percent .
No wonder it can be tough finding people willing to discuss their experiences .
Kalish says visitors to her Web site often are willing to share their stories , just so long as they do n't have to give their names -- even though , as a psychologist , Kalish is required not to disclose their identities .
We ran into the same problem .
We queried 1,500 readers about the topic by e-mail .
We received very few responses , which seemed odd until the confidential replies started trickling in , each asking " What if you are married ? "
Clearly , it was not a topic people want to discuss publicly .
Not every contact leads to a torrid , marriage - wrecking romance .
But some do .
And even if neither person is married , things may take an unexpected turn .
After the initial euphoria of getting together with her former beau in August , Altschul began to have doubts about her old flame and distanced herself from him .
" I think he 's crazy -- seriously insane , " she says now .
" Yes , I would do it again , but I would be much more cautious next time . "

Miguel , that 's cool , I know SOAP ( with a library ) does n't involve a ton of application code .
My point is more that ( to me ) it 's just not worth learning about for this sort of thing .
If you want to get a couple of pieces of data on an Amazon product you just do " get url contents " and " stuff into XML parser " and " grab the Item node " and that 's about it .
All programmers already know how to download a URL and pull out an XML node , and being able to try out requests in the browser by editing the address in the location bar is pretty useful .
" REST " is just very conceptually simple and requires no ramp - up time , even if it involves a couple more lines of code .
Recently I have been considering the implementation of a system that would replace D - BUS and CORBA with a simple HTTP framework .
At the core of such replacement there is an activation and arbitration system running on a well known location , for example : http://localhost:123/.
This can be an Apache module or a custom built HTTP server .
The daemon , very much like our existing activation systems ( bonobo - activation and d- bus ) has a list of services that can be started on demand and provides assorted services to participants .
When an application starts , it registers itself with the local arbitration daemon , it does this with a RESTful call , lets say :
http://localhost:123/registration/id=f-spot&location=http://localhost:9000/
Where " f - spot " in this case is the name of the application , and " localhost:9000 " is the end point where F - Spot happens to have an HTTP server running that exposes the F - Spot RESTful API .
A client application that wants to communicate with F - Spot always contacts the well - known end - point :
http://localhost:123/app/f-spot/request
The arbitration daemon merely returns an HTTP 303 result pointing to : http://localhost:9000/request .
The http client library already has support for this redirection .
If F - Spot was not running , the arbitration daemon would look into a special directory that lists the available applications .
The file could be called " f - spot.service " and it would describe how to launch f- spot , very similar to the way d-bus does it :
[ Service ] Name=f - spot Exec=/opt/gnome/bin/f-spot
The request comes in on http://localhost:123/f-spot/request , the activator launches f- spot , f - spot registers itself using the previously discussed call , a redirect is then sent to the client and you are done .
To use this system as a message bus , in the same spirit as d-bus , you merely connect and listen to another well known - end point : http://localhost:123/bus/event-name .
The connection is never closed by the server and clients keep reading data from this stream .
To push information into the bus , a POST request is done http://localhost:123/bus/event-name .
The contents of the POST are then delivered to all the clients that are listening on the endpoint .
The format and protocol for the information that flows on that particular HTTP request as REST is up to the creator , users would have to follow that format .
For example it could be one line at a time , or it could be a url pointing to the full message .
As for the security of this system , it should use a mechanism similar to what we have used in the past with Bonobo Activation : a randomly generated password is generated and stored on the file system in a well known location , and private location ( ~/.config / private / something ) .
The security process is the only component that requires a little bit of code .
The rest can be implemented just with an HTTP client and the HTTP server for those providing information .
A client application would only needs something like this :
FILE f = popen ( " http - get - key " ) ; fgets ( password , sizeof ( buf ) , f ) ; close ( f ) ;
The benefits I think are multiple :
HTTP is a well known protocol .
There are plenty of HTTP client and server implementations that can be employed .
The protocol can be as simple or as complex as needed by the applications .
From passing all the arguments on a REST header as arguments to the tool - aware SOAP .
HTTP works well with large volumes of data and large numbers of clients .
Scaling HTTP is a well understood problem .
Users can start with a REST API , but can easily move to SOAP if they need to .
HTTP includes format negotiations : clients can request a number of different formats and the server can send the best possible match , it is already part of the protocol .
This colors the request with a second dimension if they choose to .
Servers can take advantage of HTTP frameworks to implement their functionality on the desktop .
It is not another dependency on an obscure Linux library .
The possibility of easily capturing , proxying and caching any requests .
Redirects could be used to redirect request to remote hosts transparently and securily .
and .
And finally , makes the desktop " Web 2.0 ready " :-)
HTTP on its own has plenty of fantastic advantages that today we are bound to reimplement with things like D - Bus or live without them .
The implementation of this infrastructure is trivial .
All I need now is a name for the project .

For people of Basra , fear has a name : ' the Duck ' / A onetime oasis of relative calm now on brink of collapse
2006-10-19 04:00:00 PDT
Basra , Iraq --
On the streets of Basra , in southern Iraq , one thing nobody wants to see is " the Duck . "
That 's the nickname for a slightly battered , cream colored Toyota Crown , a car model known as Batta , Arabic for duck .
It has become the stuff of grim local legend , a murderer on wheels , whose victims include Sunni and Shiite , rich and poor alike .
Little is known about the car or its drivers .
Some say it is a Shiite gang carrying out an ethnic - cleansing campaign against the minority Sunnis , others that it is al Qaeda attempting to provoke a civil war in the oil - rich south .
Wilder accusations point to British special forces or the city governor .
Skeptics say the Duck is a largely mythical creature .
Whatever the truth , the fearful obsession is symptomatic of a city on the brink of collapse .
Once regarded as an oasis of comparative calm and a model of how the U.S. - led occupation could work , Iraq 's second city is a place where death squads now roam free .
A local resident who , like others interviewed for this story insisted on anonymity , described one such execution he said he saw in broad daylight this summer .
" There was a lot of traffic on the Baghdad road , and the Duck just came up alongside a car in front .
A man got out -- he had a dark shirt and heavy black beard -- and walked toward the other car .
" He pulled two pistols out of his belt and stood there calmly shooting into it at point blank range .
There was nothing left of the person inside .
Then he walked back to the car and drove off . "
The killing happened just yards away from a police checkpoint -- which happened to be unmanned that day .
Another infamous assault implicating the Duck involved a drive - by shooting from a Toyota Crown that killed a Sunni shopkeeper .
As the slain man 's family and neighbors -- a mix of Sunni , Shiite and Christian -- waited outside the hospital to collect the body , the Toyota reappeared together with a truck , from which a heavy machine gun opened fire , killing more than two dozen people .
" Everyone is afraid of the Duck , everyone in Basra lives in fear of the death squads because we know we could all be targets , " a former Shiite resident who fled to Amman , Jordan , said .
Because his family remains in Iraq , he spoke on condition of anonymity , afraid of recriminations .
Basra is an increasingly divided and dangerous city , caught in a power struggle between radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army and the Fadhila movement , a Shiite organization formed in 2003 that now has an armed wing , has won local elections and holds the governorship .
Criminal gangs , widespread corruption and neighbor fearing neighbor add to the volatile mix .
Recriminations reached a high point last month when a group of local tribal leaders told Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki that death squads were being supported by the municipal authorities .
British military sources in Basra said there was " no evidence " to support the claims .
But British Army spokesman Maj .
Charles Burbridge confirmed that death squads -- including police officers -- are roaming the city .
" It 's certainly not an isolated incident , and it's not just one vehicle involved , there are several , " he said in a telephone interview .
Burbridge blames renegade groups that have splintered from the main political and militia factions and infiltrated Iraqi security services .
" The police have been infected by these same rogue elements , and from time to time the murder vehicle will be a police car , " he said .
While he did not know specifically about the Duck , he was aware that killers roaming around the city in a Toyota Crown were notorious among local Iraqis .
In an attempt to regain control of the police , British forces last month launched " Operation Sinbad , " designed to purge police ranks of militia members .
" We 're aiming to rehabilitate the police force and make it more able and willing to implement the rule of law , " Burbridge said .
" At the same time , we 're conducting strike operations at terrorist attacks . "
What effect that will have remains to be seen , but there is little hope among ordinary Iraqis that anything will change in the near future .
Baquer Shaheen , an unemployed 40 - year - old , lost a brother to a death squad .
The brother had been working at Umm Qasr , Iraq 's only deepwater port .
" My brother came under a lot of pressure because he refused to get involved in corruption , " Shaheen said .
" One day , someone left a note at his door threatening to kill him unless he left his job .
He went to work anyway and on the way home , his car was followed and attacked .
Doctors said they found 37 bullets in his corpse . "
Port workers at Abu Flose , a major oil transfer site , claim that millions of dollars raised from smuggling are financing political groups and private armies .
" You can only do business here if you go through certain groups , and you only get a job if you 're an active supporter , " one port employee said , on condition of anonymity .
" It 's like the Mafia , but if anyone speaks out , they 're finished . "
Such criminal activity , combined with widespread unemployment , has left increasing numbers of people destitute in Basra , heightening the sense of despair and further strengthening the militias ' hold , observers say .
" The economic situation is so bad it 's embarrassing for us , " said Alaa Sabah , a local fisherman .
" There is little honorable work , which means people get pushed into dishonorable things .
Many young men join the Islamic parties ' armies because it 's the only thing they can do to get some money . "
I 'm so glad this site exists , so people can share there experiences and realise they 're not the only ones - well done guys !!!
I 've had many unfortunately , but I will just mention a few .
My city has no official blog yet .
As a introverted and shy teenager , I was carrying 2 heavy bags of shopping ( and looking pretty rough , old jean and sweatshirt ) in , A circle of at least 10 drunk guys surrounded me , blocking me and not letting me walk off .
They were wearing novelty costumes ( a stag night , maybe ) .
I felt so intimidated that a froze .
The " ring leader " came forward , and said , " we wo n't let you go until you give us all a kiss " .
I was still frozen .
He started to move his face closer to mine , it was so disgusting .
I squeaked , " I have a boyfriend " ( I did n't ) and pushed past them .
And they were all laughing , I felt so humiliated and sick for the rest of the evening .
Not too long after that , another woman I did n't know and I were walking down a narrow street with scaffolding in the pouring rain and wolf whistles started from the builders .
We both turned around and one went " No , not you , you train wreck " I do n't know which of us the attention was aimed at , but again this made my day just a little worse .
Another time drunk guy in club maneuvered me into a corner and would n't let me go until I gave him my ( fake ) number .
To top this off , I went abroad to a certain foreign country ( religiously conservative and by some standards 3rd world ) for study reasons , where street harassment is the norm .
In fact sexual responsibility and " sin " falls almost entirely on the women 's side .
Women are belittled , some are not allowed out on their own , and stared at constantly even if they are dressed extremely modestly ( as I was ) .
Some women particularly of minority ethnic origins , have stones thrown at them ( I think since I was taller than most of the men , they did n't dare with me ) .
Also if a man is staring at you , they wo n't stop staring even if you make eye contact - they think they have the right .
They would talk to me , even though it is meant to be unacceptable to talk to women they do not know .
Yes , I was aware of this behavior before I went , I am aware it is a different culture and values and I am a guest in their country etc etc but it still made me feel sick and it does n't make it right - I talked to many women who lived there and they all hated the harassment too , but they felt powerless about it .
I felt under siege .
Another sent flowers to my school and tried to negotiate with the school principal to marry me .
Urghh .
At a tourist festival , all the local men were photographing US , western women , more than we were photographing the festival itself .
The one time that was almost funny was when I was visiting a local landmark and a rich looking man started filming us even though he was with his family !
Then his wife saw and smacked him hard across the head and a torrent of verbal abuse was aimed at him by the women .
Hah !
That showed him !
It got more serious though .
There was one incident where I felt my life was genuinely threatened , when I was stranded due to circumstances beyond my control .
A man I did n't know ( whose unwanted attentions and sexual threats I had rejected ) accelerated his taxi at me , almost running me down while I was alone on a dark night and deliberately intimidating me , then drove off in the night .
In that moment my brain flashed to the attacks that 's had happened in South Africa , where a gang ran women down with cars to disable and rape them .
I was so scared and numb .
I stood for 10 minutes in the dark in the pouring rain , waiting to get in through the gate to my house ( gatekeeper was in the toilet ) , all the time thinking he was coming back .
The feral ( and sometimes rabid ) dogs prowling about added a nice atmospheric touch .
After 2 months of this , the effect on me , in addition to my other experiences , was profound .
I 'm sorry if this sounds cliche but I would be lying if I said I did n't feel tears pricking at my eyes as I typed the previous paragraph .
Since I 've returned home I 'm very sensitive to street harassment .
When I go out , I tend to wear hoodies and jeans , and do n't call attention to myself .
I walk tall and confident and with purpose , but I do n't feel that way , even though I 'm 5 ' 7 and reasonably attractive .
I keep my face blank , carry keys or perfume in my pockets ( for defence if needs be ) and my phone in other .
I tend to be hyper - vigilant and I get really angry , mostly inside , at street harassment , particularly by drunks .
My body language becomes very defensive even if a man is being respectful and friendly in showing interest in me , I blank them and turn my head away .
Even now in my mid twenties I feel vulnerable going out alone wearing skirts and dresses ( although I will with a group of friends , rarely , in house parties or places I feel safe ) , even though I love girly dresses , especially retro ones .
I want to go out and feel beautiful within myself and respected , and you know what , one day I want to meet the right guy , get married and be happy - but if keep acting this way I worry I 'll never get that close to a guy again .
Its sad but I think I have had more negative contact from guys in my life than positive .
Things are getting a little better now , I feel happier and more confident than I have in years although the emotional distance is still there .
I have travelled alone to many countries , made new friends , skydived , climbed mountains .
If you met me in a social situation you would probably never guess any of it - I would come across a pretty , friendly girl , not a wallflower .
But I have to say this - Guys , please be considerate .
Try not to be obnoxious assholes who stare and and yell and grope .
I 'm a nice , funny , person and although I try to be strong , I have a thin skin and these things still hurt me .
And it has been these little incidents , the harassment which guys do n't even seem to think about , and which still happen to me occasionally , which make it worse .

I have been trying to increase code reuse in the projects I have been doing recently .
In my first few years of coding I hardly ever got to reuse any of my code because it was always too coupled together and dependant upon other parts of the code .
So recently I have been trying to write code which I can reuse .
It has been interesting that since I have been doing this I have noticed that my library of code is starting to grow .
I have started to create more Static Helper classes with useful methods in .
I have also been removing the business logic away from any Struts actions or framework work .
To do this I have tried to do a number of things to help this and these are the sort of rules and things I do ( in no order ) to help me try and achieve this .
They are a number of rules and tips I have picked up but can't remember where from
1. Keep the code DRY .
Dry means
Do n't repeat yourself .
This is one of the main changes I have tried to bring in .
Always try to eradicate duplication and if you find any then move remove the duplication to a relevant place .
Sometimes this has lead me to create Static Helper classes or sometimes move it to the class it makes most sense to have it .
2 . Make a class / method do just one thing .
This is along the lines of the advice of giving the class only one reason to change .
This often means creating methods that other methods use but this helps to make the methods / classes simple and less coupled .
3 . Write unit tests for your classes AND make it easy to test classes .
Writing code that is easy to test is decoupled .
If you write code and are thinking about writing a unit test for it then you tend to split up the code into smaller testable chunks .
4 . Remove the business logic or main code away from any framework code .
Following the rules above will help this .
An example I have seen is code that is inside Struts Actions classes , this code is practically impossible to reuse because of all the Struts dependencies that it now linked with .
5 . Try to think more abstractly and use Interfaces and Abstract classes .
Try to hide dependencies of code behind a more Generic interface / abstract class .
The benefit this gives the code is it creates a flexible point in the code where you can then hide future changes behind .
6 . Code for extension .
Write code that can easily be extended in the future .
This is particularly true with the above point .
If you write code that uses interfaces then you can extend that interface at a later point .
7 . Do n't write code that is n't needed .
Do the simplest thing possible .
Do n't waste your time adding methods and classes that might be used in the future .
Keep the code simple and focused on what you are trying to deliver .
I think I read / heard Josh Bloch say once that " if in doubt , leave it out " .
Basically who wants to write code that no one ( including yourself ) is going to use again .
8 . Try to reduce coupling .
When writing code think about the links and coupling the code is creating , does it need to be linked to those other classes .
9 . Be more Modular - make your code more modular , think modular , be modular .
10 . Write code like your code is an External API .
Imagine the code you are writing is a self contained component .
It was n't going to be ten until I got to 8 and then thought no one writes 8 tips , lets add two more on .
It is n't really a list but it 's sort of aims and mental notes I try tell myself when writing code .
They are more small bits of code I have written recently that has helped .
I would like to hear people 's comments and especially their tips on writing reusable code

Tasteless Request - advertisement - - advertisement -
We 've dealt with Janie Hoffman over the years , and she 's a no - nonsense pro who has served Pantera , Vinnie Paul and extended family well for some time .
Below is an e-mail Janie sent in response to a licensing request from the E !
Channel to re-enact the murder of Dimebag Darrell .
Hi Beau .
I¹m leaving John¹s comments in cause he¹s a nice guy and I know this was difficult for him to send on through .
I¹m also blind copying a whole list of folks who will most likely copy a whole other list of folks until maybe this spreads like a good email should and end up on 100,000 websites to show the world what a collective bunch of tasteless morons you all are .
Dime¹s birthday is this coming Sunday and your timing couldn¹t be worse .
Not that there is a good time .
In fact , in honor of his birthday , I think I¹ll send this around to a few of our favorite music websites who will most likely print the whole damn thing word for word , including your phone number and email .
For good measure , I ¹m going to throw in the top 50 major daily music and some of the top TV writers in the country and why not , the weeklies as well .
I realize there is nothing anyone can do to stop E ! from producing garbage like this below , as you¹ve built your audience on the backs of other people¹s private lives , creating some type of warped reality out of your garbage , which is merely excuses for programming on the cheap and at the expense of others .
I would like to request that you please read this out out loud to all the creative geniuses in the programming department that came up with this idea .
...
We have received your request to license footage on Dimebag Darrell Abbott for your upcoming production of , " 25 Most Chilling Hollywood Murders . "
While we realize the average E! audience most likely has the IQ of an umbrella , they collectively are a smarter bunch than the lot of you .
Your programming creativity falls somewhere to the bottom of the middle at best , and that ¹s saying a lot .
I ask that you all please take a moment from your busy days and close your eyes .
Live out the fantasy of playing your favorite instrument onstage .
Your closest friends in the world surround you , either in the band or in your crew .
From one side of the stage , a man approaches .
Thinking he¹s a security guy or a drunk fan who¹s just a bit out a line , you continue to perform .
Two seconds later , he lifts his arms , aims a rifle at your brother , your best friend , your buddy and blows his brains out , not three feet from where you are .
In the nanosecond it takes you to comprehend the magnitude of what just happened , he does it again ... and again ... and again ... and again ... and again ... and again before taking aim and murdering additional members of your extended family as well as fans that have come to see you play .
Two of your crew are shot but survive , but of course , will never be the same gain .
Now imagine it¹s a few years later and you turn on the TV set .
Just in case you may be having at least a five minute respite from that scene that plays over and over in your head , just in case ..... you flip through the channels and there it is .
Again .
Only with some two bit actor who thinks this is his big Hollywood break .
And please , if you don¹t like that scenario , make believe it¹s your child who got his brains splattered all over a stage in Ohio .
And then you turn on E !
Oh , the magic of television !
In case none of this appears clear enough and you need a definitive answer to your request ... no .
The answer if no , and on behalf of everyone that was there that night and everyone that misses him every day , you can take that no and shove it up your collective asses .
And , for your second request , yes , you can quote me on that .
Sincerely ,
Jane Hoffman Kick ass , Janie .
Enjoy the rants .

増井俊之さんは、ソニーコンピュータサイエンス研究所に在籍していたころに、現在も多くの携帯電話に搭載されている文章入力システム「POBox」を開発。これによって2005年に「第4回ドコモ・モバイル・サイエンス賞」を受賞した。その後もユーザーインタフェースの分野で研究やソフトウェア開発を続けている。情報整理にも独自の考え方を持ち「適当な道具がなければ自作する」という考え方だ。
増井さんの全情報を握るサーバと、そこにあるWiki
愛用 のLet 's note R3でなんでもメモする増井さん
増井さんは、どこにいても小型軽量 のLet's note R3でメモを取る。テキストエディタは自分で機能を追加したEmacsを使う。ネットが使える環境になったら、メモは増井さんがすべての情報を置いているサーバ内の自作Wikiにアップロードする。このWikiは、メモ・日記・ToDoリスト・スケジュール管理のために使っており、テキスト形式で入力するが、出力の形式はさまざまだ。例えば、スケジュールならば入力した内容をカレンダー表示にできる。この「お手製Wiki」は、増井さんのサイト内にデモが公開されている。
このサーバで管理しているデータはほかにもある。プログラムや文章の管理には、Subversionというバージョン管理ソフトウェアを使っている。バージョン管理ソフトウェアとは、複数人でプログラムを開発するときによく使われるもので、プログラムを変更するたびに、それを1つのバージョンとして、変更を加えた時間と変更内容を保存しておき、必要があれば過去のバージョンに巻き戻したりできるものだ。一般に、プログラマーがこういったバージョン管理システムに慣れると、まとまった文章を書くときも同じ仕組みで管理するのが便利だと思うことが多いようだ。
また、写真の整理のために 、Flickrに似た写真整理システムを自作した。それぞれの写真にタグを付けて整理できるところはFlickrと同じだが、違いは、写真を撮った位置（緯度と経度）を登録しておき、地図から「この近所で撮った写真」を呼び出せることだ。面白かった本についても自作の蔵書管理システム「本棚.org」に登録する。本棚.orgは、増井さんだけが使えるものではなく、誰でもサービス内に「自分の本棚」を作り、持っている本や好きな本を登録できる。2004年7月にスタートした本棚.orgは、その後続々と登場した「ブクログ」や「 MONO+List」など、アマゾンなどの商品写真を使い、ユーザーごとにモノを登録できるサービスのはしりと言えるだろう。さらに現在は「 Wikiとソーシャルブックマークの中間のようなソフトウェアを開発中」だという。
「 RSSリーダーとmixi見てると仕事ができない 」
そんな増井さんは、どのように情報を収集しているのだろうか。「RSSリーダーはFreshReaderを使っていますが、どんどん読んでしまって困っています。重要度をつけていかないといけないのだろうなと思います。これとmixiを交代に見ているともう一日何もできなくなりますね（笑）。これを見ないで集中する心の強さが必要です」とネット中毒ぶりを明かす。
FreshReaderには、ある単語を登録しておくと「gooブログ検索」などのフィード検索サービスを利用し、その単語が見つかったら通知してくれるという機能があるが、「やはり評判は気になりますからね」と、増井さんは自分の名前を登録している。増井さんのブログにも、直接コメントはしないが、はてなブックマークにはなにか書くという人が存在するので、自分が見ているページにつけられているはてなブックマークコメントを同時に表示させるFirefoxのGreasemonkeyスクリプトを使っている。
「 最近は、電車待ちなどちょっとした時間にも、携帯でmixiを見てしまうので、いかんなぁと思っています。あとは、iRiver
U10で動画を見たりもします。最近は『涼宮ハルヒ』シリーズを見ていますよ」と、若い世代の話題にもキャッチアップしている。
「 メールはもうダメですね、時代遅れですよ」
メールを使った情報整理法は一般に人気があるが、「メールはもうダメですね、このシステムはすでに時代遅れだと思います」と増井さんは否定的だ。スパムと、メールの送信元を詐称できることが2つの大きな問題点だ。さらに、届いたかどうか・読まれたかどうかが送り手に分からないこと、スケジュール調整などをメールのやりとりで決めるとメールの流量が増えて煩雑になること、そして相手のアドレスを知らなければメールを送れないこと、を挙げる。
「 メールにとって代わるより良い手段があったら、いつ乗り換えが起こっても不思議ではありません」
一方、紙の情報整理は苦手だという。 「 紙の整理はうまくできていません。でも最近は、紙でもらうものは減りましたよね。名刺とパンフレット程度ではないでしょうか。論文も以前は紙で来ましたが、現在はPDFになりました。ScanSnapも買ったのですが（8月8日の記事参照）、まだ使いこなせていない状態です」と明かす。
サイクロンで有名な掃除機メーカー、英dysonの創業社長など、「エンジニアとか『発明おじさん』のような人が好きで、そういう人が出てくる本をよく読みます」という増井さん。一方で生活を便利にしたり、新しい発想に気づかせてくれるソフトウェアを次々と生み出す増井さんもまた「ITの発明おじさん」と呼ばれるのにふさわしい人物だ。

A bipartisan array of constitutional law scholars has published " A Letter to Congress " ( New York Review of Books , Feb. 8 ) assailing the DOJ 's apology for Bush 's secret , illegal program of domestic surveillance .
The authors include Walter Dellinger , Ronald Dworkin , Richard Epstein , Harold Koh , William S. Sessions ( former FBI director ) , Geoffrey Stone , Kathleen Sullivan , Lawrence Tribe , and William Van Alstyne .
Responding to the DOJ's Dec. 19 , 2005 , White Paper and related transmissions to members of Congress , the Letter begins :
[ T ]he Justice Department 's defense of what it concedes was secret and warrantless electronic surveillance of persons within the United States fails to identify any plausible legal authority for such surveillance .
Accordingly the program appears on its face to violate existing law .
The basic legal question here is not new .
In 1978 , after an extensive investigation of the privacy violations associated with foreign intelligence surveillance programs , Congress and the President enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) ....
FISA comprehensively regulates electronic surveillance within the United States , striking a careful balance between protecting civil liberties and preserving the " vitally important government purpose " of obtaining valuable intelligence in order to safeguard national security . " ...
With minor exceptions , FISA authorizes electronic surveillance only upon certain specified showings , and only if approved by a court .
The statute specifically allows for warrantless wartime domestic electronic surveillance — but only for the first fifteen days of a war .
50 U.S.C. § 1811 .
It makes criminal any electronic surveillance not authorized by statute , id .
§ 1809 ; and it expressly establishes FISA and specified provisions of the federal criminal code ( which govern wiretaps for criminal investigation ) as the " exclusive means by which electronic surveillance ... may be conducted , " 18 U.S.C. § 2511 ( 2 ) ( f ) ( emphasis added ) .
The Department of Justice concedes that the NSA program was not authorized by any of the above provisions .
It maintains , however , that the program did not violate existing law because Congress implicitly authorized the NSA program when it enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) against al - Qaeda ....
But the AUMF cannot reasonably be construed to implicitly authorize warrantless electronic surveillance in the United States during wartime , where Congress has expressly and specifically addressed that precise question in FISA and limited any such warrantless surveillance to the first fifteen days of war .
The Letter goes on to demolish an alternative argument floated by the Gonzales DOJ : that the Bush program is legal because the President possesses inherent power during wartime to gather " signals intelligence " secretly and without warrant .
Why not simply apply for FISA warrants , post - facto if necessary ?
Anticipating Bush 's red - faced answer ( here ) , Washingtonpost.com blogger William M. Arkin has suggested -- in " The Curious Section 126 of the PATRIOT Act " ( Dec. 23 , 2005 ) -- that " the government decided after 9/11 to monitor everyone , " by high - tech methods of " pattern - based data - mining " that can sift through
massive databases of non-publicly available data ; both proprietary databases and [ the NSA 's ] own compiled intelligence and law enforcement databases to " search " for terrorists and terrorist connections .
In this program , the subject of monitoring is not one individual but everyone .
The " reasonable suspicion " standard under FISA could readily be met by data - mined patterns of past electronic transactions with persons overseas -- but only if the nature and extent of the data - mining were made know in the application .
The reason why Bush and his " operators " decided to ignore FISA , Arkin guesses , was that
the government could n't go to the Court or the Congress and say , " hey , we 'd like to monitor everyone on a fishing expedition to find the next Mohamed Atta . "
... not even to a Republican Court or Congress .

The alliance between George Bush and Tony Blair is in danger after it was revealed that the Prime Minister believes the President has ' let him down badly ' over the Middle East crisis .
A senior Downing Street source said that , privately , Mr Blair broadly agrees with John Prescott , who said Mr Bush 's record on the issue was ' crap ' .
The source said : " We all feel badly let down by Bush .
We thought we had persuaded him to take the Israel - Palestine situation seriously , but we were wrong .
How can anyone have faith in a man of such low intellect ? "
The disclosure comes ahead of a mini recall of Parliament to allow MPs to vent their fury over Mr Blair 's handling of Israel 's war with Hezbollah and whether the recent terror plot in Britain was affected by his role in the Iraq war .
Foreign Affairs Minister Kim Howells , who has criticised Israeli attacks on women and children , is to be summoned before an emergency meeting next month of the Labour - dominated Commons foreign affairs select committee .
The highly unusual move to allow a Parliament evidence session during the summer recess mirrors emergency meetings called after the July 7 bombings in London .
The rift between No10 and the White House stems from British anger that Mr Bush failed to do enough to pursue the ' road map ' to peace between the Israelis and Palestinians , which he approved , at Mr Blair 's instigation , on the eve of the Iraq war .
" We have been banging on at them for three years about the need to address the Palestinian problem but they just wo n't engage , " said a senior Government insider .
" That is one of the reasons there is such a mess now . "
It is understood Mr Blair hopes to undertake a highly controversial one - man mission to the Middle East when he returns from his holiday , including a trip to war - torn Lebanon .
Until now , the Prime Minister has given Mr Bush 100 per cent backing on all foreign policy issues since the Iraq war in 2003 .
But Mr Blair 's refusal to distance himself publicly from the White House 's all - out support for Israel 's attacks on Hezbollah guerillas in Lebanon has enraged Labour MPs and several Ministers .
However , a Downing Street official said : " We believe our best approach is to use our influence with the American government to persuade them of the importance of making progress to achieve peace in the Middle East . "
Mr Blair 's advisers say his portrayal by critics as Mr Bush 's ' poodle ' is a travesty and claim he gets results by hammering out their differences in private .
But they do not deny that , behind the facade of public support , Downing Street 's patience with Mr Bush has never been stretched so far .
The decision by the foreign affairs committee to stage its emergency debate on September 13 - after Mr Blair opposed calls for a full recall of Parliament - is a further reflection of backbench unrest .
MPs have been demanding that the Government explains its stance on the crisis , which saw Mr Blair back Israel 's use of force against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon which has left hundreds of civilians dead and thousands homeless .
Mr Howells will be questioned over the Government 's handling of the crisis , which has seen the Cabinet deeply divided over Israel 's actions .
He will also be asked to update MPs on the latest UN peacekeeping efforts which will see thousands of international troops deployed into a buffer zone on the Israel - Lebanon border .
Labour committee member Eric Illsley confirmed that the committee would take evidence from Mr Howells on September 13 .
He said : " There has been a public clamour for a full recall of Parliament . "
Meanwhile John Prescott has been involved in another foul - mouthed incident over Tony Blair 's policy on the Middle East , it was claimed last night .
He is said to have had a heated exchange with Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer , one of the few Cabinet Ministers to defend Mr Blair 's stance on Israel 's war with Hezbollah , when the conflict was raised during a Cabinet meeting and Lord Falconer denied that Ministers had disagreed on the issue .
Mr Prescott , one of the Ministers who led the revolt , allegedly snapped at Lord Falconer : " Of course they f****** did , you were f****** there . "
Spam e-mail can affect the price of stocks and shares
E-mails typically promote penny shares in the hope of convincing people to buy into a company to raise its price .
People who respond to the " pump and dump " scam can lose 8 % of their investment in two days .
Conversely , the spammers who buy low - priced stock before sending the e-mails , typically see a return of between 4.9 % and 6 % when they sell .
The study recently published on the Social Science Research Network say their conclusions prove the hypothesis that spammers " buy low and spam high " .
The researchers say that approximately 730 million spam e-mails are sent every week , 15 % of which tout stocks .
Other estimates of spam volumes are far higher .
Mass marketing
The study , by Professor Laura Frieder of Purdue University in the US and Professor Jonathan Zittrain from Oxford University 's Internet Institute in the UK , analysed more than 75,000 unsolicited e-mails .
All of the messages touting stocks and shares were sent between January 2004 and July 2005 .
Our analysis shows that spam works
Professors Frieder and Zittrain
The e-mail messages had either been received by Professor Zittrain or been posted on a newsgroup , known as Nanas .
Nanas is used to alert network administrators about new spam messages and the action they can take against them .
The researchers were then able to compare the estimated size of an e-mail campaign with trading activity and share prices immediately before and after the first arrival of a spam message .
The team found that a spammer who bought shares the day before starting an e-mail campaign and then sold them the day after could make a return on his or her investment of 4.9 % .
" If he or she were to be a particularly effective spammer , returns to this strategy would be roughly 6 % , " they wrote .
Conversely , if someone who received the message chose to invest $ 1000 ( £ 530 ) in a promoted company they would be left with $ 947.50 after two days .
Victims of a large e-mail campaign could be left with $ 930 after two days .
On average a victim loses $ 52.50 for every $ 1000 invested .
However , real losses would be even greater , the team suggest , because the victim would also have had to have paid fees to buy and sell the shares .
" Our analysis shows that spam works , " the team wrote .
" Among its millions of recipients are not only those who read it , but who also act upon it "
Security firms advise e-mail users to install a spam filter , delete unsolicited messages and never to respond to offers .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 29  The Justice Department is investigating whether the director of a multibillion - dollar oil - trading program at the Interior Department has been paid as a consultant for oil companies hoping for contracts .
The director of the program and three subordinates , all based in Denver , have been transferred to different jobs and have been ordered to cease all contacts with the oil industry until the investigation is completed some time next spring , according to officials involved .
The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation had not been announced publicly , said investigators were worried that senior government officials had been steering huge oil - trading contracts to favored companies .
Any such favoritism would probably reduce the money that the federal government receives on nearly $ 4 billion worth of oil and gas , because it would reduce competition among companies that compete to sell the fuel on behalf of the government .
It 's not just cool , though , it 's prescient .
The vlog has been up and running for 14 months , but it 's only in the last two that Web video has become new media 's favorite new medium -- since Apple Computer 's iTunes online store began stocking vlogs , calling them video podcasts and making it easy to download them for free viewing on the new iPods .
In fact , the day Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , introduced the video iPod to developers , he showed a playlist of video podcasts on his computer .
Rocketboom was at the top .
In case you 're wondering , it has occurred to Mr. Baron and Ms. Congdon that they just might be sitting on a gold mine .
At a cost of about $ 20 an episode , they reach an audience that some days is roughly comparable in size to that of , say , CNN 's late , unlamented " Crossfire " political debate show .
They have no background in business , but Jeff Jarvis , who tracks developments in technology and culture on his blog , BuzzMachine.com ( and who has served as a consultant to The New York Times on Web matters ) , pointed out to them that they might be able to charge $ 8,000 for an interactive ad at the end of the show , which would bring in about $ 2 million annually .
The financial opportunity here has occurred to others , too .
TiVo , which can now be used to watch Web video on home television sets , just signed a deal to list Rocketboom in the TiVo directory -- making it as easy to record as conventional television programs like " 60 Minutes " and " Monday Night Football . "
Giving up no creative control , Ms. Congdon and Mr. Baron will get 50 percent of the revenue from ads sold by TiVo to appear before and after their newscast , and their show will gain access to more than 300,000 TV sets connected to those new TiVo boxes .
( That wo n't include Mr. Baron , though , since he gave up watching television years ago , and does n't even own a set .
He briefly considered buying one this year , but the thought passed .
" I guess I 'm going to hold out , " he said . )
THE rapid expansion in the number of vlogs and Web sites offering video podcasts strongly suggests how bored viewers are getting with standard commercial TV : a growing number of them are willing to seek out alternatives online , or just create one themselves .
As recently as a year ago there were fewer than two dozen active vlogs .
In mid-October , just after Mr. Jobs name - checked Rocketboom , and Apple added the category of " Video Podcast " to the default menu of the new iPod , the site Vlogmap.org showed 415 vlogs worldwide .
A month later Mefeedia.com , a site that allows users to watch and subscribe to vlogs , had 1,100 sites in its directory .
Two weeks after that Mefeedia boasted of " 2,017 vlogs and counting . "
Rocketboom includes reports from vloggers both near ( Boston ) and far ( Prague ) , with regular contributors based in Los Angeles , Minneapolis and " the German - speaking part of Europe . "
Many of the world 's other vlogs are closer in form to diaries or home movies -- with all the tedium that can imply .
Still , some have their fans , such as the filmmaker Ross McElwee , whose personal documentaries , including " Sherman 's March , " have elevated the home movie into a serious art form .
" Most of the vlogs are quite boring , " he said recently by e-mail , " but now and then there is one that for some reason seems to have something special . "
Mr. McElwee cited one called Mom's Brag Vlog that documents events like trick - or - treating at the mall and a spider spinning a web outside a family 's house .
" It 's so mundane and down - to - earth that it 's charming , " he said , " in small doses . "
An important principle of Web architecture is that all important resources be identifiable by URI .
The finding discusses the relationship between the URI addressability of a resource and the choice between HTTP GET and POST methods with HTTP URIs .
HTTP GET promotes URI addressability so , designers should adopt it for safe operations such as simple queries .
POST is appropriate for other types of applications where a user request has the potential to change the state of the resource ( or of related resources ) .
The finding explains how to choose between HTTP GET and POST for an application taking into account architectural , security , and practical considerations .
The terms MUST , SHOULD , and SHOULD NOT are used in this document in accordance with [ RFC2119 ] .
Additional TAG findings , both approved and in draft state , may also be available .
The TAG expects to incorporate this and other findings into a Web Architecture Document that will be published according to the process of the W3C Recommendation Track .
This is the 21 March 2004 revision of this finding .
It has been approved by the TAG .
At their 2 March 2004 face - to - face meeting , the TAG resolved to approve this version of the finding with one change from the previous version , the addition of a link to ongoing work in the W3C Web Services Description Working Group , in section 6 .
The 21 March 2004 revision supersedes the 22 Sep 2003 version of this finding , which the TAG had previously approved .
1 Introduction
In this finding , we discuss when it is appropriate to use HTTP GET and when it is appropriate to use HTTP POST , and the architectural principles behind the separation of these two methods .
In the introduction , we present scenarios that illustrate some of the topics covered , summarize the relevant principles of Web Architecture , and provide a quick checklist for choosing GET or POST .
Following that , we discuss the benefits of URI addressability , which is the primary reason for distinguishing GET from POST .
We then characterize safe interactions , when the use of GET is encouraged .
However , when considering GET or POST , designers should also remain aware of considerations for sensitive data such as passwords or credit card information , and other practical considerations .
1.1 Scenarios Scenario 1 : Dan purchases a new wireless telephone and wishes to share information about it with his colleagues .
Following the clue " CAT . NO. 43-893 " on the bottom of the phone , Dan visits the Web site of the phone manufacturer .
Typing the catalog number in the site 's search box , Dan pulls up the relevant information .
However , since the site designers created a POST Web form instead of a GET Web form for this read - only operation , Dan cannot bookmark the query , or send the query to his colleagues ( who are potential customers ) as a URI , or gain any of the other benefits made possible by the proper use of HTTP GET .
The Web site designer should have provided GET access to the catalog information ; see the benefits of URI addressability .
Scenario 2 : My bank allows me to read current information about my checking account over the Web .
The URI they provide me for this access includes my account number .
This is sensitive information I do not want to appear in the URI since , for example , when I follow a link from the bank Web site to the site of their advertiser , my account information may appear in the advertiser 's server logs .
Rather than moving my account number from the URI into the body of a POST request , my bank allows me to establish a secure HTTP connection .
Not only do I feel more confident retrieving information over a secure connection , my browser knows not to expose sensitive information to the next site I visit after the secure connection .
As a result , I can still bookmark my account page without revealing sensitive information .
For more information , see the considerations for sensitive data .
1.2 Relevant Principles of Web Architecture
All important resources SHOULD be identifiable by URI .
HTTP GET is safe ; i.e. , agents do not incur obligations by following links .
1.3 Quick Checklist for Choosing HTTP GET or POST Use GET if :
The interaction is more like a question ( i.e. , it is a safe operation such as a query , read operation , or lookup ) .
Use POST if :
The interaction is more like an order , or The interaction changes the state of the resource in a way that the user would perceive ( e.g. , a subscription to a service ) , or The user be held accountable for the results of the interaction .
However , before the final decision to use HTTP GET or POST , please also consider considerations for sensitive data and practical considerations .
2 The Benefits of URI Addressability Web architecture starts with Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) , whose generic syntax is defined by [ RFC2396 ] .
The Web relies on global agreement to follow the rules of URIs so that we can refer to things on the Web , access them , describe them , and share them .
Providing a URI for a resource affords many advantages , including : linking
bookmarking
caching
As described in [ TBL50K ] , " Great multiplicative power of reuse derives from the fact that all languages use URIs as identifiers :
This allows things written in one language to refer to things defined in another language .
The use of URIs allows a language to leverage the many forms of persistence , identity , and various forms of equivalence . "
In this finding , the term " URI addressability " means that a URI alone is sufficient for an agent to carry out a particular type of interaction .
In some cases , it may be desirable to interact in different ways with the resource identified by a URI .
For example , the W3C link checking service illustrates the usefulness of separating URIs from methods .
The link checker works as follows ( ignoring recursive link checking for this discussion ) : for each HTTP URI that is part of a link in an HTML or XHTML document , the link checker uses the HEAD method to gather information about the resource identified by the URI .
As the HTTP / 1.1 specification states , " The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message - body in the response . "
By using HEAD instead of GET , the link checker does not ask for more bits than it requires to do its job .
The Web architecture thus allows for the separation of URIs and methods .
A URI 's scheme determines a set of interaction methods .
For instance , the HTTP URI scheme is defined in HTTP / 1.1 [ RFC2616 ] , which allows " an open - ended set of methods and headers that indicate the purpose of a request .
It builds on the discipline of reference provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier ( URI ) ... for indicating the resource to which a method is to be applied . " ; refer to section 1.1 .
There are costs to separating URIs and methods , however .
The separation means that some metadata required for the interaction may not be part of the URI , and as a result , the URI alone is no longer sufficient for an agent to carry out the interaction .
URI addressability is lost .
In the following section we look more closely at when to use HTTP GET ( since it promotes URI accessibility ) and when to use HTTP POST .
3 Safe Interactions Section 9.1 of HTTP / 1.1 discusses safe interactions .
A safe interaction is one where the user is not to be held accountable for the result of the interaction .
Safe interactions are important because these are interactions where users can browse with confidence and where software programs ( e.g. , search engines and browsers that pre-cache data for the user ) can follow links safely .
Users ( or software agents acting on their behalf ) do not commit themselves to anything by querying a resource or following a link .
For example , Web sites that say " by following the link to ABC , you agree to the following terms and conditions " do not account for the fact that anyone ( in particular , a search service ) can make another link to ABC , and anyone who follows this other link to ABC may never have seen the terms and conditions .
See the related TAG finding " Deep Linking in the World Wide Web " [ DEEPLINK ] .
By distinguishing safe from " unsafe " interactions ( i.e. , those where the user should be accountable for a particular interaction ) at the protocol level : Clients can inform users when a particular action will have consequences ( e.g. , subscription to a list , payment of a fee , cancellation of a contract , etc . )
In section 9.1.1 , the HTTP / 1.1 specification states , " Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in their interactions over the Internet , and should be careful to allow the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an unexpected significance to themselves or others .
Intermediaries ( e.g. , caches ) can safely process on behalf of the user .
In the same section , HTTP / 1.1 states , the convention is that GET is used for safe interactions and SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval .
Indeed , if you use GET for interactions with side - effects , your make your system insecure .
For example , a malicious Web page publisher outside a firewall might put a URI in an HTML page so that , when someone inside the firewall unwittingly follows the link , that person activates a function on another system within the firewall .
Users accept obligations through other mechanisms than requests to follow a link .
Per the HTTP / 1.1 specification , designers should use HTTP POST for those interactions .
HTTP GET is designed so that all information necessary for the interaction is part of the URI , thus promoting URI addressability .
With HTTP POST , some information intended to affect change to the resource state may be part of the protocol headers , not in the URI .
With this approach , the resulting URI for identifying the resource may be shorter , but the advantages of URI addressability are lost .
Note that it is possible to use POST even without supplying data in an HTTP message body .
In this case , the resource is URI addressable , but the POST method indicates to clients that the interaction is unsafe or may have side - effects .
By convention , when GET method is used , all information required to identify the resource is encoded in the URI .
There is no convention in HTTP / 1.1 for a safe interaction ( e.g. , retrieval ) where the client supplies data to the server in an HTTP entity body rather than in the query part of a URI .
This means that for safe operations , URIs may be long .
The case of large parameters to a safe operation is not directly addressed by HTTP as it is presently deployed .
A QUERY or " safe POST " or " GET with BODY " method has been discussed ( e.g. , at the December 1996 IETF meeting ) but no consensus has emerged .
WebDAV [ RFC2518 ] uses a different HTTP method , PROPFIND ( section 8.1 PROPFIND ) , for querying properties of resources ; unfortunately , this provides no URI for the results of these queries .
Other work on identification of safe interactions includes the experimental RFC " The Safe Response Header Field " [ RFC2310 ] .
3.1 Examples of using GET and POST
In section 9.5 , the HTTP / 1.1 specification lists some example applications where POST should be used due to side - effects , including annotation of existing resources ; posting a message to a bulletin board , newsgroup , mailing list , or similar group of articles ; and extending a database through an append operation .
Whether and how one chooses between GET and POST depends on the format specification and the application context .
When HTTP URIS are used for hyperlinks in HTML , SMIL , and SVG , for example , the application determines which method will be used ( generally GET ) .
However , for both HTML forms and XForms , the author can choose between GET and POST .
One implication is that HTML application designers should implement " unsafe " operations ( or others requiring POST ) with a form , even if the application does not call for user input .
3.1.1 Mailing List Subscription Consider the following two designs for mailing list subscription confirmation .
Design 1 : The user sends a subscribe message to an administrative mailbox ( mylist-request@example.org ) .
The list processing software sends an email response to the user , requesting that the user confirm the subscription request , and including a link to a confirmation page .
The user follows this link to the confirmation page , and finds a form with a button to " [ Confirm ] your subscription " .
The form is submitted with method = " POST " .
The user activates the [ Confirm ] form control .
The list processing software confirms the subscription .
Design 2 ( incorrect ) : same as 1 above same as 2 above
The user follows the link to the confirmation page and and is informed " your subscription is confirmed " .
The latter design performed an unsafe operation ( list subscription ) in response to a request with a safe method ( following the link from the mail message with GET ) .
If the user 's mail agent pre-fetched pages to speed up browsing , the subscription would be confirmed without the knowledge and consent of the user ; the HTTP / 1.1 specification makes it clear that the fault is with the server in this case ; the user 's mail agent is free to follow links without incurring obligations .
3.1.2 Steps for Establishing an Obligation
To establish obligations of confidentiality ( or payment , or licensing terms , etc. ) , designers should follow this protocol :
The client requests access to materials that can only be viewed by people who agree to certain confidentiality terms .
The server declines , with an " authorization required " notice and a link to an account application form .
The client follows the link to the form , and applies for an account , agreeing to the terms and conditions in a POST request ( or by fax or postal mail , for that matter ) .
The server provides credentials in response .
The client re-requests the materials , providing credentials .
Similarly , an individual might agree to terms and conditions by signing a contract with an employer or other organization , after which the person might legitimately incur an obligation through some interaction ( e.g. , following a link ) covered by the terms of the agreement .
3.1.3 Side -effects do not Imply Unsafe Interactions
Some user interactions cause side effects ( i.e. , they change the state of the server ) but are safe interactions .
When a server is configured to count and display the number of visitors to a site , each user interaction increments a counter .
Users do not commit themselves to anything through this sort of interaction , so it is safe .
4 Considerations for Sensitive Data Some
Web interactions involve sensitive data , such as passwords , credit card numbers , social security numbers , and bank account numbers ( as in scenario 2 ) .
To protect information carried by either GET or POST operations , it is often appropriate to use an underlying secure protocol such as the Secure Socket Layer [ SSL3 ] .
By using GET over SSL for safe operations , designers retain some of the benefits of URI addressability , even if they lose others ( e.g. , caching ) .
Designers do need to consider the costs of using SSL , such as : Time required to establish an SSL connection .
Memory required on the server to create a novel copy of ( encrypted ) data for each request .
In situations where the use of such protocols for security is inappropriate , designers MAY use POST to carry credentials or other information needed to authenticate an otherwise safe operation .
For instance , a designer may require security beyond the protocol layer into the application layer ( e.g. , because software or data queues within a server site are not trusted , or because the application requires credentials not supported at a lower layer ) .
When the use of SSL is impractical , it may still be possible to keep some sensitive data out of a URI .
For instance , designers can communicate authentication information in HTTP headers rather than in the query part of a URI .
Broad issues of data protection such as preventing unauthorized access to an individuals ' bookmarks ( or cookies , for that matter ) lie beyond the scope of Web architecture .
5 Practical Considerations
Web application design should be informed by the above principles , but also by the relevant limitations .
For instance , when designing a service that operates on a resource via URI , consider whether there are use cases where such operation would be inappropriate .
For example , the W3C HTML validation service allows for two scenarios ( both using HTML forms ) .
With the " safe " option , validation requests are done via a URI ; the form uses GET , which gives the results a URI for bookmarks , links , etc .
The second option allows clients to upload a document for validation .
The form uses POST for that option , since : the document to be validated might be confidential ; any link to the results of validating it ( at the public W3C Web site ) would divulge its contents .
a URI that encoded the entire document would be at least as large as the document , and there 's little or no use in linking to it , since the results will always be the same .
Whether or not GET with HTTP is used for the initial access , supplying a URI for subsequent access to the same information , e.g. , using Content - Location , is useful .
5.1 Internationalization Designers of HTML forms that accept non-ASCII characters have been challenged by some implementation limitations and gaps in specifications .
Implementation limitations are length - related .
Section section 17.13.4 of HTML 4.01 [ HTML401 ] on multipart / form - data says , " The content type " application /x-www - form-urlencoded " is inefficient for sending large quantities of binary data or text containing non-ASCII characters . "
This inefficiency is due to the octet - to - %hh escape conversion , combined with the fact that many characters need more than one octet to be encoded .
But while somewhat inefficient , this is not a real obstacle to using GET for non-ASCII characters .
A more serious problem is that the mapping between characters and octets is not clearly specified beyond US - ASCII ; refer to section 2.1 of [ RFC2396 ] .
For query parts resulting from filling in an HTML form , the default is to use the character encoding of the form .
The definition of the accept - charset attribute on the form element in HTML 4.01 says , " The default value for this attribute is the reserved string ' UNKNOWN ' .
User agents may interpret this value as the character encoding that was used to transmit the document containing this FORM element . "
The general direction to address this limitation is to converge to using UTF - 8 for the mapping between characters and octets .
The use of UTF - 8 is already defined in various specifications , and we expect it to be adopted in future specifications and further deployed in due course .
For instance , we expect XForms to specify that the encoding to be used in query parts is always UTF - 8 . 5.2 Ephemeral Limitations
While Web application design must take into account the limitations of technology that is widely deployed at present , it should not treat these as architectural invariants .
The following is a list of limitations have already been largely resolved , or are likely to fade away as bugs are fixed and the scope of interoperable specifications expands .
URIs cannot be longer than 256 characters
This was a limitation in some server implementations , and while servers continue to have limitations to prevent denial - of - service attacks , they are generally at least 4000 characters , and they evolve as the legitimate uses of application developers evolve .
GET requests are re-executed when the user uses the back button .
This is not by design .
Section 13.13 of [ RFC2616 ] states : " History mechanisms and caches are different .
In particular history mechanisms SHOULD NOT try to show a semantically transparent view of the current state of a resource .
Rather , a history mechanism is meant to show exactly what the user saw at the time when the resource was retrieved . "
If I visit a page via a secure protocol , and then follow a link to another page , the second site may have access to sensitive data in a URI .
This is not by design .
Section 15.1.3 of [ RFC2616 ] states : " Because the source of a link might be private information or might reveal an otherwise private information source , it is strongly recommended that the user be able to select whether or not the " Referer " [ sic ] field is sent .
For example , a browser client could have a toggle switch for browsing openly / anonymously , which would respectively enable / disable the sending of Referer and From information .
Clients SHOULD NOT include a Referer header field in a ( non-secure ) HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol . "
Search services will not index anything with a " ? " in the URI .
This was a heuristic to avoid infinite loops in some search service crawlers , but it was not an architectural constraint , and modern search services use more sophisticated heuristics to avoid loops .
6 Ongoing Work on GET in Web Services
Since the first publication of this finding , W3 C's XML Protocol Working Group has enhanced SOAP Version 1.2 to support use of GET for safe operations ( cf. section 4.1.2 of [ SOAPADJUNCTS ] . )
Specific conventions are also now suggested for use of GET in conjunction with SOAP Remote Procedure Calls ( also in section 4.1.2 )
The SOAP HTTP binding ( cf. section 7 of [ SOAPADJUNCTS ] ) has been modified accordingly , and thus supports appropriate use of GET and POST in conjunction with the SOAP RPC Representation ( cf. section 4 of [ SOAPADJUNCTS ] ) , as well as for non-RPC SOAP Request / Response messages ( cf. section 6.2 and section 6.3 of [ SOAPADJUNCTS ] ) .
Indeed , non-normative conventions are suggested which allow traditional Web servers ( i.e. , those not specifically enabled for SOAP support ) to interoperate with SOAP clients using GET and resource representations in media type application / soap+xml ( cf. section 7.1.3 of [ SOAPADJUNCTS ] ) .
Section 3 WSDL 1.2 Bindings [ WSDL ] provides a binding to HTTP GET , which makes it possible to respect the principle of using GET for safe operations .
However , to represent safety in a more straightforward manner , it should be a property of operations themselves , not just a feature of bindings .
As of publication of this document , the W3C Web Services Description Working Group has plans to specify a " safe " attribute for this purpose ; see their issue 117 for more information .
7 Future Work Reviewers of this finding asked about its applicability to HTTP PUT .
Rather than address this question in this version of the finding , the TAG expects to address PUT semantics as part of issue putMediaType - 38 : " Relation of HTTP PUT to GET , and whether client headers to server are authoritative . "
President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles believed that Nasser should be overthrown — some day .
Repeatedly they told the British and French that it would be a mistake to use force , at least at the moment .
But Britain and France were already planning how they might use force .
Frenchmen imagined that Algeria ’s revolt against them , launched in 1954 , was inspired by Nasser , and that without him it would collapse .
Britons found themselves losing control of Jordan because of Nasser , and believed that without him they could regain control .

There was more to it .
The Western leaders had irrationally come to regard Nasser as dangerous , a Hitler or a Mussolini .
Prime Minister Anthony Eden of Britain was typical : a Foreign Office Arabist by background who moved in circles where it was felt that Arabs loved Englishmen , Eden believed that Nasser had somehow stolen that love .
It was Nasser , he thought , who had taken away Jordan ’s famed Arab Legion from its British officers .
“ I want him killed , ” Eden said .
So for months the allies had been conspiring .
They would return to the Middle East , and they would invade Egypt .
The confiscation of the canal company spurred them into action .
Eden , Prime Minister Guy Mollet of France and his foreign secretary , Christian Pineau , joined by a number of colleagues , hatched a plot based on an earlier plan for France and Israel to act together , and in which Britain now joined .
In October 1956 , Israel attacked Egypt through Sinai and drove to Suez .
Britain and France then invaded , occupying the canal and claiming to be separating the Egyptian and Israeli Armies .
The British , French and Israelis stuck to their prefabricated story , but their collusion was evident ; soon they had to admit the truth .
The Americans had been kept in the dark , and they took it personally .
Eisenhower in particular was angered by British wartime colleagues who had lied and deceived him .
“ What does Anthony think he is doing ? ” Eisenhower demanded .
“ Why is he doing this to me ? ”
He refused to listen to excuses , claiming that “ nothing justified double - crossing the United States . ”
The Soviet leader , Nikita Khrushchev , grandstanded , threatening the Western imperialists .
That enabled him to take credit for stopping the Europeans — even though it really was America that did it .
The United States acted quietly but effectively .
The Treasury Department threatened to withdraw support of the British currency unless the British Army left Egypt .
Within 10 days , England would have collapsed financially .
The British — and the invasion — stopped .
To keep from being thought imperialists , the Eisenhower administration saved Nasser .
The Suez crisis was over .
Britain and France had gone to war in order to keep their empires ; instead , they lost them .
The United States had aimed to keep Russia out of the Middle East , but the Suez crisis , and Khrushchev ’s rhetoric , brought the Russians in .
Eisenhower and Dulles believed that by their actions at Suez they were showing the nonaligned nations that , unlike the British and French , Americans were not imperialists — but the third world remained unconvinced .
And in Europe , skeptics claimed the episode showed that the Americans intended to steal the empires of Britain and France .
As popular opposition to Israel spread across the Middle East in the second half of the century , many Arab governments funded new printings of the Protocols , and taught them in their schools as historical fact .
They have been accepted as such by many Islamist organizations , such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
Reportedly , Arabic editions issued in the Middle East were found on sale as far away as London .
Syria
The Protocols is a best - seller in Syria and , together with other anti-Semitic materials published there , is distributed throughout the Arab - Muslim world .
In 1997 , the two - volume 8th edition of the Protocols , translated and edited by ' Ajaj Nuwayhid , was published by Mustafa Tlass 's publishing house and exhibited and sold at the Damascus International Book Fair ( IBF ) and at the Cairo IBF .
At the 2005 Cairo IBF a stand of the Syrian publisher displayed a new , 2005 edition of the Protocols authorized by the Syrian Ministry of Information .
In Syria government - controlled television channels occasionally broadcast mini-series concerning the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , along with several other anti-semitic themes .
Egypt
In a foreword to a translation of Shimon Peres ' book The New Middle East , the Egyptian state - owned publisher al - Ahram editorialized in 1995 :
When The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were discovered , some 200 years ago , and translated in various languages , including Arabic , the World Zionist Organization attempted to deny the existence of the plot , and claimed forgery .
The Zionists even endeavoured to purchase all the existing copies , in order to prevent their circulation .
But today , Shimon Peres proves unequivocally that the Protocols are authentic , and that they tell the truth .
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and their Biblical and Talmudic Origins , 2003 ed. by Ahmad H. al - Saqa , professor of Comparative Religion , Al - Azhar University
An article in the Egyptian state - owned newspaper al - Akhbar on February 3 , 2002 stated :
All the evils that currently affect the world are the doings of Zionism .
This is not surprising , because the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , which were established by their wise men more than a century ago , are proceeding according to a meticulous and precise plan and time schedule , and they are proof that even though they are a minority , their goal is to rule the world and the entire human race . "
In October 2002 , a private Egyptian television company Dream TV produced a 41 - part " historical drama " A Horseman Without a Horse ( Fares Bela Gewad ) , largely based on the Protocols , which ran on 17 Arabic - language satellite television channels , including government - owned Egypt Television ( ETV ) , for a month , causing concerns in the West .
Egypt 's Information Minister Safwat El - Sherif announced that the series " contains no anti-Semitic material " .
On November 17 , 2003 , an Egyptian weekly al - Usbu ‘ reported that the manuscript museum at the Alexandria Library , displayed the first Arabic translation of the Protocols at the section of the holy books of Judaism , next to a Torah scroll .
The museum 's director Dr. Yousef Ziedan was quoted as saying in an interview :
" ... it has become one of the sacred [ texts ] of the Jews , next to their first constitution , their religious law ... more important to the Zionist Jews of the world than the Torah , because they conduct Zionist life according to it ...
It is only natural to place the book in the framework of an exhibit of Torah . "
It also quoted him as saying that no more than one million Jews were killed by the Nazis , but Zionists manipulated the " knowledge that has reached the world " .
Dr. Yousef Ziedan strongly denies these quotes , accusing al - Usbu ‘ of attributing " fabricated , groundless lies " to him and stating that " the Protocols is a racist , silly , fabricated book " :
" The story began with an article in an Egyptian newspaper , al - Usbu ‘ , two weeks ago ( on November 17th , 2003 ) , which alleged quoting from me utterly senseless statements intertwining facts with fancies .
A month before , a journalist from the aforementioned newspaper interviewed me concerning the recent refurbishment of the manuscript and rare book museum .
I handed her a written statement , as was the case with other journalists who covered the same news .
Although , she concluded her article with my exact words , she started it with fabricated , groundless lies .
She falsely reported me saying that I placed an edition of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion at the center of the museum alongside the Jewish Torah and divine books .
Moreover , she claimed that I told her that this book is more significant then the Torah ...
On my part , I would like to maintain to the visitors of ziedan.com that the Protocols is a racist , silly , fabricated book .
Perhaps , I should consider more thoroughly the Jewish issue on the academic level and furnish my vision of the interaction of religions .
As civilized people , we totally renounce racism and call for tolerance and constructive interaction between people . "
After the publication , director of the Library Dr. Ismail Serageldin issued a statement :
" Preliminary investigation determined that the book was briefly displayed in a showcase devoted to rotating samples of curiosities and unusual items in our collection .
...
The book is a well - known 19th century fabrication to foment anti-Jewish feelings .
The book was promptly withdrawn from public display , but its very inclusion showed bad judgment and insensitivity ... "
Iran
The first Iranian edition of the Protocols was issued during the summer of 1978 at the time of the Iranian Revolution .
In 1985 a new edition of the Protocols was printed and widely distributed by the Islamic Propagation Organization , International Relations Department in Tehran .
The Astaneh - ye Qods Razavi ( Shrine of Imam Reza ) Foundation in Mashhad , Iran , one of the wealthiest institutions in Iran , financed publication of the Protocols in 1994 .
Parts of the Protocols were published by the daily Jomhouri - ye Eslami in 1994 , under the heading The Smell of Blood , Zionist Schemes .
Sobh , a radical Islamic monthly , published excerpts from the Protocols under the heading
The text of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion for establishing the Jewish global rule in its December 1998 – January 1999 issue , illustrated with a caricature of the Jewish snake swallowing the globe .
Iranian writer and researcher Ali Baqeri , who researched the Protocols , finds their plan for world domination to be merely part of an even more grandiose scheme , saying in Sobh in 1999 :
" The ultimate goal of the Jews ... after conquering the globe ... is to extract from the hands of the Lord many stars and galaxies " .
In April 2004 , the Iranian television station Al - Alam broadcast Al - Sameri wa Al - Saher , a series that reported as fact several conspiracy theories about the Holocaust , Jewish control of Hollywood , and the Protocols .
The Iran Pavilion of the 2005 Frankfurt Book Fair had the Protocols , as well as The International Jew ( reprints from Henry Ford 's The Dearborn Independent ) available .
Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabian schoolbooks contain explicit summaries of the Protocols as factual :
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion :
These are secret resolutions , most probably of the aforementioned Basel congress .
They were discovered in the nineteenth century .
The Jews tried to deny them , but there was ample evidence proving their authenticity and that they were issued by the elders of Zion .
The Protocols can be summarized in the following points :
Upsetting the foundations of the world 's present society and its systems , in order to enable Zionism to have a monopoly of world government .
Eliminating nationalities and religions , especially the Christian nations .
Europe , as Zionism believes in their corruption and [ eventual ] collapse .
Striving to increase corruption among the present regimes in , as Zionism believes in their corruption and [ eventual ] collapse .
Controlling the media of publication , propaganda and the press , using gold for stirring up disturbances , seducing people by means of lust and spreading wantonness .
The cogent proof of the authenticity of these resolutions , as well as of the hellish Jewish schemes included therein , is the [ actual ] carrying out of many of those schemes , intrigues and conspiracies that are found in them .
Anyone who reads them — and they were published in the nineteenth century — grasps today to what extent much of what is found there has been realized .
According to Freedom House 2006 report , Saudi " textbook for boys for Tenth Grade on Hadith and Islamic Culture contains a lesson on the " Zionist Movement . "
It is a curious blend of wild conspiracy theories about Masonic Lodges , Rotary Clubs , and Lions Clubs with anti-Semitic invective .
It asserts that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an authentic document and teaches students that it reveals what Jews really believe .
It blames many of the world ’s wars and discord on the Jews . "
Lebanon and Hezbollah
In March 1970 , the Protocols were reported to be the top ' nonfiction ' bestseller in Lebanon .
The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2004 by the US Department of State states that " the television series , Ash - Shatat ( " The Diaspora " ) , which centred on the alleged conspiracy of " The Protocols of the Elders of Zion " to dominate the world , was aired in October and November 2003 by the Lebanon - based satellite television network Al - Manar , owned by Hezbollah . "
Hamas
The Charter of Hamas explicitly refers to the Protocols , accepting them as factual and makes several references to Freemasons as one of the " secret societies " controlled by " Zionists . "
The Article 32 of the Hamas Charter states :
The Zionist plan is limitless .
After Palestine , the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates .
When they will have digested the region they overtook , they will aspire to further expansion , and so on .
Their plan is embodied in the " Protocols of the Elders of Zion " , and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying .
Palestinian National Authority
The PNA frequently used the Protocols in the media and education under their control and some Palestinian academics presented the forgery as a plot upon which Zionism is based .
For example , on January 25 , 2001 , the official PNA daily Al - Hayat al - Jadida cited the Protocols on its Political National Education page to explain Israel 's policies :
Disinformation has been one of the bases of morale and psychological manipulation among the Israelis ...
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion did not ignore the importance of using propaganda to promote the Zionist goals .
The second protocol reads : ' Through the newspapers we will have the means to propel and to influence ' .
In the twelfth protocol : ' Our governments will hold the reins of most of the newspapers , and through this plan we will possess the primary power to turn to public opinion . '
Later that year the same newspaper wrote : " The purpose of the military policy is to impose this situation on the residents and force them to leave their homes , and this is done in the framework of the Protocols of Zion ... "
The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri appeared on the Saudi satellite channel Al - Majd on February 20 , 2005 , commenting on the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri .
" Anyone who studies The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and specifically the Talmud , " he said , " will discover that one of the goals of these Protocols is to cause confusion in the world and to undermine security throughout the world . "
In 2005 , it was reported that the Palestinian Authority was teaching the Protocols in schools .
After media exposure , the PA promised to stop .
On May 19 , 2005 , the New York Times reported that Palestinian Authority Minister of Information Nabil Shaath removed from his ministry 's web site an Arabic translation of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion .

Differences between Scheme and Common Lisp
Size of the language
Some of these features include : packages , arrays , structures , hash tables , object - oriented programming features , a powerful macro feature for extending the language , generalized assignment , and much more .
Numbers
Common Lisp , by contracts , requires every implementation to support floating point numbers , rational numbers , integers of arbitrary precision , complex floating point number , and complex rational numbers .
This fact makes programs that use numbers more portable .
Tail call optimization
No such rule exists in Common Lisp , although many Common Lisp compilers actually do optimize tail calls .
It is therefore less frequent in Common Lisp to use tail recursion for ( say ) traversing lists .
Instead , Common Lisp has a rich set of iteration primitives for exactly that purpose .
Program / data equivalence
For instance , in Scheme , there is a difference between :
( define ( f x y . ( z ) ) ...)
( define ( f x y z ) ... )
read
read
Common Lisp , on the other hand , does require two such forms to be equivalent .
This feature is the very basis of the Common Lisp macro system , which uses Lisp data to represent and manipulate Lisp code .
Since no such equivalence exists in Scheme , one can argue that it is impossible to ever have a good macro system for Scheme .
In practice , of course , nearly all implementations do define the equivalence and do contain macro systems .
Multiple namespaces
The main idea in Common Lisp is that the name fun in an expression such as :
( fun arg )
arg
fun
Perhaps the most obvious difference is that in Common Lisp , it is possible to use the name of a function as an ordinary value without shadowing the function .
This is possible in Common Lisp , but not in Scheme :
( let ( ( list ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) ) ( list list ) )
( list list )
list
let
On the other hand , this is possible in Scheme but not in Common Lisp :
( let ( ( fun ( compute - a - function ) ) ) ( fun x y ) )
fun
funcall
( let ( ( fun ( compute - a - function ) ) ) ( funcall fun x y ) )
fun
funcall
funcall
We have seen how Common Lisp through the built - in function funcall is able to call a function that is the value of an ordinary variable .
We must also solve the inverse problem , i.e. , obtain the function object that is not the value of an ordinary variable , but only the global function value of some name such as car .
This is possible in Scheme :
( map car l )
car
function
#'
map
mapcar
( mapcar #'car l )
Minor variations in syntax
define
( define ( f l ) ( g ( reverse l ) ) )
defun
( defun f ( l ) ( g ( reverse l ) ) )
set !
setq
map
mapcar

No sooner do I start writing about net neutrality than Ed Whitacre , the CEO of baby bell company SBC , energizes the debate with a juicy interview :
Q : How concerned are you about Internet upstarts like Google , MSN , Vonage , and others ?
A : How do you think they ’re going to get to customers ?
Through a broadband pipe .
Cable companies have them .
We have them .
Now what they would like to do is use my pipes free , but I ai n’t going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it .
So there ’s going to have to be some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion they ’re using .
Why should they be allowed to use my pipes ?
The Internet ca n’t be free in that sense , because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes [ for ] free is nuts !
This is a pretty dumb thing for him to say , for several reasons .
First , it shows amazing disrespect for his home broadband customers , who are paying $ 40 or so every month to use SBC ’s pipes .
If I were an SBC broadband customer , I ’d be dying to ask Mr. Whitacre exactly what my monthly payment is buying , if it is n’t buying access to Google , Yahoo , Vonage , and any other $ %& ^* Internet service I want to use .
Did n’t SBC ’s advertising say I was buying access to the Internet ?
Second , if somebody is going to pay somebody in this situation , it ’s not clear who should be doing the paying .
There is some set of customers who want to use SBC broadband service to access Google .
Why should Google pay SBC for this ?
Why should n’t SBC pay Google instead ?
Sure , SBC would like its customers to have free access to Google , Yahoo , and Vonage .
But as Mr. Whitacre would put it , the Internet ca n’t be free in that sense , because Google , Yahoo , and Vonage have made an investment and for SBC or anybody to expect to use those services for free is nuts !
My point is not that SBC should necessarily pay , but that there is no rule of nature saying that one layer of the protocol stack should pay another layer .
If SBC gets paid by Google , it ’s because SBC faces less competition and hence has more market power .
As Susan Crawford observes , Mr. Whitacre speaks with “ the voice of someone who does n’t think he has any competitors . ”
At this point , economists will object that it ’s sometimes efficient to let ISPs levy these kinds of charges , and so requiring net neutrality from SBC may lead to an inefficient outcome .
I appreciate this point , and will be writing more about it in the future .
For now , though , notice that Mr. Whitacre is n’t speaking the language of efficiency .
He wants to extract payments because he can .
There ’s a whiff here of the CEO - tournament syndrome that infected the media world in the 1990s , as documented in Ken Auletta ’s “ mogul ” stories .
Can Mr. Whitacre make the CEOs of Google , Yahoo , and Vonage genuflect to him ?
Is he really the man with the biggest … market power ?
If there are to be side payments , will they reflect business calculation , or just ego ?
It ’s one thing to argue that a policy can lead to efficient results .
It ’s another thing entirely to show that itwill lead to efficient results , in the hands of real human beings .
Bereits 1965 sagte Intel - Mitbegründer Gordon Moore voraus , dass sich die Anzahl der Transistoren auf einem Chip künftig alle zwei Jahre verdoppeln werde .
Diese als Mooresches Gesetz bekannte Regel gilt auch heute noch : Wie Intel nun stolz verkündet , wird auch die nächste Chip - Generation sich erneut an Moores Vorstellungen orientieren .
Die neue Intel - Generation wird im nochmals kleineren 45 Nanometer - Verfahren hergestellt und enthält ungefähr doppelt so viele Transistoren wie ihr Vorgänger – über eine Milliarde , um genau zu sein .
Mit dem neuen Produktionsprozess kann Intel im Vergleich zum bisherigen 65 Nanometer - Verfahren entweder Prozessoren mit doppelter Leistung oder aber Chips mit gleicher Geschwindigkeit und in halber Größe bauen .
Der erste 45 Nanometer - Probechip wurde als eine Art Mooresches Beweisstück gebaut , wie Mark Bohr , Senior Fellow in Intels wichtiger Technologie - und Produktionsabteilung , sagt .
Es wird noch ungefähr anderthalb Jahre dauern , bis der Prozessor verkaufsbereit ist .
Nachdem die ersten 65 Nanometer - Chips im Oktober 2005 angekündigt worden waren , befindet sich die 45 Nanometer - Technologie also genau im Zeitplan .
Doch wird der Durchschnittskunde die zunehmende Anzahl an Transistoren in seinem Rechner überhaupt bemerken ?
Womöglich im Bereich Video .
Da immer mehr Medieninhalte nicht mehr am Fernseher sondern am Computer konsumiert werden , braucht es passende Chips , wie Nathan Brookwood , Analyst beim Chipmarktforscher Insight 64 , sagt .
" Jeder wird einen dieser kleinen Heimserver haben wollen , die Filme herunterladen und über drahtlose Breitbandnetze streamen können " , meint er .
Obwohl die Dual Core - Prozessoren von Intel und AMD , bei denen zwei CPU - Kerne auf einem Chip sitzen , bereits sehr schnell sind , reicht die Leistungsfähigkeit für sehr komplexe , gleichzeitig ablaufende Medienfunktionen nicht immer aus .
Die Umwandlung eines DVD - Films zur Verwendung auf tragbaren Geräten , das so genannte Transcoding , nimmt beispielsweise viel Zeit und Last in Anspruch , was nicht zuletzt mit komplizierter Rechteschutztechnik zu tun hat , wie Brookwood ausführt .
Ein solches Transcoding kann selbst auf einem Dual Core - Rechner noch 30 Sekunden für jede Minute Video dauern .
Rechner mit mehr als zwei Kernen könnten den Vorgang beschleunigen .
Und weil auch die Transistoren selbst immer kleiner werden , existiert künftig mehr Platz auf der Chip - Oberfläche .
Das bedeutet , dass man auch mehr Platz für weitere Kerne haben wird , die derlei Video - Aufgaben bewältigen können .
" Je mehr diese Dinge Teil unseres täglichen Lebens werden , um so mehr Prozessor - Leistung brauchen wir auch , obwohl wir das gar nicht merken " , sagt Brookwood .
Bei der Produktion eines 45 Nanometer - Chips setzen die Intel - Techniker ultraviolettes Licht ein , das durch eine Maske aus Glas und Chrom scheint .
Diese dient als Matrize , auf die dann die Chipfunktionen aufgebracht werden .
Die eingesetzte Lichtwellenlänge lag hier bei 193 Nanometern - wesentlich größer als die Chip - Bestandteile .
Daher musste die Maske verändert werden , um die Unschärfe zu kompensieren , die auftritt , wenn die Lichtwellenlänge größer ist als die Maske , durch die sie hindurch muss .
Diese Tricks stoßen allerdings an ihre Grenzen .
Mit abnehmender Chip - Komponenten - Größe werden neue Strategien benötigt .
Eine Option ist die so genannte extreme Ultraviolett - Lithographie mit einer Wellenlänge von nur noch 13,5 Nanometern .
Dies würde Chipteile in einer Größe unter 10 Nanometern ermöglichen .
Intel prüfe derzeit verschiedene Optionen , um spätere Chips mit 32 Nanometern , 22 Nanometern Strukturgröße oder noch kleiner produzieren zu können .
Eine der Optionen könnte die extreme Ultraviolett - Lithographie sein .
Solche lebensverlängernde Maßnahmen für das Mooresche Gesetz setzen die Chipentwickler dennoch stark unter Druck .
Wie lange werden sie noch mithalten können ?
Dennis Buss , Vizepräsident für den Bereich Silicon Technology Development bei Texas Instruments , vermutet , dass es mit der Technologie noch bis 2015 oder 2020 so weitergehen könne .
Dann werden Chips mit nur noch zehn Nanometern Strukturgröße erwartet .
Ab diesem Zeitpunkt dürfte die Anzahl der Transistoren jedoch " definitiv stagnieren " , so Buss .

Ruth Malhotra went to court last month for the right to be intolerant .
Malhotra says her Christian faith compels her to speak out against homosexuality .
But the Georgia Institute of Technology , where she ’s a senior , bans speech that puts down others because of their sexual orientation .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Wednesday April 12 , 2006 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 2 inches ; 80 words Type of Material : Correction
Religious expression :
An article in Monday ’s Section A said Gregory S. Baylor of the Christian Legal Society viewed homosexuality as a lifestyle choice .
In fact , he does not have a stance on that issue .
As the article noted , he supports policies that protect people from discrimination based on race , gender and other inborn traits .
He asserts that antidiscrimination policies regarding homosexuality are different because they protect people based on conduct .
Baylor ’s organization seeks to exempt religious groups from those policies .
Malhotra sees that as an unacceptable infringement on her right to religious expression .
So she ’s demanding that Georgia Tech revoke its tolerance policy .
With her lawsuit , the 22 - year - old student joins a growing campaign to force public schools , state colleges and private workplaces to eliminate policies protecting gays and lesbians from harassment .
The religious right aims to overturn a broad range of common tolerance programs : diversity training that promotes acceptance of gays and lesbians , speech codes that ban harsh words against homosexuality , anti-discrimination policies that require college clubs to open their membership to all .

The Rev. Rick Scarborough , a leading evangelical , frames the movement as the civil rights struggle of the 21st century .
“ Christians , ” he said , “ are going to have to take a stand for the right to be Christian . ”
In that spirit , the Christian Legal Society , an association of judges and lawyers , has formed a national group to challenge tolerance policies in federal court .
Several nonprofit law firms -- backed by major ministries such as Focus on the Family and Campus Crusade for Christ -- already take on such cases for free .
The legal argument is straightforward : Policies intended to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination end up discriminating against conservative Christians .
Evangelicals have been suspended for wearing anti-gay T - shirts to high school , fired for denouncing Gay Pride Month at work , reprimanded for refusing to attend diversity training .
When they protest tolerance codes , they ’re labeled intolerant .
A recent survey by the Anti-Defamation League found that 64 % of American adults -- including 80 % of evangelical Christians -- agreed with the statement “ Religion is under attack in this country . ”

“ The message is , you ’re free to worship as you like , but do n’t you dare talk about it outside the four walls of your church , ” said Stephen Crampton , chief counsel for the American Family Assn .
Center for Law and Policy , which represents Christians who feel harassed .
Critics dismiss such talk as a right - wing fundraising ploy .
“ They ’re trying to develop a persecution complex , ” said Jeremy Gunn , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief .
Others fear the banner of religious liberty could be used to justify all manner of harassment .
“ What if a person felt their religious view was that African Americans should n’t mingle with Caucasians , or that women should n’t work ? ” asked Jon Davidson , legal director of the gay rights group Lambda Legal .

Christian activist Gregory S. Baylor responds to such criticism angrily .
He says he supports policies that protect people from discrimination based on race and gender .
But he draws a distinction that infuriates gay rights activists when he argues that sexual orientation is different -- a lifestyle choice , not an inborn trait .
By equating homosexuality with race , Baylor said , tolerance policies put conservative evangelicals in the same category as racists .
He predicts the government will one day revoke the tax - exempt status of churches that preach homosexuality is sinful or that refuse to hire gays and lesbians .
“ Think how marginalized racists are , ” said Baylor , who directs the Christian Legal Society ’s Center for Law and Religious Freedom .
“ If we do n’t address this now , it will only get worse . ”
Christians are fighting back in a case involving Every Nation Campus Ministries at California State University .
Student members of the ministry on the Long Beach and San Diego campuses say their mission is to model a virtuous lifestyle for their peers .
They will not accept as members gays , lesbians or anyone who considers homosexuality “ a natural part of God ’s created order . ”

Legal analysts agree that the ministry , as a private organization , has every right to exclude gays ; the Supreme Court affirmed that principle in a case involving the Boy Scouts in 2000 .
At issue is whether the university must grant official recognition to a student group that discriminates .
The students say denying them recognition -- and its attendant benefits , such as funding -- violates their free - speech rights and discriminates against their conservative theology .
Christian groups at public colleges in other states have sued using similar arguments .
Several of those lawsuits were settled out of court , with the groups prevailing .
In California , however , the university may have a strong defense in court .
The California Supreme Court recently ruled that the city of Berkeley was justified in denying subsidies to the Boy Scouts because of that group ’s exclusionary policies .
Eddie L. Washington , the lawyer representing Cal State , argues the same standard should apply to the university .
“ We ’re certainly not going to fund discrimination , ” Washington said .

As they step up their legal campaign , conservative Christians face uncertain prospects .
The 1st Amendment guarantees Americans “ free exercise ” of religion .
In practice , though , the ground rules shift depending on the situation .
In a 2004 case , for instance , an AT&T ; Broadband employee won the right to express his religious convictions by refusing to sign a pledge to “ respect and value the differences among us . ”
As long as the employee was n’t harassing co-workers , the company had to make accommodations for his faith , a federal judge in Colorado ruled .
That same year , however , a federal judge in Idaho ruled that Hewlett - Packard Co. was justified in firing an employee who posted Bible verses condemning homosexuality on his cubicle .
The verses , clearly visible from the hall , harassed gay employees and made it difficult for the company to meet its goal of attracting a diverse workforce , the judge ruled .
In the public schools , an Ohio middle school student last year won the right to wear a T - shirt that proclaimed : “ Homosexuality is a sin !
Islam is a lie !
Abortion is murder ! ”
But a teen - ager in Kentucky lost in federal court when he tried to exempt himself from a school program on gay tolerance on the grounds that it violated his religious beliefs .

In their lawsuit against Georgia Tech , Malhotra and her co-plaintiff , a devout Jewish student named Orit Sklar , request unspecified damages .
But they say their main goal is to force the university to be more tolerant of religious viewpoints .
The lawsuit was filed by the Alliance Defense Fund , a nonprofit law firm that focuses on religious liberty cases .
Malhotra said she had been reprimanded by college deans several times in the last few years for expressing conservative religious and political views .
When she protested a campus production of “ The Vagina Monologues ” with a display condemning feminism , the administration asked her to paint over part of it .
She caused another stir with a letter to the gay activists who organized an event known as Coming Out Week in the fall of 2004 .
Malhotra sent the letter on behalf of the Georgia Tech College Republicans , which she chairs ; she said several members of the executive board helped write it .
The letter referred to the campus gay rights group Pride Alliance as a “ sex club ... that ca n’t even manage to be tasteful . ”
It went on to say that it was “ ludicrous ” for Georgia Tech to help fund the Pride Alliance .

The letter berated students who come out publicly as gay , saying they subject others on campus to “ a constant barrage of homosexuality . ”
“ If gays want to be tolerated , they should knock off the political propaganda , ” the letter said .
The student activist who received the letter , Felix Hu , described it as “ rude , unfair , presumptuous ” -- and disturbing enough that Pride Alliance forwarded it to a college administrator .
Soon after , Malhotra said , she was called in to a dean ’s office .
Students can be expelled for intolerant speech , but she said she was only reprimanded .
Still , she said , the incident has left her afraid to speak freely .
She ’s even reluctant to aggressively advertise the campus lectures she arranges on living by the Bible .
“ Whenever I ’ve spoken out against a certain lifestyle , the first thing I ’m told is ‘ You ’re being intolerant , you ’re being negative , you ’re creating a hostile campus environment , ’ ” Malhotra said .

A Georgia
Tech spokeswoman would not comment on the lawsuit or on Malhotra ’s disciplinary record , but she said the university encouraged students to debate freely , “ as long as they ’re not promoting violence or harassing anyone . ”
The open question is what constitutes harassment , what ’s a sincere expression of faith -- and what to do when they overlap .
“ There really is confusion out there , ” said Charles C. Haynes , a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center , which is affiliated with Vanderbilt University .
“ Finding common ground sounds good .
But the reality is , a lot of people on all sides have a stake in the fight . ”

The blast at 8.34 am local time ( 0534 GMT ) also injured three other soldiers , one seriously , the Ministry of Defence said .
Corporal Pritchard was commanding the lead Land Rover in a three - vehicle rations and water run when the explosion went off .
Tony Blair , who ordered British troops to join the invasion , was " deeply saddened " by the death , as he was by all fatalities of service personnel , his official spokesman said .
The spokesman said British forces in Iraq - which currently amount to around 8,000 troops - would stay in the country for " as long as necessary " .
" No life is worth this kind of sacrifice but , in terms of why we are in Iraq , we have now had three democratic elections in a country that was brutalised for decades , " he told reporters .
Critics of the war blamed the government for the soldiers ' deaths .
Reg Keys , whose son
Thomas was one of six military policemen killed in an ambush in Iraq more than two years ago , said the milestone figure was " absolutely dreadful " .
" We have had 100 chances to learn our lesson .
It just goes on and on , " he said .
" These deaths were 100 % preventable .
These lads are dying for a falsehood .
Their oath of allegiance has been betrayed .
This was not what they went to war for .
They are not the world 's police . "
George Galloway , the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow and a leading critic of the war , said : " What a melancholy milestone this is .
" The United States long ago passed it - now 2,000 deaths and counting .
Of course , nobody is counting the number of Iraqis killed .
" These deaths are the all too predictable consequences of the illegal and immoral war in Iraq .
I do n't want another British soldier to die occupying other people 's countries .
That 's why all British troops must be brought home now . "
The defence secretary , John Reid , said it was an " appropriate time " to reflect on the " dedication , courage , professionalism and sacrifice " of the armed forces and their families .
Dr Liam Fox , the Tory defence spokesman , also expressed his sympathy over today 's fatality .
Second British loss in 24 hours
Today 's fatality is the second British loss in just over 24 hours .
Lance Corporal Allan Douglas , 22 , of the 1st Battalion the Highlanders , died after being wounded by sniper fire in Maysan province , south - east Iraq , yesterday .
His father , Walter , of Aberdeen , told the Daily Mirror his son had not wanted to go to Iraq .
" He was against the war .
He could n't see the point of it .
The lives of 99 young men have now been lost - and all for nothing , " he said yesterday .
Of the 100 fatalities , the MoD classes 77 soldiers as having been killed in action and 23 as having died from illness , non-combat injuries , accidents or unknown causes .
At least 230 British troops have been injured .
British troops are regularly targeted by insurgents using improvised explosive devices , which are often left by roadsides to target patrols .
In all , just over 4,000 people , including Iraqis and British civilians as well as servicemen and women , have been evacuated to the UK for medical treatment .
The vast majority suffered illness or an accident .
It is hoped the number of British troops in Iraq will eventually be scaled back as UK and US forces train Iraqi security personnel to take their place but no definite withdrawal plan has been announced .
Mr Reid last week announced plans for a major new deployment of British troops to a dangerous area in southern Afghanistan , where US forces have been targeted by suicide bombers .
In the next few months , around 3,300 combat troops will be sent to Afghanistan , on top of around 850 already there , and will take on a Nato peacekeeping and counter - narcotics mission .
April , 2000
To whom it may concern :
Since April of 1999 , I have publicly decried the addition of fluoride , especially hydrofluosilicic acid , to drinking water for the purpose of preventing tooth decay .
The following summarize my reasons .
New evidence for lack of effectiveness of fluoridation in modern times .
1. Modern studies ( published in the 1980 ’s 1990 ’s ) show dental decay rates are so low in North America that the effects of water fluoridation cannot be measured .
Because of the low prevalence of dental decay , water fluoridation studies today must be carefully conducted to correct for mobility of subjects between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas , access to fluoride from other sources , the lack of blinding and problems with the `halo ’ effect .
Even when very large sample sizes are used to obtain statistically significant results , the benefit of water fluoridation is not a clinically relevant one ( the number of tooth surfaces saved from dental decay per person is less than one half ) .
Recent studies show that halting fluoridation will either result in only a marginal increase in dental decay which cannot be detected or no increase in dental decay at all .
2 . The major reasons for the general decline of tooth decay worldwide , both in non-fluoridated and fluoridated areas , is the widespread use of fluoridated toothpaste , improved diets , and overall improved general and dental health ( antibiotics , preservatives , hygiene etc ) .
3 . There is now a better understanding of how fluoride prevents dental decay .
What little benefit fluoridated water may still provide is derived primarily through topical means ( after the teeth erupt and come in contact with fluorides in the oral cavity ) .
Fluoride does not need to be swallowed to be effective .
It is not an essential nutrient .
Nor should it be considered a desirable “ supplement ” for children living in non-fluoridated areas .
Fluoride ingestion delays tooth eruption and this may account for some of the differences seen in the past between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas ( i.e. dental decay is simply postponed ) .
No fluoridation study has ever separated out the systemic effects of fluoride .
Even if there were a systemic benefit from ingestion of fluoride , it would be miniscule and clinically irrelevant .
The notion that systemic fluorides are needed in non-fluoridated areas is an outdated one that should be abandoned altogether .
New evidence for potential serious harm from long - term fluoride ingestion .
1. Hydrofluorosilicic acid is recovered from the smokestack scrubbers during the production of phosphate fertilizer and sold to most of the major cities in North America , which use this industrial grade source of fluoride to fluoridate drinking water , rather than the more expensive pharmaceutical grade sodium fluoride salt .
Fluorosilicates have never been tested for safety in humans .
Furthermore , these industrial - grade chemicals are contaminated with trace amounts of heavy metals such as lead , arsenic and radium that accumulate in humans .
Increased lead levels have been found in children living in fluoridated communities .
Osteosarcoma ( bone cancer ) has been shown to be associated with radium in the drinking water .
Long - term ingestion of these harmful elements should be avoided altogether .
2 . Half of all ingested fluoride remains in the skeletal system and accumulates with age .
Several recent epidemiological studies suggest that only a few years of fluoride ingestion from fluoridated water increases the risk for bone fracture .
The relationship between the milder symptoms of bone fluorosis ( joint pain and arthritic symptoms ) and fluoride accumulation in humans has never been investigated .
People unable to eliminate fluoride under normal conditions ( kidney impairment ) or people who ingest more than average amounts of water ( athletes , diabetics ) are more at risk to be affected by the toxic effects of fluoride accumulation .
3 . There is a dose - dependent relationship between the prevalence / severity of dental fluorosis and fluoride ingestion .
When dental decay rates were high , a certain amount of dental fluorosis was considered an acceptable `trade off ’ of providing an `optimum ’ dose of 1.0 ppm fluoride in the water .
However , studies published in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s have shown that dental fluorosis has increased dramatically in North America .
Infants and toddlers are especially at risk for dental fluorosis of the front teeth since it is during the first 3 years of life that the permanent front teeth are the most sensitive to the effects of fluoride .
Children fed formula made with fluoridated tap water are at higher risk to develop dental fluorosis .
A relatively small percentage of the children affected with dental fluorosis have the more severe kind that requires extensive restorative dental work to correct the damage .
The long - term effect of fluoride accumulation on dentin colour and biomechanics is also unknown .
Generalized dental fluorosis of all the permanent teeth indicates that the bone is a major source of the excess fluoride .
The effect of this excess amount of fluoride in bone is unknown .
Whether stress bone fractures occur more often in children with dental fluorosis has not been studied .
4 . A lifetime of excessive fluoride ingestion will undoubtedly have detrimental effects on a number of biological systems in the body and it is illogical to assume that tooth enamel is the only tissue affected by low daily doses of fluoride ingestion .
Fluoride activates G - protein and a number of cascade reactions in the cell .
At high concentrations it is both mitogenic and genotoxic .
Some published studies point to fluoride ’s interference with the reproductive system , the pineal gland and thyroid function .
Fluoride is a proven carcinogen in humans exposed to high industrial levels .
No study has yet been conducted to determine the level of fluoride that bone cells are exposed to when fluoride - rich bone is turned over .
Thus , the issue of fluoride causing bone cancer cannot be dismissed as being a non-issue since carefully conducted animal and human cancer studies using the exact same chemicals added to our drinking water have not been carried out .
The issue of mass medication of an unapproved drug without the expressed informed consent of each individual must also be addressed .
The dose of fluoride cannot be controlled .
Fluoride as a drug has contaminated most processed foods and beverages throughout North America .
Individuals who are susceptible to fluoride ’s harmful effects cannot avoid ingesting this drug .
This presents a medico- legal and ethical dilemma and sets water fluoridation apart from vaccination as a public health measure where doses and distribution can be controlled .
The rights of individuals to enjoy the freedom from involuntary fluoride medication certainly outweigh the right of society to enforce this public health measure , especially when the evidence of benefit is marginal at best .
Based on the points outlined briefly above , the evidence has convinced me that the benefits of water fluoridation no longer outweigh the risks .
The money saved from halting water fluoridation programs can be more wisely spent on concentrated public health efforts to reduce dental decay in the populations that are still at risk and this will , at the same time , lower the incidence of the harmful side effects that a large segment of the general population is currently experiencing because of this outdated public health measure .

- failure to recognize in most cases that hydrofluosilicic acid ( and its radium and arsenic contaminants ) , not pure sodium fluoride , was used to fluoridate water

IT 'S true .
Pornography can make you blind .
Look at a smutty picture and , according to research by Steven Most , of Yale University , and his colleagues , you will suffer from a temporary condition known as emotion - induced blindness .
Dr Most made this discovery while studying the rubbernecking effect ( when people slow down to stare at a car accident ) .
Rubbernecking represents a serious lapse of attention to the road , but he wondered if the initial reaction to such gory scenes could cause smaller lapses .
The answer is , it does .
What he found was that when people look at gory images — and also erotic ones — they fail to process what they see immediately afterwards .
This period of blindness lasts between two - tenths and eight - tenths of a second .
That is long enough for a driver transfixed by an erotic advert on a billboard to cause an accident .
The researchers conducted two experiments .
In the first , the results of which will be published in next month 's Psychonomic Bulletin and Review , the experimental subjects were shown a sequence of images .
Some of these images were gory ( violent injuries and mutilated bodies ) while others were photographs of landscapes and buildings — things thought to be emotionally neutral .
The subjects were asked to watch out for a picture that had been rotated , without being told what was in it .
Between the horror picture and this target were two to eight neutral pictures .
The closer the grim picture was to the target , the less likely the subjects were to spot the target .
When the gory pictures were substituted by erotic ones , the outcome was the same .
Dr Most thinks that the explanation for this temporary blindness is that there is an information - processing bottleneck in the brain when it is presented with important stimuli .
When the human brain was evolving , such stimuli would not have been two - dimensional images .
They would , rather , have been part of the real world .
Gory scenes would have had survival value ( ie , “ am I going to be next ? ” ) , while erotic ones would have had reproductive value .
Paying attention to the landscape would have been a distraction .
In the age of photography , though , it is the image that is the distraction , and if the distracted individual is travelling at speed in a car , such distraction could be fatal .
So the team carried out a second series of experiments , still unpublished , that were intended to discover whether their subjects could override this emotion - induced temporary blindness by using what they rather grandiloquently called an “ attentional strategy ” ( ie , focusing harder on the target image ) .
This was arranged by asking the subjects to find not any rotated photo , but a rotated photo of a building , in the array of images .
The fact that they had to pay attention to both content and orientation meant they focused harder .
As the researchers had expected , in this version of the experiment subjects were , on average , better at spotting the target image .
But that average concealed some interesting differences that depended on a subject 's personality .
The researchers knew from previous studies that the more neurotic someone is , the worse he is at controlling his attention , so they decided to see how a measure of neuroses known as the harm - avoidance scale correlated with their results .
The harm - avoidance scale is a measure of a person 's reaction to negative or frightening stimuli .
They found that the lower a subject 's score on this scale was , the more successful he was at detecting the target .
This information might be useful when considering the reliability of witnesses to crimes .
Fantasy Computer Science Research Lab by Philip Greenspun in March 2003 Site Home : Research : One Section
Students are n't sure what this should look like and therefore I 've prepared a sample fantasy computer science research lab agenda below .
Labus Novus , a.k.a.
Philip 's Fantasy Computer Lab
Video - conferenced Assistant
The Labus Novus coordination system will comprise the following components :
a life - sized two - way video conferencing system ; it is as if a wall in one 's office is opened up to the assistant 's office thousands of miles away
an information system that records everything relevant to the high - wage worker 's job , including facts , reference material , contacts , correspondence , appointments , and relationships among these items [ like a more sophisticated Microsoft Outlook ]
robot arms and other robots within the high - wage worker 's office that can be manipulated by the low - wage worker , thus enabling the assistant to pull folders from file cabinets , position papers on a desk , etc. , from the other side of the planet
Outlook - on - steroids might sound straightforward but doing the job right can be as challenging as all of Artificial Intelligence .
We are building support for a computer - mediated assistant rather than attempting to build a fully automated personal cognitive assistant .
This does not reduce the difficulty of achieving a complete solution but it does increase the utility of an incomplete solution .
A desire to give the assistant the ability to manipulate physical objects half a world away ( telepresence ) justifies research in broad areas of robotic actuators and sensors .
Funding Possibilities : Phone companies are logical sponsors for this research .
Telcos built a tremendous amount of network capacity in the 1990s but then neglected to offer any services besides voice communication , thus resulting in falling prices and bankruptcies .
Only about 10 percent of the fiber installed through the U.S. is actually being used .
Continuously active high quality video conferences have the potential to consume all of currently unused bandwidth in the networks .
Note that the system could be used domestically , yoking together a worker in an expensive crowded place such as New York City with an assistant in a low - wage uncrowded place such as Iowa .
Personal Coach
Our coach needs to be able to keep track of our goals and what we 've accomplished toward those goals .
For example , if our goal is losing weight the coach needs to know our most recent weight and about any food intake or exercise .
The recency requirement means that we need to be able to communicate with our coach regardless of where we are , by telephone , by handheld computer , by desktop computer , or entirely passively ( computer notices that we 've stepped on our home scale and records the weight ) .
Ensuring coach availability implies research on ubiquitous wireless Internet connectivity .
Making a coach that is n't too cumbersome requires a conversational speech interface , thus implying research at the very edge of current speech systems .
Building a coach that is unobtrusive will require cameras mounted in homes and work places and machine vision so that the coach can figure out what you 're doing ( no sense interrupting you if you 're in a conversation but if you 're alone and reaching for the cookie jar it might be time to admonish ) .
A world full of cameras requires research in computer and network security so that only your coach has access to your private life .
The coach needs to be smart enough to learn something of your habits and thus implies research in machine learning .
If we consider the domain of health and weight coaching it is useful to build wearable low - power hospital - grade instrumentation for all aspects of the human body , thus driving research into miniature electronics and sensors .
Anything that can be measured should be measured and recorded , automatically and without user intervention .
At the same time we can interface computer graphics and games to exercise equipment , to motivate the coachees , thus opening the door to all of the graphics research that goes into video games ( but this time aimed at making people less fat rather than more ) .
Funding Possibilities : the military spends a tremendous amount of money on training and physical conditioning ; they ought to be willing to invest in a technology that would help each soldier be all that he ( or she ) can be .
Weather Forecasting
Better Avionics
Labus Novus will build its own operating system from the ground up .
Academicians keep saying that safe high - level languages such as Haskell , Lisp / Scheme , ML , etc. are more reliable and result in higher programmer productivity than unsafe low - level languages such as C .
However in practice nearly all computer science research is done on top of standard old - style operating systems such as Unix and Windows .
If high - level languages are so great , it ought to be possible for a university or a consortium of universities to build something better and more reliable than Unix in short order .
Simulated flight is safer and more practical in the frigid Northeast than actual flight , especially for uncertificated students .
Thus our goal of better avionics implies a heavy workload for the graphics researchers in our lab .
Throughout an airplane are opportunities for microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) , starting with the gyros used to sense airplane attitude , velocity , and acceleration .
An airplane is a acoustically noisy environment .
Designing active noise - cancelling systems for airplanes can take a researcher into a wide range of computational acoustics , microelectronics , and real - time control problems .
Avionics require high - reliability high - availability databases of terrain information , instrument flight approach procedures , airspace restrictions , and airport information .
This information is constantly changing and it ideally would be updated from intermittent radio contact with the Federal Aviation Administration 's extensive transmitter network , thus entailing research on distributed database management .
Pilots are challenged with a flood of constantly changing information , thus opening the door to a lot of user interface and human - computer interaction research .
Funding Possibilities : the Air Force .

The Playoffs
The grand prize ?

Reader 's Comments
I think the idea of a clearly explainable goal , or focus , of the lab is critical .
I the idea that all the technical projects can fit under one umbrella that even a five year old could understand .

There are all sorts of reasons for having forms on your sites .
One for every day of the year .
There are a multitude of web pages describing how to craft the HTML for the forms .
What there is n't though is enough attention paid to how these forms are handled by servers .
The very fact that there is a form means that you want the server to do something more or less clever with information that your web visitors provides .
What you expect the server to do though determines some of the basics of how you should code the HTML forms and how you should architect the script that processes the form submission .
The options
First of all we should take a look at the HTML form element itself .
There are no significant changes between HTML 4.01 , XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1 that we need to worry about other than the allowed cases .
As HTML 4.01 will support the lower case mandated by XHTML then I 'll be using the XHTML notations here .
The form attributes that are of interest to us are :
method — The HTTP method that is to be used by the user agent when it submits the form .
— The method that is to be used by the user agent when it submits the form .
action — The URL that the form is submitted to .
This will typically be an ASP page or a CGI script or executable .
What you put in here as really of no further interest in this discussion .
— The that the form is submitted to .
This will typically be an page or a script or executable .
What you put in here as really of no further interest in this discussion .
enctype — The encoding that the form should use .
Not really of interest here , but we need to know about it as sometimes the choices we make will affect what we can and what we should use here .
The get method
The essential difference between them is that the user agent may cache the response for a get and show that to the user ( there are some provisos to this spelled out in the HTTP specification that I 'm not going to worry about for our purposes ) .
The important point here is that the user agent may show the result of the last fetch again without ever talking to the server .
When the user agent requests anything from the server as the result of clicking on a link or a having a URL typed in then it will use this method .
Proxy servers may provide the result to many users and even though a user clicks on the submit button several times the user agent may never talk to the server again unless the user has made changes to the form .
This means that this is normally the correct method to use for a site search form .
This is because the same search terms will return the same content each time they are used and the same search terms submitted by different users will return the same results ( if you are customising the page based on the logged in user then you should already know what to do about this — if you do n't then you should n't be writing the software ) .
The post method
The HTTP specification states very clearly that the response to a post may not be cached .
This means that every time the user clicks on the submit button the user agent must ask the server again .
A proxy must also honour this requirement .
What this means is that you should use this method where the form is actually updating something on the server .
For example , when a user submits a newsgroup post or a comment .
This is also what you should use for refresh style buttons on pages which have dynamic content that updates often .
The application / x - www - form - urlencoded encoding type
This form encoding takes each field ( of whatever sort ) and encodes the names and the values in the same way that a standard query string is encoded for a get request .
This is the default form encoding and the format of the data sent is described in the HTML 4 specification .
Unlike a query string though the data is sent in the HTTP request body rather than appended to the URL .
The multipart / form - data encoding type
multipart / form - data form encoding is more complex than application / x- www - form - urlencoded , but it has one great advantage which is that it works with file uploads .
The encoding here is MIME and is ( according to the HTML 4 specification ) defined by RFC 2045 .
Again the data are sent in the HTTP request body .
This method has higher overhead than the URL encoding so by using this you are forcing the browser to send more data to the server .
Form processing
Most forms need to do some processing .
After all if no processing is being done then what is the form for ?
This means that we ought to spend a little time thinking about how this forms processing should be done with respect to the pages before and after .
The single most important thing to consider is whether or not the URL that form takes you to should be bookmarkable and cacheable .
For example , by using get for a search form you make the result of that search both cacheable and bookmarkable .
Many of your site 's users will like to do this .
post on the other hand should be used where the form submission changes the state of the server .
You should use it for example whenever a form does something .
In some ways the difference between get and post is like the difference between asking a question and making a command .
If many people are asking the same question at nearly the same time then it is probably the right thing to give them all the same answer .
However many people telling the server to do the same thing at nearly the same time have to be responded to individually so that they know if their command was listened to or not .
For the encoding type the choices are a little simpler .
If the form allows file uploads to the server then you must use multipart / form - data otherwise you do n't need to specify this attribute .
One final issue with forms is whether or not the script that processes the form should generate any HTML or not .
Generally if the script does something where the results should be bookmarkable then the script ought not to generate the HTML , but rather redirect to a page that can be fetched multiple times .
Errors should always be generated by the script though .
You need a very good reason not to present the form again alongside the error and an even better reason not to have the form filled in with the input the user tried last time ( with the exception of passwords ) .
Examples
Here are some examples of the uses of forms and recommendations on how they should be done .
Site search — For this get is probably the best choice , as seen on major search engines .
It allows results to be bookmarked and it allows proxies to serve the same search results to many people .
— For this is probably the best choice , as seen on major search engines .

Contact form — Use post for these .
The script should generate HTML to tell the user that the feedback has been saved or show the reason for it not being saved .

Comments or bulletin post — Use post because these are saving new content on the server .
The script should redirect to the page where the comment or post will appear so that the user can easily bookmark it .
Alternatively you can display a confirmation screen which then links to the page where the comment / post may be viewed .
Of course the script should generate any error messages .

Of course the script should generate any error messages .
Booking form — Again post is the way to go .
The script should generate any errors , but the confirmation screen needs to be bookmarkable , so , if successful the script really ought to redirect to a seperate confirmation page .
Do n't forget that this confirmation page is probably going to require securing so that only the original user can view it .
— Again is the way to go .
The script should generate any errors , but the confirmation screen needs to be bookmarkable , so , if successful the script really ought to redirect to a seperate confirmation page .
Do n't forget that this confirmation page is probably going to require securing so that only the original user can view it .
Validator — These utility pages which perform processing of some other web page should use get so that their results can be bookmarked .
— These utility pages which perform processing of some other web page should use so that their results can be bookmarked .
Login — This should go without saying , login pages must use post so that the password is not exposed on the address bar and can't end up in referrer logs .
Whenever you use a form you need to give some thought to these issues as well as the processing or task that the form is actually doing .

Pumpkins Are Indigenous to the Americas
While the early explorers to the New World ( the North and South American Continents which were mostly unknown to Europeans prior to their discovery by Columbus ) were most interested in the gold , silver , and animal furs , the New World also contained many new foods which are now enjoyed by people the world over .
Among the crops indigenous to the New World are many popular traditional American autumn holiday foods including pumpkins , cranberries , potatoes , sweet potatoes , and corn ( maize ) .
While the native peoples of the New World had enjoyed these foods for thousands of years prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus , the newly arrived European settlers quickly began adding these native crops to their diets .
In addition to growing and eating these new foods , the settlers came up with new ways of preparing and serving these new foods .
Thus , pumpkins were not only grown and eaten in the traditional native manner but also ended up being transformed into things like pumpkin pies and jack - o- lanterns .

From Pepon to Pumpkin
The name pumpkin is descended from the centuries old Greek word pepon which meant " large melon " and obviously did not refer to the pumpkin that we now know .
The French then changed the pronunciation to pompon , but again the reference was to a melon or other gourd as the pumpkins that we know are native to the New World .
As with many French words , pompon crossed the English Channel and became pumpion , again still referring to another pumpkin - like vegetable .
When the English came to the New World , they were introduced to what we know as pumpkins by the Indians .
Upon being introduced to the pumpkin , these early English settlers modified the pronunciation , for a third time since its Greek origin , to the present pumpkin .

Native American Origins of Pumpkins
The pumpkin is native to the New World and was one of the foods grown by the Indians .
Among the Iroquois of the northeastern U.S. , the pumpkin was one of the group of crops known as the three sisters and was grown together with corn and beans .

The Three Sisters : An Iroquois Creation Legend
According to legend , a pregnant woman living in the sky world above the present world craved the bark of the root of the great tree that grew in the middle of the Sky World .
Her husband , like all good husbands of pregnant wives , promptly acceded to her request and dug away the dirt from the base of the tree to expose the roots of the tree .
This also created a hole in the sky .
After her husband had given her the bark she desired , the woman leaned over and peered into the hole .
However , she lost her balance and fell into and through the hole to the earth below .
The poor woman thus became the first human on earth .
Having survived her fall , the woman eventually gave birth to a daughter who grew up and was impregnated with twins by the West Wind .
Just before the time came for their birth , the twins got into a fight about how they were to emerge from the womb .
The twin on the left side did not want to emerge in the usual way and , instead , forced himself out through his mother 's left armpit , killing her in the process .
Once freed from the womb the twins buried their mother .
Shortly after , there sprouted from the spot where the mother had been buried corn , beans and pumpkins sprouted and became one of the main food staples of the Iroquois .
Cultivating of Pumpkins by the Iroquois
While the men of the Iroquois hunted and fished , the women tended to the crops .
Each spring the women of the tribe first prepared the ground in the fields surrounding their village for planting .
Once the ground had been prepared the women carefully dug holes for the seeds .
Into each hole they placed a fish along with a corn , bean and pumpkin seed .
The hole was then covered .
The dead fish fertilized the ground for the seed .
As the three seeds in each hole sprouted , the cornstalk provided support for the bean plant to climb on , the pumpkin provided ground cover to keep the weeds out and the roots of the bean added nutrients to the soil .
As spring moved into summer and summer to autumn , whole fields were filled with corn , beans and pumpkins growing together like the three sisters of legend to provide sustenance for the human families of the tribe .

European Colonists Invented Pumpkin Pie
When the first colonists arrived from England , they survived by trading with the Indians for food thereby becoming acquainted with the foods native to this country .
However , the Europeans made their own contributions as well .
In the case of the pumpkin they not only gave it the name we knew but , instead of cutting them into strips and baking them as the Indians had done for generations , the colonists cut off the top of the pumpkin , scooped out the seeds , and then filled the hollow pumpkin with milk , honey , and spices .

Once filled , they replaced the top and baked the pumpkin in the hot coals of a fire thereby inventing pumpkin pie .
In time , the European settlers decided to scoop out the meat from inside the pumpkin , mix it in a bowl with the milk , honey and spices and then baked the concoction in a crust to give us the version of the pie that we serve every Thanksgiving .

Irish Settlers in the New World Used Pumpkins for Jack - O - Lanterns
Halloween has been observed in Ireland since ancient times .
Among the Halloween traditions that were developed by the Irish was the jack - o- lantern .
In Ireland , people used to hollow out turnips , carve a scary face on them , and then place a candle inside .
When moving about outside after dark on Halloween , they would carry the lit turnip with them to light their way and scare the Devil away with its scary face .

After arriving in America , many Irish immigrants began substituting pumpkins , which were both larger and already hollow inside , for the turnips .
Thus , the pumpkin , in the form of a jack - o - lantern , became the main symbol of Halloween in addition to its other holiday uses .

I love the myth about the origin of the pumpkin !
I had never heard it before .
Thanks for this very well researched Hub .
What 's News on August 21 , 2010 :
Great hub .
Good content .
I never knew that pumpkins flowered .
Learn something new ever day .
Tath from georgia on October 09 , 2009 :
thanks i enjoyed learning about the orgins of the pumpkin !
i love learning something new
Gwen Wilkinson on October 30 , 2007 :
i think that these are good stories but not all true
they are very informational though
i think that they are great
Satan on February 10 , 2007 :
Giant pumpkins developed independently of the character Howard Dill .
He was yellow and lucky enough to sell his name and the seed of this " public " variety .
See the patent papers .
And see the history - which progresses without contribution from this person .
No more than a rudimentary application of logic to the facts apprises that such claims are one more holiday of obnoxious absurdity by media with its common undiscriminating patronage .
The fantasy has no defense .
This is not to contend that this individual did not do some of his own phenotypic selections as have unnamed others .
Opportunistic reputation jockeying is a fundamental archtype of sociological pathology .
The writing is always on the wall .
Clean - up the internet .
Thanks .

Good question .
I did some more research and have posted the results in the text box below .

Thanks for that !
Do you know anything special about the huge pumpkins that we see in the newspapers every fall ?
Where are the most pumpkins grown commercially now ?

Recently , the Washington Post , and then the New York Times , reported a top - secret assessment by the Marines ’ chief of intelligence that focused on the catastrophic situation of his undermanned Corps in the heartlands of Iraq ’s Sunni insurgency .
He concluded , according to the Post‘s Tom Ricks , that “ the prospects for securing that country ’s western Anbar province are dim and that there is almost nothing the U.S. military can do to improve the political and social situation there . ”
Could n’t get much worse , you ’d think .
Then , Maj. Gen. Richard C. Zilmer , the senior Marine commander , decided to “ dispute ” both news accounts .
His argument , according to Michael Gordon of the Times , was that “ he had sufficient forces to carry out his mission but that the mission did not include defeating the insurgency . ”
Come again ?
Fortunately , in a front - page piece , “ Growing Concern : Terrorist Havens in ‘ Failed States ' ” on the possibility that Iraq , Lebanon , and Afghanistan might all turn into the kinds of terrorist safe territories that only Afghanistan had been prior to Sept. 11 , 2001 , the Wall Street Journal ‘s Yochi J. Dreazen and Philip Shishkin sum up the latest “ desired endstate ” of the Bush administration this way : “ U.S. officials acknowledge their main goal in Iraq now is to prevent it from turning into a place run by fundamentalists who export terrorism to the region . ”
Um , come again ?
That ’s the “ strategy for victory ” ?
Well , what can you expect from an overstretched empire enmeshed in a grinding , hopeless set of wars , with increasingly strained ground forces ?
The U.S. Army , its equipment wearing down and with almost no nondeployed combat - ready brigades at hand , now has “ fully two - thirds ” of its active forces officially classified as “ not ready for combat . ”
( And that ’s considered good shape , compared to the state of the completely overstressed National Guard . )
With military stress and strain in mind , it ’s great to welcome Nick Turse back to the writing ranks of TomDispatch .

The Pentagon ’s 12 - step program to create a military of misfits
by Nick Turse
Military recruiting in 2006 has been marked by upbeat pronouncements from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , claims of success by the White House , propaganda releases by the Pentagon , and a spate of recent press reports touting the way the military has made its wo / manpower goals .
But the armed forces have only met with success through a fundamental “ transformation , ” and not the transformation of the military  that “ co-evolution of concepts , processes , organizations , and technology ” 
Rumsfeld is always talking about either .
While the secretary of defense ’s long - standing goal of transforming the planet ’s most powerful military into its highest tech , most agile , most futuristic fighting force has , in the words of the Washington Post ‘s David Von Drehle , “ melted away , ” the very makeup of the armed forces has been mutating before our collective eyes under the pressure of the war in Iraq .
This actual transformation has been reported , but only in scattered articles on the new recruitment landscape in America .
Last year , despite NASCAR , professional bull - riding , and arena football sponsorships ; popular video games that doubled as recruiting tools ; TV commercials dripping with seductive scenes of military glory ; a “ joint marketing communications and market research and studies ” program actively engaged in measures to target for military service Hispanics , dropouts , and those with criminal records ; and at least $ 16,000 in promotional costs for each soldier it managed to sign up , the U.S. military failed to meet its recruiting goals .
This year those methods have been pumped up and taken over the top in 12 critical areas of recruitment that make the old Army ad - line , “ Be All That You Can Be , ” into material for late night TV punch lines of the future .
1. Hard Sell
When not trolling for potential soldiers via video games , Web sites , or most recently the social networking site MySpace.com and text messaging , the armed forces employ recruiters who use old - fashioned hard - sell tactics to cajole impressionable teens into enlisting .
Recently , one New Jersey mother told her local newspaper about the Army ’s persistence in targeting her 17 - year - old daughter .
When the mother finally asked the Army to stop calling her child , the recruiter argued vigorously against it .
The mother , who otherwise praised the military , was nonetheless aghast at the recruiter ’s tactics .
“ That ’s what frightened and enraged me .
This military person telling me that I have no rights over my child , ” she said .
Teens are also subject to military advertising and high - pressure tactics at school .
The Boston Globe recently wrote that recruiters were now setting up booths in “ cafeterias in high schools across the nation . ”
The State Journal - Register of Springfield , Ill. , reported that local recruiters were “ visiting each school about every three to four weeks . ”
At one school , administrators were forced to “ clam[p ] down on aggressive recruiters ” and bar at least one from ever returning to campus .
2. Green to Gray
The military has always filled its rolls primarily by targeting the young , but these days the “ old ” are in its sights , too .
In 2005 , the Army Reserves increased their maximum enlistment age from 35 to 40 ; then , later that year , to 42 .
This year , regular Army green went grayer as well with a similar two - step increase that boosted active - duty enlistment eligibility to 42 years .
3. Backdoor Draft
Another group of old - timers has recently been targeted by the military : the Marine Corps Individual Ready Reserve ( IRR )  troops who have left active - duty status and transitioned back into civilian life .
In August , the Marines announced that they would begin making up for a shortage of volunteers by “ dipping into [ this ] rarely used pool of troops to fill growing personnel gaps in units scheduled to deploy in coming months . ”
As the Boston Globe noted , it was “ the first time since the invasion of Iraq three years ago that Marine commanders have taken the extraordinary step of drafting back into uniform those who have left the ranks . ”
For its part , the Army , according to the Washington Post , “ has used its IRR several times since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
It has mobilized about 5,000 soldiers from that pool over the past five years , most of them since the middle of 2004 . ”
CBS
News reports that , from the Army Reserve , “ approximately 14,000 soldiers on IRR status have been called to active duty since March 2003 and about 7,300 have been deployed to Iraq . ”
4. Rubber - Stamp Promotions
Earlier this year , the Army admitted that , to maintain desperately needed numbers , it was forgoing almost any measure of quality when it came to its officer corps .
According to 2005 Pentagon figures , 97 percent of all eligible captains were promoted to major  a significant jump from the already historically high average of 70 - 80 percent .
“ The problem here is that you ’re not knocking off the bottom 20 percent , ” one high - ranking Army officer at the Pentagon told the Los Angeles Times .
“ Basically , if you have n’t been court - martialed , you ’re going to be promoted to major . ”
Despite near - guaranteed promotions , the San Antonio Express - News reported that the “ Army expects to be short 2,500 captains and majors this year , with the number rising to 3,300 in 2007 . ”
5. Foreign Legion
In July , testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee , Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness David S. C. Chu listed a series of inducements currently offered to get foreigners to risk life and limb for Uncle Sam .
These included : “ President Bush ’s executive order allowing non-citizens to apply for citizenship after only one day of active - duty military service , ” a streamlined application process for service members , and the elimination of “ all application fees for non-citizens in the military . ”
While noting that approximately 40,000 non-citizens are already serving in the U.S. armed forces , Chu offered his own solution to the immigration crisis .
With the services denied the possibility of a draft , he made a pitch for creating a true foreign legion from a group “ potentially interested in military service , ” the “ estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented alien young adults who entered the U.S. at an early age . ”
Chu then talked - up legislation like the DREAM
Act  which would give illegal aliens the opportunity to , among other options , join the military as a vehicle to conditional permanent resident status .
In addition to proposing a possible source of undocumented cannon fodder that might prove less disturbing to Americans than their own sons and daughters , Chu noted that the “ military also has initiated several new programs , including opportunities for those with language skills , which may hold particular appeal for noncitizens . ”
Just in case noncitizens are n’t thrilled to the depths by the chance to serve with the occupation forces in Iraq , the Army promises expedited citizenship , quick advancement , and a host of other perks  including a boatload of cash .
In addition to “ foreign language proficiency pay while on active duty , ” those willing to sell their “ Middle - Eastern language skills and join the U.S. Army as a Translator Aide in Iraq and Afghanistan ” will receive an enlistment bonus of $ 10,000  a sizable sum given yearly per-capita incomes in those countries , which hover in the $ 800 - $ 2,000 range .
6. Mercenary Military
To solve its wo / manpower woes , the military has also enhanced its lure at home  in the form of “ more recruiters and more financial incentives . ”
In some cases , this can mean enlistment bonuses as high as $ 40,000 for those documented but poor Americans looking to put themselves directly in harm ’s way for three years as an Army infantryman or explosive ordnance disposal specialist  markedly more than 2005 per-capita yearly income for African Americans ( $ 16,874 ) , Hispanics ( $ 14,483 ) , and even non-Hispanic whites ( $ 28,946 ) .
According to a recent Associated Press report , the Army is doling out yet more fistfuls of taxpayer dollars to entice troops to reenlist  “ an average bonus of $ 14,000 , to eligible soldiers , for a total of $ 610 million in extra payments . ”
Marine reenlistees seem to rake in the biggest bucks of all .
This July , Maj. Jerry Morgan , who runs the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program , told Stars and Stripes that “ the maximum bonus has been raised to $ 60,000 for Marines ” serving in five critical military occupational specialties .
Add to these sums promised benefits of up to $ 71,424 and $ 23,292 , for active duty and reserve personnel respectively , to “ help pay for college ” and you ’ve got a potentially life - changing bribe , provided you still have a life when that college acceptance finally comes through .
7. Abuse of Power
More recruiters waving more money has its pitfalls .
Last year , amid a swirl of complaints as recruiters struggled to meet monthly goals ( including tips to potential enlistees on how to pass drug tests ) , the Army suspended all recruiting activities for a one - day nationwide “ stand down ” to reexamine its methods and retrain its men .
Just last month , however , the Government Accountability Office issued a report showing that “ between fiscal years 2004 and 2005 , allegations and service - identified incidents of recruiter wrongdoing increased , collectively , from 4,400 cases to 6,500 cases ; substantiated cases increased from just over 400 to almost 630 cases ; and criminal violations more than doubled from just over 30 to almost 70 cases . ”
What also came to light last month , courtesy of the Associated Press , was this revelation : “ More than 100 young women who expressed an interest in joining the military in the past year were preyed upon sexually by their recruiters . ”
According to one of the victim ’s lawyers , a recruiter “ said to her , outright , if you want to join the Marines , you have to have sex with me .
She was a virgin .
She was 17 years old . ”
Another teenage victim spelled out the situation quite clearly , “ The recruiter had all the power .
He had the uniform .
He had my future .
I trusted him . ”
8. Civilian Headhunters
Not surprisingly , given tough times and an administration that never saw anything it could n’t imagine privatizing , the private headhunter has landed on the military recruitment landscape .
According to Renae Merle of the Washington Post , as part of a pilot program that began in 2002 , two Virginia - based companies , Serco and MPRI Inc. , “ have more than 400 recruiters assigned across the country , and have signed up more than 15,000 soldiers .
They are paid about $ 5,700 per recruit . ”
While these companies rake in the recruitment money , the mercenary recruiters themselves reap cash bonuses , free gas cards , and suede jackets .
They can augment their base salary by about $ 30,000 a year by successfully shuttling large numbers of aimless kids and others into the armed forces .
As has been true with the military ’s use of private contractors in all sorts of roles in recent years , this step has drawn ire .
According to Rep. Janice D. Schakowsky ( D - Ill . ) , “ The use of contractors for this sensitive purpose , dealing with the lives of young people , is troublesome . ”
She was particularly worried by the lack of oversight .
Quality - control has been another issue .
While an Army report recommended continuing the $ 170 million program , it also noted that the civilian headhunters “ enlisted a lower quality of recruit . ”
Yet the Army ’s less - than - complimentary assessment of the private sector ’s performance did n’t sway its officials from announcing in August that they had awarded MPRI “ a firm - fixed price requirements - type contract for $ 11,196,996 as the base - period portion of an estimated $ 34,272,571 contract ( if all options are exercised ) for recruiting services to be performed at any of the Army ’s 1,700 recruiting stations nationwide . ”
9. How Low Can You Go ?
Lowered standards have hardly remained the property of privateers these days .
As Brad Knickerbocker of the Christian Science Monitor noted , “ The Army has had to recruit more soldiers from the ‘ lowest acceptable ’ category based on test scores , education levels , personal background , and other indicators of ability . ”
Even Undersecretary of Defense Chu admitted in July that almost 40 percent of all military recruits scored in the bottom half of the armed forces ’ own aptitude test .
Other how - low - can - you - go indicators of the military ’s desperation are now regularly surfacing in news reports .
Here are two examples :
Last year , the New York Times reported that two Ohio recruiters were quick to sign up a recruit “ fresh from a three - week commitment in a psychiatric ward even after the man ’s parents told them he had bipolar disorder  a diagnosis that would disqualify him . ”
After senior officers found out , the mentally ill man ’s enlistment was canceled , but in “ [ i] nterviews with more than two dozen recruiters in 10 states , ” the Times heard others talk of “ concealing mental - health histories and police records , ” among other illicit practices .
In May of this year , the Oregonian reported that Army recruiters , using hard sell - tactics and offering thousands of dollars in enlistment bonus money , signed up an autistic teenager “ for the Army ’s most dangerous job : cavalry scout . ”
The boy , who had been enrolled in “ special education classes since preschool ” and through “ a special program for disabled workers ha[d ] a part - time job scrubbing toilets and dumping trash , ” did n’t even know the U.S. was at war in Iraq until his parents explained it to him after he was first approached by a recruiter .
Only following a flurry of negative publicity did the Army announce that it would release the autistic teen from his enlistment obligation .
10 . Armed and Considered Dangerous
In 2004 , the Pentagon instituted a “ Moral Waiver Study ” whose seemingly benign goal was “ to better define relationships between pre-Service behaviors and subsequent Service success . ”
That turned out to mean opening the recruitment doors to potential enlistees with criminal records .
In February of this year , the Baltimore Sun wrote that there was “ a significant increase in the number of recruits with what the Army terms ‘ serious criminal misconduct ’ in their background ”  a category that included : “ aggravated assault , robbery , vehicular manslaughter , receiving stolen property , and making terrorist threats . ”
From 2004 to 2005 , the number of those recruits had spiked by over 54 percent , while alcohol and illegal drug waivers , reversing a four - year downward trend , increased by over 13 percent .
In June , the Chicago Sun-Times reported that , under pressure to fill the ranks , the Army had been allowing in increasing numbers of “ recruits convicted of misdemeanor crimes , according to experts and military records . ”
In fact , as the military ’s own data indicated , “ the percentage of recruits entering the Army with waivers for misdemeanors and medical problems has more than doubled since 2001 . ”
One beneficiary of the Army ’s new moral - waiver policies gained a certain prominence this summer .
After Steven D. Green , who served in the Army ’s 101st Airborne Division , was charged in a rape and quadruple murder in Mahmudiyah , Iraq , it was disclosed that he had been “ a high - school dropout from a broken home who enlisted to get some direction in his life , yet was sent home early because of an ‘ antisocial personality disorder . ' ”
Recently , Eli Flyer , a former Pentagon senior military analyst and specialist on “ the relationship between military recruiting and military misconduct ” told Harper ’s Magazine that Green had actually “ enlisted with a moral waiver for at least two drug - or alcohol - related offenses .
He committed a third alcohol - related offense just before enlistment , which led to jail time , though this offense may not have been known to the Army when he enlisted . ”
With Green in jail awaiting trial , the Houston Chronicle reported in August that Army recruiters were trolling around the outskirts of a Dallas - area job fair for ex-convicts .
“ We ’re looking for high school graduates with no more than one felony on their record , ” one recruiter said .
The Army has even looked behind prison bars for fill - in recruits  in one reported case , a “ youth prison ” in Ogden , Utah .
Although Steven Price had asked to see a recruiter while still incarcerated and was “ barely 17 when he enlisted last January , ” his divorced parents say “ recruiters used false promises and forged documents to enlist him . ”
While confusion exists about whether the boy ’s mother actually signed a parental consent form allowing her son to enlist , his “ father apparently was n’t even at the signing , but his name is on the form too . ”
11 . Gang Warfare
According to the Chicago Sun-Times , law enforcement officials report that the military is now “ allowing more applicants with gang tattoos because they are under the gun to keep enlistment up . ”
They also note that “ gang activity may be rising among soldiers . ”
The paper was provided with “ photos of military buildings and equipment in Iraq that were vandalized with graffiti of gangs based in Chicago , Los Angeles , and other cities . ”
Last month , the Sun - Times reported that a gang member facing federal charges of murder and robbery enlisted in the Marine Corps “ while he was free on bond  and was preparing to ship out to boot camp when Marine officials recently discovered he was under indictment . ”
While this particular recruit was eventually booted from the Corps , a Milwaukee police detective and Army veteran , who serves on the federal drug and gang task force that arrested the would - be Marine , noted that other “ [ g ] ang - bangers are going over to Iraq and sending weapons back gang members are getting access to military training and weapons . ”
Earlier this year , it was reported that an expected transfer of 10,000 - 20,000 troops to Fort Bliss , Texas , caused FBI and local law enforcement to fear “ a turf war ” between “ members of the Folk Nation gang [ and ] a criminal group that is already well - established in the area , Barrio Azteca . ”
The New York Sun wrote that , according to one FBI agent , “ Folk Nation , which was founded in Chicago and includes several branches using the name Gangster Disciples , has gained a foothold in the Army . ”
12 . Trading Desert Camo for White Sheets
Another type of “ gang ” member has also begun to proliferate within the military , evidently thanks to lowered recruitment standards and an increasing urge by recruiters to look the other way .
In July , a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks racist and right - wing militia groups , found that  due to pressing manpower concerns  “ large numbers of neo - Nazis and skinhead extremists ” are now serving the military .
“ Recruiters are knowingly allowing neo -Nazis and white supremacists to join the armed forces and commanders do n’t remove them from the military even after we positively identify them as extremists or gang members , ” said Scott Barfield , a Defense Department investigator quoted in the report .
The New York Times noted that the neo - Nazi magazine Resistance is actually recruiting for the U.S. military “ urg[ing ] skinheads to join the Army and insist on being assigned to light infantry units . ”
As the magazine explained , “ The coming race war and the ethnic cleansing to follow will be very much an infantryman ’s war .
It will be house - to - house until your town or city is cleared and the alien races are driven into the countryside where they can be hunted down and ‘ cleansed . ' ”
Apparently , the recruiting push has worked .
Barfield reported that he and other investigators have identified a network of neo -Nazi active - duty Army and Marine personnel spread across five military installations in five states .
“ They ’re communicating with each other about weapons , about recruiting , about keeping their identities secret , about organizing within the military . ”
Little wonder that “ Aryan Nations graffiti ” is now apparently competing for space among American inner-city gang graffiti in Iraq .
Force Transformation
When the American war in Vietnam finally ground to a halt , the U.S. military was in a state of disarray , if not near disintegration .
Uniformed leaders vowed never again to allow the military to be degraded to such a point .
A generation later , as the ever less appetizing - looking wars in Iraq and Afghanistan spiral on without end , an overstretched Army and Marine Corps have clearly become desperate .
At a remarkable cost in dollars , effort , and lowered standards , recruiting and retention numbers are being maintained for now .
The result : U.S. ground forces are increasingly made up of a motley mix of underage teens , old - timers , foreign fighters , gang - bangers , neo - Nazis , ex-cons , inferior officers , and a host of near - mercenary troops , lured in or kept in uniform through big payouts and promises .
In the latter half of the Vietnam War , as the breakdown was occurring , American troops began to scrawl “ UUUU ” on their helmet liners  an abbreviation that stood for “ the unwilling , led by the unqualified , doing the unnecessary for the ungrateful . ”
The U.S. ground forces of 2007 and beyond , fighting in Iraq , Afghanistan , or any other war du jour may increasingly resemble the collapsing military of the Vietnam War , the band of criminal misfits sent behind enemy lines during World War II in the classic Vietnam - era film , The Dirty Dozen , or the janissaries of the old Ottoman Empire .
With a growing majority of Americans opposed to the war in Iraq , even ardent hawks refusing to enlist in droves , and the Pentagon pulling out ever more stops and sinking to new lows in recruitment and retention , a new all - volunteer generation of UUUU ’s may emerge  the underachieving , unable , unexceptional , unintelligent , unsound , unhinged , unacceptable , unhealthy , undesirable , unloved , uncivil , and even un-American , all led by the unqualified , doing the unnecessary for the ungrateful .
Current practices suggest this may well be the force of the future .
It certainly is n’t the new military Donald Rumsfeld ’s been promising all these years , but there ’s no denying the depth of the transformation .

Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez is taking decisive steps to turn off the oil taps to the U.S .
Venezuela 's state owned oil company PDVSA has inked a key deal with India , taking the first key step away from the U.S. as its major oil buyer .
At the same time , PDVSA has announced that it will no longer reveal oil statistics to the SEC after paying off its debts .
The India deal and the refusal to disclose information are not just strategic , but also send a message to the U.S. about Venezuela 's future plans with regard to supplying the U.S. with oil .
No More Disclosure
According to the BBC : " Venezuela 's state oil firm has said it will no longer disclose information to US financial regulators after paying off debts in the US .
PDVSA said it was no longer obliged to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) after buying up $ 83 m in US - traded bonds . "
At the same time Venezuela has begun to ship two million barrels of oil to India per month , making use of India 's heavy crude refineries , for which Venezuela 's sulfur laden oil is no problem .
According to Stratfor.com : " While the new deal with India is relatively small , given that Venezuela produces more than 2 million barrels of oil in a single day , it nevertheless represents a step down a sustainable path toward diversifying Caracas ' oil markets . "
Venezuela has been working on diversifying its dependence on U.S. oil purchases for some time , having nurtured relationships with Iran and China , as well as India .
But because the U.S. and India are two of the few countries with existing refineries able to process heavy crude , the Chavez regime has had a difficult time getting beyond the conceptual stage with the strategy .
The India deal is small , considering the fact that Venezuela ships 1.5 million barrels of oil to the U.S. per day .
But it is a big signal , nevertheless .
According to Stratfor : " the April 12 deal with India is just one part of a nascent multi-tier cooperation between the two nations in which Venezuela is helping India develop its own heavy crude fields , and India is in turn purchasing Venezuelan heavy crude and investing in the facilities necessary to refine heavy crude . "
The Chevron Wildcard
The oil world , though , takes strange turns , as Chevron recently announced a stake in an Indian refinery that will be processing heavy crude shipped from Venezuela , and will provide products to Asia .
According to the BBC : " 5 % of Reliance Petroleum , a company set up by Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries to operate a new export refinery in north - west India .
The 580,000 barrels - per - day site in Jamnagar will process heavy crude and is due to open in December 2008 . "
There has been no mention of any intention of Chevron 's intentions to divert any gasoline from its India projects toward the U.S .
Conclusion
There are several key factors in this story , not the least of which is the international aspect of the oil market , and the effect of unintended consequences of any one party 's actions .
PDVSA cuts a deal with an Indian oil company in order to move away from the U.S. as its primary source of oil revenues .
Yet , Chevron , a U.S. company , slipped into the deal through the back door .
Chevron is playing it cool , noting that this venture will concentrate on providing oil to Asia .
Yet , all gasoline looks , feels , and smells similarly , which means that while ideologues will try to manipulate the markets , money will always win out .
Who 's to know where the gasoline we put in our gas tank in 2008 will come from ?
The only thing that is certain is that because of geopolitics , it will take a lot more money to take oil out of the ground , send it somewhere to get refined , and eventually deliver it to gas stations .
Futures Markets Predict Even Higher Prices Ahead
The mainstream press has finally tuned into the fact that crude oil is selling above $ 70 per barrel , but they have yet to note that the December 2006 crude contract is now testing the $ 75 area .
Meanwhile , gasoline and heating oil prices remain above $ 2 and natural gas has made a bottom , and looks to be heading higher as well .
A look ahead in natural gas shows that the December Natural gas contract is trading near $ 11 while the May contract is working on the $ 8 mark .
In other words traders are starting to place a significant premium for energy into the winter months , as they begin to speculate on potential supply disruptions .

MySpace will eventually be used to save the life of a cute puppy trapped in a well , and the company will bask in the glow of some unusual good press .
But until that happens , we 'll all have to settle for the more traditional stories of sexual predators , online harassment , and school officials who see MySpace as little more than a filthy cancer — and sometimes all three at once .
That 's the case in Texas , where an assistant principal is suing two students and their parents over a MySpace page that depicted the administrator as a lesbian and contained " obscene comments , pictures and graphics , " according to the court filing ( .DOC ) .
Anna Draker , who works at Clark High School in San Antonio , knows the kids behind the site well .
She had been forced to discipline them several times , and was aware of their animosity to her , but apparently did not suspect the lengths to which they would go to get a bit of revenge .
Ben Schreiber and Ryan Todd set up a MySpace page in Draker 's name earlier this year which " indicated by implication and by direct statement that Ms. Draker is a lesbian , which she is not . "
Furthermore , the page featured comments from other MySpace users , many of them other Clark students who knew Ms. Draker .
These messages were less than complimentary .
And it was n't just school students ; " a few were individuals Ms. Draker did not recognize , that lived near Clark High School , and had made suggestive , lewd and obscene comments based on the content of the webpage .
One of the teachers at Clark brought the page to Draker 's attention on April 19 , 2006 , and Draker claims that since then , she has had " many sleepless nights and worried days regarding this web page and the people who attempted to contact her through the web page . "
The situation rattled the school administration enough that Draker 's picture was removed from the school website and a brief video about the dangers of MySpace was posted instead .
Am I my brother 's child 's keeper ?
What sets this case apart from many other lawsuits filed over the content of blogs is that it does n't target only the teenagers who created the site .
It also argues that the parents were guilty of negligence by failing to supervise their children , and that they bear some of the responsibility for the defaming site .
The police were able to determine that the computers used to create the site were located in the students ' homes , and Draker 's lawsuit says that the parents have a duty to know what their children are up to — especially in light of both students ' past run-ins with Draker at school .
" Allowing access to the Internet , unsupervised and without restraint poses an obvious and unreasonable danger that such children would utilize the Internet for illicit purposes such as the ones alleged above , " says the suit in accusing the parents of " negligent supervision . "
We 'll leave it to the courts to decide if this is sound legal doctrine , but there 's certainly something in what Draker says .
As we have repeatedly argued when it comes to video games , parents need to take an interest ( and a supervisory role ) in the media that their children consume , and that holds true when it comes to the Internet as well .
Sticking a computer and a DSL modem in your child 's room and never showing the slightest bit of interest in what he does with that technology is the height of irresponsibility .
But clearly a line has to be drawn somewhere .
While parents should know in general what their kids are up to , they do n't know everything .
Nor should they — parenting should not be a Stasi - style exercise in control and absolute knowledge .
What kid wants to live in a home like that ?
So tricky situations like these end up before a judge , and such cases are becoming more common .
Bloggers across the country are learning the hard way that writing a blog does not always mean you can say anything you want ; sometimes , speech has consequences .

July 12 , 2006  -- Mikhail Gorbachev is generally regarded as the man who broke down the " iron curtain " that separated the communist world from the West and thawed the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union .
Now , 15 years after a coup removed him from power and the Soviet Union dissolved , he has some stern words for the United States , whose relationship with Russia has soured lately .
" We have made some mistakes , " he said , referring to recent attacks on Russia 's democracy .
" So what ?
Please do n't put even more obstacles in our way .
Do you really think you are smarter than we are ? "
The former general secretary of the Soviet Union Communist Party accused Americans of arrogance and trying to impose their way of life on other nations .
" Americans have a severe disease -- worse than AIDS .
It 's called the winner 's complex , " he said .
" You want an American style - democracy here .
That will not work . "
Gorbachev found a partner in former President Bush in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
During their time in power , communism fell in East Germany , when Germans tore down the legendary wall separating the democratic West from the communist East .
The collapse of communism quickly spread across eastern Europe , and the leaders worked together to create a partnership in the changing world
Gorbachev , however , is wry about the current president , George W. Bush .
" He 's very determined , " Gorbachev said .
" You ca n't say he does not have character . "
The former Soviet leader had severe criticism for two of the most important people in the Bush administration : Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
" They are just hawks protecting the interests of the military -- shallow people , " he said .
Criticism for Putin
Gorbachev also often has stern words for the Russian government , but frequently advises President Vladimir Putin , who is under fire for his authoritarian tactics .
" I told him I did not understand why he had canceled state elections .
There is no glasnost , " he said , referring to the Soviet push toward a more open society in the 1980s .
" No elections here like there used to be in '89 and ' 90 . "
" Vladimir Putin is walking on a razor 's edge , " he said .
" Putin has used and he will continue to use authoritarian measures , but Russia will form a democracy .
I know Vladimir Putin .
He is a moral person . "
Gorbachev said he was ultimately a Putin supporter and was impressed by the president 's need to create stability out of chaos .
Although he has assumed the role of senior statesman and remains active in Russian politics , Gorbachev said he was " 75 years .
Enough is enough . "
He has not given up the dream of Russian democracy and hopes to see his two granddaughters live in freedom .
" I want my grandchildren to live in a democratic country -- in a peaceful world , " he said .
" But it 's hard to imagine because there are so many answers we still need to find . "
Well now they 're back and they 're more accessible , even lighter in weight ( just 12 lines of JavaScript ) , have greater compatibility ( they now work in Opera and Safari without a hack in sight ) and can have multiple - levels .
The original Suckerfish Dropdowns article published in A List Apart proved to be a popular way of implementing lightweight , accessible CSS - based dropdown menus that accommodated Internet Explorer by mimicking the : hover pseudo - class .
Single - level Dropdowns
Right .
Let 's not beat around the bush .
The initial HTML we 're dealing with will look something like this :
< ul id =" nav " > < li > < a href= " # " > Percoidei</a> < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Remoras</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Tilefishes </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Bluefishes </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Tigerfishes </a></li> </ul > </ li > < li >< a href= " # " > Anabantoidei</a> < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Climbing perches</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Labyrinthfishes </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Kissing gouramis</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Pike - heads </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Giant gouramis</a></li> </ul > </li > <!-- etc. --> </ul >
A good wholesome structured unordered list .
To set things up we need some basic styling :
#nav , #nav ul { padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; list - style : none ; } #nav a { display : block ; width : 10em ; } #nav li { float : left ; width : 10em ; }
Note that you need to specify a width in the #nav li selector or else Opera will chuck a wobbly .
Also remember that because we 're floating things , the content underneath the dropdowns also needs to be cleared ( clear : left ) .
We obviously need to hide the lists that we want to ' drop down ' but to make things as accessible as possible we need to avoid using display : none , which , as is commonly mentioned in image replacement write - ups , hides elements from some screen readers .
You might think that there are a multitude of ways to deal with this , but having exhaustedly experimented with widths , heights , margins , top and clip across a large number of browsers , the best solution ( accommodating multiple level lists anyway ) lies in manipulating the left property .
The CSS specs say that top , right , bottom and left values should offset an absolutely positioned box from its containing block .
But unfortunately Opera decides to offset absolutely positioned boxes in relation to the page and that 's why the original Suckerfish Dropdowns did n't work on Opera - because they relied on the top and left properties with explicit lengths .
So instead of display : none we use left : - 999em to propel the dropdown list out of view and then left : auto ( rather than left : 0 ) to bring it back :
#nav li ul { position : absolute ; width : 10 em ; left : - 999em ; } #nav li:hover ul { left : auto ; }
And that will sort out everything for those browsers that fully support the : hover pseudo class , but for Internet Explorer we need to set the Suckerfish JavaScript loose :
sfHover = function ( ) { var sfEls = document.getElementById(" nav " ).getElementsByTagName( " LI " ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i<sfEls.length ; i++) { sfEls[i].onmouseover=function ( ) { this.className+= " sfhover " ; } sfEls[i].onmouseout=function ( ) { this.className=this.className.replace(new RegExp ( " sfhover\\b " ) , " " ) ; } } } if ( window.attachEvent ) window.attachEvent( " onload " , sfHover ) ;
Basically , this applies the ' sfhover ' class to li elements in the ' nav ' id 'd ul element when they are ' moused over ' and removes it , using a regular expression , when ' moused out ' .
So now we 've got the Suckerfish pumping out new classes , the next step is to simply duplicate the : hover selector with ' sfhover ' class selectors :
#nav li:hover ul , #nav li.sfhover ul { left : auto ; }
And there you go .
Your standard single - level dropdown menu .
Multi-level Dropdowns
The original Suckerfish Dropdowns article covered only single - level dropdown menus , but with a bit of an extension of the cascading logic , it is quite possible to create multi- level dropdowns with CSS too .
And , unlike the original Suckerfish JavaScript code , the ' sfHover ' function now applies the behaviour to all of the descendent li elements of ' nav ' rather than just the direct children so now multi- level dropdown menus are quite possible in Internet Explorer too .
So , to get started , let 's say we 're dealing with a list structure with more levels like this :
< ul id =" nav " > < li > < a href= " # " > Percoidei</a> < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Remoras </a> < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Echeneis</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Phtheirichthys </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Remora</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Remorina</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Rhombochirus </a></li> </ul > </ li > < li >< a href= " # " >
Tilefishes </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Bluefishes </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Tigerfishes </a></li> </ul > </ li > < li >< a href= " # " >
Anabantoidei</a> <!-- etc. --> </li> <!-- etc. --> </ul >
There are a few things we need to add to the single - level method .
Firstly , the third - level list ( in this example ' Echeneis , ' Phtheirichthys ' etc. ) needs to drop down to the side of the corresponding list item ( in this case ' Remoras ' ) , so we need to add this rule , which will apply to all dropdowns after the first one :
#nav li ul ul { margin : - 1em 0 0 10em ; }
Because we can't explicitly specify the top of the absolutely positioned boxes , they will sit below the line of the hovered list item , which is why the top margin of the next level of lists needs to be set to - 1 em .
But this wo n't pull the menus up far enough the be in line with the corresponding list item because by default line heights are greater than 1em ( usually 1.2em ) , so we need to add a little something to the initial ul rule set :
#nav , #nav ul { padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; list - style : none ; line - height : 1 ; }
Due to the cascading effect whereby upon the second level list being displayed , the third level list would also be revealed , we also need to explicitly hide that third level list ( remember that we need to duplicate the : hover pseudo class with the .sfhover class ) :
#nav li:hover ul ul , #nav li.sfhover ul ul { left : - 999em ; }
Now , this rule can be contradicted so that it is displayed when the corresponding list item is hovered over by expanding on the displaying of the dropdown ( which with the single level dropdown was #nav li:hover ul , #nav li.sfhover ul { left : auto ; } ) :
#nav li:hover ul , #nav li li:hover ul , #nav li.sfhover ul , #nav li li.sfhover ul { left : auto ; }
And that will establish a solid two level dropdown menu .
Following the same logic you can accommodate as many levels of dropdown menus as you want :
For three levels of dropdowns :
#nav li:hover ul ul , #nav li:hover ul ul ul , #nav li.sfhover ul ul , #nav li.sfhover ul ul ul { left : - 999em ; } #nav li:hover ul , #nav li li:hover ul , #nav li li li:hover ul , #nav li.sfhover ul , #nav li li.sfhover ul , #nav li li li.sfhover ul { left : auto ; }
And in the crazy event you need four levels :
#nav li:hover ul ul , #nav li:hover ul ul ul , #nav li:hover ul ul ul ul , #nav li.sfhover ul ul , #nav li.sfhover ul ul ul , #nav li.sfhover ul ul ul ul { left : - 999em ; } #nav li:hover ul , #nav li li:hover ul , #nav li li li:hover ul , #nav li li li li:hover ul , #nav li.sfhover ul , #nav li li.sfhover ul , #nav li li li.sfhover ul , #nav li li li li.sfhover ul { left : auto ; }
Examples
So you might have already looked at the one level , two level and three level bare - bones examples , which are probably the best places to take a look at the uncluttered source code in action , but , of course , you can make things look a bit prettier .
You could even turn it into a vertical menu rather than a horizontal one .

A committed Christian said today she planned to take legal action against her employers British Airways after the airline ruled that displaying her crucifix breached uniform rules
Heathrow check - in worker Nadia Eweida was sent home after refusing to remove the crucifix which breached BA 's dress code .
See also :
• Muslim pharmacist refuses to give morning after pill ' on religious grounds '
• Axe for teacher who kept her veil on in the classroom
Her treatment by BA - which styles itself as the " world 's favourite airline " - brought condemnation both from Christian groups and members of other faiths last night .
BA 's chief executive Willie Walsh has upheld the action against Miss Eweida for failing to comply with " uniform regulations " despite himself coming under fire recently for failing to wear a tie .
Miss Eweida , who has an unblemished record during seven years at BA , is suing her employer for religious discrimination after being suspended from work without pay for two weeks .
She said her treatment was all the more extraordinary as she and fellow employees had just undergone " diversity training " - including receiving advice from pressure group Stonewall on how to treat gays and lesbians in the workplace .
The airline 's uniform code states that staff must not wear visible jewellery or other ' adornments ' while on duty without permission from management .
It makes exceptions for Muslim and Sikh minorities by allowing them to wear hijabs and turbans .
Under rules drawn up by BA 's ' diversity team ' and ' uniform committee ' ,
Sikh employees can even wear the traditional iron bangle - even though this would usually be classed as jewellery - while Muslim workers are also allowed prayer breaks during work time .
But Miss Eweida , 55 , from Twickenham , insisted her cross , which is smaller than a ten pence piece , was not jewellery but an expression of her deep Christian faith .
She questioned why she was being forced to hide her religion when BA 's Muslim and Sikh workers could express theirs .
Miss Eweida said last night : " I will not hide my belief in the Lord Jesus .
British Airways permits Muslims to wear a headscarf , Sikhs to wear a turban and other faiths religious apparel .
" Only Christians are forbidden to express their faith .
I am a loyal and conscientious employee of British Airways , but I stand up for the rights of all citizens . "
Her case comes at a time of intense debate over the rights of individuals to express their belief - following Jack Straw 's call for Muslim women to remove their veils .
Earlier this month it emerged BBC governors had agonised over whether newsreader Fiona Bruce should wear a small cross on a chain around her neck while on air in case it might cause offence by suggesting a religious affiliation .
Miss Eweida , a Coptic Christian whose father is Egyptian and mother English , was ordered to remove her cross or hide it beneath a company cravat by a duty manager at Heathrow 's Terminal 4 last month .
She then sought permission from management to wear the chain - but was turned down .
When Miss Eweida , who is unmarried , refused to remove the necklace she was offered the choice of suspension with pay or unpaid leave , pending a disciplinary hearing .
Following a meeting with her managers on 22 September 2006 , Customer Service Manager Caroline Girling told Miss Eweida in a letter : " You have been sent home because you have failed to comply with a reasonable request .
" You were asked to cover up or remove your cross and chain which you refused to do .
" British Airways uniform standards stipulate that adornments of any kind are not to be worn with the uniform . "
In a letter to Miss Eweida 's MP , Vince Cable , last week , BA chief executive Willie Walsh insisted his employee had not yet been disciplined but said she was off work for failing to comply with " uniform regulations " .
He added : " We have previously made changes to our uniform policy to accommodate requests , after a detailed evaluation process including Health and Safety assessment to incorporate the wearing of Sikh bangles . "
But Miss Eweida said : " BA refuses to recognise the wearing of a cross as a manifestation of the Christian faith , but rather defines it as a piece of decorative jewellery .
" I would like to say how disappointed I am in this decision and the lack of respect shown by BA towards the Christian faith .
" I have been badly treated .
I am a loyal and hardworking employee and for seeking similar rights to other employees , I have been treated harshly by British Airways management .
" British Airway can be great again , but it needs to treat Chrstians fairly .
I am not ashamed of my faith . "
Miss Eweida is suing BA under the Employment Equality ( Religion or Belief ) Regulations 2003 .
Her case is being supported by her union , the TGWU , and she has hired Paul Diamond , a barrister specialising in religious affairs and an adviser for the Keep Sunday Special campaign , to represent her at her employment tribunal .
And a petition of support has been signed by more than 200 fellow workers .
BA is already at the centre of a criminal investigation into alleged price - fixing - which has led to the resignations of two executives .
The airline has come under fire in the past for its adherence to political correctness .
A decade ago it attempted to ditch its traditional Union Flag tailfin in favour of an ethnic design - which provoked the anger of Baroness Thatcher .
Mr Cable , MP for Twickenham and Liberal Democrat deputy leader said : " It is absolutely mind boggling that Britain 's flag - carrying airline could treat its employees in such a disgraceful and petty manner .
" Nadia is a devout Christian who was displaying her faith , but in a modest and totally unprovocative manner .
" It is absolutely right that other religious minorities be allowed exemption from the dress code , but why ca n't a Christian be treated in the same way ? "
Dr Patrick Sookhdeo , international director of the Christian charity the Barnabas Fund , said : " Discrimination against Christians is commonplace in Muslim - majority contexts , such as Egypt where Nadia 's family roots are .
" Now we see the same thing increasingly happening within the UK .
" Her Sikh and Muslim colleagues at BA can show their faith publicly in what they wear , but Nadia and other Christians cannot .
All we are asking for is a level playing field for all faiths . "
Andrea Williams of the Lawyers ' Christian Fellowship said : " The forces of political correctness are such that an individual needs to be very determined to protect their rights . "
About a month ago , one of my regular respondents asked me to blog about self - awareness in animals .
I ’m doing so now because it will be useful for an essay I ’m planning to write about ethical and legal definitions of humanity .
Let ’s start by defining a slightly more abstract category , what science - fiction fans call a ‘ sophont ’ .
A being or animal is fully sophont if it :
Shows behavioral evidence of self - awareness , e.g knows it has a mind .
Shows awareness of the existence of other minds .
Communicates abstractions using language .
Invents and uses tools .
Can reason about counterfactual hypotheticals , e.g. can answer questions of the form “ What would things be like if a fact I am now observing to be true were not true ? ”
( That last one may seem odd to those of you not familiar with primate ethology , but bear with me … )
Normal human beings pass all these tests .
Few animals are known to even come close to passing all of them — but the “ are known ” is necessary , because in some cases animals might pass all of the tests other than tool use without being able to communicate that to humans .
Some people feel quite strongly about animal rights .
Their position does not , however , generally spring from an assertion that animals are sophonts ; rather , it seems to come down to an unwillingness , or inability , to distinguish between sophont status and sentience — that is , being able to feel .
In practice , while theoretically even insects can feel , even PETA members tend to ascribe sentience only to animals that can exchange recognizable emotional signals with us — which is to say , basically , mammals .
The mamalian repertoire of behaviors for communicating states like fear , affection , anger , boredom , and playfulness is remarkably conservative .
So much so that humans can have meaningful emotional communication with cats , dogs , and raccoons , a datum that would be astonishing if we were n’t so used to it !
Some mammals are so good at this that we routinely keep them around for pleasure .
Even dogs and cats exhibit little evidence of sophont behavior , though .
They can learn tricks by reinforcement , but they do n’t use tools , they show only very weak problem - solving intelligence and even less evidence that they have a theory of mind or self - awareness .
One test animal behaviorists use for self - awareness is whether the animal will try to remove a smudge from its face when it sees itself in the
mirrors ; cats and dogs generally fail this .
Sentience is less than sophont status .
There are , however , interesting borderline cases among the animals .
Chimpanzees , bonobos , gorillas , orang - utans , dolphins , whales , seals , otters , elephants , a few species of birds , and even octopi and squid have all displayed not merely sentience but suspiciously sophont - like behaviors .
Here are some data :
Great apes can learn sign language and use it in original ways , including coining new terms and making puns ; they also make and use tools and have complex social patterns recognizably akin to human ones .
Some apes can pass the mirror test .
Some handle abstractions tolerably well , and there is a famous incident in which a gorilla named Koko speculated to its trainers about an afterlife after its pet kitten died .
There is some , disputed , evidence that dolphins can in fact learn to use iconic languages .
Nobody who has interacted with dolphins at any length is in any doubt that they have minds , recognize human beings as having minds , and have a lively sense of humor ( not infrquently they try to include humans in their play ) .
They can count and have at least a limited ability to handle abstractions .
Claims that they are sophont at human level are not established by evidence , but nobody who has studied the evidence would be much surprised if
they turned out to be .
they turned out to be .
Elephants use tools , engage in complex vocal communication ( parts of which are infrasonic , entertainingly enough ) , have elaborate social behaviors , play jokes on their trainers , and apparently grieve for their dead .
They pass the mirror test .
And they really do have long memories ; they ’ve been known to wait years for a chance to take revenge an abusive human .
New evidence suggests they may be very close to human in intelligence and self - awareness .
Some parrots and crows can count .
Some talking birds appear to graduate from mimicry to using learned words to express emotional states , and a few seem to make the jump to talking about the emotional states of humans .
Mediterranean squid have a very high brain - mass - to - body - mass ratio ( this correlates with various indicators of intelligence in mammals ) .
They been observed to solve mechanical problems ( how to extract the tasty food fish from the corked bottle ) by examining their environment , thinking for a while , then acting quickly and correctly .
Octopi and squid appear to communicate within groups using color flashes made with chromatophores in their skins ; nobody know what they ’re communicating , exactly , but the potential bandwidth of that channel is extremely high .
There is even some evidence of observational learning in octopi .
Significantly , the birds who seem to be using speech , and the apes who handle abstractions best , are animals that have lived with humans for a long time .
Even cats and dogs , though not very bright compared to elephants or dolphins or chimps , accasionally show flashes of self - awareness ( for example , by recognizing themselves in a mirror ) .
Given all this animal data , what ’s left as a unqiquely human capability ?
Though interpretation of the experimental results is controversial , one thing even the cleverest nonhuman primates seem to have problems with are counterfactual hypotheticals .
Imagine a table with two red balls , three green balls , and an upright paper screen large enough to hide a sixth ball behind it .
To human beings , the following two questions are both easy and nearly indistinguishable :
How many green balls would be in the room if there were a green ball behind the screen ?
How many green balls would you be able to see if the leftmost green ball were red ?
But these two questions are subtly different .
The first is a what - if that is consistent with all visible facts : the second is a what - if that contradicts a visible fact ( thus ‘ counterfactual ’ ) .
The brightest non-human primates handle questions like the first one pretty well , but questions like the second one rather poorly .
They do n’t seem to have have the capacity to construct a full - blown hypothetical universe in their heads and reason about it despite what observable reality is telling them .
( This test has only been done with primates .
You need to have a language in common with your subject (s ) to do it ; primates can use sign language or symbol tiles , but communication with other possible quasi - sophonts is far more limited so far . )
If this test is to be believed , what distinguishes humans from other higher primates is not reasoning ability but imagination !

Haskell is Purely Functional - apparently , Haskell is a purely functional programming language .
Scheme has some impurities floating around herer and there .
Well , wonderful .
But I do n't see the big deal .
I mean , can it be a bad thing to allow some ( limited ) flexibility in the paradigm ?
I really do think this is going to be the hallmark of the next 5 - 10 years of PL design - this insistence on pure versions of various paradigms .
And I also think it 's silly .
It 's one thing for a language to support a particular paradigm and encourage its use , but to choose one paradigm exclusively is to deliberately exclude classes of users .
But OK , ya'll have fun making your loop objects in Ruby , or doing monadic I/O in Haskell .
Do n't let me spoil the fun !

Monads - not that anyone actually knows what these are , but Monads are the shit , let me tell you .
So this is the functional programmer 's OOP .
Monads are supposed to be some kind of huge foundational paradigm shift , but all they really are is a way to introduce sequencing and side - effects into the " purely functional " programming languages .
Which of course just illustrates the point above : there is no sense in having a purely functional programming language ! .
Now , actually , I 'm being too harsh .
Monads may not be strictly necessary , but the fact that they had to be discovered to make Haskell work properly has led to more than one insight ( demonstrating that seemingly unrelated computations in fact have related forms ) in computation theory .
So Monads are useful .
It 's just that it 's a bit embarrassing to watch the Haskell people go all glowy over something that started out - let 's be honest - as a workaround .
They 're scaffolding for people who like to pretend that programs are proofs - that programming is just math .
But programming is more than that and we all know it .

Monads are supposed to be some kind of huge foundational paradigm shift , but all they really are is a way to introduce sequencing and side - effects into the " purely functional " programming languages .
Which of course just illustrates the point above : .
Now , actually , I 'm being too harsh .
Monads may not be strictly , but the fact that they had to be discovered to make Haskell work properly has led to more than one insight ( demonstrating that seemingly unrelated computations in fact have related forms ) in computation theory .
So Monads are useful .
It 's just that it 's a bit embarrassing to watch the Haskell people go all glowy over something that started out - let 's be honest - as a workaround .
They 're scaffolding for people who like to pretend that programs are proofs - that programming is just math .
But programming is more than that and we all know it .
Call - by - need - I can never put my finger on just why , but I think this is largely hype too .
For those not in the know - " call - by - need " is one broad category of functional semantics a programming language can exhibit .
The main ones are call - by - value , call - by - reference , call - by - name and call - by - need .
The overwhelming majority of PLs use call - by - value .
This means two things - broadly : ( 1 ) when you pass a value to a function parameter , the function will not change the value passed .
It may perform operations on it using private variables , but it will not actually change the caller 's value unless you ask it to .
This is distinct from call - by - reference , where variable names all refer , thoughout a program , to the associated memory register .
In call - by - refernece , when you name a variable inside a function x , it 's the same x as any variables by that name outside the function .
Parameters passed to functions are the same as the variables associated with them .
Run -time efficient , but computationally confusing .
( 2 ) Arguments are evaluated before being passed to the function .
This is the disctinction with call - by - name .
In call - by - name , arguments are passed as they are to functions .
So - to use one of Friedman 's examples - the difference can be seen in the return value of this function :
fun x = x + x
Looks like a function that doubles its argument , right ?
And under call - by - value it is - becuase x gets evaluated before it 's passed .
But with call - by - need it is n't necessarily .
If we said :
x ( random 10 )
we might not get double anything - might get an odd number .
And that 's because in call - by - name what gets passed is ( random 10 ) itself .
So for each x in the body it is reevaluated .
This seems silly , but it 's actually very useful in some cases because it prevents code from being unnecessarily evaluated .
In addition to sometimes being an efficiency gain ( though not always ) , this has the huge advantage of minimizing chances of going into infinite loops .
Well , call - by - need is supposed to be the best of both worlds .
It has the lazy evaluation of call - by - name , but once an argument has been evaluated it also remembers that value so that the semantics come out right - i.e. our example function is a doubling function for all arguments again .
I dunno - I can't prove it but I think there 's something cheesy about this .
It 's another smug Haskell pretend solution - something just tells me so .
On the documented side - it is true that evaluation order becomes a problem here .
I wo n't give a motivating example because I think this is probably obvious from the example above .
Now , evaluation order is n't always such a big deal in functional langages ( especially , one presumes , in purely functional languages ... ) , but it could still be annoying I think .
But until I can come up with something better than " evaluation order problems , " I think I 'm going to have to admit that this feature of Haskell is indeed Very Cool .
After all , evaluation order problems are less severe than the enhanced potential infinite loop problems that Scheme 's call - by - value paradigm has .
As a subject of minor annoyance , Lambda the Ultimate has a bit suggesting that someone translate Hofstadter 's Scientific American columns introducing Scheme to a general audience into Haskell .
Yet more evidence that Scheme is losing its " cool " factor .
The thing is , I do n't think there 's any good reason for it .
There is nothingwith Scheme .
I think the onlyreason that people switch to Haskell and so on is just to jump a train .
Scheme 's been plugging along since 1975 , and people therefore think it 's time for something new .
Why Haskell ?
Here are the commonly - cited reasons :
So anyway - lots of the stuff that 's supposedly cool about Haskell is ... well , cool , but maybe not as cool as we 're often led to believe .
To all of the above I just want to say : I admit that call - by - need is probaby cool .
Monads are cool too , but maybe not to the extent people wet their pants over them ( and anyway they 're supported in Scheme too ) .
The purely functional stuff is crap and is actually an argumentHaskell , in my opinion .
But then , I underestimate the extent to which some people are born with the functional programming gene .
In any case , I think Haskell is a fad , and one that has already peaked , at that .
It 's here to stay , do n't get me wrong , but it definitely is n't the Next Big Thing - neither in the functional programming subculture nor in the real world of industry programming .
Which is why I get a little annoyed that so many Haskell hackers think Scheme should just step aside .
This town 's definitely big enough for both of us , thanks partner .
For anyone trying to lose weight , this question is an exciting one !
If you simply want to know if your body burns calories warming up the water , the answer is yes .
But if you want to know if drinking a lot of ice water can help you lose weight , or keep weight off , this " yes " needs to be qualified with some calculations .
First of all , calories are case - sensitive .
There are calories and then there are Calories .
Calories with a big " c " are the ones used to describe the amount of energy contained in foods .
A calorie with a little " c " is defined as the amount of energy it takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius .

What most people think of as a Calorie is actually a kilo - calorie :
It takes one Calorie to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius .
So when you drink a 140 - Calorie can of cola , you are ingesting 140,000 calories .
There is no cause for alarm , because the conversion applies across the board .
When you burn 100 Calories jogging a mile , you are burning 100,000 calories .
So , considering that the definition of a calorie is based on raising the temperature of water , it is safe to say that your body burns calories when it has to raise the temperature of ice water to your body temperature .
And unless your urine is coming out ice cold , your body must be raising the temperature of the water .
So calories are being burned .
Let 's figure out exactly what you 're burning when you drink a 16 - ounce ( 0.5 liter ) glass of ice water :
The temperature of ice water can be estimated at zero degrees Celsius .
Body temperature can be estimated at 37 degrees Celsius .
It takes 1 calorie to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius .
There are 473.18 grams in 16 fluid ounces of water .
So in the case of a 16 - ounce glass of ice water , your body must raise the temperature of 473.18 grams of water from zero to 37 degrees C . In doing so , your body burns 17,508 calories .
But that 's calories with a little " c. "
Your body only burns 17.5 Calories , and in the grand scheme of a 2,000 - Calorie diet , that 17.5 is n't very significant .
But let 's say you adhere to the " eight 8 - ounce glasses of water a day " nutritional recommendation .
In 64 ounces of water , there are 1,892.72 grams .
So to warm up all that water in the course of a day , your body burns 70,030 calories , or 70 Calories .
And over time , that 70 Calories a day adds up .
So , while you definitely should n't depend on ice water consumption to replace exercise or a healthy diet , drinking cold water instead of warm water does , in fact , burn some extra Calories !
Over the last 24 hours I have n't been able to help myself but dig a little deeper into the Vista story and I have to tell you , I 've not read more fascinating content on the Internet than I found at the Mini Microsoft blog in the comments section on this post .
There are an amazing 400 + comments but do n't let that deter you because all the good stuff is right at the top .
Basically , it 's a whole bunch of Microsoft developers and staffers bitching about everything from compensation , hours , shipping schedules , management incompetence , accountability and so on .
If you want to take a real peak under the hood , forget Scoble , this is where the real naked conversation is going on .
( The quality of comments decreases exponentially after the post gets slashdotted and the geek mob arrives but the dude behind mini Microsoft has provided a summary of the best comments here ) .
Basically , the thread gets down to the fact that Vista is a bloated product and Microsoft has become a bloated company , with one staffer comparing what M$ has become to the old Big Bloated Bluey .
The real problem for Microsoft is it has invested about as much money as the Gross Domestic Product of more than a few African nations in an operating system that became out - of - date about a year before it was due to ship .
The simple fact is we do n't need another desktop operating system .
We need an Everywhere OS .
When was the last time you smacked your PC across the display because XP did n't look pretty enough or was lacking some key feature you needed .
Do n't ask me because I could n't tell you .
Now tell me when was the last time you found yourself at a loss because there was some file on your home PC that you really needed when you were on the road .
I reckon I have that problem once a week , at least .
Do you use multiple computers too ?
Find it frustrating trying to remember how you set up the file system on each one ?
I 've written before how I think Google is working towards an online / offline future .
Now if Microsoft really wanted to trump the big G , this is where they could hit them with a great big plank of four by two .
Start the foundation of your next operating system with the kind of technology that appears to drive Omindrive or Sharpcast ( I say appear because both are still pre-public beta so I 've not played with either yet ) .
Do n't tack online tricks onto the back of a desktop .
Start with this model .
Get replication , synchronisation , online / offline file system models right first and foremost and then tack everything else on around it .
I do n't care if you have to start again , nobody does .
Build a skinny Windows emulator for those apps that some customers just have to have , but once you give developers a platform to build all of their applications according to the online / offline model , who 's going to want to keep a desktop bound application , anyway .
Change the paradigm , Microsoft and watch the innovation flourish .
Re-energise your devs with a project that really does matter .
Enabled your third - party developers to re-cast their applications .
Give people a real reason to upgrade their software and give our industry a real - lift in the process .
Build the Everywhere OS .
Let me centralise my desktops , my favourites , my preferences , my file structure and have it follow me where ever I may go .
And while you 're there , start again with security so that we can make this model inherently protected .
Because once you enable true online / offline , all these AJAX applications start to look pretty lame .
Finally , you enable the software industry to build true , rich applications that can natively harness the collaborative and everywhere nature of the Internet .
And guess what , as an added bonus for software monopolisits who call within the next five minutes , free to you , a subscription model !
Finally you have a genuine reason not only to ask your users to pay for that up - front upgrade , because who the hell would n't upgrade to the Everywhere OS , plus you can charge them an annual fee for their online storage requirements .
Google may be heading in this direction with G : Drive , GDS and Lighthouse but they 're at a fundamental disadvantage because they do n't control the OS of - choice today so they have very little leverage in regard to the offline part of the equation .
Apple are more intent on pushing into the loungeroom and the open source brigade would take a decade to regroup and respond to this kind of initiative .
In fact , really only Microsoft has both the online and offline clouth plus the developer network to properly pull this off within the forseeable future .
Maybe Microsoft is headed in this direction with Live ?
However , it does n't appear to be .
I do n't think it can do this until it makes the strategic decision to let loose it legacy model and start again from scratch .
But I reckon if you took 50 of the smartest devs in Microsoft and gave them a project like this to sink their teeth into , they 'd probably beat out Vista , if they did n't have to worry about the backward - compatibility issue .
Hell , if Microsoft wo n't do it , maybe there 's a start - up out there who can .
OS X was n't created by Apple let 's remember .
Build this and I reckon you 'll have Bill and Steve coming knocking on your door in double - time flat .
You can even have my Everywhere OS name , free , gratis , on me .
The industry needs this .
Build it and we will come .
CHAD TROUTWINE , an entrepreneur in Malibu , Calif. , was negotiating a commercial lease earlier this year for a building he owns in the Midwest .
Though talks began well , they soon grew rocky .
The telltale sign that things had truly devolved ?
The sign - offs on the e-mail exchanges with his prospective tenant .
“ As negotiations started to break down , the sign - offs started to get decidedly shorter and cooler , ” Mr. Troutwine recalled .
“ In the beginning it was like , ‘ I look forward to speaking with you soon ’ and ‘ Warmest regards , ’ and by the end it was just ‘ Best . ’ ” The deal was eventually completed , but Mr. Troutwine still felt as if he had been snubbed .
What ’s in an e-mail sign - off ?
A lot , apparently .
Those final few words above your name are where relationships and hierarchies are established , and where what is written in the body of the message can be clarified or undermined .
In the days before electronic communication , the formalities of a letter , either business or personal , were taught to every third - grader ; sign - offs — from “ Sincerely ” to “ Yours truly ” to “ Love ” — came to mind without much effort .
Feb. 7 , 2006  -- A wild New Year 's
Eve two years ago has landed a Georgia teen in prison for 10 years on charges of child molestation in a case that has state legislators reworking the strict law that put him behind bars .
Genarlow Wilson and a group of friends had the kind of bash no parent would want their teenager to attend .
Crime scene investigators combing the room in a Days Inn in the small town of Douglasville , Ga. , found evidence of drinking , as well as condoms and wrappers littered all over .
Plus , there was a video camera .
In a portion of a tape obtained by " Primetime , " Wilson , then 17 and an honor student and star athlete who was homecoming king , is seen having intercourse with a 17 - year - old girl , who was seen earlier on the bathroom floor .
During the sex act , she appears to be sleepy or intoxicated but never asks Wilson to stop .
Later on in the tape , she is seen being pulled off the bed .
Other portions of the tape show a second girl , who was 15 and later said she did not drink that night .
She was recorded having oral sex with several boys in succession , including Wilson .
The following morning , Wilson got a phone call that would change his life .
He learned from a friend that the 17 - year - old had gone to the police to report that she 'd been raped .
" I was , like , ' What ?
When was this happening ?
Did this happen at the same party I was at ? ' "
Wilson said .
" It was shocking to me . "
A Decade in Prison
Authorities believed the 17 - year - old alleged rape victim and said she was too intoxicated to consent to any sexual acts , which is what Georgia law requires , otherwise these acts can be considered rape .
Six boys , including Wilson , were arrested on various charges , including rape .
District Attorney David McDade said the videotape was critical to his case .
" There is no doubt that without the videotape we would have to be relying on the statements of these young people , and that would have been a more difficult prosecution , " he said .
Wilson maintained his innocence .
" I know that it was consensual , " he told " Primetime . "
" I would n't went on with the acts if it was n't consensual .
I 'm not that kind of person .
No means no . "
Five of the boys accepted plea deals , but Wilson -- the only one without a police record -- held out .
" I knew Genarlow 's state of mind , " said his attorney , Michael Mann .
" He was n't going to prison willingly .
He was n't going to plea to something in his mind he did n't do . "
He stood trial in February 2005 for five days .
And at first , the jury 's deliberations moved swiftly .
Jurors voted to acquit Wilson of raping the 17 - year - old .
" I mean it was n't even an hour , " said jury forewoman Marie Manigault .
" We immediately saw the tape for what it was .
We went back and saw it again and saw what actually happened and everybody immediately said not guilty . "
But there was one other charge the jury had to decide on .
The second girl in the videotape was 15 , and the age of consent in Georgia is 16 .
And under state law , prosecutors charged Wilson with aggravated child molestation .
To those close to the young man , it was an outrage .
" Nobody could believe that this is the law , " Mann said .
Even jurors frowned on the charge .
" A bad law , absolutely , " Manigault said .
And in Georgia , that they 'd had oral sex made matters worse .
Until 1998 , oral sex between husband and wife was illegal , punishable by up to 20 years in prison .
In Wilson 's case , even though he is only two years older than the girl , she was 15 and -- willing or not -- could not consent legally that night .
Whatever their feelings about the law , jurors felt they had no choice but to find Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation .
Moments later , back in the jury room , jurors were told for the first time that the conviction came with a mandatory sentence of at least 10 years in prison .
In addition , Wilson would be forced to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life .
McDade said Wilson could have had a better outcome if he had accepted the plea deal .
" What I believe is that Genarlow Wilson listened to people who were trying to use this case for another agenda and he followed their advice , " he said .
" Do I believe that [ in ] Genarlow Wilson 's case justice would have been served if he accepted a lesser plea ?
Sure I do .
I wish he had of .
Sure I do . "
' Doing What 's Right '
Before the incident , Wilson -- by any measure -- had beaten the odds .
The son of a single mom , the high school senior was an honor student and an all - conference football player and track star , with offers to play in college .
He was popular enough to be elected homecoming king at Douglas County High .
" I was the first - ever homecoming king at my high school , " he said .
" That was a very great privilege for me . "
Atlanta attorney B.J. Bernstein has filed Wilson 's appeal .
She said prosecutors should never have brought charges and that justice should have been meted out at home .
And a state legislator who helped pass the molestation law said it was never meant to police teen sex .
" The legislative intent was to protect women and children from sexual predators , " said Rep. Tyrone Brooks , a Democrat in the Georgia State Assembly .
As the court considers Wilson 's appeal , the Georgia legislature is rewriting the law that sent Wilson to prison .
In a bill that has passed the House and is pending in the Senate , the crime would become a misdemeanor , punishable by no more than a year in prison , or even probation .
And anyone convicted would not have to register as a sex offender .
Today Wilson remains as steadfast as ever about not taking the deal that would have reduced his sentence by half .
" It 's all about doing what 's right , " he said .
" And what 's right is right , and what 's wrong is wrong .
And I 'm just standing up for what I believe in . "

As you probably know , long awaited Visual Studio 2005 SP1 is out .
However , installation of this giant ( 400 + Mb ) update is far from easy , and it is not guaranteed to succeed , at least at first run .
You need to have a LOT free space on your system drive : at least 3 Gb Make sure that you have enough patience – it can take between 10 minutes and 1,5 hour If you do not use C++ portion of Visual Studio , deinstall it before installation of SP1 – it can save a lot of installation time .
Deinstall Web Application Project if you have it installed .
Deinstall Visual Studio 2005 Web Deployment Projects if you have it installed .
Deinstall Visual Studio 2005 SP1 beta
Finally , you can speed up installation process by :
Disabling Patch Cache
Create CMD file with following content :
reg export HKLMSoftwarePoliciesMicrosoftWindowsInstaller installer.reg
reg add HKLMSoftwarePoliciesMicrosoftWindowsInstaller
/v MaxPatchCacheSize /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
net stop msiserver
start / wait VS80sp1-KB926601-X86-ENU.exe
reg delete HKLMSoftwarePoliciesMicrosoftWindowsInstaller
/v MaxPatchCacheSize /f
reg import installer.reg
net stop msiserver
del /q installer.reg 2>nul
and save it in folder where SP1 is .
Run it – it should cut down installation time significantly .
Ok , you succeeded to do all above , and installation is failing .
What next ?
Error 1718
Let assume that your operating system is XP SP2 .
If you got during installation this error :
Error 1718 .
File was rejected by digital signature policy
try recipe from this location :
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925336
– this helped with installation on two locations where it failed previously .
I have Windows Server 2003 SP1 and unfortunately , neither of solutions ( disable patch cache or KB925336 ) helped 🙁
I though that memory upgrade will help , so I added 1 Gb to total of 2 Gb – no luck .
You can also try to :
Disable SAFER check for local administrators
– Note ( if exist ) previous value of Policy Scope at :
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREPoliciesMicrosoftwindowssafercodeidentifiers
– Set this value ( or create it as DWORD if does not exist ) to 1
– Run net stop msiserver
– Try SP1 install
– Revert PolicyScope to previous value / delete it after installation .
( this helped on two other Windows 2003 SP1 machines ; again , not on mine )
Finally , I decided to :
Slipstream SP1 into Visual Studio 2005 and reinstall it
There are couple steps here :
Make Network Installation
Create network administrative installation from your VS 2005 DVD ( assuming that E : is DVD and location where you want installation \ dvesicpublicVisualStudio2005SP1 ) :
msiexec.exe /a E:vsvs_setup.msi TARGETDIR=\dvesicpublicVisualStudio2005SP1 /L*vx install.log
I did this all on same machine , using mounted ISO image on a virtual drive and unpacking it at network location on same machine – it took over 2 hours to create network install
Unpack the Patch
Original EXE file is just wrapper around MS Patch file .
You can unpack it using some unzip utility ( or Total Commander ) or by executing :
VS80sp1-KB926601-X86-ENU.exe / extract .
Patch Network Install
Finally , do the patching of installation :
msiexec.exe /a \dvesicpublicVisualStudio2005SP1vs_setup.msi /p VS80sp1-KB926601-X86-ENU.msp /L*vx patch.log
Reinstall Visual Studio 2005 SP1
I hope that at least some of this will help you too .

I 'm forty - four years old .
The first time I remember hearing the name Muhammad Ali was in Juanuary , 1971 , when he fought Joe Frazier in New York 's Madison Square Garden .
The highly touted " Battle of the Century . "
I grew up in rural Missouri so the mere sound of the name Muhammad Ali grated on my ear .
I did n't know a muslim from muscrat .
But I did know this :
My DAD hated that " loud mouthed , draft dodgin ' nigger . "
And I hated my dad .
So I decided I loved Muhammad Ali .
Ali lost that fight .
Frazier beat him fair and square .
I collect fight films now as a hobby and I 've seen the fight a hundred times .
Frazier won it .
And his monumental left hook in the fifteenth round should be taught in boxing textbooks .
But more to the point , I learned my first lesson in How to be a Man 101 from that fight : lose gracefully .
Ali's response to the fight at the press conference , his jaw swollen literally to the size of a grapefruit : " Joe beat me .
He 's the champion .
But I 'll be back . "
Huh ?
What happened to " Float like a butterfly , sting like a bee ? "
What happened to " I am the greatest ? "
What happened to " If Joe even dreams he can beat me , he oughta wake up and apologize ? "
Lose gracefully .
And never stop trying .
Some short time later I began to box myself .
I joined Golden Gloves .
I learned what I could of " the sweet science . " I competed .
I was never really very good , but I won some .
And I kept trying .
In 1972 , Ali got his jaw broken in the first round against a former Marine that no one outside of California had ever heard of : Kenny Norton .
Ali fought the next eleven rounds with a broken jaw .
He lost that fight , too .
The pain must have been nearly unimaginable .
And the fight ( which , again , I 've seen many times ) was VERY close .
Another lesson from Ali in How to be a Man 101 : keep trying through adversity .
Endure pain .
Fight THROUGH the pain .
Never let 'em see you hurt .
And above all , do n't quit .
Later , like Frazier , he came back to defeat Norton twice .
Lesson number three :
If at first you do n't succeed ... face your fears AGAIN .
If you know you 're better than your failure - take it on again and prove it to yourself .
In 1974 , Muhammad Ali fought a real - life , living , breathing boogey man : George Forman .
A giant of a man that had actually crippled other fighters in the ring .
He 'd decimated both Frazier and Norton in previous fights .
He'd hit Frazier so hard he lifted him four feet off the mat .
He 'd knocked Kenny Norton asleep .
He beat him like a rug the year earlier and Norton did n't wake up until he was in his dressing room .
As often as the movies may portray that sort of thing , the truth is in professional fighting it 's nearly unheard of .
And now Ali , at 32 , way , way past his prime as a pugilist , was facing him on the dark continent - the Congo itself , Zaire .
Never in a thousand years could anyone expect to find a more compelling match up between men .
Foreman could barely put a sentence together back then - he usually just glared at people if he did n't feel like acknowledging him .
Ali , on the other hand , had done the impossible over the past 10 years : he had gone from Most Hated Athlete in America to Most Adored HUMAN on the Face of the Earth .
And , of course , he reveled in it .
He talked about EVERYthing - tooth decay , racism , boxing , music , magic tricks ... anything that caught his fancy .
Smiling , laughing , giggling , chortling , merry - making his way through the sweltering pre-rainy season of Kinsasha .
Not a care in the world .
Of course , that was n't true , though .
Ali was worried .
Years later he acknowledged his fear in an interview with George Plimpton .
" I was afraid for my children , " he said , " I was afraid if maybe Big George broke my spinal column or something , how would I feed my children ? "
My God , it 's astonishing to think of the fear that must have enveloped him for those three months prior to the fight .
He fought " The Rumble in the Jungle " against George Foreman on October 31st at three in the morning .
He gave birth to the " rope - a - dope . "
He took back his title and knocked Big George to the canvas for ten seconds in the eighth round .
He hit him with a series of lightning quick , sniper - like lefts and rights that were almost invisible to the naked eye in their fury and quickness .
It was . . . magnificent .
Another lesson : Might is n't always right .
Face your fears .
Do your best .
If you ca n't go OVER the wall ... figure a way to go around it .
Think on the spot .
Do n't be tied to a pre-arranged plan if it is n't working .
Fear is sometimes just and only that - fear .
I met him in New York in 1989 .
Parkinson 's Syndrome had changed him irrevocably by then .
There was a hint of the old Ali smile .
A glimmer in the eyes .
I shook his hand in a diner on 37th and 3rd .
He had very big hands .
I leaned in close to him and said in his ear very quickly - there were many others trying to touch him - " You helped me grow up and be who I am today . "
He stopped what he was doing ( signing autographs and shaking hands ) for just a heartbeat , a blink , and looked full square in my eyes .
I had tears in them .
He said , " Boy , I was something , was n't I ?
" You were .
You are .
IN her thigh - highs and ruby miniskirt , Little Red Riding Hood does not appear to be en route to her grandmother ’s house .
And Goldilocks , in a snug bodice and platform heels , gives the impression she has been sleeping in everyone ’s bed .
There is a witch wearing little more than a Laker Girl uniform , a fairy who appears to shop at Victoria ’s Secret and a cowgirl with a skirt the size of a tea towel .
Anyone who has watched the evolution of women ’s Halloween costumes in the last several years will not be surprised that these images — culled from the Web sites of some of the largest Halloween costume retailers — are more strip club than storybook .
Or that these and other costumes of questionable taste will be barely covering thousands of women who consider them escapist , harmless fun on Halloween .
“ It ’s a night when even a nice girl can dress like a dominatrix and still hold her head up the next morning , ” said Linda M. Scott , the author of “ Fresh Lipstick : Redressing Fashion and Feminism ” ( Palgrave Macmillan ) and a professor of marketing at the University of Oxford in England .
The trend is so pervasive it has been written about by college students in campus newspapers , and Carlos Mencia , the comedian , jokes that Halloween should now be called Dress - Like - a - Whore Day .

Testing vs. Reviews
by Bruce Eckel
July 5 , 2006
Summary
Some studies have shown that reviews are a far cheaper and more efficient approach to error removal than testing .
These studies do n't suggest that reviews should replace testing , but that you are missing out on some big economic leverage if you do n't use reviews .

And yet , in all the years that I have offered design reviews , code reviews , and walkthroughs , only one client has ever used these services .
But in that case the president of the startup company was someone who had previously been a VP in software development and had a number of successes under his belt .
He knew from experience the value of saying " Let 's step back and look at this again , " and thus there was buy - in for the concept at the highest level .
It may simply be an issue of maturity in software development organizations .
My experience is that the seminar is the easiest package for an organization to consume , because it has a clear definition and boundaries .
It 's really a kind of consulting , but you have a pretty good idea of what you 're getting .
And " doing training " is a well - accepted concept in the corporate software development world ; indeed , some organizations have " training managers . "
Consulting is a dicier business , especially because a stigma can easily be attached to " needing a consultant . "
( And I 'm speaking here of consulting as giving advice about a project , rather than someone who does the work or is a temporary employee ) .
In some environments , if you bring in a consultant , it could be taken as meaning " you / your team ca n't do the work yourself . "
In the technical world , it 's all about what you know , so admitting that you do n't know something can be akin to exposing your throat to the alpha dog .
Ironically , I learned long ago that it was a waste of my time to smile and nod as if I understood the conversation , just to be able to pretend that I knew something .
Especially if I then turned around and reiterated my misunderstanding to another smile - and - nodder , so that eventually everyone got the wrong idea .
Much better to just suck it up and say " I do n't know what that means . "
I try to be very aggressive with myself about this , telling myself not to let anything slide and to ask the question .
This has the important secondary benefit of discovering whether the person explaining the topic really knows what they 're talking about .
My perception is that for an organization to be able to consume consulting , they must have that same attitude , but on a group scale .
Maturity is when you do n't say " uh oh , here 's something that I do n't know , and maybe other people will discover that and think that I 'm stupid . "
Instead , you have enough experience to know that you are competent and valuable , and yet " I know some things , but there is a ton of stuff I do n't know , and if I never ask the question I 'll never learn any more . "
If you are evaluating a project and you discover a risk , the immature thing to do is ignore the risk and pretend it will go away or wo n't happen .
The mature thing to do is to manage that risk .
This usually means finding everything out about it that you can , and creating a plan to apply mitigation factors if it comes up .
We are naturally drawn to the happy path .
In fact , our minds tend to filter out the difficult and unpleasant experiences , so we rapidly forget the monumental struggles and remember fondly how easily a program went together , how we waved our hands and everything magically coalesced .
So the next project comes up , we remember how easy it was to do the last one , and we schedule and do risk assessment based on that illusion .
No wonder so many projects fail .
On a number of occasions , I 've made the point that it 's more likely that your project will fail rather than succeed .
This is usually a jarring idea .
People believe that , in theory , someone else 's project has the odds stacked against it , but not this one .
This one is special .
And if you say otherwise , then you 're a negative thinker and not a team player and you are n't committing completely enough to ( insert management wonder solution of the month here ) .
The problem with that approach is that you are assuming the happy path , which is incredibly unlikely .
If you instead accept that the odds are against you -- not in a defeatist way , but to see the reality of the situation from the start -- then you can start off with the likelihood of failure staring you in the face , so you can say " what are we going to do about this ? "
This is , for example , why I say " if it 's not tested , it 's broken , " because then I 'm not surprised when something fails .
I 'm only surprised that it slipped through the tests , and that 's something I can fix .
Economics are an important reality in software projects .
You have limited resources ( which includes time ) , and your success or failure depends on how you allocate those resources .
Which brings us back to the question of " if reviews are so useful and cost - effective , why do n't software organizations do more of them ? "
This could easily be a lack of experience , just as unit testing has been in the past .
If you apply the " it works for me " correctness metric to your code , then unit testing seems to be a waste of time .
And the idea may be foreign to your current way of thinking , so you may push it away .
And no amount of discussion can change your mind , but a single experience with unit - tested code can .
You make a change , the unit tests go off , and you realize that the bug would have been buried , or it would have taken you a lot of time and pain to discover it .
That 's the point at which you say , " testing is essential , " because you know that it saves you time .
But if you are never exposed to it , you never get the chance to have that experience .
This may be the same with design and code reviews .
If they are n't very common , then people do n't get a chance to see how valuable they might be .
Another problem might be that everyone within the group feels like they understand the design or code well enough and going over it again seems boring or a waste of time .
This is why it 's useful to get someone outside the group to lead the review , either someone else in the company if it 's big enough , or a consultant ( which is why I offer the service ) ; in either case someone who might be able to offer new information or ideas to the process , and thus make it more enticing for people to participate .
How is it done in your organization ?
Do you have design and code reviews or avoid them ?
If you have done reviews , was it a clear win in everyone 's mind , or were people unconvinced that it was a good use of time ?
Talk Back !

Space Aliens : The ' Mother ' Of All Hallucinations ?
People who claim to have been abducted by space aliens seem to invariably describe a very similar picture .
Space aliens are described as having large heads , big eyes , gray skin , smooth features and small mouths .
( Mom ? )
Psychologist Frederick Malmstrom , currently a visiting scholar at the U.S. Air Force Academy , believes that these ' visions ' of space aliens are actually the image of the prototypical female face that is is hardwired into every baby human 's brain .
When Malmstrom altered a picture of a woman in a manner consistent with the characteristics of a newborn 's vision ( astigmatism and a shallow focal plane ) , the result looked very much like a big - eyed alien .
( Mother 's face as seen by newborn infant
Squint to enhance effect )
Note that the nostrils appear to be vertical slits , and the mouth is much less distinguishable , as in the alien picture shown at top .
The power of visual imagery is often confused for visual reality .
This confusion is understandable , as visual imagery frequently occupies and competes for the same regions of the visual cortex and subcortical regions as visual perception itself .
The competition between visual and mental images seems to be at its greatest during hypnagogic and dream states , precisely the awareness regions where these two processes merge .
15
Hence , it would be expected that the alien face perceived in hypnagogic dreamlike states is also produced from the same primitive facial recognition template .
Further investigation is warranted .
( Dr. Malmstrom )
( Dr. Frederick Malmstrom )
Malmstrom was asked why people see this prototypical mother face , rather than some other important figure .
He replied that the answer had to do with the fact that cases of abduction that are considered credible enough to study were those in which abductees reported that they were falling asleep , or were under hypnosis .
For those whose belief systems have been severely shaken by this revelation , consider reading Catholic Belief and Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life ; those who would like a bit of distance on this topic might consider reading Find Extraterrestrial Civilizations By Their Works .

Our editors have compiled a list of the “ Top 10 Strangest Clocks ” for your enjoyment .
Which ones are your favorites ?
10 . Cathode Ray Tube Clock
As the name implies , this interesting clock — developed by David Forbes — consists of a 3 - inch cathode - ray oscilloscope that bends the CRT beam to form bright and crisp numbers .
The PC board holds a switching power supply , a crystal - controlled microcontroller for generating the timing and scanning the digits , and an analog circle generator system to draw the digits .
It makes circles directly from sine and cosine waves .
That ’s why the curves look so clean .
[ Source ]
9 . The Water Powered Clock
At first glance this clock looks no different from any other , but upon closer inspection you ’ll notice there is n’t a battery slot .
That ’s because it ’s water ( or any other electrolytic fluid like beer ) powered .
The clock comes to life – displaying the time and date – after the liquid reservoirs located in the back are filled .
An internal converter extracts electrons from any liquid and acts as a power generating fuel cell for the clock .
We ’ve had ours running for weeks so far and the water levels have barely descended and we have n’t had to refill it at all .

8. Spy Camcorder Clock
This gadget combines a motion - activated video camcorder with a fully functional LCD clock .
It comes with 64MB of built - in memory — good for 12 minutes of video ( no audio ) — and can be further expanded via SD / MMC cards .
To play the recorded video , just use the included USB cable and connect it to your computer for easy viewing .

7. Lexon ’s On - Off Alarm Clock
Available in a wide variety of different colors , the Lexon On - Off alarm clock is more than just a cool looking gadget — featuring a tilting mechanism that can be used to set the alarm or for turning it off .
It measures a compact 5.3 ″ x 3.1 ″ x 1.4 ″ .
While we ’re sure this will result in some exciting and violent early morning clock tilting action , we ’re not so sure how snooze functionality factors in

6. Rolling Ball Lego Clock
Based on the original rolling ball clock by Idle Tyme Corporation , this Lego version is a bit more amusing to watch — complete with an RCX 1.0 and external supply to obtain longtime stability .
Four video clips after the jump .
The clock works by using steel balls to indicate the exact time .
The bottom rail represents the hours .
The middle and upper rails are used to represent the minutes .
An electric motor scoops up a ball every minute .
Every five minutes , the top rail will dump and deposit a ball on the second rail .
Every hour , the upper and middle rails dump and one ball is transferred to the bottom rail to increment the hours .
5. AXbo Alarm Clock
For an alarm clock that monitors your sleep patterns and wakes you at the best possible time , look no furthur than a Xbo ’s Sleep Phase Alarm Clock .
With support for up to two people , the Sleep Phase includes a sweatband with built - in sensor that wirelessly transmits your sleep pattern info to the clock .
Ensuring that you do n’t oversleep , the alarm will sound within a 30 minute window before your desired wake time .

4. Functional Hard Drive Clock
Alan Parekh converted an old hard drive into a fully functional clock .
It uses twelve high power LEDs to display the clock hands and a custom programmed PIC16F628 microcontroller for clock operation .
Unfortunately , this creation is n’t very practical as older hard drives are quite noisy .
Slot cut into upper drive platter and white tape on center drive platter provides a slot that when illuminated by the LED ’s will represent a clock hand .
Minute hand is represented by blue light , hour hand is represented by red light and the second hand is represented by purple ( both blue and red on at the same time ) .
Infrared Beam sensor and drilled index hole in lower drive platter .
Three micro switches to set hours , minutes and seconds .

3. Pong Clock
Now you do n’t even need to play Pong to enjoy it , presenting the Pong clock .
The score shown on the left and right sides correspond to the time of day .
A continuous random game of Pong is played by the clock every 24 hours .

2. Digital Clock T - Shirt
Powered by 4 x AAA batteries , this “ Digital Clock T - Shirt ” utilizes an electro - luminescent panel in front to display the time .
The batteries — hidden inside a compartment — will last between 12 – 36 hours depending on the flashing mode selected .
And if the static display does n’t fit your style you can select up to 8 different flashing patterns or even switch it to a stopwatch mode .

Again and again , movie theater owners have chosen to point the finger at non-factors like piracy and shrinking DVD release windows as the biggest " threats " to their businesses , rather than realizing their biggest problem is their own failure to improve the movie - going experience .
The real issue is one of value : with the ever - increasing cost of a movie ticket , going to the theater becomes less and less worthwhile as long as the experience does n't improve .
It 's hardly surprising , then , to find that online ticket - selling services that tack on usage fees -- without adding much customer value in most cases -- are n't very popular .
These sites tend to charge a dollar or so per ticket for booking , and while that might be worthwhile to moviegoers wanting to see the latest blockbuster on the Friday night of its release , it really is n't to most customers , who are content to walk up to the box - office window and buy a ticket with a pretty minimal , if any , wait .
It 's a simple equation -- for people wanting to see a movie that might sell out , the ability to buy a ticket in advance without going to the theater is worth the extra dollar .
But for all the people seeing an older or unpopular movie that 's not likely to sell out , or are n't going at a peak time , there 's no real added value for that dollar .
So , after only several years , the ticket sites are realizing they 've got to tinker with their proposition to draw in more customers , with the biggest potential change being variable usage fees that would charge people less for tickets to unpopular movies or showings at unpopular times .
Perhaps that 's a start , but it 's unclear why these sites should charge usage fees at all , particularly at a time when more and more industries are pushing customers to use automated systems as a way to cut costs , and actually charge them for transactions made face - to - face with a human employee .
In any case , the situation is indicative of what seems to be the movie theater industry 's current strategy : get customers to pay more , while offering no more value in return .
Deploying Seaside 17 November , 2006
I just saw a very nice thread on the Seaside mailing list about deploying a seaside application .
I thought I ’d summarize the suggestions for this article .
First you should consider using a newer image .
If you have to use an older image then make sure you load the following :
List from Philippe Marschall :
The patches we apply against 3.8 , they are all in 3.9 .
I do n’t know what of this is in 3.8.1 .

Dictionary fix ( again in 3.9 )
From Michael Reuger :
For testing and debugging purposes you may want to run the image headed against a VNC server .
We do this for most of the stuff running on our server .
VNC listening on localhost only , then use a ssh tunnel to connect if needed .
When building a deployment image consider these suggestions from Philippe :
– Close Morphs .
Weird things can happen if you leave them up open too long .
– Especially close the Transcript .
– Flush the Monticello Cache
– Build a special image for deployment without , RB , Shout , eCompletion , …
Yanni Chiu shared experiences and received some help with optimization :
I start the image with :
squeak - vm display=none , sound=none foo.image
where the image has been saved with the VNC server already running .
I mostly see the CPU usage at 49 % , and sometimes at 99 % .
When things are stable , the usage is 8 % .
Any ideas on how to get the image into a stable usage mode ?
Adrian Lienhard responded :
in the beta version of 3.9 there was the higher Performance preference turned on ( -> Preferences higher Performance ) which on one of our old test server made the image idle at around 30 % IIRC !
Ultimately Yanni found some solutions :
I tried the hint from Lukas on the other half of this thread on the squeak - dev list – close windows and remove flaps .
So , I closed the Transcript in my current project , opened a new Morphic project , entered it , then turned off the flaps .
I did the above via VNC , then I did a save image .
Now , the response is snappy , and the squeak process does n’t even show up on the “ top ” list ( in fact , sshd is at the top with 0.3 % ) .
Using “ top -d 0.25 ” to refresh every 1 / 4 second , I see squeak show up at 4 % , with spikes up to the 90’s when processing a request .
So in summary for deploying seaside consider a newer image , run headless or headed with VNC , check your optimization settings , close morphs especially Transcript and Flaps , check and clean your memory and caches , then save without development tools .
Happy Coding !
“ Everyone in southern Lebanon is a terrorist and is connected to Hezbollah , ” roared Israeli Justice Minister Haim Ramon on July 27 .
“ Every village from which a Katyusha is fired must be destroyed , ” bellowed an Israeli general in a quote bannered by the nation ’s largest newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth .
The Israeli paper then summarized what the justice minister and general were saying : “ In other words , a village from which rockets are fired at Israel will simply be destroyed by fire . ”
That was Thursday .
Sunday , in Qana , 57 of Haim Ramon ’s “ terrorists , ” 37 of them children , were massacred with precision - guided bombs .
Apparently , Katyushas had been fired from Qana , near the destroyed building .
“ One who goes to sleep with rockets should n’t be surprised if he does n’t wake up in the morning , ” said Israel ’s ambassador to the United Nations , Dan Gillerman .
Today , we hear unctuous statements about how Israel takes pains to avoid civilian casualties , drops leaflets to warn civilians to flee target areas , and conforms to all the rules of civilized warfare .
But Israel ’s words and deeds contradict her propaganda .
As the war began , Ehud Olmert accused Lebanon , which had condemned Hezbollah for the killing and capture of the Israeli soldiers , of an “ act of war . ”
Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz publicly threatened “ to turn back the clock in Lebanon by 20 years . ”
Gillerman , at a pro-Israel rally in New York , thundered , “ [ T ] o those countries who claim that we are using disproportionate force , I have only this to say :
You ’re damn right we are . ”
“ His comments drew wild applause , ” said the Jerusalem Post .
Though Israel is dissembling now , Gillerman spoke the truth then .
No sooner had Hezbollah taken the two Israeli soldiers hostage than Israel unleashed an air war  on Lebanon .
The Beirut airport was bombed , its fuel storage tanks set ablaze .
The coast was blockaded .
Power plants , gas stations , lighthouses , bridges , roads , trucks , and buses were all hit with air strikes .
Within 48 hours , it was apparent Israel was exploiting Hezbollah ’s attack to execute a preconceived military plan to destroy Lebanon  i.e. , the collective punishment of a people and nation for the crimes of a renegade militia they could not control .
It was the moral equivalent of a municipal police going berserk , shooting , killing , and ravaging an African - American community , because Black Panthers had ambushed and killed cops .
If Israel is not in violation of the principle of proportionality , by which Christians are to judge the conduct of a just war , what can that term mean ?
There are 600 civilian dead in Lebanon , 19 in Israel , a ratio of 30 - 1 , though Hezbollah is firing unguided rockets , while Israel is using precision - guided munitions .
Thousands of Lebanese civilians are injured .
Perhaps 800,000 are homeless .
Yet , whatever one thinks of the morality of what Israel is doing , the stupidity is paralyzing .
Instead of maintaining the moral and political high ground it had  when even Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Jordan were condemning Hezbollah , and privately hoping Israel would inflict a humiliating defeat on Nasrallah  Israel launched an air war on an innocent people .
Now , 87 percent of Lebanese back Hezbollah , and the entire Arab and Islamic world , Shia and Sunni alike , is rallying behind Nasrallah .
And how does one defend the behavior of the United States ?
When Gillerman was exulting in the disproportionality of Israel ’s attack on Lebanon , U.S. Sen .
Hillary Clinton was smiling smugly beside him .
When the UN Security Council tabled a resolution condemning Hezbollah ’s igniting of the war and Katyusha attacks , but also the excesses of Israel ’s reprisals , U.S. Ambassador John Bolton vetoed it .
When a few congressmen sought to moderate a pro-Israeli resolution by adding words urging “ all sides to protect innocent life and infrastructure , ” GOP leader John Boehner ordered the words taken down .
Why ?
Because , says Zbigniew Brzezinski , AIPAC , the Israeli lobby , had prepared the resolution and wanted it passed the way they wrote it .
Our Knesset complied .
It sailed through the House 410 - 8 .
For two weeks , Bush seemed unable to find a word of criticism for what our friends in Israel were doing to our friends in Lebanon .
He publicly sent more bombs to Israel .
He and Condi emphasized that America did not want a cease - fire  yet .
And because America provides Israel with the bombs it uses on Lebanon , and we refused to restrain the Israelis , and we opposed every effort for a cease - fire before Sunday , America shares full moral and political responsibility for the massacre at Qana .
Rubbing our noses in our own cravenness , “ Bibi ” Netanyahu took time out , a week ago , from his daily appearances on American television , denouncing terrorism , to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the terror attack on the King David Hotel by Menachem Begin ’s Irgun , an attack that killed 92 people , among them British nurses .
This was not a terrorist act , Bibi explained , because Irgun telephoned a 15 - minute warning to the hotel before the bombs went off .
Right .
And those children in that basement in Qana should not have ignored the Israeli leaflets warning them to clear out of southern Lebanon .
Our Israeli friends appear to be playing us for fools .

Fascinating interview With Richard Arvedlund , Founder , Cypress Capital Management , who is not particularly optimistic on the economy going forward :
The preconditions would be the following :
Whenever housing starts and permits drop by the rates of decline that have been exhibited -- 10 % to 20 % -- it has always preceded a recession .
What is remarkably different in housing than just about any other sector of the economy is that whenever housing cycles turn down , and that 's happened twice in the last 30 years , once in the late ' Seventies and once in the late ' Eighties , the downturn tends to last much longer than people dream .
The average cycle is three to four years .
Arvedlund :
Well , until midyear the economy was running much stronger than I had thought it would .
However , a GDP [ growth domestic product ] slowdown has clearly begun .
The GDP growth rate dropped to 1.6 % in the third quarter from 2.6 % in the prior quarter and 5.6 % in the first quarter .
We have not seen GDP growth below 2 % for four or five years .
We now have preconditions in place for a recession .
Barron's :
It took a year , but the calls you made when we last spoke are looking pretty good now .
WE CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON RICHARD ARVEDLUND to take a different tack .
Independent and bold calls on the economy come easy to this longtime money manager , who 's seen it all in his 30 - plus - year career .
But his balanced investment approach , with a focus on high - yielding , big - cap stocks combined with some bets on bonds , helps his clients preserve their capital as much as build it .
The founder of Wilmington , Del. - based Cypress Capital Management , which has $ 450 million in assets and is now a unit of WSFS Financial , is at his best in troubled times .
Trouble , the way he sees it , is straight ahead .

From our perspective , this one began in late 2005 , when housing starts and sales and permits peaked , and should last at least through all of 2008 .
The rate of price appreciation in this housing boom has been the highest we have seen .
We had a string of five years where the compound growth in housing prices approached 15 % a year .
Whereas housing kept the economic recovery going much , much longer and stronger than expected , housing now will drag it down for a much longer period than people think .
The other area that will hurt the economy is that all the major domestic auto makers have announced double - digit production declines for the quarter and into early 2007 .
This has happened before but , again , only preceding recessions or very dramatic slowdowns .
The third precondition for a recession is a flat to inverted yield curve .
Flat to inverted yield curves only occur before recessions , not slowdowns .
All rates from three months to two years are above long - term rates .
The yield on short - term paper is over 5 % and the yield of the long bond is 4.75 % .
Where we had been looking for a slowdown , we now think there 's a 40 % to 50 % probability of a recession .
Next year could be a very difficult time in the U.S. economy .
You have been concerned , too , about how the low - end consumer was holding up .
Wal - Mart 's numbers suggest they are not holding up well .
Wal - Mart [ ticker : WMT ] is my favorite economist .
It is huge , reflects the low - to middle - income sector of the economy and it gives us monthly statistics .
What has happened is a dramatic reduction in spending by low - end consumers .
It is starting to impact not only Wal - Mart 's outlook but , we presume , quite a few other retailers .
Wal - Mart 's reaction has been to become even more competitive , so I would suspect the retail - sales environment will be the next sector of the economy that we will start to hear less exciting news from .
How does the election play into your view ?
We 've had bull and bear markets with both Republicans and Democrats alike , so you can't make a case that one party in power is good and one party in power is bad .
What we are dealing with is possible change , and the most significant change would be if our tax policy were to be reversed by the Democrats .
A major reason this stock - market cycle has done so well was because of the passage of lower capital - gains and lower dividend taxes , which took place in May 2003 .
The stock market bottomed in early 2003 .
Anything that would negatively influence the tax treatment on capital gains or dividends would be a serious negative now .
The tax treatment is in place until 2010 , but even any verbiage about changing it would be negative .
Secondly , the Democrats plan to immediately raise the minimum wage by a meaningful percentage .
That will raise unit labor costs throughout the economy , not just for the low - level workers but everybody else .
It will impact profit margins .
It will definitely have an impact on employment .
It will definitely hurt job creation .
If you raise the price of labor by a high percentage , business will figure out a way to use less of it .
The Democrats have also been making noises about a windfall tax on the oil companies .
That would be a major negative .
Any windfall tax on anything would be a major negative .
The last time that was implemented was by President Carter .
It resulted in a serious blow to the oil industry , and it resulted in less exploration .
Are you worried at all about inflation ?
No .
Inflation will peak by the end of this year or early 2007 , and the reason for that will be much lower economic activity and a significant drop in the price of oil .
There 'll be a meaningful contraction in the housing industries , other commodities will be declining in price , and then the job market will soften .
The time to worry about inflation is over .
Inflation numbers always lag both ways .
The inflation numbers tend to peak after the economy has seen peak rates of growth , and the peak rates of growth were early - to - mid - 2006 at 4 % or 5 % year - over - year .
The worry about inflation is overstated , and for the next 18 months we will see good news on the inflation front , not bad .
I would remind you that inflation rates in just about every other part of the developed world are extremely low .
Inflation always comes down when the GDP decelerates or you have a recession .
Will commodities peak if China and India continue their strong growth ?
I do n't buy that noise at all .
We are the major user of commodities , and by my standards you have two areas of the world where growth rates are going to really take a beating : here and Europe .
China and India might keep the declines in some perspective but not prevent them .
Look at oil .
We 've seen a peak in the 80s or so .
Oil is now in the 60s .
Even with China and India using a lot of oil , we think the price of oil could drop to a range of $ 45 to $ 50 by this time next year .
We 've witnessed forecasts as high as $ 100 a barrel or more .
Here we 've had a drop of about $ 20 a barrel , and everybody I read or talk to tells me it has nothing to do with economics 101 .
My argument is that somewhere in the world the demand for oil is moderating , and I would pick this country for starters .
You do n't get a drop in oil from $ 80 to $ 60 without demand causing it .
This is exactly what happened in the last economic cycle .
In 1998 the price of oil bottomed at $ 10 , rose close to $ 40 by 2000 and then dropped to $ 20 by 2002 .
That drop in the last cycle correlated with the peak in the economy , and the same thing is going to occur here .
Is this good news for the fixed - income market , which you have been bullish on for the last few years ?
Yes .
The fixed - income market in 2005 was reasonably decent ; there was n't much volatility .
Volatility in the fixed - income markets this year was enormous and bond yields rose for the first six months on the strength of the economy , which really undermined our bond positions .
Did you stick with them though ?
We stuck with them .
We feel the bond market peaked in yield in May or June of this year and that was totally coincident with the peak of GDP growth .
It was coincident with the Federal Reserve finishing their rate hikes .
As far as the outlook , we think the Federal Reserve has finished raising short - term rates .
Historically , they normally go on hold for six to nine months .
In almost every cycle they 've done that -- including the last one , I might add .
This implies Mr. [ Ben ]
Bernanke [ Fed chairman ] will keep rates flat here until the first or second quarter of ' 07 , and by then he will see that the GDP has slowed down or dropped .
Once he starts cutting rates , I see a 200 - basis - point [ two percentage point ] drop from early ' 07 to early ' 08 .
This should bring the long bond yield to 4 % or 4.25 % by this time next year .
Bond markets always do well in recessions or slowdowns .
I have never seen a slowdown or a recession where bond yields go up .
The consensus for GDP growth is anywhere from 2 % to 4 % over the next two years .
Our argument is that 2 % will be the high end next year , and you should consider the odds that some quarters will be zero .
It would n't surprise me if the five - year Treasury , which is near 5 % today , dropped to 3 % in the next 18 months .
Do we have to worry then about the dollar ?
Yes .
The dollar is about to resume a fairly extended decline .
And under that scenario , it obviously raises the attraction of foreign investments .
It also significantly raises the attractiveness of precious metals .
We remain very , very positive on gold and the precious metals , because in an economic slowdown , demand for the dollar will decline .
Have you stuck with your gold and silver positions ?
We 've stayed the course .
It has been one of the most volatile situations I have ever been involved with .
When I chatted with you last year , gold was about $ 475 or $ 500 , then had a magnificent rally to $ 700 - plus in May , and then began a magnificent correction -- I 'm being Christian -- which drubbed the gold stocks .
Now , gold has rebounded above $ 600 , and I would look for a very significant move in gold the next two years .
I would hazard a guess that the gold market will appreciate by $ 200 to $ 300 an ounce over that time frame , and it will be driven by another decline in the dollar .
We would recommend people would have a hedge position in precious metals using either the bullion directly or gold - mining stocks .
We 're using a closed - end fund called Central Fund of Canada [ CEF ] , which owns the physical metals , one half silver and one half gold , in bullion form .
It trades totally in line with the price of the two metals and rarely is at a premium or a discount .
The two stock candidates we would recommend are Newmont Mining and also Barrick Gold .
We are putting 3 % to 5 % of client assets in precious metals .
Moving on to the stock market .
How will it hold up under this scenario ?
The stock market is very , very related to GDP growth , and it has done extremely well over the last four years since the economy rebounded .
We have achieved record levels of profit margins and we do n't think that 's sustainable .
All of our valuation metrics imply that the P/E of the stock market today at 16 or 17 times is more than adequate .
We would argue that S&P earnings will flatten or decline in the next 18 months .
So the stock market looks fully valued .
Stay away from economically sensitive sectors , including anything to do with commodities such as energy , steel , copper , aluminum and you name it .
Avoid industrial companies , and emphasize sectors that would benefit from declining interest rates .
Which would be ?
I would highlight the insurance sector .
We find this group dramatically underfollowed .
These are stocks that have done little if anything for years .
The major asset of any insurance company is a bond portfolio .
Last time we mentioned St. Paul Travelers [ STA ] ; we 've hung onto it and would still purchase it here .
We also like a smaller company , Delphi Financial [ DFG ] , but the whole group looks attractive to us .
From Katrina to litigation to asbestos , the group has had its problems .
They raised rates dramatically from late 2005 through now , and I would say that game is over .
But the losses of yesteryear are going away and their capital reserves have improved , and from this point forward pricing will probably be flat .
This is not a high - growth industry , but the P / Es on these stocks are very low , 10 - 12 .
There is no reason why this industry should sell at such a dramatic discount .
That would be our favorite interest - sensitive group .
The second interest - sensitive group would be the telephone area .
What do you like there ?
Verizon Communications [ VC ] , because of its dividend yield and also because they will be able to refinance their debt at more attractive rates .
We also like Windstream [ WIN ] , a spin - out and subsidiary of the telephone company Alltel .
They operate in the country 's rural areas where people do not have high wireless concentration , and they are converting their client base slowly into wireless and broadband .
In the meantime , it generates enormous cash flow and pays out a high proportion of their earnings in dividends .
Windstream has a dividend yield of 7 % .
How about another pick ?
The supermarket Supervalu [ SVU ] .
We were attracted by their purchase of Albertson's .
We 're very familiar with management and believe they can execute and make the merger work .
It 's a defensive name in a sector where unit growth will continue fairly steady and wo n't be impacted by economic trends .
What else ?
We think the anti-oil outlook we 've had the past year is a valuable theme .
While oil prices stayed much higher for much longer than I expected , the price has clearly broken trend , and the most obvious beneficiary would be the airline sector .
Even in light of your economic outlook ?
Well , the airline industry has consolidated .
Some of them have crawled out of bankruptcy , and we think they are running their companies in a much more efficient manner .
Our favorite candidate is JetBlue Airways .
JetBlue has the most sensitivity to a decline in oil prices and rates .
What about the labor costs there ?
Labor costs are OK and are going up in line with their growth .
But the bogeyman for them was that they had no hedges on oil , and it scorched them .
They are continuing to gain market share .
They are watching costs .
They have a very leveraged balance sheet , and so any reduction in interest rates would really help them .
Any other names come to mind ?
Dow Chemical [ DOW ] , which is also on the list of unloved companies .
It sports a 4 % dividend yield , and they raised the dividend for the first time in many years this year .
They are repurchasing shares , and they sell at a fairly low multiple .
They will benefit if , as we expect , raw - material costs come down .
What about your old favorites , the real - estate investment trusts and utilities ?
We are paring back because the yields on REITs have really dropped as the stocks have done well .
All our utilities are near highs .
We can't make a case for further purchase here .
We are running into a pretty fully valued stock market .
There are isolated stocks but very few sectors that look attractive .
How does this compare with other periods ?
To us , year end 2006 has a remarkable similarity to year end 2000 .
In 2000 , there was a double peak in most equity indices and new highs in small - caps .
There were peak rates of GDP in mid-2000 and this year .
Oil prices peaked in late 2000 just as they have been peaking here .
And there was a flat - to - inverted yield curve .
It led to the making of a very difficult economic environment in 2001 and ' 02 .
The only area that stood out from that point forward was the bond market .
From an asset - class perspective , fixed - income is our best bet .
The focus is on longer bonds .
The 10 - year Treasury yield could drop from 4.75 % to 4%-4.25 % by this time next year , for a return of 8 % to 10 % .
Thanks ,
Dick .
When folks think of Digg , they 're often misled into believing that the content seen on the homepage is representative of what a wide base of Internet users think is news - worthy and important .
The numbers tell a different story - that of all stories that make it to the front page of Digg , more than 20 % come from a select group of 20 users .
Digg is n't shy about hiding this fact , their top users page plainly displays the statistics :
Digg 's Top Users Page
These Top 20 have contributed a total of 5257 stories that have reached the frontpage out of a total of 25,260 stories to ever reach that page - 20.81 % to be exact .
Many of these top users have , as Digg terms it , a popular ratio of 30 % and higher , meaning that almost 1 out of every 3 stories they submit will reach the homepage .
Several users ( specifically DarkHack & OsterMayer ) have popular ratios of over 60 % .
A logical extension shows that the top 100 Digg Users have contributed 14,249 stories to the homepage , or 56.41 % .
At Digg , a very select group of users is dominating the popular homepage content .
Far from being a mass of opinion , Digg is instead showing , primarily , the content opinions of just a few , select folks .
There 's certainly nothing wrong with this - it's not a secret or a problem and it is n't hurting Digg 's popularity , reputation or importance .
But , it is something that many folks who use the site do n't realize and many marketers or folks attempting to use it to promote their content should be aware of .
Like the college frathouse , it pays to know the right people at Digg .
UPDATE : A few good addendums from the comments and some folks in our office that should be included :
I first discovered the term “ consensual hallucination ” when reading William Gibson ’s seminal cyberpunk novel “ Neuromancer ” .
He used the term to describe his concept of cyberspace – a place that did n’t actually exist but it was a representation of a massive computer network that people could conceptualise well enough to deal with .
For ease of understanding , everyone treated an abstract concept as a physical reality – they consented to believe in the hallucination because it was easier to understand that way .
Life is full of consensual hallucinations .
If you live in a democracy , you tend to believe you have a say in what happens even though the whole political system is completely under the control of vested interests .
Voting is a sideshow but we tend to indulge in the consensual hallucination that it means something because life is easier to bear that way .
In fact , pretty much any political or religious belief system is a consensual hallucination .
Which is not to say that they are all by definition untrue – simply that they are abstract systems that people tends to treat as concrete reality despite the complete lack of empirical evidence to support this consensual hallucination .
When you work in IT , you deal with the consensual hallucination of Project Management .
There is an almost universal belief that it is possible to predict ahead of time how long a project will take , how much it will cost and what will happen along the way .
In the broadest sense , this is possible .
If you have enough experience you can come up with ballpark figures ; last time we did something similar it took this long and cost this much .
But some people believe Project Management should tell you these things down to the day and the dollar .
A project plan should tell you every task that needs to be completed .
A project plan should be flawless and leave nothing to chance .
And a project plan should be completed before ANY work is done on the project .
Despite the fact this is clearly insanity , it is a terrifyingly common mindset in management ranks .
Project planning and goals are obviously important at some level ( otherwise how the hell would you know what you are doing ? ) but how did we move from “ let ’s have a clearly defined set of project goals and a strategy for how we ’ll get there , ” to “ this is 100 % accurate , carved in stone and will never change ” ?
I think there are a number of reasons the myth of Project Management has been elevated to the level of holy scripture :
A whole industry of consultants who base their existence on the lie that they can provide definitive solutions to Project Management
Several rainforests worth of books purporting to offer the definitive methodology for flawless Project Management
Nobody likes to look stupid .
If you ’re a professional and someone puts you on the spot to answer “ how long will this take ? ” you like to have an answer
When you do work that is measurable in retrospect ( “ we wrote this many lines of code and it took this long ” ) it ’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking you should be able to project forward accurately ( “ it should be this many lines of code which should take us this long to do . ” )
Very few businesses are keen to hand over an open chequebook – when you buy stationery , you know what you ’re getting and how much it will cost .
Why is it so hard to get the same thing with software ?
So how do we escape the consensual hallucination that there is a way to do Project Management that is absolutely foolproof and provides definitive answers ?
Well , the first step is to kill all the consultants .
Okay , maybe that ’s a bit harsh .
Let ’s limit ourselves to killing the consultants who act as though they have some mystical powers that enable them to succeed where all other have failed .
Maybe even that ’s going a little bit too far .
Surely there ’s a solution that does n’t involve the risk of incurring jail time ?
There is no silver bullet ( although there ’s quite a good essay entitled “ No Silver Bullet “ ) that will solve this issue but there are things that can be done to improve the situation .
How about we all sit down to a big three - course serving of reality together ?
If you ’re on the development side , one of the best things you can do is to have the courage to say “ I do n’t know , ” when you do n’t , in fact , know the answer to a question .
Sure , the geek mystique might take a bit of a hit when you admit you ’re not infallible but it ’s worth it in the long term .
If you ’re on the business side it means LISTENING when your IT people tell you that a definitive answer is n’t possible .
The obsession some people have with getting an answer , any answer , even when they know the answer is totally inaccurate is nothing short of stupidity .
Just do n’t do it .
It ’s perfectly reasonable ( and I would even suggest that it ’s necessary ) to come up with some sort of estimate in a project plan .
So long as everyone agrees that ’s what it is : an estimate .
And , more importantly , the estimate will need to be revisited at key milestones to see if anything has been uncovered that will affect previous estimates .
For this to work , everyone has to be open and everyone has to listen and be responsive .
Or we can keep flailing about saying it has to be this way because the sacred Project Plan says it ’s this way .
To illustrate the ups and downs of Project Management , in another post I ’ll be documenting the project I ’m finishing up on right now .
I ’ll be using my current project as an example because it ’s one of the best managed projects I ’ve ever worked on ( I ’m not the Project Manager so do n’t worry – I ’m not big - noting myself ) .
It ’s a good illustration because it ’s quite a big project and most of the Project Management was done really well but there were still some problems .
And at the end of the day , it ’s the way everyone involved handles the unexpected that drives whether a project will succeed or fail .
Die finnische EU - Ratspräsidentschaft hat ein Kompromisspapier für die umstrittene Novelle der EU - Fernsehrichtlinie ausgearbeitet , das den Mitgliedsstaaten größtenteils die letzte Entscheidung über die Freigabe von Produktplatzierungen lässt .
Nutzergenerierte audiovisuelle Inhalte , wie sie etwa über Videoblogs oder europäische YouTube - Klone verbreitet werden , sollen zudem aus dem strengen Auflagengeflecht für TV - Programme herausgehalten werden .
So unterscheidet der heise online vorliegende
Text in einem Erwägungsgrund zwischen " Massenmedien " , die einen " klaren Einfluss auf einen signifikanten Teil der allgemeinen Öffentlichkeit haben könnten " , und " hauptsächlich nicht - ökonomischen " Angeboten , " die nicht im Wettbewerb mit Fernsehübertragungen stehen " .
Unter letztere sollen private Webseiten und Dienste fallen , die nutzergenerierte Inhalte bereitstellen oder verteilen " zum Zweck des Austausch innerhalb von Interessensgemeinschaften " .
Den heftigen Streit zwischen mehreren EU - Ländern über die Legalisierung von Product Placement hoffen die Finnen mit einer zweistufigen Regelung zu entschärfen .
Im Gegensatz zum ursprünglichen Entwurf der EU - Kommission soll die gezielte Platzierung von Produkten in Filmbeiträgen zunächst verboten werden .
Den Mitgliedsstaaten soll aber gleichzeitig die Möglichkeit gegeben werden , Product Placement in Filmen , TV - Serien , Sportübertragungen und " leichten Unterhaltungsprogrammen " freizugeben .
Auch die " Bereitstellung " von Produkten , wie sie heute auch hierzulande schon etwa beim ZDF - Traumschiff akzeptiert wird , fällt unter diese Klausel .
Kinderprogramme sollen generell nicht mit mehr oder weniger deutlich ausgewiesener Schleichwerbung durchsetzt werden .
Zudem dürfen laut dem Vorschlag zusätzlich etwa zu Zigaretten auch verschreibungspflichtige Arzneimittel oder medizinische Behandlungen in Sendungen nicht in den Vordergrund gerückt werden .
Werbeblöcke beliebiger Länge sollen die Sender jede halbe Stunde einmal einschieben können .
Bei Kinderprogrammen soll dies nur gestattet sein , wenn die Sendungen tatsächlich länger als 30 Minuten dauern .
Beim Jugendschutz will das Kompromisspapier auch den prinzipiell weniger scharf regulierten " On- demand " - Diensten vorschreiben , die Entwicklung von Kindern möglicherweise beeinträchtigende Inhalte nur abgesichert mit Schutzmaßmechanismen zu verbreiten .
PIN - Codes sollen etwa sicherstellen , dass für Jugendliche nicht freigegebene Sendungen diese auch tatsächlich nicht erreichen .
Nur noch abgeschwächt findet sich die Empfehlung der Kommission für die besonders von Deutschland vorangetriebene " Co- Regulierung " von Mediendiensten im Vorstoß der Ratspräsidentschaft wieder .
So werden ihr Selbstregulierungsbemühungen der Wirtschaft als gleichberechtigt gegenübergestellt .
Zudem soll klargestellt werden , dass es keine Verpflichtung zur Einführung solcher Kontrollsysteme gibt und bestehende Initiativen nicht in Frage gestellt werden sollen .
Generell ist vorgesehen , dass für Anbieter das so genannte Herkunftslandprinzip gilt , sie also im Großen und Ganzen das Recht ihres Heimatstaates zu beachten haben .
Mehrere Verbände fürchten daher eine mögliche Unterwanderung der besonders strengen deutschen Regeln zum Schutz von Jugendlichen oder der Menschenwürde .
Die Kultusminister der EU werden die Vorlage der Finnen am Montag bei ihrem Treffen in Brüssel debattieren .
Der Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien im Bundeskanzleramt , Bernd Neumann , sieht aber noch wenig Chancen , dass es bereits zu einer Einigung auf einen gemeinsamen Standpunkt kommt .
Der CDU - Politiker hatte am Dienstag nach einem Besuch des luxemburgischen Ministers für Kommunikation , Jean Louis Schiltz , betont , dass " der derzeitige Verhandlungsstand für beide Länder noch nicht befriedigend ist " .
Korrekturbedarf bestehe hauptsächlich bei den vorgeschlagenen Regelungen zu den Werbevorschriften und insbesondere aus deutscher Sicht beim Thema Product Placement .
Gemeinsam unterstützen Luxemburg und Deutschland eine weitere Liberalisierung quantitativer Werbebeschränkungen .
" Hier sollten wir insbesondere den privaten Sendern entgegenkommen und damit den Erhalt des Free­TV ein Stück weit sichern " , meint Neumann .
Das heiße nicht , dass es mehr Spots im Fernsehen geben müsse .
Vielmehr sollte es den Anbietern freigestellt werden , wie sie ihr Werbeaufkommen verteilen und in welchen Momenten sie Spots schalten .
Der Kulturstaatsminister bekräftigte zudem die Position der Bundesregierung , sich in den Beratungen zur Richtlinie für die prinzipielle Beibehaltung der Trennung von Werbung und Programm einzusetzen .
Diese Linie werde auch von den Bundesländern geteilt , die sich allerdings jüngst prinzipiell kompromissbereit gaben .
Beim Ratstreffen Anfang nächster Woche dürften so die unterschiedlichen Haltungen aufeinanderprallen .
Vor allem Großbritannien macht sich in der EU für eine Freigabe von Product Placement nach US - Vorbild stark .
Kommissionsbeamte warnen demnach vor einer " absurden Situation " .
Sollte der gegenwärtige Ratsvorschlag verabschiedet werden , dürften in Sendern europäischer Länder ohne ausdrückliche Erlaubnis von Produktplatzierungen etwa zunächst keine " James Bond " - Filme mehr gezeigt werden : Der britische Geheimagent hat in mindestens drei Filmen einen BMW gesteuert .
Im Streifen " Die Another Day " brachten insgesamt 20 Firmen ihre Produkte unter und bezahlten dafür 70 Millionen US - Dollar .
Problematisch dürften die vorgeschlagenen Regelungen für internationale Produzenten werden , die ihre Formate dann an unterschiedliche Werberegeln anpassen und mehrere Versionen anbieten müssten .
Der federführende Kulturausschuss des EU - Parlaments , der sich ebenfalls am Montagabend mit der Fernsehrichtlinie befasst und seine Empfehlung für die Plenardebatte im Dezember verabschieden will , liebäugelt mit einer Liberalisierung der Regelungen für Product Placement .
Einer Freigabe der Werbezeiten stand er im Vorfeld der Abstimmung genauso skeptisch gegenüber wie einer Regulierung nutzergenerierter Inhalte nach Rundfunkmaßgaben .

UPDATE : St. John 's Hospital still has not called back , but we may have figured out what is going on here .
It seems as if the nurses entered the license number of the doctors who delivered the children .
Doctors are registered with the Medical Board , not the Nursing Board .
Reps from two other hospitals -- UCLA and St. Joseph's -- told TMZ the box for " License Number " should have the nurse 's license , not the doctor's .
A rep from L.A. County Vital Records , the agency where birth certificates are filed , confirmed to TMZ that the " License Number " should be the nurse 's , not the doctor's .
The same nurse who signed the birth certificate for Tom Cruise 's daughter Suri also signed the birth certificate for Brooke Shields ' daughter Grier , but there 's an interesting discrepancy .
Both babies were born on April 18 at St. John 's Hospital in Santa Monica .
Anne Heffernan is the registered nurse who signed both birth certificates .
As TMZ reported Monday , Heffernan , who never saw Suri , signed her birth certificate .
A hospital rep says Heffernan is authorized to sign when a doctor is not available .
On the Suri Cruise certificate , Heffernan 's license number is G48079 .
On the Grier Henchy certificate , Heffernan 's license number is different -- G068399 .
TMZ checked with the California Board of Registered Nursing and we were told Heffernan 's license number did n't match either of the birth certificates .
A Board rep told TMZ Hefferman 's license number is 317058 .
And it gets more interesting .
The Board of Registered Nursing told TMZ the license number on Grier 's certificate comes back to a Dorothy Rork .
The license number on Suri 's birth certificate is a mystery .
There is no name attached to that license number .
By the way , unlike Suri 's birth certificate , Brooke Shields signed the one for her daughter .
Someone listed as " Friend " signed the certificate for Suri .
Also , the hospital 's policy is to file birth certificates with L.A. County within 10 days of birth .
In the case of Suri , it took 20 days to file , in part because the " friend " did n't sign for 16 days .
In Grier 's case , Brooke herself signed two days after her birth and the certificate was filed nine days after the baby was born .
TMZ placed multiple calls to St. John's .
So far , no comment .
Bush 's policy on terror suspect detainees has been criticised
The suspects , who include the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , have now been moved out of CIA custody and will face trial .
Mr Bush said the prisons were a vital tool in the war on terror and that intelligence gathered had saved lives .
He added that the CIA treated detainees humanely and did not use torture .
He said all suspects would be afforded protection under the Geneva Conventions .
KEY SUSPECTS Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( above left ) : Alleged mastermind of 9/11 ; believed to be the Number 3 al - Qaeda leader before he was captured in Pakistan in 2003 Abu Zubaydah : Alleged link between Osama Bin Laden and many al - Qaeda cells before his capture in Pakistan in 2002 Ramzi Binalshibh ( above right ) :

Bush speech : Key excerpts
Bush gives ' plot details '
Q&A : Bush 's announcement
Mr Bush said he was making a limited disclosure of the CIA programme because interrogation of the men it held was now complete and because a US Supreme Court decision had stopped the use of military commissions for trials .
He said the CIA programme had interrogated a small number of key figures suspected of involvement in 9/11 , the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 in Yemen and the 1998 attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
Mr Bush spelled out how the questioning of detainee Abu Zubaydah had led to the capture of Ramzi Binalshibh , which in turn led to the detention of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Mr Bush said the CIA had used an " alternative set of procedures " , agreed with the justice department , once suspects had stopped talking .
But he said : " The US does not torture .
I have not authorised it and I will not . "
He said the questioning methods had prevented attacks inside the US and saved US lives .
" This programme has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill , " the president said .
The CIA programme had caused some friction with European allies .
Some EU lawmakers said the CIA carried out clandestine flights to transport terror suspects .
Dick Marty , who investigated the issue of secret CIA prisons for the Council of Europe , said it was now up to European governments to reveal what they know about secret CIA prisons in Europe .
Revised guidelines
Mr Bush said he was asking Congress to authorise military commissions and once that was done " the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11 2001 can face justice " .
All detainees will now have Geneva Convention protection
The move marks a reversal in policy for the Pentagon , which previously argued that many detainees were unlawful combatants who did not qualify for such protections .
The new guidelines forbid all torture , the use of dogs to intimidate prisoners , water boarding - the practice of submerging prisoners in water - any kind of sexual humiliation , and many other interrogation techniques .
The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says that in one stroke the Pentagon is moving to defuse all criticism of the way it treats the people it has captured in its war against terrorism .
The US administration has faced criticism from legal experts and human rights activists over the policy on detentions of terrorism suspects .
Mr Bush also said he was asking Congress to pass urgent legislation to clarify the terms under which those fighting the war on terror could operate .
He said the laws must make it explicit that US personnel were fulfilling their obligations under the Geneva Convention .
Mr Bush said those questioning suspected terrorists must be able to use everything under the law to save US lives .
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , when hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes , incomes and tax records , the I.R.S. delayed the filing deadline for 2005 taxes to Oct. 16 , 2006 , for those living in the counties most affected by the storm .
Normally , those taxpayers who did not file returns or pay their taxes by that extended deadline would begin receiving notices and , eventually , collection demands from the I.R.S .
Mr. Everson ’s order delayed those collection efforts until early next year .
Terry L. Lemons , an I.R.S. spokesman , said that about 1.2 million taxpayers lived in the seven Louisiana parishes and three Mississippi counties where the agency had allowed people to delay payment of 2005 income taxes .
Mr. Everson was deputy director of the White House budget office in January 2003 when he was nominated by President Bush to be I.R.S. commissioner .
His wife , Nanette , was until February the chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House .
There is no indication that anyone in the White House was aware of the order to delay the tax collections .
In an interview , Mr. Everson acknowledged that he had “ probably ” mentioned the elections to Ms. Tucker in their conversation .
He said that in his mind the elections were part of a continuum that ran through the holidays , adding that it was a long - standing practice not to begin enforcement actions near Christmas because it often resulted in negative news and commentary about the I.R.S .
“ We talk about the elections here every day , ” Mr. Everson said .
“ We deal with the Congress  is there going to be a new Finance Committee chairman , a new Ways and Means Committee chairman ? ”
He added : “ Of course , we think about whether our actions will play in the public space ; we have to be seen as legitimate and independent , doing our job , and of course we would not institute a major enforcement action days before an election because it would be misinterpreted . ”
Donald C. Alexander , who was commissioner under Mr. Carter and Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford , said he would never have even thought about delaying enforcement because of an election , but added that he thought Mr. Everson was otherwise doing an excellent job .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices sank over 4 percent Thursday , hitting a new low for 2006 , as swelling inventories and the December contract 's expiration on Friday forced traders out of the market .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , December crude tumbled $ 2.50 to settle at $ 56.26 per barrel .
Crude hit a low of $ 56.20 during trade , its lowest since November 2005 .
" The storage at Cushing is full , if you 're long you would have to take delivery . " said Nauman Barakat , an energy trader at Macquarie Futures , the trading arm of Macquarie investment bank .
" Basically this is confirming that inventories are very high . "
Barakat was referring to the storage tanks at Cushing , Okla .
where oil is stored until it is shipped to an industrial user , like a refinery .
But with the February crude contract currently trading higher than the December contract , there is no incentive for traders to sell their product , said Sal Gilbertie , an energy trader at Fimat in New York .
Instead , they are just keeping it in Cushing .
Besides , said Gilbertie , " If you take delivery and there 's no place to put it , what are you going to do ?
You 're dead .
No one 's buying . "
Crude inventories have been growing for weeks as the summer driving season came to an end in the United States and domestic production escaped damage from a hurricane season that never materialized .
The swelling inventories have helped push oil prices down over the last several weeks .
Crude has fallen nearly 25 percent from a trading high of $ 78.40 reached in July .
Concerns over a slowing economy and easing of tensions in the Middle East were some of the other reasons for crude 's decline , followed by a bail out of big money investment funds that further depressed prices .
However , the slide had been stemmed until recently .
Crude has been hovering around $ 60 a barrel for the last several weeks as OPEC talks of a production cut and the general supply and demand situation remains tight - crude is three times more expensive now than it was at the start of 2002 .
Traders will still be paying close attention to weekly inventory reports to see if OPEC is making good on their threat to cut production by just over 1 million barrels .
But with inventories so high , even that might not be enough .
" Even a cut of 1.1 million is n't going to do the job , " said Barakat .
Stocks of major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil ( Charts ) , ConocoPhillips ( Charts ) , Chevron ( Charts ) , Royal Dutch Shell ( Charts ) and BP ( Charts ) , which often track the price of oil , were all lower in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday .

Many schools have already banned social network sites
The Deleting Online Predators
Act tries to limit the access paedophiles have to the networking sites which have become hugely popular with minors .
The act has already been approved by a large majority in the House of Representatives .
Critics say the act is too broad and could mean a huge number of websites are cut off from users .
Net ban
The DOPA Act was introduced into the US legislative system by Congressman Michael Fitzpatrick .
It passed 410 votes to 15 in a vote on 26 July .
Speaking before the vote was taken , he said : " The social networking sites have become , in a sense , a happy hunting ground for child predators . "
The act covers federal institutions that received funding for computers and net access via the US E - Rate scheme - primarily schools and libraries .
The American Library Association ( ALA ) estimates that two - thirds of US libraries receive this funding .
It requires these organisations to put in place filters to stop children viewing social networking sites where they might be subject to " unlawful sexual advances " .
Critics fear many popular sites could be caught by the law
Social networking sites such as MySpace , Bebo , Facebook , Friendster and many others count large numbers of children among their users .
In both the UK and US many schools have already banned pupils from using these networks over fears that the children are taking risks with the amount of information they are posting .
The DOPA Act leaves the final definition of what counts as a social networking site to the Federal Communications Commission .
Critics say the act's broad description of what the FCC should take into account in its definition could mean a huge number of sites will be blocked by libraries .
The act says the FCC should consider any site that allows users to create and modify a profile , chat to other users and post personal information .
Those criticising the Act said this could mean that a huge number of websites , such as Slashdot , Amazon , blogging sites , wikis and news organisations could be cut off .
" DOPA is redundant and unnecessary legislation , " said Leslie Burger , president of the ALA in a statement .
She pointed out that the Children 's Internet Protection
Act already requires libraries to block net content that is harmful to children .
Some MySpace users have created an online petition to gather support for protests about the act .
The petition , called Save your Space , aims to gather more than one million signatures in a month .
The act now passes to the Senate and a vote on its approval is likely to take place in early August .
Wikimania is postponed until 2021 .
A letter from Katherine Maher to the Wikimedia Community
18 March 2020
Dear everyone ,
As a part of the Wikimedia movement ’s ongoing response to the COVID - 19 pandemic , we are postponing Wikimania Bangkok 2020 .
This decision was made with the full support of the ESEAP host team and Wikimania Committee .
Together , we will hold Wikimania in Bangkok in 2021 .
We are filled with sadness to not see you all in Bangkok in August .
However , we are confident that this is the best possible decision for the well - being of our global community and public health overall .
This decision was proposed by the ESEAP organizers in line with their countries ’ response to the COVID - 19 pandemic and is in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
You are certain to have many questions .
We hope to answer some of your questions below .
We will continue to answer questions on the Wikimania Meta - Wiki page and on the Wikimania Telegram group chat ( more information below ) .
What does “ postponing ” Wikimania mean ?
We will not host an in - person Wikimania in 2020 .
We are rescheduling Wikimania Bangkok until 2021 .
The ESEAP organizing team will continue their work as a regional collaborative between affiliates in the East , South East , and Pacific regions to host us in Thailand next year .
The hotel and venue in Bangkok will remain the same .
We have not yet finalized dates for 2021 .
We will work with the ESEAP team and Wikimania Steering Committee to confirm new dates .
We will let you know these dates by the end of 2020 .
The good news is that Wikimania 2021 will coincide with Wikipedia ’s 20th birthday year .
We expect this to be a truly memorable Wikimania -- an opportunity to celebrate reconnection after a year apart , along with the remarkable accomplishment of two decades of free knowledge .
Will there be an alternative to the in - person event ?
There are no plans by the 2020 Wikimania hosts to organize a virtual , online event .
Hosting Wikimania is a lot of work .
The ESEAP team is committed to hosting the best possible in - person event in Bangkok in 2021 .
Therefore , they will not have the capacity to organize a virtual Wikimania this year .
However , the Wikimania committee , the ESEAP host team , and the Wikimedia Foundation all recognize that other members of the community may be interested in organizing a remote , global Wikimedia event for 2020 .
Although the Wikimedia Foundation does not have the capacity at this time to lead the organizing of a virtual online conference , we recognize others may have the desire to do so .
We welcome discussion about online events .
Interested parties are welcome to contact the Wikimania Steering Committee and Wikimania Foundation staff for advice on the Wikimania Meta - Wiki page .
We are also considering proposals for improving the capacity of communities to organize local virtual convenings , and for how we can support communities in organizing impromptu local and regional Wikimedia events once the pandemic passes .
As the situation has been changing rapidly we are still working on specifics and will share more information in the coming weeks .
What does this mean for scholarship applications ?
We are working on a plan for how to process Wikimania 2020 scholarship applications .
We will share more information in the coming weeks .
How was this decision made ?
This recommendation was made by the ESEAP organizers based on what we know about the current COVID - 19 global health pandemic and current WHO guidelines .
The decision was made together with the ESEAP team in consultation with the Wikimania Steering Committee and Wikimedia Foundation .
Together we are fully and unanimously aligned around this decision .
Although we are genuinely sad to not have the opportunity to see you all this year , we also are fully supportive of this decision in all of our best interests .
It allows our ESEAP community hosts to focus on the immediate needs of their families , local Wikimedia communities , and local communities as a whole .
It is in line with global public health guidance and aligns the Wikimedia movement as a responsible actor in support of our common public good .
We want to thank all volunteers and affiliates that have been involved with planning Wikimania .
We ’re especially appreciative of the ESEAP for their leadership , flexibility , and compassion , as we have worked together to make some difficult decisions on this important event .
Where can I learn more about Wikimania 2021 ?
There are a number of channels where Wikimania is regularly discussed and where plans for 2021 will be posted as they develop .
We welcome all interested participants to bring together our collective wisdom and creativity to discuss what happens next with Wikimania .
You can find these channels here :
Wikimania wiki : https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania
Wikimania mailing list : https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikimania-l
Freenode IRC channel : # wikimania
Telegram group chat : https://t.me/wikimaniachat
Where can I learn more about COVID - 19 and Wikimedia ?
We know the Wikimedia community as generous and altruistic .
Unsurprisingly , many volunteers have started applying their skills and attention to this current global pandemic .
The Foundation created a page on Meta - Wiki where we can share and document the steps the Foundation and movement members are taking and ways to participate .
We invite you to join us in documenting more about our collective response : https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/COVID-19
Thank you .
Our world , and many of our lives , have changed rapidly over these past few weeks .
Yet we can look to history to take comfort that crises are also often moments when people put aside differences , prioritize community and care , and find ways to connect .
The sense of community and purpose within the Wikimedia movement is a powerful rejoinder to these uncertain times .
This is a moment in which not only what we do , but how we do it , will make a meaningful impact on the world .
We are so grateful for all that you do as a movement to continue to rise to the challenges of our moment .
Please , stay safe and take care .
Katherine , on behalf of the :
ESEAP Core Organizing Team
Wikimania Steering Committee
Wikimedia Foundation Events Team

Viral advertising - as defined at wikipedia : " The term ' viral advertising ' refers to the idea that people will pass on and share interesting and entertaining content ; this is often sponsored by a brand , which is looking to build awareness of a product or service .
These viral commercials often take the form of funny video clips , or interactive Flash games , an advergame , images , and even text . " Not something I 've tried - yet - but it should be fairly easy to try out ...

Paid advertising - depends on your budget , and the type of site you have .
If you are selling a product , it might be an option , but if you are using a form of affiliate marketing to generate revenue ( e.g. Google adsense ) , then this probably does n't make sense .

If you are selling a product , it might be an option , but if you are using a form of affiliate marketing to generate revenue ( e.g. Google adsense ) , then this probably does n't make sense .
Link exchanges - link exchanges are another way to increase both traffic and your pagerank ( getting those all important inbound links ) .
But it seems like this is difficult if you do n't already have decent traffic to your site ( i.e. who would want to exchange links with a low traffic site ? ) .
Content is king ?
some
direct result
too
How can you promote your website ( or blog ) to get a ton of traffic ?
This is the million - dollar question : I certainly do n't have all the answers , but I 'm throwing my 2 cents worth in here in the context of my new site squidsquid.com
First off I decided to get my new site listed in some internet directories .
Getting links from high ranking sites is good for two reasons - firstly you get the traffic directed from these sites , and secondly the links contribute to increasing your ( Google pagerank is a measure of how ' important ' your page is , and affects how highly your page will rank in results of a relevant Google search ) .
So getting listed in popular web directories should be good .
I targeted mainly humor directories and got my site listed on a few .
The most successful of these has been Rawmeat.com , from which I 've received about 100 visitors .
I 've submitted to i-am - bored.com several times ( a very popular site - Alexa traffic rank ) , without success .
Many sites get the majority of their traffic from search engines , and the majority of these searches are from Google ( some estimates around 80 % ) .
Some search engines require you to submit your site to them , whereas others crawl the web to automatically detect content ( Google is in this category ) .
I took the time to submit my site to a few search engine directories , although I really have no idea what effect , if any , this has had .
Its probably worth submitting to dmoz at least , but note that it may take several weeks or more to be included , followed by an additional wait to be included by partner sites that use the data ( AOL Search , Google , Netscape Search , Yahoo Search ) .
For my particular type of site however , I 'm not sure that search engines will necessarily be the biggest source of traffic .
For example , people that are searching for information about giant squid are not likely to find a lot of useful material on squidsquid.com .
However , comedy sites such as catsthatlooklikehitler.com ( exactly what it sounds like ! ) , Chuck Norris facts ( e.g . " There is no chin behind Chuck Norris ’ beard .
There is only another fist . " ) and rathergood.com ( a bunch of silly flash videos etc ) have relatively high Google pagerank and Alexa stats , yet it seems unlikely that most new visitors would be from search engine referrals ( e.g. searching for ' hitler cat ' ) !
It seems more likely that these sites become popular through ' word of web ' - blogs , emails , forums , social bookmarking etc .
The whole complicated area of search engine optimisation ( SEO ) is of course also relevant here , but that 's another kettle of fish ( or pandora 's box ? ) .
Anyway , I 've been arguing that certain types of site such as my own are not likely to get a lot of search engine referral traffic ( apart from searches by users already looking for a specific site e.g. " squidsquid " ) .
As an aside , if the Google sandbox really exists , then I think I 'm in it at present .
The ' sandbox effect ' is a theory that explains the observed phenomena that newly registered domains tend to receive lower pageranks for all but very specific searches ( e.g. for the company name ) .
Some people believe that this is due to an intentional Google filter , designed to slow down spam websites that abuse search engine optimisation techniques .
Others believe it is simply a result of the way that Google indexes and ranks pages ( and the time that this takes ) .
In any case , the result is that a new domain will likely not rank very highly for relevant searches on Google for some period of time ( from a few months up to a year ) , and there seems to be very little that can be done to avoid it .
Because Google is the biggest source of search engine referrals , and my pages are currently low on most relevant results ( perhaps because of the sandbox ) , it is difficult to estimate how much search engine traffic I might get in the future .' Web 2.0 ' is a popular buzzword at present - I use the term here to mean something like ' internet sites and services that let people collaborate and share information in new ways , with a focus on user production and control of content ' .
Well known examples are Wikipedia and Youtube .
In terms of promoting your web content , the most relevant are news sites such as Digg and Reddit , and social bookmarking sites like del.icio.us and Technorati .
Some of these sites are pretty cool , and you can find a lot of interesting stuff on them .
The basic principle is that articles / links that are good ( or interesting / controversial / ' sticky ' ) will tend to be promoted as people ' vote ' for them ( by digging , bookmarking , tagging or whatever ) .
The table and graph below are the result of a quick bit of traffic research on Alexa , using 3 month averages .
The list is just a sample of such sites , and is by no means exhaustive .
Note that some of the less popular sites , such as Techtagg and Bluedot are pretty new , so their traffic rankings will likely increase .
Interestingly , Fark only allows 5 % of submitted stories to the front page i.e. it is strongly edited ( although all of them are shown on totalfark - the paid version of the site ) .
In this sense it is more similar to a traditional web directory type site as control of content is partially centralised , and in part controlled by users .
Of these sites , Digg is the most popular .
It 's easy to submit a story to Digg , and you will definitely get some traffic straight away from submission .
Getting aof traffic , and ideally getting promoted to the front page is however another matter .
Of note in the interesting article on the beginning stages of a high - traffic website is that the authors say that despite trying almost daily it took them months to get a story promoted to the front page of one of the sites listed above .
There has been some debate about people ' gaming ' the system , and claims that a small number of users effectively control a large portion of the promoted articles .
Also read the amusing to 10 steps to guarantee you make the Digg front page which is simultaneously a sarcastic dig at Digg users and a largely accurate portrayal .
Certainly if you have friends on the network , who are likely to read ( and digg ) your articles when you submit them , you are much more likely to get stories promoted .
In general , if you want to get a lot of traffic from these web 2.0 sites , you probably need to do some research and tailor your content somewhat to match the sort of stories that tend to get promoted .
There is an argument that if you create good or interesting enough content , then the visitors and traffic will follow .
While I think this is true to an extent ( and I agree with a focus on content over excessive promotion / optimisation etc ) , you also needways of getting your content out there in the first place .
My two biggest sources of traffic so far ( from the 9 at Yahoo , and BBC Radio1 ) were not from aof my own promotion efforts i.e.
I did not ' submit ' these links , they were picked up in some other unknown way .
I 've also received a lot of traffic from links on blogs , forums and emails etc .
Presumably this is because people found the content original / funny / sticky enough to want to share with other people .
Do n't spendmuch time monitoring your traffic , search engine optimising , or submitting to directories , Digg etc , at the expense of creating good content on your site - whatever that might be !
Providence , RI ---
A collaboration between a mathematician and an artist - geometer has resulted in some of the most mathematically sophisticated and aesthetically gripping animations ever seen in the field .
Their visualizations of cutting - edge research in dynamical systems theory not only provide a dramatic new way of visiting mathematical worlds once seen only in the mind 's eye , but also point to a new era for the use of computer graphics in communicating and carrying out mathematical research .
The two collaborators are Etienne Ghys , a mathematician at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon , France , and Jos Leys , a Belgian graphic artist and engineer with strong mathematical interests .
They have written an online animated exposition of an important new theorem Ghys has proved in dynamical systems theory .
The exposition will appear as the November 2006 installment of the Feature Column on the web site of the American Mathematical Society .
Ghys 's Theorem : A Deep Connection in Dynamical Systems Theory
Ghys was preparing a lecture for the Bibliotheque National de France when he found some intriguing mathematical pictures on Leys 's web site .
Soon the two were discussing making illustrations of a theorem that Ghys had recently proved , which gives a deep connection between two seemingly unrelated phenomena in dynamical systems theory : Lorenz attractors and modular flows .
A dynamical system is a system that evolves over time , like the weather or the stock market .
Mathematicians study the differential equations that describe how dynamical systems change over time .
Lorenz attractors :
The Lorenz attractor has become the paradigmatic image of chaos theory .
In the 1960s the meteorologist Edward Lorenz stumbled on this " strange attractor " in his research examining a particular dynamical system that modeled weather patterns .
As that system evolves , the points in it trace out trajectories that return back to their original locations , forming periodic orbits that accumulate around the attractor ( hence the name ) .
The orbits are knots : closed loops in 3 - dimensional space .
Out of the infinite universe of mathematical knots , only a small set of very special knots appear in the Lorenz attractor .
The animations of Ghys and Leys display these special Lorenz knots and show how the knots determine the shape of the Lorenz attractor .
Modular flows :
A lattice is a collection of evenly - spaced points in the plane , like the set of dots in the Dots and Boxes game .
A dynamical system , or flow , on the lattice is a rule for making the lattice points move in a uniform way across the plane .
This notion of " modular flow " has been an important tool in mathematics , in particular in number theory , where its roots go back to the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss ( 1777-1855 ) .
Ghys showed how each modular flow can be associated in a unique way with a knot --- and he discovered that the set of knots associated with modular flows is exactly the set of Lorenz knots !
This extraordinary result , and the animations illustrating it , formed the centerpiece for a plenary lecture Ghys presented at the quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid , Spain , in August 2006 .
Being invited to present an ICM plenary lecture is a coveted honor in the mathematical world .
Ghys 's lecture was enthusiastically received and constituted a major highlight of the Congress , which was attended by 4000 mathematicians from all over the world .
Getting the Knots to Close
When Ghys and Leys first began working together , they intended to produce still images to illustrate Ghys 's theorem .
" Soon , we realized that animations are much more fun than still images , " Ghys said .
The two worked closely to develop numerical algorithms to carry out the animations .
All of the work was done on their personal computers , and their interaction has been almost entirely through email .
" It was an intense collaboration , " said Leys .
" We exchanged about 1,800 email messages in 4 months , a lot of them sent late at night when we were close to a breakthrough . "
While Leys wrote code in a program called UltraFractal that is good for pictures but not ideal for mathematics , Ghys would work in parallel using specialized mathematical software packages to provide hints about how the computations should be done .
The perfection with which the animations capture the mathematical world of dynamical systems and knots came as a result of hard work --- and a great deal of back and forth between Ghys and Leys .
" Almost never did our knots close ! "
Ghys recalled .
" Most of the time , the knots came out in several pieces not connected together . "
The errors were caused sometimes by wrong formulae , and sometimes because of numerical artifacts arising from the computing scheme .
As Ghys and Leys worked together to find the best way to represent the mathematics , each learned about the other 's area of expertise .
Their animations offer a glimpse deep into the heart of a mathematical world that few have been able to see until now .
By the time they had begun collaborating , Ghys already had a mathematical proof of his theorem .
But the animations brought him to a new level of understanding .
" When I saw the proof in action , I was ' more convinced ' that it is true ! "
Link to the Riemann Hypothesis
At the end of their Feature Column , Ghys and Leys present an animation of yet another kind of dynamical system called a horocycle flow .
There is a link between this flow and a question known as the Riemann Hypothesis , which is a statement about the distribution of prime numbers and is perhaps the biggest open problem in mathematics today .
If one could prove a certain fact about the horocycle flow , the Riemann Hypothesis would follow as a consequence .

What Ended
What ended this week in New Orleans was not a city .
The city will be rebuilt .
What ended this week was not dream .
Martin 's dream still lives -- not least in the outrage expressed throughout the country , from the redneck forests to the Berkeley waters , over the shabby negligence with which the victims of storm and flood were treated .
And the big dream 's still there , too .
Somewhere in the Astrodome tonight , there 's a little boy or girl who is tired and hungry and frightened , and who will grow up to be president .
You can bet on it .
What ended this week was not a war , though its destined end in ignominy and failure is now assured .
What ended this week a was not a presidency , though Katrina made George W. Bush , overnight , a lame duck .
What ended this week is the illusion that words can substitute for real work and real knowledge .
This was the last , spectacular failure of the internet bubble , the final burnout of paper businesses that had no business and paper politicians who had no cause and paper experts whose expertise lay in their bogus credentials or in the wealth of their pals .
We 'll know the details in time .
We 'll have years of investigations .
We already know the answer .
We filled key roles at the top with lawyers and promoters and press agents and cronies , and when we needed them to do their job , they held press conferences instead .
And we filled key roles on the line -- police and fire and public safety -- with too many people who were n't up to the job , or whose leaders were n't up to the job .
Frightened by snipers and rumors , they sacrificed the lives of men and women and children in danger , lives entrusted to them , to save their own .
They turned in their badges or grounded their choppers .
Their duty was hard ; they did not do it .
What ended , too , was the illusion that history is over , and the academic illusion that whatever clever argument we can make is equally good .
In the last decade , arguing specious positions has been a route to funding and fame .
You could argue that we did n't need better flood control in New Orleans .
People did argue it -- just like they argue still for teaching intelligent design to our kids , just like they argue that global warming needs more study , that maybe the environment will take care of itself .
That 's what ended .
We know , now , that sometimes we need experts in jobs that require expertise .
We need scholars in jobs that require scholarship .
In jobs that require doing your job -- even in the face of discomfort and danger -- we need people on whom we can depend .
Most of all , we need to take responsibility to weigh the evidence , decide , and bear the weight of decision .
No excuses .
No press conference .
No spin , because there is no need for spin .
What ended is the illusion that we can believe anything , however absurd , and make it true by insisting on it , by believing that such a nice man or such a committed woman will do a great job at FEMA or wherever .
Or , if not a great job , one we can call " great " .

Archives > 2006 > September > Digg Algorithm For Scoring Stories
Here is a condensed version of what Kevin Rose & Jay Adelson confirmed as being some of the core elements used in determining the ranking ( could substitute relevance here ) for a story on digg .
Again , these are my personal notes from our meeting with them and hopefully this will make it fairly clear what parts the " machine " looks for on new stories and user diggs .
Also , if you know anything about seo , then all of this will sound a bit familiar .
Digg is now where Google was circa 1999.1 . )
Not a set number of diggs in order for a story to be promoted .
2. )
Brand new users are like automatic penalties in the search engines ( sandbox effect ) . -
I asked Kevin if they were going to call this part of their algorithm diggbrother , that got a good laugh out of everyone that was on the call .3. )
Buries are often overlooked but are key to their ranking3a . )
Buries arein value .
Digg looks at ...-
Number of people that buried it before it was promoted -
What is the audience like ( history , tendancies , etc ... ) that diggs / buries the story4 . )
The time of day the story was submitted is included in the ranking algorithm .
Because people watch the digg spy , labs , etc...5 . )
Digg crawls the stories that are submitted to look for additional content such as images , external links , etc...6 . )
The person submitting a story is not factored in when ranking a submission .
7. )
URLs are all treated equal - no preference to the mainstream .
if url has been banned .
They were emphatic about this point and said they know they are n't perfect and that some good urls got banned on accident but they 're more than willing to manually correct those .- if reported by enough users - fraudulent url , spam site , etc...8 . )
Reputation plays a role .
A positive reputation means ...-
If you agree with the same person over and over again it 's a red flag ( think automatic penalties in Google & Yahoo ) -
Agreeing with a friend is not a behaviour they want to penalize but if the same 20 people digg the same stories togetherthey must be treated as one mind .
Definitely a clever one - liner Jay has had to use many times in the past for sure . - Karma DOES impact promotion ( as they have said in the past ) .
9. )
The lifeline of a story is monitored as well .- who diggs the story and the sequence of those diggs ( is it the same people digging the stories ? ) 10 . )
Age of users is a conundrum - Readers Digest Version :
It does n't take a year to gain a good reputation 11 . )
They will not show who buried stories in rss feeds because they do n't want to start flamewars by showing people that are burying stories .
12 . )
They receive 4,000 - 5,000 stories submitted a day and it's impossible to handle that kind of volume without having sophisticated algorithms running on the backend .
Ultimately , they stood by their statement that Digg is all about the wisdom of the masses .
Jay " A submission is equal weight "
(8) Thoughts on Digg Algorithm For Scoring Stories
Thanks for posting your notes .
Greater transparency is better for everyone ; what would be best is a transcript -- but maybe you 're working on it anyway .
In some ways the partial transcript generates more questions than answers , but it seems their intentions are in the right place -- for what its worth .
I guess time will tell if blunting elite diggers " diggs " will work .
And what the _next_ " gaming " effect is ... intentional or otherwise .
Thanks for your coverage of this topic .
Cheers

The notes here are just mine and John Gartner was asking most of the questions , being the veteran journalist he is , so I 'll see if we can round his notes and Ev's notes up as well .
As far as the transcript goes ...
Do n't think we 'll be able to do that since we do n't have one .
Their pr firm may have something but I honestly doubt it .
I 'll let you know if we get some new stuff though .
At this point I 'm so sick of hearing their name I want to throw up .
Comments by Jason Dowdell : Friday , September 08 , 2006 at 11:06 AM
I 'll add my notes here , they are summarized but the points can be taken from what I 've wrote .
Yesterday was Jay 's birthday and no one said Happy B - day on Digg . :)
Q : How does Editorial Work ?
- philosophy is automated in terms of promotion
-" no editorial process "
-" admitted weaknesses that are being worked on "
Q: What makes kevin digg a story ?
-" It is usually because I look at what my friends have dugg "
- I use DiggUpdate to monitor digg.com
- Digg gets around 4,000 submitted stories a day .
- They also use obvious things like IP tracking to help curb gaming and fraud .
These are all the notes i have that Jason did n't put in his post .
Comments by Evan : Friday , September 08 , 2006 at 11:18 AM
Should be interesting if people who submit to Digg regularly will change their strategy or behavior , in any way , based on what was disclosed .
Comments by webmetricsguru : Friday , September 08 , 2006 at 02:11 PM
" So sick of their name I want to throw up ? "
Those are strong words ...
Whom do you refer ?
The PR firm ?
Digg ? or Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson ?
Comments by Tony : Friday , September 08 , 2006 at 04:10 PM
SOrry -- another thing :
" No editorial process ? "
I 'm not sure what they mean .
I think what they mean is " we do n't control which stories go to the front page -- but we 're happy to delete users and posts we think are spam " .
And there 's the crux .
When stuff like that happens , it _is_ an editorial process .
Cheers

To be frank , I look at Digg as a website with 10 active , biased editors .
Slashdot is BY FAR a better social website .

Post a Comment
It does exactly what is says on the tin
A team of engineering students from Durham University have won a prestigious national award for re-designing the humble tin can to help victims of natural disasters .
Their all - in - one tin not only contains food but also provides a pan , spoon and stove with fuel and matches .
The team won an RSA ( Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts , Manufactures and Commerce ) Design Directions Award , sponsored by The Worshipful Company of Tin Plate Workers .
The £ 3000 prize money was split between all six team members Jon Lee , Mark Atkinson , Chris Crabtree , Elliott Hampson , Chris Webb and Chris Taylor to be used to assist them in the development of their education and future careers .
Chris Taylor , who is keen to start a career working in renewable energy , plans to spend his prize on a trip to Europe to research people ’s attitudes to this type of energy .
Explaining how the team set about the project , Chris said : “ We were aiming to make the tin can more useful when distributed as aid after a natural disaster .
We wanted it to be able to store more than just food , without becoming too difficult or costly to manufacture .
“ After speaking to people who work in aid distribution , we identified the five basic needs people have after a natural disaster .
These were food , water , shelter , fuel and health .
We tried to solve as many of these problems in one design .
With the exception of the shelter , our tin directly provides these needs . ”
The design is similar to a standard can but is split into two sections internally .
The top section holds food while the bottom section acts as a stove .
Solid fuel tablets and matches are stored in the stove section and are accessed by three air holes , which are opened with ring pulls .
After heating the food there is sufficient fuel remaining to boil 4.5 litres of water which provides enough purified water for at least two people for a day .
A handle is attached to the side to allow for safe operating , and doubles up as a useful tin opener .
Built into the top of the can is the spoon - like utensil which allows the contents to be stirred and removed .
Chris added : “ By being able to put food , a stove and utensils into one unit it is more cost effective , because aid agencies do n’t need to distribute items such as cooking equipment and food separately . ”
The manufacturing cost for one tin , excluding the food is £ 1.30 .
Chris continued : “ In addition , the design also encourages self - sufficiency , providing a psychological boost to the communities in need , and does not require disaster victims to have access to other resources provided by the aid agencies . ”
Commenting on his thoughts on winning the award , Chris said : “ We are all very happy and proud to have won .
In total , 20 groups entered the ‘ Designing for Emergencies ’ category of the Design Directions awards and we were one of the four that were short - listed .
“ The project was initially set as our third year coursework for our Masters degree , but it also coincided with the RSA ’s competition .
“ We decided to enter because we could see that something worthwhile could come out of it at the end .
After all our hard work , roughly four months to prepare and design the tin can , we were really pleased with the standard of our coursework , but to have the honour of winning this national award was an added bonus . ”
The panel of judges at the RSA recommended the team show their design to aid agencies .
The six are now looking towards patenting and registering their tin can and hope that one day it may be used to help people in the aftermath of a natural disaster .

生産的になろう （ Aaron Swartz のブログから ）
「 君がテレビを見てた時間をぜんぶ合わせれば、」そいつは言った「いまごろ長編小説の一本も書けてたはずだ」。これにはたしかに反論しがたいものがある。テレビを見てるよりは小説を書くほうが時間のいい使いかただというのは疑いようもない。だけどちょっと待てよ？
この手の言い分は、まるでテレビを見てた時間を、小説を執筆する時間にたやすく置き換えられるみたいな言いかただ。残念なことに、事実はそうじゃない。
時間の質には程度の差というものがある。地下鉄の駅まで歩いている途中で、ノートも持っていないようなときに小説の続きを執筆するなんてのは至難の業だ。また、しょっちゅうだれかに割り込まれるようなときに集中しつづけるのもむずかしい。精神状態の要素もからんでくる。いい気分でやる気もあって、いっちょやってやろうかというときもあれば、落ち込んでたりくたびれてたりして、テレビを眺めるくらいしかできないというときもある。
だからより生産的になろうというのなら、この事実を認識して、そいつとうまくつきあっていかなきゃいけない。第一に各種の時間をできるだけ有効利用するということ、そして第二に、時間の質をより高くするよう心がけるということだ。
効率的に時間を使 う
よい問題設定 を
人生は短い（聞いたところによるとね）。それならくだらないことに時間を費やしている理由がどこにある？
あることがらに、手ごろだからという理由でとりかかるのは簡単だ。だけどつねにそのことについて自問するべきだ。自分ができることでもっと重要なことがあるんじゃないのか？
どうしてそのことじゃなくて、かわりにこれをやろうとしてるんだ？
こうした問いかけに正対するのは厳しいことだけど（このルールに従うと、ついには自分はどうして世界でもっとも重要な問題に取り組んでいないんだろうと自問することになるわけだし）、この小さな積み重ねが人をより生産的にしてくれる。
これはべつに自分の生涯を世界でもっとも重要な問題にささげろといってるわけじゃない。僕だってそこまでやってるわけじゃないからね（こんなエッセイを書いたりしてるわけだし（訳注 : それを訳したりしてるわけだし））。だけど自分の生きかたを評価するときにはこれを絶対の基準にしている。
いろいろや れ
もうひとつの神話は、たったひとつの問題にのみ取り組んでいるときに、人はより多くを成し遂げるというやつだ。僕はこれはまず間違ってると思う。いまこの瞬間だって、姿勢を変えたり、体の筋を伸ばしたり、なにか液体を飲んだり、デスクを整理したり、兄弟とインスタント・メッセンジャーをしながら僕はこのエッセイを書いている。きょう一日を通してみれば、このエッセイを書き、本を読んで、食事をして、メールにいくつか返信、友達とチャットをして、買いものをしてきて、べつのエッセイをいくつか、ハードディスクをバックアップ、それに蔵書目録の整理をした。週を振り返ってみれば、いくつかのソフトウェア・プロジェクトでコードを書いて、本も何冊か読み、プログラミング言語の勉強をいくつか進めて、家具の配置を変えたりもしている。
プロジェクトをたくさん抱え込むことで、いろいろな質の時間にかかわることができるようになる。くわえて、行き詰まったときや飽きてきたときに、べつの作業をすることができるようにもなる（しかもそれをしている間に行き詰まった状態から脱することができる）。
いろいろやるということは、人をより創造的にもする。創造性は、ある仕事にべつの領域で学んだことを適用するところからやってくる。ことなる領域からなるさまざまなプロジェクトを抱えていれば、よりたくさんのアイデアを活かせるようになるだろう。
リストを作 れ
たくさんのことがらを進めるのについていくのがしんどくならないようにしなくちゃいけない。人はやり遂げたいことをたくさん抱え込んでしまいがちだ。しかしすべてを頭の中にしまいこんでおこうとすると、それはあっという間にふくれあがってしまう。ぜんぶ覚えておかなきゃというプレッシャーで頭がおかしくなってしまうかもしれない。解決策はまたもやシンプル。メモっておけ、だ。
やりたいことをぜんぶ箇条書きにしたら、それを種類別に整理してもいい。たとえば、僕のリストはこうなっている。プログラミング、書く、考える、おつかい、読む、聞く、観る（順番もこのとおりだ）。
たいていの規模のプロジェクトでは、いくつものことなるタスクが関わってくることになる。このエッセイを例に挙げると、先延ばしの心理について書いているほかの記事を読んだり、記事の新しい節を考えたり、文章を推敲したり、問題について人びとにメールしたりといったようなことが、本文を書くというじっさいの作業にくわえて発生する。それぞれのタスクは適切に分類しておいて、ふさわしい種類の時間がきたときにできるようにする。
リストを生活に統合する
ひとたびリストができあがったなら、問題はそれを見るのを忘れないようにするということになってくる。そのためのいちばんの方法は、なにかしようというときにそれが必ず目に入るようにしておくということだ。たとえば、僕のデスクには本が積んであるけど、これはいま読んでいるものがいちばん上になるようにしている。本を読みたくなったら、いちばん上のやつを手にとればいい。
僕は同じことをテレビや映画についても実践している。これは見なくちゃ、というような映画を知ったときには、その情報を自分のコンピュータの特別なフォルダに置いておく。そしてなにか見たくなったときには、そのフォルダを開けてみる。
僕はもっとおせっかいなやりかたも考えてみたこともある。たとえば、どこかのブログをチェックしようとすると「to read」（読むべし）フォルダに置いてある記事の一覧を自動的にポップアップするようなウェブページとか。さらには自分がだらけないよう、ときおりやることを提案してくるようなポップアップ・ウィンドウなんてのも。
時間の質を高め る
ここまで書いてきたことだけでは、ある時間の最良の使いかたができるようになったにすぎない。もっと重要な問題は、より質の高い時間を自らの手で作ることだ。人の時間のほとんどは、学校や仕事といったことで食いつぶされてしまう。もちろんいちばんいいのはそれらに従事するのをやめてしまうことだけど、そうするほかにはなにができるだろう？
物理的制約を解消す る
ペンと紙を取 れ
僕の知り合いで機知のある人たちというのはみんな、小型のノートやそれに類するものをいつも持ち歩いている。ペンと紙というのは、どんな状況にあってもすぐに役に立ってくれる。人になにかを書いて説明したり、メモを取ったり、アイデアを書き留めたり。僕は地下鉄で記事をまるまる書き上げてしまったこともある。[^sub ]
（これを実践してたのは以前までで、いまはどこにでも携帯電話を持ち歩くようにしている。これだと人になにかを書いて渡すといったことはできなくなるけど、そのかわり読まなきゃいけないような記事を（メールで送って）いつでも読めたり、メモを受信トレイに送信しておいたりできる。そうしておけば、目に触れざるをえなくなるからね。）
割り込まれないようにする
多大な集中を必要とするような作業では、割り込まれるようなことは避けなければいけない。単純な方法としては、邪魔者に見つからないようなところに行ってしまうというのがある。もうひとつの方法としては、周囲の同意を取り付けておくというのがある。「ドアを閉めているときには邪魔をしないでくれ」とか「インスタントメッセンジャーは僕がヘッドフォンをしているときにしてくれ」とか（そうしておけば、時間が空くまでメッセンジャーを無視しても大丈夫だろう）。
無理はだれだってしたくない。ときには、時間をもてあましていて、ぜひ割り込んでいただきたいというようなときもあるだろう。座ってニュースを読んでいるよりも、困っているだれかの助けになってやるほうが時間の使いかたとしてはずっといい。あらかじめ同意を結んでおくのがいいアイデアだという理由がそこだ。本当に集中しているとき以外は、割り込んでもらえるわけだから。
精神的制約を解消す る
食事、睡眠、運 動
空腹だったり、疲れていたり、落ち着かなくなっているときというのは時間の質が低いときだ。その解消法は単純。食事、睡眠、そして運動だ。とはいえ僕はこれがなかなかできないでいる。僕は外食が好きでないので、空腹になっても作業を続けてしまい、ついには食事に出る元気もないというくらいにまで疲れ果ててしまうというのがたびたびだ。[^t ]
「 疲れてるのはわかってけど、寝るわけにはいかない――やらなきゃいけないことがあるから」。ついそう考えてしまいがちだ。睡眠をとっていればその日の残りの時間の質も高いものになるし、それにどうせいつかは寝なくちゃいけないわけだから、じっさいにはそうしたほうがずっと生産性は上がっているはずなのに。
じつをいうと僕はそんなに運動してるわけじゃないので、たぶんこの点に関してはアドバイスするのにはふさわしくない人間なんだけど、それでもできるところでは体を動かすようにはしているよ。寝そべって本を読んでいるときに上体を起こしたり、徒歩でどこかに向かうというときに走ったり。
愉快な人たちと話 す
メンタルな制約を解消するのはものすごくむずかしい。その助けとなることのひとつは、愉快な友達を持つということだ。たとえば、僕は
Paul Graham（訳注 : ハッカーのえらいひと）や Dan Connolly（訳注 : HTML のえらいひと）と話すといつもやる気が出てくる。かれらはエネルギーを発している。大仕事をやろうというときには、人を避けて部屋に引きこもる必要があると思いがちだけど、これはやる気をくじくから、じつはかえって能率が悪くなるんだ。
苦労を共有す る
友達がそんなに愉快なやつじゃなかったとしても、ほかのだれかと一緒になってやることで、困難な仕事というのはずっと乗り越えやすくなるものだ。心理的な重荷が両者に分散されるし、それにもうひとりがいることで、邪魔されるどころか、仕事に取り組む気を起こさせるようになる。
先延ばしと精神の障 壁
しかしいま書いてきたようなことは、すべて問題の回避策だ。人びとが抱える、生産性にかかわる本当の問題というのは、先延ばしだ。これは、ちょっとした、忌まわしき秘密といったようなものだが、しかしみんな、ものごとを先延ばしにしている――しかもとんでもなくね。これはなにもあなたに限ったことじゃない。だけどだからといって克服する必要がないというものでもない。
先延ばしとはいったいなんだろう？ 傍から見れば、あなたは仕事や勉強をするかわりに、なにかべつの「楽しい」こと（ゲームをするとか、ニュースを読むとか）をしているにすぎない。（そしてあなたのことをなまけもののの悪い子だと思うだろう。）しかし本当の問いはここからだ。あなたの頭の中では、いったいなにが起こっているのか？
僕はこのことを説明しようとずいぶん時間をかけたんだが、僕にできる最善の解説というのは、人の脳が、仕事のまわりに精神的な障壁のようなものを築くんじゃないかということだ。磁石をふたつ近づけて遊んだことある？
ふたつの磁石を同じ向きに合わせて近づけると、磁石はものすごい力で反発する。磁石をあちこち動かしてみると、磁力の境界線みたいなものを感じることができるはずだ。磁石同士を近づけようとすると、磁場は相手を反対側に押し返すか、あるいは自分のほうで逃げていこうとする。
精神的な障壁も同じようなものなんじゃないだろうか。はっきりと触ったり見たりはできないけど、その境界線のようなものを感じることができる。近づけば近づくほど強い力で押し返してくる。そしてその当然の帰結として、反対側に行ってしまうんだ。[^s ]
そしてちょうど反発しあうふたつの磁石を並べるのがものすごくたいへんなのと同じように――ふたつの磁石は手を緩めるやいなや跳びすさってしまう――、この精神的な障壁には、薄弱な意志の力ではとうてい打ち勝つことができない。かわりにずるをして、磁石をひっくり返すことになる。
なにがこの精神的な障壁を作りあげるのだろう？
それにはたぶんふたつの大きな要素が関係していると思う。その仕事が困難であるということと、それが割りあてられたものであるということだ。
困難な問 題
こまかく砕 く
困難な問題のひとつは、大きすぎる問題だ。レシピ管理のプログラムを作ろうとしたとする。椅子に座るなりいきなりレシピ・オーガナイザーを書きあげられるやつなんていない。それはゴールであって、タスクじゃない。タスクというのは、ゴールに近づくための、はっきりとして具体的なステップのことだ。まともな第一のタスクというのは「レシピを表示するスクリーンのデザインをスケッチしてみる」とか、そういったようなことだ。それくらいなら手の出しようもある。[^nc ]
これができれば、次のステップがより明確になってくる。レシピを構成する要素にはどういうものがあるか、どのような検索機能が必要か、データベースをどのように構築するか、などを決めていかなければいけない。あるタスクが次のタスクを導くことで、はずみがつく。ある案件を頭の中でこまかく切り分けていくことで、その案件にまつわる問題は解決しやすくなっていく。
大きなプロジェクトごとに、僕はそこでできるあらゆる次のタスクを考えては、分類分けされている（前述の）To
Do リストにそいつを追加する。そして、なんらかの理由で作業を中断したときに、そのリストにさらなるタスクを追加していく。
単純にす る
困難な問題のもうひとつは、あまりに複雑すぎたり、厄介すぎる問題だ。本を一冊書きあげるなんて考えるとうんざりするから、ひとつエッセイを書くというところからはじめる。エッセイも手にあまるというようなら、一段落の概要を書いてみる。大切なことは、とにかくいますぐになにかをするってことだ。
ひとたびなにかをやり始めたら、それをもうすこし正確に把握し、問題をよりよく理解できるようになる。まっさらなところから始めるよりは、すでにあるものを改善することのほうがずっとやさしくもなっている。一段落をうまく書けたのなら、そこから一本のエッセイなり、一冊の本なり、少しずつ、適切な分量の文章へと成長させることもできるだろう。
考える
いくつかの思いつきが難問を解く鍵となることもしばしばだ。その領域に明るくないのなら、ぜひともそれについて調べてみるべきだ。ほかの人びとがどうやって問題を解決しているか、そのコツをつかむんだ。腰をすえてその領域をすっかり理解するところまでやってみる。理解できたかどうか、やさしめの問題を解いて確認もしてみる。
割りあてられた問 題
割りあてられた問題というのは、人からこれこれをやるようにと言われた問題のことだ。「動機付けさせられて」なにかするという場合、人はすすんでそれをやるようなことはなく、その成果も芳しくないということが、いくつもの心理学の実験から明らかになっている。報酬にせよ懲罰にせよ、外部から与えられた動機というのは心理学用語でいうところの「内発的動機付け」――問題に対して抱く自然な興味というやつ――を殺してしまうのだ。（このことは社会心理学でもっとも繰り返し確認されていることのひとつで、70以上もの研究で、報酬はタスクに対する興味を損なうものであるということが述べられている。）[^kohn ]
どうやら人の脳みそというのは、やれと言われてやることには深い忌避を感じるものらしい。[ ^avo ]
不可解なのは、この現象が他人から言われた場合のみに限られず、やろうと自分で決めた場合でも起こるということだ。「 X をやらなくちゃ、これはもう今すぐにもとりかからなければならない最重要事項なんだから」と自分に言い聞かせる、するとたちまち
X はやり始めるのが世の中でいちばん億劫なものになってしまう。ところがここで
Y が最優先事項になると、当の X のほうはずいぶんととりかかりやすいものに見えてくる。
自分をだま す
わかりやすい解決策としてこういうのがある。X をやらなければならないとする、そういうときに、Y
をやらねば、と言い聞かせる。残念なことに、故意に自分をだますというのは、そうと本人が自覚してる以上なかなかむずかしいものがある。[^feyn ]
ここは変化球で攻めてく必要があるだろう。
手としては、ほかの人からなにか自分に課してもらうという方法がある。卒業論文を抱えた学生がいい例だ。卒業するには避けて通れない、とほうもない困難。それゆえに学生たちは、それ以外であればどんな困難でもすすんでやるというまでになってしまう。
課してもらうタスクは、一見重要（やらないと卒業できないとか）かつ壮大（何百ページもの努力の結晶）ではあるが、じつをいうとそうでもなく、うっちゃっても大惨事にはならないようなのが望ましい。
自分で自分に課さな い
「 さあ、ほかのことにかまけてる場合じゃない、机にかじりついてでもこのエッセイを完成させなきゃ」ついこう考えてしまいがちだ。さらにひどくなると「それじゃこのエッセイを書きあげたらだな、キャンディをご馳走してあげよう」などと自分に買収までもちかける。ところがだれかにやれといわれてなにかやるというのは、もっともまずいやり方なのだ。
「 すべてを自分で成し遂げる」――甘い響きだが、しかしこういうのはかえって逆効果だ。どの場合でも、自分で自分にタスクを課しているところに違いはない。そうなれば、脳はそこから逃れるあらゆる手立てを講じるようになるだろう。
楽しめるようにす る
いわれているとおり、たいへんな仕事というのは楽しくなさそうに見える。だけどじつは、それは僕がやることの中でいちばん楽しいことなのかもしれない。困難な問題は、それに挑むものを飲み込んでしまうというばかりじゃない。その先には、重要なことを成し遂げたというすばらしい感覚が待っている。
だから、自分になにかさせようというときの秘訣は、自分に対してしなきゃいけないんだと説得するんじゃなくて、それは楽しいことだと説得するということなんじゃないだろうか。そしてもしそれが嘘になるようであれば、楽しくする必要があるんだ。
大学でエッセイを書かなきゃいけなかったとき、最初僕は深刻になっていた。エッセイを書くのはとりたててたいへんなタスクというわけじゃない。しかしそれが割りあてられたんだ。勝手に決められた本2冊の見解を結び付けろといわれて何ページも喜んで書けるやつなんている？
そこで僕はエッセイを自分流のジョークに仕立てあげることにした。たとえばあるとき、僕はエッセイの段落にぜんぶ独自の文体を持たせてやろうと考えた。それぞれが、できるだけいろんな演説の形式を再現したものになるようにしたんだ。（これには、課題の分量を水増しできるという利点もあった。）[^ex ]
ものごとを面白くするもうひとつの方法は、問題をメタレベルで解決してしまうことだ。ウェブ・アプリケーションを作るかわりに、ウェブ・アプリケーションのフレームワークを作ってアプリケーションはそのサンプルということにしてしまうとか。こうするとタスクがより面白くなるというだけじゃなく、その成果もより役に立つようなものが得られるようになる。
結論
生産性にはさまざまな神話がつきまとう。時間は交換可能であるとか、集中することはよいことだとか、自分へのご褒美が効果的だとか、きつい仕事は楽しくないとか、先延ばしはよろしくないとか。だけどそういったことはみんな、あるテーマを共有している。現実の仕事というのを、人の生来の気持ちに逆らったものとみなす概念だ。
たいていの人にとって、またたいていの仕事に対して、これはあたっているのかもしれない。くだらないエッセイだとか、意味のない書類の整理だとかをするのにやる気をそそられなきゃいけない法はない。社会がとにかくやれと命じたのなら、やめちまえとささやく頭の中の声には耳を貸さないようにすることを学ぶ必要がある。
だけど、やりがいのあることや、クリエイティブなことをやろうというのなら、脳みそをシャットダウンさせるなんてのはとんでもなく間違ったやり方だ。生産的になる本当の秘訣というのはそれとは正反対のところにある。自分の身体に耳を傾けるんだ。腹が減ってたらなにか食えばいい、疲れていたら眠ればいい、飽きてきたら休憩すればいい、楽しそうで興味のわくプロジェクトなら進めていけばいい。
すべてはあまりにも単純なことのように思われる。へんてこな略語だとか、意思決定とか、成功した実業家からの推薦状なんてのは関係ない。それは常識のようなものだといってもいい。ただ世の中の仕事の定義が、僕らを間違った方向に押しやってしまう。生産的になりたいのなら、踵を返して正しいほうを見据えるだけで十分なんだ。
参考図書
動機付けの心理学についてもっと知りたければ、Alfie Kohn の著作に勝るものはない。彼はこの問題についてたくさんの記事を書いているし、まるまるそれについての本、
Punished by Rewards （邦訳、アルフィ・コーン『報酬主義をこえて』）も書いていて、僕のおすすめだ。
いつか僕も、学校を辞めてしまうという選択肢についてエッセイを書いてみたいと思うけど、これについてはまず
The Teenage Liberation Handbook を手にとってみるべきだ。コンピュータに携わっている人なら、
Y Combinator の資金援助を受けて独立するという手もある。それから 、Mickey Z の本、 The Murdering of My Years では、やりたいことを追求しながら経済的にどうやりくりしているのかについて、アーティストや活動家たちの言葉を特集している。
註
[ ^sub ] : 信じる信じないは自由だけど、僕は地下鉄で本当に一本書きあげちゃったんだ。仕事がはかどらない理由を挙げるのは簡単だ。次のアポが差し迫ってるとか、下の階の連中が騒々しいとか。だけど、ひらめいてしまったときなら、うるさい地下鉄に乗っててあと数分で降りて歩いていかなけりゃならないようなときであろうとものを書くことができるんだってことが僕にはわかった。
[ ^t ] : 同じ問題は睡眠についてもいえる。眠る力も残ってないほど疲れきってしまうなんてのは最悪だ。ゾンビにでもなってしまったんじゃないかという気がしてくる。
[ ^s ] : 僕はこれと同じ現象をべつのところでも体験することに気づいた。人見知りだ。僕は、会ったことのない人に電話をかけたり、パーティーでだれかに話しかけに行ったりするのが億劫になってしまうことがよくある。すると、僕のまわりにはやっぱり同じ精神的な障壁ができ、僕をそこから遠ざけようとする。これは人見知りもまた、問題のある幼年時代の結果という特性があるからなんじゃないかという気がしている（「割りあてられた問題」を参照）。もちろんこれは、推測の域をでないことだけど。
[ ^nc ] : ここで僕が使っている、 「次の具体的なステップ」というのは、David Allen の Getting Things
Done （邦訳、デビッド・アレン『仕事を成し遂げる技術――ストレスなく生産性を発揮する方法』）からきてるんだけど、ここに書いている原則は（無意識にといってもいいくらいに）、ほとんどエクストリーム・プログラミング ( XP ) で用いられているものになっている（訳注 : プログラムの開発方法論のひとつ）。エクストリーム・プログラミングはプログラムを管理するために開発された方式だけど、僕はそれが先延ばしを脱却するための有効なアドバイスになるってことに気づいた。
たとえばペア・プログラミング（訳注 : エクストリーム・プログラミングで提唱されている実践項目のひとつで、ふたりのプログラマが一台のコンピュータを使い、コーディングとその評価を協力しておこなう）は、質の低い時間において有意義な効果を人にもたらすばかりでなく、両者に精神的な重荷を自動的に分散させる効果がある。プロジェクトを具体的なステップに分割するのは
XP のもうひとつの鍵となる部分だけど、これは（「単純にする」で後述する、）できるところからすぐにとりかかってそれを改善していくというやり方とおんなじだ。こうしたことはなにもプログラミングに特化したことじゃないんだ。
[ ^kohn ] : その目を見張るあらましについては、Alfie Kohn の著作 Punished By Rewards （邦訳、アルフィ・コーン『報酬主義をこえて』）で読むことができる。僕がここで主張してることは、彼の記事
Challenging Behaviorist Dogma : Myths About Money and Motivation から導かれたものだ 。
[ ^avo ] : 僕は最初このことをたんに生物学的なものだと考えていたんだけど、
Paul Graham はむしろそれは学習的なものなんじゃないかと指摘していた。小さいころに、両親は子供をなんとか手なずけようと試みる。親たちは宿題をしなさいというが精神は自由にのたうちまわり、なにかほかのことを考えようとする。こののたうちまわることがすっかり習慣になるんじゃないかと。まあどちらにしても、こいつは矯正しがたい問題になってしまう。これをあらためるのは僕にはお手上げだ。いまはその周辺に手をつけるようにしている。
[ ^feyn ] : リチャード・ファインマンが、自分の夢について観察しようとしていたときの話を書いているが、僕が自分自身の先延ばしの心理を観察しているときも同じような感じだった。ファインマンは、毎晩眠りに落ちるときに自分自身になにが起こっているかを観察しようとしていた。
（略）それはある夜例のごとく夢を見ながらその観察をしていたときのことだ。（略）と、僕は自分が上向きに寝ていて、真鍮の棒を枕にしているのに気がついた。頭のうしろを触ってみると、これが柔らかい。僕はそこで、「ははあ。この真鍮の棒が僕の視覚領を刺激していたから、夢の観察ができたのに違いない。この棒を頭の下において眠りさえすれば、好きなときに観察ができるんだから今はこれでもうやめにして、もっと深い眠りにおちることにしよう」と思った。
あとになって目が覚めてみると、真鍮の棒など影も形もないし、僕の頭のうしろも、ちっとも柔らかくない。ということは、おそらく僕の脳が睡眠中の観察に疲れてきて、これを中止する良い口実を作りだしたのに違いなかった。 （リチャ－ド・Ｐ・ファインマン 『ご冗談でしょう、ファインマンさん』 大貫昌子訳、62ページ）
人の脳は、思ったよりよくできているものだ。
[ ^ex ] : たとえば 、 「 比べてみる と 、 Riis はさほど多くの人物から引用はしていない。」と書くかわりにこんなふうに書く。「
Riis に関しては、しかしながら、対人の口述からなる同時代の民族誌を書物として出版できるような報告書へと編纂するのに必要とされる技量面での個人的な才能の欠如によるのか、あるいはたんに地域個別の報道特派員からの報告の選択肢の不足によるものか、比較結果の提示においては完全な失敗の様相を呈している。」
教授は悪文不感症にでもやられていたのか、僕がふざけてるということにはいっこう気づかなかった（その論文は僕の目の前で読んでもらったというのに！）。

Wednesday , 11 January 2006 , The Day After the Macworld Expo Keynote Address , 8:30 AM Pacific
A bedraggled figure stands at the front door of a nice house .
It is Brushed Metal .
He wipes his mouth , brushes various crumbs and bits of detritus from his chest and sleeves .
He ’s been out all night .
He knocks on the door .
A few seconds later , he knocks again .
The door opens , revealing Safari , looking comfortable in a robe and holding a mug of coffee .
This is his home .
He seems slightly surprised to see Brushed Metal , but he ’s cheerful .
Safari : Hey .
Brushed .
What ’s up ?
Brushed Metal : Ah , you know .
In the neighborhood , figured I ’d stop by .
Tried calling you , but kept getting your voicemail .
Safari : ( bemused )
It ’s like eight in the morning .
Brushed Metal : Really ?
Wow , I thought it was like ten .
( Holds left wrist out . )
Lost my watch .
Silence for a few beats .
There ’s a tangible sense of Brushed Metal waiting for a “ come inside ” invitation that is quite obviously not forthcoming , the awkwardness of which neither acknowledges , which ( the lack of acknowledgement of the awkwardness of the situation ) is itself awkward .
Safari sips his coffee .
Brushed Metal :
So how about that fucking keynote ?
Fucking iLife , the whole goddamn suite , gone to that bastard theme from iTunes .
You believe that shit ?
Safari : Yeah , I saw that .
That ’s a tough break , man .
Brushed Metal : Whole goddamn suite .
Safari : Well , not GarageBand .
Brushed Metal : Yeah , that crazy fucker .
You know that theme ’s on meth , right ?
Safari : Really ?
Brushed Metal : Total nut job .
You know the worst part of this thing ?
I had fucking deals signed with all these apps .
Contracts .
They did n’t even bother weaseling out of them with loopholes — you know , saying something like that the contract was for “ iMovie ” , not “ iMovie HD ” , that sort of thing .
They just ripped ’em up .
Safari :
The contracts .
Brushed Metal : Yeah .
That fucker Jobs .
Just ripped ’em up .
I ought to sue those bastards .
If my goddamn agent had n’t Benedict - Fucking - Arnolded me …
Safari :
They do play hardball .
Brushed Metal :
You know what gets me about these apps using that fucking theme ?
Safari : Hmm ?
Brushed Metal :
That everyone ’s raving about how good they look without borders .
Everyone is like , Ooh , borders are so out .
I loooove how everything goes right up against the sides of the windows now .
It feels so light .
Brushed metal and borders look so “ heavy ” .
Like I ca n’t do borderless !
Like you and me are n’t existence proof that I can do borderless !
We fucking pioneered borderless .
We ’ve been borderless right from the start .
They took borderless from us .
Safari :
My browser windows do have some borders when they ’re in bookmarks mode .
Brushed Metal : Sure , but you know what I mean .
Those are n’t border borders .
Safari : Right .
Brushed Metal :
And what ’s the deal with those squared - off window corners ?
Oooh , custom corner radiuses .
What is the point of that ?
It looks like a bug .
Safari : Yeah , I do n’t get that .
Brushed Metal :
We ’ll knock those bookmark - mode borders out in your 3.0 .
Maybe we should do the corner thing , too .
What do you think ?
Safari : ( pause )
Well , that stuff ’s not my call .
Brushed Metal :
We could do it , though .
You and me .
Remember when your public beta hit the street ?
Everyone was like ,
Oh man , brushed metal in a document - based app ?
That ’s against the interface guidelines !
You ca n’t do that !
Waaa ! ”
Good times , man , good times .
Safari : Yeah .
Brushed Metal :
And the whole no - official - name - for - this - theme game .
You know what I think they should call him ?
They should call him “ The iLife Theme ” .
You know , like make it official , put it in the HIG : “ This theme is only for use by iLife apps . ”
Do n’t you think ?
Safari : Look , Brushed .
I ’m not involved in this sort of thing .
I just want to render pages , keep getting faster .
Keep closing leaks .
I ’m just not involved with the theme stuff .
Brushed Metal looks down , takes a breath , shifts a bit from jovial to earnest .
Brushed Metal : I ’ll be honest with you .
I ’m counting on you , Safari .
Safari :
It ’s out of my hands .
You ’ve got to talk to my reps about this stuff .
Brushed Metal : I can count on you , right ?
Safari :
How did you get my address ?
Brushed Metal :
All right , all right .
Can I ask you something , though ?
Safari : Sure .
Brushed Metal : Can I borrow a hundred dollars ?
Safari puts his hand on the door to close it .
Safari : I have to go .
Brushed Metal : Fifty ?
Safari :
Get out of here .
Brushed Metal : OK .
OK .
Hey , do you know where iChat lives ?
Safari closes the door , leaving Brushed Metal alone outside .
There ’s a CLICK from the deadbolt .
Brushed Metal : ( louder , so as to be heard through the door )
How about iCal ?
( quieter , to himself ) Fucker .
Cut to black .
