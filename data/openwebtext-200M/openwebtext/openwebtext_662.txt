Here ’s the good thing of today ’s recession – retailers are giving deep , real deep , discounts to attract customers .
This situation , in my opinion , is good for small businesses .
You can start spending – of course with a eye at your budgeting – to stock office supplies , purchase office equipments and fixtures , or invest in productivity tools – which more likely than not , will be discounted these days .
Conserve your cash :
Use your business credit cards – or apply for a new one
This is the time you should put your business credit cards to work .
Why spend important cash , if you have the choice to stall payment to later date ?
As long as you stick to your budget and pay the outstanding balance in full each billing cycle , you are ready to shop !
Need some equipments you are planning to buy at the year ’s end , but you want to conserve the cash ?
Consider applying new business cards .
However , you need to approach this with caution – again , stick to what your budget allows , otherwise you will end up paying credit cards ’ high interest rates .
Doing this smartly , you can also get yourself additional perks offered by the credit card issuers , such as redeemable loyalty points , frequent flyer points , etc .
Applying for a credit card is easier at this time of the year
Credit card issuers are also shopping around for applicants , because they know this time of the year , customers spend a lot ( some spends more than they should ) .
You can browse for credit card programs online , or inquire directly to the plastic ’s issuer , reason with them why you need a business credit card , and ask them to give you interesting rates – most likely , they will approve your proposal , as long as you have a clean and good credit track records .
I also recommend you to shop for credit cards from specialty providers , such as this credit room that tartget women credit card holders or applicants .
Tis the season to be jolly
Forget recession , enjoy the holiday season .
You need all the energy to enter the new year – and I meant this for you , the business owner , and your business .
Get in shape , and be ready to ride the wave .
The outlook of 2009 is still bleak , but who cares ?
The show must go on !
So , get those discounted office supplies and tools , and be ready for the next year .
And , oh , do n’t forget to purchase them with your business credit cards .

Price per month $ 15 $ 19 $ 39 What to Consider Looking for the Best eCommerce Tool for You When you ’re looking for a good eCommerce tool there are a lot of different things to take into consideration .
It ’s more than just looking for a lot of features and functions .
First , think about your key audience .
Most eCommerce tools also function as website creators , and you need to be able to build a website that fits your business ’s brand and character .
If you do n’t already have a logo or other marketing graphics , you may also want to look for an eCommerce tool that will help you design those graphics .
You should also think about the types of payments you need to be able to accept .
A lot of eCommerce websites will only allow for single purchases instead of subscriptions or appointment booking .
This should be high on your list , make sure your tool can do what you need it to from the beginning .
Think about scaling at the same time .
If you do n’t need subscriptions at the moment , but think you might in the future , it should be an option through your chosen eCommerce platform .
Additional content is also important for building your business .
Your product and business information may not bring the customers you need right away .
You should try to also put our blogs and other content that is genuinely valuable to your customers .
eCommerce platforms offer a variety of SEO and other content support , including analytics .
Make sure those tools are going to be an effective option for your business , and that you can release content in a way that feels simple .
Ultimately , all this information comes down to one simple thing .
You need the best eCommerce tool for your business , not just the best eCommerce platform out there .
Spend some time thinking about how your business is organized and where it ’s biggest areas of opportunity exist .
Once you have that information , finding an eCommerce platform that really works for you and your business is simple .
Key Features
Of course , you ca n’t find the perfect platform if you do n’t know what kinds of features are most important .
This list provides some of the most common features across eCommerce platforms , along with why each feature can be a critical part of your eCommerce business plan .
Payment Processing :
One of the most important single features is payment processing .
The way your eCommerce platform can accept payments is critical to building your business .
If you ’re limited to only a few types of credit card or need to take payments over the phone , you ’ll lose customers .
The easier , and more payment options you have , the more customers you ’ll be able to keep .
Inventory Management :
This is another critical feature , especially as your business grows .
If you have a multiple sales channel platform , you need to stay on top of inventory even when multiple simultaneous sales come in .
Inventory management tools work not only to help you know how much stock you have but also make ordering and other inventory tasks significantly easier .
Do n’t get caught in a lurch with more orders than you can fulfill , ever again .
Make sure this is at the top of your list of key features .
Booking Option : Sometimes your business needs more than just selling goods .
When you ’re offering a service , consultations , or even matching your customers with different products from your website , you need to be able to set up appointments .
Wix is one of the better platforms for this .
It allows for booking appointments in a way that makes it possible to run a consumer goods business or a services - based business .
Anyone who need to make appointments need a booking option .
SEO : Search engine optimization is a critical step for getting people ’s eyes on your business .
It ’s not how you attract customers to your site , but it is how you tell Google and other search engines that your website is worth recommending to their customers .
SEO recommendations will help improve your visibility , attracting more people , and reducing how much you have to spend on ads and other marketing campaigns .
Coupons and Promo Code Tools : Everyone knows how good it feels to use a good coupon .
And once you ’ve got a customer , they ’re a lot more likely to come back and bring more business to your company .
Plus , if they ’re especially pleased with the product and the discount , they ’ll be more likely to recommend your business to others .
If you ’re looking to grow your business , this feature can make your job a lot easier .
Look for a platform that does n’t limit coupons and makes it easy for customers to use them .
Upselling in Cart :
Once you have a customer engaged , they are a lot more likely to continue spending their money .
Upselling in a cart makes it a lot simpler to increase what might have been a small sale to a large one .
Take advantage of this psychological trick to build your business and generate better sales quickly .
Customer Reviews :
One of the biggest things you have to prove to your customers is that you can do what you say you are going to .
Whether that ’s a service , or just that you ’re going to deliver your products on time , one of the easiest ways to do that is to display positive customer reviews .
Giving your customers the opportunity to leave a review , and displaying the best ones , will increase your credibility and make it easier to convert page viewers to customers .
Live Chat :
If your business needs to be highly responsive , you may want to offer a live chat feature .
But before you can offer Live Chat , you need to make sure your eCommerce platform can support it .
Even if your business does n’t have the staff to provide live chat yourselves , you can hire a third - party provider to make sure your customers are getting the answers they need , when they need them .
For instance , ZenDesk lets you add live chat to any website simply by embedding a simple widget .
Blog Feature : Blogs are one of the easiest ways to provide customer - relevant content that will drive more traffic to your website and business .
But , your eCommerce website needs to be able to support a blog , with good load times , to make this an effective part of your platform .
FAQs
What is the best free eCommerce website builder ?
That depends on how you want to use the platform .
There are several free options , but none of them outshine the others in all respects .
Our advice is to do your research and look for the free option that supplies more of the features you need most .
Which online store complies with EU regulations ?
Of the eCommerce platforms on this list ?
Jimdo will be your best bet , though there are other alternatives that comply with EU regulations .
Can I use Dropshipping with these Website Builders ?

Fallout 3 is a fusion of two wildly popular game franchises , in much the same way that Taco Ice Cream would be a fusion of two wildly popular foods .
It takes the gameplay of Oblivion , and splices it with the setting of Fallout .
There are other gameplay elements they ’ve introduced to act as adhesive between the two disparate systems , which both add and detract from the whole in equal measure .
In order to help confuse both players and ( more importantly ) reviewers , Fallout 3 has better gameplay than Oblivion , but a worse story than Fallout .
So figuring out if the game is good or bad depends a lot on which axis you ’re traveling on – which of its progenitors you ’re using as a standard .
The name “ Fallout ” carries expectations with it that I can’t just dismiss with a hand - wave .
The fact that Fallout 3 is good does n’t change those expectations .
In case you missed it , I just admitted that Fallout 3 is good .
And now I ’ve said it twice .
It was no less painful the second time , and I hope you ’ll not ask me to do it again .
It is entertaining .
Inasmuch as that ’s what we want from games , it is a success .
Despite all my Fallout - based disappointments , this game has merit , and – amazingly enough – manages to hit a few home runs .
Let ’s go over a few of them :
The music is excellent .
Any game that has Bing Crosby in the soundtrack ca n’t be all bad .
This song in particular has been stuck in my head for days .
That man was an even , undiluted mixture of talent and class .
The capital wasteland is wonderfully realized .
It ’s reportedly smaller than Oblivion ’s Tamriel in total square footage , but with a greater variety of interiors and a more diverse landscape , which makes it feel larger in the end .
I still pine for the turn - based combat of Fallout .
It was good , and now it ’s gone .
But its loss does not change the fact that the combat in Fallout 3 is pretty fun .
The VATS system – where you can pause the game and take an aimed shot at an enemy based purely on the numbers that drive your character – is about as good a compromise between the new and the old as you could hope to conceive .
I ca n’t come up with a system that would deliver the turn - based fun I crave without alienating the FPS gamers this game is courting .
( Aside from cutting down on the use of slo -mo .
Sweet Jambi , the constant slo - mo became a form of ocular torture after a few hours . )
I have n’t seen anyone else talking about this , but I think the Fallout 3 lockpicking system is the best portrayal of the activity in a videogame , ever .
It ’s a thoroughly tactile experience , and getting that click at the end is deeply satisfying , even before the game surrenders the loot and XP .
The voice acting is tremendous .
Liam Neeson , Malcolm McDowell , Ron Perlman .
All of them give great performances .
( Most readers will naturally and unconsciously append “ Duh ” to the end of the preceding sentence , which is why I did n’t put one there myself . )
The Bethesda regulars are here again , playing the various small - time NPCs in the game .
A few new actors have been added to the mix , so it does n’t feel like a world of clones the way Oblivion did .
It ’s a good game , ( ouch again ) and I can fully endorse it .
This is important to say this up front , because in the next few posts I ’m going to hammer away at the egregious failures of the game and I do n’t want you to walk away with the wrong impression .
This game contains greatness , but it also contains idiocy , and the idiocy is all the more lamentable for the fact that most of it would have been easy to avoid .
Most reviewers would just mention these things in passing , but if you ’ve been reading for any length of time then you know that obsessive , in - depth pedantic nitpickery is my eternal mandate , and I will fulfill that in the coming posts .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Embattled insurer American International Group Inc received New York state approval to post $ 20 billion of policyholders ’ assets as collateral as it seeks to stave off a liquidity crisis and works with banks to fix its problems .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Under the plan , AIG will be permitted to shift the funds from its insurance subsidiaries to the parent company , New York State Governor David Paterson told a press conference .
AIG worked with New York officials , including New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo , through the weekend seeking ways to shore up capital after rating agencies threatened downgrades .
The New York Federal Reserve said it was hosting meetings with banks and the U.S. Treasury Department to discuss a plan for AIG .
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the New York Fed has hired Morgan Stanley to advise it .
AIG shares were down 58 percent .
The company had been in talks with billionaire investor Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway , but those talks have ended , a person familiar with the matter told Reuters .
Neither AIG nor Berkshire returned calls seeking comment .
AIG has posted losses totaling $ 18 billion over the past three quarters on guarantees it wrote on mortgage - linked securities .
Paterson said he had worked with AIG in a bid to help save New York jobs .
The insurer employs 6,000 in Manhattan and 8,600 statewide .
Paterson added that the plan was carefully crafted to pose no risk to New York taxpayers .
“ New York would like to maintain them ( AIG ) if we can as they are critically important to us , ” Paterson said at the press conference .
AIG is scrambling in the wake of one of Wall Street ’s worst ever days ever , with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filing for bankruptcy and Bank of America Corp agreeing to take over Merrill Lynch & Co Inc .
AIG shares fell to $ 5.05 on the New York Stock Exchange after earlier touching $ 3.50 .
The shares have fallen 80 percent this year and closed Friday at $ 12.14 .
Who can blame Galveston plainclothes police who thought a 12 - year - old girl standing outside her house ( flipping the switch on the circuit breaker as her mother has asked her to do ) was a prostitute ?
After all , she was wearing " tight shorts " according to the vigilant officers , and she happened to live only two blocks away from a location where someone had complained that prostitution was taking place .
So the three brave officers did the natural thing : they allegedly jumped the girl and beat her up , according to Courthouse News and the Houston Press .
As Dymond headed toward the breaker , a blue van drove up and three men jumped out rushing toward her .
One of them grabbed her saying , " You 're a prostitute .
You 're coming with me . "
Dymond grabbed onto a tree and started screaming , " Daddy , Daddy , Daddy . "
One of the men covered her mouth .
Two of the men beat her about the face and throat .
As it turned out , the three men were plain - clothed Galveston police officers who had been called to the area regarding three white prostitutes soliciting a white man and a black drug dealer .
After the incident , Dymond was hospitalized and suffered black eyes as well as throat and ear drum injuries .
I guess the silly family expected an apology from the police .
Like I said , silly .
Instead , here 's what happened .
Three weeks later , according to the lawsuit , police went to Dymond 's school , where she was an honor student , and arrested her for assaulting a public servant .
Griffin says the allegations stem from when Dymond fought back against the three men who were trying to take her from her home .
The case went to trial , but the judge declared it a mistrial on the first day , says Griffin .
The new trial is set for February .
UPDATE : This case was filed on 22nd August 2008 , and the alleged attacked occurred in August 2006 , according to this court document .
Here is the Courthouse News article .
Here 's the filing in the Texas Southern District Court .
I emailed Radley Balko about the apparent age discrepancy that some commentator have brought up .
On a couple of social networking pages , the girls says she 's 17 , which would have made her 15 in 2006 , not 12 , as the article indicates .
Radley says :
My guess would be that she exaggerated her age on her profile for those pages ( as teen girls will do ) .
This track results page puts her birth year at 1993 .
If her birthday comes later than August , she 'd have been 12 when the incident took place .
The vital records file for Galveston country show that Dymond Milburn was 12 years old when the police allegedly beat her .
Radley Balko posted an update clearing some misconceptions about the story here .

It Rice Pudding meets all the criteria of a comfort food .
That is , it evokes feelings of nostalgia , it is simple to make , uses the most basic of ingredients ( milk , rice , and sugar ) , and tastes good .
Looking back to Roman times , Alan Davidson in ' The Oxford Companion to Food ' tells us that rice puddings were not eaten daily but were considered a medicine to be used as a cure for upset stomachs .
Interestingly enough , although sweetened milk is the basis for all rice pudding recipes , country and culture does influence what type of milk was ( is ) used and also what spices ( nutmeg , mace , and cinnamon ) and flavorings ( such as rose water , vanilla , orange and lemon peel ) are added to the pudding .
Related Recipes You May Like Banana Pudding Butterscotch Pudding Chocolate Pudding Tapioca Pudding Lemon Sponge Pudding Bread Pudding Rice Pudding :
In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan combine the milk , rice , and salt .
Place saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil .
Reduce the heat to medium to medium - low and simmer until the rice is tender ( about 25 minutes ) .
Stir the milk mixture frequently using a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan .
When the rice is tender ( al dente ) remove from heat and add the sugar , vanilla extract , and ground cinnamon .
Return to heat and cook until the rice pudding thickens , about 5 to 10 minutes .
Remove from heat and add the raisins .
Spoon the pudding into your serving bowls and cover with plastic wrap .
If you want a film or skin on the puddings , allow them to cool before covering with plastic wrap .
Refrigerate until serving time , about 1 to 2 hours .
If desired , garnish with lightly sweetened whipped cream .
Makes 2 to 3 servings .
Note : Can double the recipe for 4 to 6 servings .

Israel has blamed rocket attacks by militants for the blockade The UK - based aid agency Oxfam has warned of catastrophe for Gaza and nearby areas of Israel if a truce agreed last June is not maintained .
Oxfam called on world leaders to do everything they could to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza and urged Israel to resume supplies without delay .
Israel has shut border crossings in response to rocket attacks from Palestinian militants in Gaza .
Earlier Israel fired missiles at targets in northern Gaza .
Two Palestinian militants were injured in the attacks , while one Israeli was injured in militant attacks on the town of Sderot .
Palestinian rockets also hit near the Israeli town of Ashkelon , 15 km ( nine miles ) from Gaza .
No injuries were reported .
' Peace endangered '
Oxfam said both sides would suffer if fighting continued .
" If Israelis and Palestinians alike do n't exert every effort now to maintain the truce which has held since last June , the result could be catastrophic for civilians both in Gaza and in nearby Israeli towns , " the agency 's executive director , Jeremy Hobbs , said in a statement .
Gaza shut to fuel and journalists Guide : Gaza blockade
He said Gazans had been routinely denied unhindered access to fuel , medicines and essential goods for the last year - and - a - half .
" Failure of the international community to act decisively will only exacerbate human suffering and could further endanger chances for peace , " Mr Hobbs added .
On Thursday , UN officials said aid for 750,000 Gazans would have to be suspended until Saturday at the earliest .
Israel earlier denied entry to a convoy carrying humanitarian supplies .
It has prevented the transfer of all goods into Gaza for nearly a week , blaming continuing rocket attacks by Palestinian militants .
The current round of clashes and rocket fire began on 5 November when Israeli troops entered Gaza to destroy what Israel said was a tunnel dug by militants to abduct its troops .
Hamas responded with a barrage of rockets fired into Israel .
There has been intermittent rocket fire since .
A truce between the two sides declared on 19 June had largely held .
Both sides have accused the other of violating the truce , but maintain that they remain committed to it .

Another strong case for a 3rd Bush term from the McCain team .
Another right wing extremist economist who advises McCain telling everyone that the economy is robust , despite what your lying eyes are telling you .
According to right wing theorist ( and have n’t we had enough of them in the last eight years ? )
Donald Luskin , the “ problem ” is purely political and of course , it ’s Obama ’s fault .
Uh huh .
Whoopee for the Bush / McCain economy .
If this McCain economic adviser thinks the US economy is so strong , why is n’t McCain making this point on the campaign trail ?
You would think that a proud owner of this Bush / McCain economy would want to brag about the impressive numbers , no ?
Do tell , Mr Luskin , do tell .
The icing on the cake by this McCain economic adviser ?
Phil Gramm was right !
That and that we may not be on “ the brink not of recession , but of accelerating prosperity . ”
Please , please , please advise John McCain to preach this message every day .
If Obama is too timid to make a strong case on the economy , perhaps John McCain can contribute and kick start the debate .
In a replicated experiment , scientists discovered the fact that people were very likely to continue administering electric shocks to other people , if they were told to do so by an authoritarian figure .
The first conclusion of this kind belonged to an experiment conducted in 1961 by Professor Stanley Milgram , of Yale University , but since then , it was deemed that such studies had a very damaging effect on the mind of the volunteers and were discontinued , due to ethical reasons .
However , in the new study , researchers from Santa Clara University in California discovered that people were still very prone to torturing others if they knew they could get away with it .
Jerry Burger , the scientist who led the current tests , said in a phone interview to Reuters that the conclusions he and his team came to were “ surprising and disappointing . ”
" When you hear the man scream and say , ' let me out , I can't stand it , ' that is the point when the real stress that people criticized Milgram for kicked in , " said Burger , referring to the fact that no one in the scientific community dared to replicate this type of studies since then .
Volunteers were asked to “ electrocute ” an actor , at various intensities , while the actor “ screamed ” in pain .
Although the maximum allowed limit for the current was 150 volts , the research team found with sadness that some 70 percent of all people who participated were inclined to use even more volts than they were allowed to , if the leader of the study asked them to , although they had no personal reason to do so .
" Although one must be cautious when making the leap from laboratory studies to complex social behaviors such as genocide , understanding the social psychological factors that contribute to people acting in unexpected and unsettling ways is important .
It is not that there is something wrong with the people .
The idea has been somehow there was this characteristic that people had back in the early 1960s that they were somehow more prone to obedience , " Burger concluded .
The other day I took my seven - year - old son Louis to buy some running shoes .
" Pick something with Velcro , " I said , as he trotted off to roam the racks .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
A clerk , hovering nearby , gave me a jaundiced look , " You know we get high school kids in here who have to buy Velcro because they never learned to tie their shoes .
Every year their parents would just buy them Velcro because it was easier than making them learn how to tie laces . "
I stared at him and he went on .
" The other day we had to special order a pair of shoes for this kid's high school graduation because he could n't tie his laces , and he needed a pair of Velcro formal shoes . "
I put the shoes Louis had chosen back on the shelf , and picked out a pair of lace - up running shoes .
It was n't just that I 'd been shamed into compliance by the salesman , but something Jane Jacobs had written about in her last book about the coming dark ages hit home .
The loss of knowledge , she said , once vanished , is so difficult to regain -- even if it 's something as mundane as tying your shoes .
In case you think this episode is an isolated example , the other day I heard a youth worker , whose job it is to help teens at risk , say that almost none of them know how to tie their shoes .
I 'm sure this is n't a causal relationship -- wear Velcro , go to jail -- but it made me think .
What else have we lost , or failed to pass along , to the generation of kids about to inherit an increasingly compromised planet ?
Is this generation heading into a coming dark age with little more than the ability to update their Facebook statuses and watch Youtube , all with laces untied ?
Failing memories
When I talk to my mother , ensconced on her farm in the Kootenays , about people quietly preparing for coming disaster , she says the first thing people in her neighbourhood say is " Well , my freezer is full . "
Then they metaphorically pat themselves on the back for having the forethought to freeze a supply of broccoli and peaches .
" But what happens if the power goes off ? " I ask .
She shrugs and says , " The one thing I 'm worried about is being able to get seeds . "
( In case you did n't know , Monsanto has been quietly buying up heritage seed companies for the past while . )
Then she says , " I 'm thinking about starting a farm school . "
I tell her it's not a bad idea .
In the Vancouver Sun , Meeru Dhalwala recently wrote a column about wanting to start a vegetable garden , but not having even the slightest notion of where to start .
For those of us even just a generation removed from the family farm , already the loss of knowledge is enormous .
I do n't know how to butcher an animal , build a house or make my own soap , although my grandparents certainly did .
To a lesser extent my mother still does .
If I told my son to go outside , start a fire and cook himself some food , he would n't have the very first clue .
While this generation can text - message , download , update and surf online simultaneously , this constant deluge of information is in fact something of a mirage .
Information is not knowledge , nor even close to wisdom .
And it is actually getting harder to learn and remember things .
In The Overflowing Brain , Torkel Klingberg , a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Sweden 's Karolinska Institute writes , " If we do not focus our attention on something , we will not remember it . "
The inability to concentrate in a world of competing bits of information and constant multitasking has led to brains that can no longer keep up .
Suddenly , I see why a podcaster has sought out my mother 's repository of practical knowledge .
" We 're counting on you , old lady , " I tell her .
Is our society ' self aware ' ?
In North America now , less than two per cent of people call themselves farmers and the median age of farmers in Canada is already pushing mid-50s .
What happens when too many people who actually know stuff age and then buy the farm , as they say ?
Which brings me back to the question that has me tied up in shoe knots .
If the lights start to go out sometime in the near future , and the Walmart closes its doors , who would really be useful ?
The answer changes , but basically it comes down to people who know how to do things , farmers , carpenters , doctors , people with a body of knowledge that can be applied directly , physically to the real world .
It certainly wo n't be film critics or bond traders .
In Dark Age Ahead , Jane Jacobs writes that , " A society must be self - aware .
Any culture that jettisons the values that have given it competence , adaptability and identity becomes weak and hollow . "
James Kunstler shares Jacobs ' dim view of the North American future , but he apparently has even less hope for the ability of current population to do the work that needs doing .
Kunstler writes often about the great tattooed , hedonistic , neo -Darwinian masses of Americans , who bear almost no resemblance to the hardworking , industrious people of the 1930s , who , when FDR announced his plans to turn the nation around , basically set to the task at hand .
I keep coming back to Kunstler 's operatic outpourings of fury and despair , maybe because there is a bitter tang of something that is n't even approached in mainstream media .
Kunstler opines that Americans in the 1930s and ' 40s bear little resemblance to the current crop , and if required to roll up their sleeves , and dig ditches , they might not be up to task .
My grandfather came of age in the Great Depression .
His mother died of cancer when he was seven years old , and he basically went to work at the age of 12 .
The same is true of my grandmother , who never made it past Grade 7 because she had to cook meals in the rooming house run by her mother .
Their lives and their stories are unremarkable in some ways , in that they were n't all that unusual .
They were born to work and they spent their entire lives doing just that , farming , day in and out , merely to survive .
They were almost completely self - sufficient , both in food and in skills .
Life without Velcro
Louis , on the other hand , along with all of his Velcro - shod video game playing friends , has been kept safely inside since he was born .
He is probably ill - prepared for the world if it becomes much more harsh .
Am I , then , a failure ?
If your first impulse is always to protect your children , are you actually doing them a disservice ?
If suffering breeds character , does a complete lack of suffering foster utter helplessness ?
This is why the public imagination was seized by the tragic story of 15 - year - old Brandon Crisp , who ran away after a fight with his parents about video games .
How could a young boy die so easily ?
Brandon discovered in the most terrible way that the real world bears little resemblance to a video game .
It gets dark and cold , and if you fall out of a tree , you die .
Every day , while Louis struggles with his laces , wailing that he can't do it and I should do it for him , I say , " You need to learn to do this yourself , you can't depend on anyone to do it for you . "
My own words echo oddly inside my brain , already assuming some larger meaning .
It is as much my responsibility to teach him , as it is his to learn .

Michelle Obama 's fashion savvy may earn her a spot on a future cover of Vogue magazine .
But her political influence has already won over Bellingham , Washington based publishing company Bluewater Productions , which plans to feature the future first lady in the third book of its Female Force comic book series .
The quarterly publication showcases women who are pioneers in modern history .
Michelle Obama joins female forces Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin , whose biographical comic books will be released early next year as part of the series .
Even though Michelle Obama has yet to move into the White House , and Clinton and Palin fell short of their political goals in 2008 , Bluewater 's president , Darren Davis , thinks the three women have forever changed US politics .
" They 've changed the way people look at government , " he said .
" Nobody ever thought there would be a female president .
Nobody ever thought there would be an African - American first lady .
Nobody ever thought there would be a female vice president , aside from Geraldine Ferraro .
( They 've ) really changed society , so in 2012 we really could have a female president . "
The book will follow Michelle Obama from her youth on Chicago 's South Side to her career as a lawyer , through the 2008 presidential campaign and Election Day .
It is scheduled to be released in April 2009 .
Bluewater 's final Female Force book of 2009 will feature Caroline Kennedy , rounding out the political theme .
For 2010 's books , Bluewater is planning on featuring influential woman in the media , like Barbara Walters , Oprah Winfrey and Martha Stewart .
Obama vs McCain campaign ads
posted Saturday October 4th @ 6:33 pm
Not living in the USA I do n't have the pleasure of seeing the TV campaign ads in their natural habitat .
However , from the few that I saw floating about online I got the feeling that the McCain camp were spending an awful lot of time rubbishing their opponent and not a lot talking about their own candidate .
Not only that , I got a very nasty taste in my mouth from all the personal accusations of being unreliable or careless - certainly getting their opinion across at an emotional level but hardly careful , factual critique .
Because I hate to spout off with only a vague opinion for backup , I did some research and watched every ad on the JohnMcCain.com video page .
It took a long time - there are sixty - three of them - but I kept a tally of who the main focus of the ad was .
To achieve this classification a name had to be mentioned more than once rather than just thrown up in passing .
I also carefully considered the real subject of the ad - not always immediately obvious .
For example , an ad that was ostensibly about the economy but included no hard facts and was focussed more on Obama having changed his mind a lot got classified as a " personal " subject , meaning the ad was a personal attack on his general character rather than a serious ad about fiscal policy .
The results were .. interesting .
By far the most popular topic was indeed , and as I suspected , personal .
Whether it was talking up McCain 's war hero credentials or trashing Obama 's lack of experience , 2 out of 5 ads were primarily about character .
That 's not leaving a lot of space for real issues .
Not only that , I found that more ads talked about Obama than did n't , while McCain was discussed roughly 50 % of the time .
Wait a minute ; that means that his campaign is ( marginally , I 'll admit ) more interested in doing down their opponent than in talking up their candidate .
Surreal .
What was really interesting however was doing the same exercise on the Obama website .
I found his ads to be much more watchable , both practically ( the website plays them in sequence rather than forcing you to skip back and forth between the video index and the player pages ) and aesthetically , despite there being more - 74 in total .
Obama himself expounds the details of his plans much more often than McCain and there was more of a sense of purpose when the ads were positive .
However , what surprised me - and will surprise many , I 'll wager - is that the proportion of ads that spent at least some time rubbishing McCain was much higher than for his opponent 's ads .
Not only that , the proportion of ads talking purely about character rather than specifics was roughly the same .
Some of Obama 's ads are fashioned after classical Greek debate ; they present one argument and then tear it down with their response .
However , purely negative ads are just as commonplace as they are in McCain 's playlist .
Additionally , in " Low Road Express " there is a really weird juxtaposition : the first half denigrates McCain 's personal judgment and then counters with the specifics of Obama 's energy policy .
Which does n't really make a lot of sense .
I was very interested to see that the main accusation from each of them was borne out by their opponent 's ad topic choices .
Obama 's tax policy , so viciously and repetitively attacked by McCain , seems strangely under - represented while McCain , so mercilessly rubbished by the Dems on the economy , chooses to go no closer to broad economics than condemning Wall Street .
Good grief ; does that mean that there might be some truth wrapped up in all this mud ?!
Although both were flawed I got a much nastier overall feel from the McCain videos .
Despite the statistic I chose to measure coming out the opposite way to my expectations , the insults from the Republican camp feel more strained , more carefully worded , as if they are skating very close to the edge of libel .
The Democrats ' mudslinging comes across more like the weary naysaying of a stressed parent .
What sealed my loss of faith in the GOP tactic was the ridiculous " Where is Obama ? " , a documentary style ad which included very false feeling interviews , supposedly with Latinos in Illinois .
" What has Obama done for Latinos ? " they were asked .
Well , maybe Latinos in Illinois do n't need to be singled out for Barack 's assistance , did you think about that ?
It 's a leading , stupid question without some more context .
At the end of a hard day 's biased reporting our presenter says , " well , here we are back where we started .
We worked our tails off , we 're tired , I bet you are .. we did n't find Obama though ! "
Evidently they did n't find the book on continuity at film school either .
They are in the same place , in the same clothes .. and sun is in precisely the same position .
Mouse over to see the Obama version of each graph .

OVER THE PAST few months , Americans have been hearing the word " depression " with unfamiliar and alarming regularity .
The financial crisis tearing through Wall Street is routinely described as the worst since the Great Depression , and the recession into which we are sinking looks deep enough , financial commentators warn , that a few poor policy decisions could put us in a depression of our own .
It 's a frightening possibility , but also in many ways an abstraction .
The country has gone so long without a depression that it's hard to know what it would be like to live through one .
Most of us , of course , think we know what a depression looks like .
Open a history book and the images will be familiar : mobs at banks and lines at soup kitchens , stockbrokers in suits selling apples on the street , families piled with all their belongings into jalopies .
Families scrimp on coffee and flour and sugar , rinsing off tinfoil to reuse it and re-mending their pants and dresses .
A desperate government mobilizes legions of the unemployed to build bridges and airports , to blaze trails in national forests , to put on traveling plays and paint social - realist murals .
Today , however , whatever a depression would look like , that 's not it .
We are separated from the 1930s by decades of profound economic , technological , and political change , and a modern landscape of scarcity would reflect that .
What , then , would we see instead ?
And how would we even know a depression had started ?
It 's not a topic that professional observers of the economy study much .
And there 's no single answer , because there 's no one way a depression might unfold .
But it 's nonetheless an important question to consider - there 's no way to make informed decisions about the present without understanding , in some detail , the worst - case scenario about the future .
By looking at what we know about how society and commerce would slow down , and how people respond , it 's possible to envision what we might face .
Unlike the 1930s , when food and clothing were far more expensive , today we spend much of our money on healthcare , child care , and education , and we'd see uncomfortable changes in those parts of our lives .
The lines would n't be outside soup kitchens but at emergency rooms , and rather than itinerant farmers we could see waves of laid - off office workers leaving homes to foreclosure and heading for areas of the country where there 's more work - or just a relative with a free room over the garage .
Already hollowed - out manufacturing cities could be all but deserted , and suburban neighborhoods left checkerboarded , with abandoned houses next to overcrowded ones .
And above all , a depression circa 2009 might be a less visible and more isolating experience .
With the diminishing price of televisions and the proliferation of channels , it 's getting easier and easier to kill time alone , and free time is one thing a 21st - century depression would create in abundance .
Instead of dusty farm families , the icon of a modern - day depression might be something as subtle as the flickering glow of millions of televisions glimpsed through living room windows , as the nation 's unemployed sit at home filling their days with the cheapest form of distraction available .
The odds are , most economists say , we will yet avoid a full - blown depression - the world 's policy makers , they argue , have learned enough not to repeat the mistakes of the 1930s .
Still , in a country that has known little but economic growth for 50 years , it matters to think about what life would look like without it .
. . .
There is , in fact , no agreed - upon definition of what a depression is .
Economists are unanimous that the Great Depression was the worst economic downturn the industrial world has ever seen , and that we have n't had a depression since , but beyond that there is not a consensus .
Recessions have an official definition from the National Bureau of Economic Research , but the bureau pointedly declines to define a depression .
What sets a depression apart , most economists would agree , are duration and the scale of joblessness .
To be worthy of the name , a depression needs to be more than a few years long - far longer than the eight - month average of our recent recessions - and it needs to put a lot of people out of work .
The Great Depression lasted a decade by some measures , and at its worst , one in four American workers was out of a job .
( By comparison , unemployment now is at a 14 - year high of 6.5 percent . )
In a modern depression , the swelling ranks of the unemployed would likely change the landscape of the country , uprooting people who would rather stay where they are and trapping people who want to move .
In the 1930s , this took the visible form of waves of displaced tenant farmers washing into California , but it also had another , subtler effect : it froze the movement of the middle class .
The suburbanization that was to define the post - World - War - II years had in fact started in the 1920s , only to be brought sharply to a halt when the economy collapsed .
Today , a depression could reverse that process altogether .
In a deep and sustained downturn , home prices would likely sink further and not rise , dimming the appeal of homeownership , a large part of suburbia 's draw .
Renting an apartment - perhaps in a city , where commuting costs are lower - might be more tempting .
And although city crime might increase , the sense of safety that attracted city - dwellers to the suburbs might suffer , too , in a downturn .
Many suburban areas have already seen upticks in crime in recent years , which would only get worse as tax - poor towns spent less money on policing and public services .
" You could have a sort of desurburbanization phenomenon , " suggests Michael Bernstein , a historian of the Depression and the provost of Tulane University .
The migrations kicked off by a depression would n't be in one direction , but a tangle of demographic crosscurrents : young families moving back to their hometowns to live with the grandparents when they can no longer afford to live on their own , parents moving in with their adult children when their postretirement fixed incomes can no longer support them .
Some parts of the country , especially the Rust Belt , could see a wholesale depopulation as the last remnants of the American heavy - manufacturing base die out .
" There will be some cities like Detroit that in a real depression could just become ghost towns , " says Jeffrey Frankel , a Harvard economist and member of the National Bureau of Economic Research committee that declares recessions .
( Frankel does not , he emphasizes , think we are headed for a depression . ) . . .
At the household level , the look of want is different today than during the last prolonged downturn .
The government helps the unemployed and the poor with programs that did n't exist when the Great Depression hit - unemployment insurance , Medicaid , food stamps , Social Security for seniors .
Beyond that , two of the basics of existence - food and clothing - are a lot cheaper today , thanks to industrial agriculture and overseas labor .
The average middle - class man in the late 1920s , according to the writer and cultural critic Virginia Postrel , could afford just six outfits , and his wife nine - by comparison , the average woman today has seven pairs of jeans alone .
So we 're less likely to see one of the iconic images of the Great Depression : Formerly middle - class workers in threadbare clothes lining up for free food .
If we look closely , however , we might see more former lawyers wearing knockoffs , doing their back - to - school shopping at Target or Wal - Mart rather than Banana Republic and Abercrombie & Fitch .
Lean times might kill off much of the taboo around buying hand - me - downs , and with modern distribution networks - and a push from the reduce - reuse - recycle mind - set of environmentalism - we might see the development of nationwide used - clothing chains .
In general , novelty would lose some of its luster .
It 's not simply that we'd buy less , we 'd look for different qualities in what we buy .
New technology would grow less seductive , basic reliability more important .
We 'd see more products like Nextel phones and the Panasonic Toughbook laptop , which trade on their sturdiness , and fewer like the iPhone - beautiful , cleverly designed , but not known for durability .
The neighborhood appliance shop could reappear in a new form - unlicensed , with hacked cellphones and rebuilt computers .
And while very few would starve , a depression would change how we eat .
Food costs remain far below what they were for a family in the 1920s and 1930s , but they have been rising in recent years , and many people already on the edge of poverty would be unable to feed themselves on their own in a harsh economic climate - soup kitchens are already seeing an uptick in attendance .
At the high end of the market , specialty and organic foods - which drove the success of chains like Whole Foods - would seem pointlessly expensive ; the booming organic food movement could suffer as people start to see specially grown produce as more of a luxury than a moral choice .
New England 's surviving farmers would be particularly hard - hit , as demand for their seasonal , relatively high - cost products dried up .
According to Marion Nestle , a food and public health professor at New York University , people low on cash and with more time on their hands will cook more rather than go out .
They may also , Nestle suggests , try their hands at growing and even raising more of their own food , if they have any way of doing so .
Among the green lawns of suburbia , kitchen gardens would spring up .
And it might go well beyond just growing your own tomatoes : early last month , the English bookstore chain Waterstone 's reported a 200 percent increase in the sales of books on keeping chickens .
At the same time , the cheapest option for many is decidedly less rustic : meals like packaged macaroni and cheese and drive - through fast food .
And we 're likely to see a move in that direction , as well , toward cheaper , easier calories .
If so , lean times could have the odd effect of making the population fatter , as more Americans eat like today 's poor .
. . .
To understand where a depression would hit hardest , however , look at the biggest - ticket items on people 's budgets .
Housing , health insurance , transportation , and child care are the top expenses for American families , according to Elizabeth Warren , a bankruptcy law specialist at Harvard Law School ; along with taxes , these take up two - thirds of income , on average .
And when those are squeezed , that could mean everything from more crowded subways to a proliferation of cheap , unlicensed day - care centers .
Health insurance premiums have risen to onerous levels in recent years , and in a long period of unemployment - or underemployment - they would quickly become unmanageable for many people .
Dropping health insurance would be an immediate way for families to save hundreds of dollars per month .
People without health insurance tend to skip routine dental and medical checkups , and instead deal with health problems only when they become acute - meaning they get their healthcare through hospital emergency rooms .
That means even longer waits at ERs , which are even now overtaxed in many places , and a growing financial drain on hospitals that already struggle to pay for the care they give uninsured people .
And if , as is likely , this coincided with cuts in money for hospitals coming from cash - strapped state and local governments , there 's a very real possibility that many hospitals would have to close , only further increasing the burden on those that remain open .
In their place people could rely more on federally - funded health centers , or the growing number of drugstore clinics , like the MinuteClinics in CVS branches , for vaccines , physicals , strep throat tests , and other basic medical care .
And as the costs of traditional medicine climbed out reach for families , the appeal of alternative medicine would in all likelihood grow .

Hannah Foster was murdered after her 999 call was judged to be accidental and cut off .
But how do police decide if an emergency call is a misdial or a desperate last plea for help ?
The number 999 is a lifeline for those in distress .
Probably every adult knows its purpose and , when faced with an emergency , even toddlers have been able to dial these crucial three digits .
But , as the case of murdered teenager Hannah Foster demonstrates , there are times when emergency calls can be cut off by the operator at the other end .
Hannah Foster 's call to the emergency services was cut off
When Hannah was abducted in March 2003 , she was quick - witted enough to surreptitiously make a 999 call on her mobile .
Unable to speak into the phone , she nevertheless hoped the operator would become suspicious of the conversation she was having with her abductor , Maninder Pal Singh Kohli .
Unfortunately , Hannah 's attempts failed to navigate a call handling system called Silent Solutions , which deals with silent calls made to the 999 number , and she was cut off moments later .
Kohli went on to rape and murder her , and has now been jailed for life following a trial at Winchester Crown Court .
Silent plea Accidental 999 calls happen all the time , but how do operators know when a silent call can actually be a real call for help ?
BT receives 30 million emergency calls a year - either to 999 or 112 , the European emergency services number , which works in all European Union countries .
There are strict procedures for handling such calls , set out in a code of practice between telecoms operators and the emergency services .
Calls made to these numbers usually result in an emergency authority ( EA ) - fire , police , ambulance - request being made , where someone asks the operator for assistance .
HISTORY OF 999 999 is world 's oldest emergency call service Launched in 1937 after five women died in London surgery fire Initially red lamp turned on and klaxon siren went off to alert operators went call came in 999 chosen over 111 for technical reasons - telegraph wires rubbed together in wind transmitted equivalent of 111 call First 999 mobile call made in 1986
Man found guilty of Hannah murder
But several million calls a year do not follow this pattern , and the emergency number is dialled but no - one actually speaks to make a request .
This is what happened in Hannah 's case .
The code of practice says in the " overwhelming majority of cases " these calls are customer misdials , such as a phone keypad activated in a bag or pocket , or even children playing .
But it acknowledges " there is always a possibility of it being a genuine caller who cannot speak " .
It also says " very large numbers " of accidental 999/112 calls are received from mobile phones .
In 2001 the Metropolitan Police introduced a country - wide system called Silent Solutions for dealing with the growing number of silent accidental 999 calls .
When a call is made , operators from police forces around the UK attempt to obtain a response by asking a series of questions .
For example , they might ask " which service is required ? " and " if you cannot speak but need help please tap the handset screen " .
Background voices
But when nothing apart from general noise can be heard , and there is no speech , it is thought there is a " negligible chance " of the call being genuine .
The operator can then end the call .
Where there is no response but there are background voices , the code of practice says the operator cannot decide whether an Emergency Authority request is needed from the police .
Most silent accidental 999 calls contain background noise , which is usually very difficult to hear or understand
Metropolitan police spokesman
In cases such as these , the call is then connected to an automated police voice response system at the Met 's Central Communication Command , which asks the caller to press five twice if help is required .
If 5 - 5 is pressed , an immediate connection with the police is made .
And in any cases where suspicious noises are heard , the operator can override all these procedures and simply connect the call directly to a police emergency authority control room .
" Most silent accidental 999 calls contain background noise , which is usually very difficult to hear or understand , " says a spokesman for the Met .
" It was only after Hannah 's 999 call was forensically examined during the subsequent investigation when the audio had been expertly enhanced that it was possible to capture the voice of her abductor and the conversation they had . "
Other cases Silent calls are now common .
Between July 2001 , when the Silent Solutions system was introduced , and September 2008 , there have been more than 40 million such calls - averaging about 5.5 million a year .
The overwhelming majority of these are unintended 999 calls , says a Met spokesman .
SILENT CALLS 5.5 m silent 999 calls a year 47,000 of those press ' 55 ' to indicate help needed Clear suspicious noise also means call can be routed to police " Since 2004 , on average each year , we have received about 47,000 silent calls during which the caller pressed ' 55 ' and therefore indicated they needed an emergency service , which means that only about 0.9 % of the silent calls we receive are intentional . "
Yet Hannah 's tragic case is not a one - off .
In 2005 Farah Noor Adams was raped and murdered in Glasgow .
She had made a number of silent calls when she spotted she was being stalked by her eventual killer .
But they too were cut off by operators when she failed to respond .
But there are occasions where silent calls do work .
One woman who was attacked at her home in Kensington , London , managed to make a silent 999 call .
This led to the police tracing her call and visiting her home , where they captured her assailant .
He was eventually convicted in 1991 of rape , possession of a firearm and attempted murder .
And emergency services in some parts of the country now respond to texts sent to 80999 .
This allows messages to be sent directly to the police control room .
The controller then calls for assistance as required from any of the emergency services .
The 80999 number is currently used in the South West , in Hampshire , the Isle of Wight , Dorset , Wiltshire , Avon and Somerset and Devon and Cornwall , and can be used at any time .
However , this is provided as a specific access service for people who cannot use voice telephony , and is not considered as an additional service for general contact .
Several other police forces already run emergency text services , but they require people to register their details and use a standard 11 - digit mobile number .
The Home Office plans to introduce a National Emergency Text number , which will eventually replace these systems .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I appreciate that it 's difficult to screen accidental 999 calls , but why is the practice of dialling 80999 not nationwide already ?
I too am a mum to a beautiful , caring 17 - year - old daughter .
I constantly nag her to carry her mobile for her own safety and keep it charged and in credit .
Please bring in the National Emergency Text number as soon as possible .
Deb , Rainham , Kent I understand the problems of trying to weed out the very few genuine calls from the many accidental calls .
However , in Farah 's case , she made a number of silent calls to try and get help .
Could n't a computer system monitor the number of silent calls and if several are made in succession from the same number , police could investigate ?
These could still be accidental but it would be less likely .
Helen , Durham I worked taking 999 calls for two years in Glasgow .
When I read about the hoax calls made by international celebrities , my first thought was " what an example " .
The emergency services have enough to deal with without celebrities turning the hoax call into a national pastime .
The more calls dealt with by the emergency services , the more difficult it is to pinpoint " THE " call .
I can only say the dedication and effort made by these call centres to ensure valid calls are answered is exceptional and needs more exposure .
Jerry McBride , Saigon , Vietnam
Why not just have a separate number that means " I 'm in trouble but cannot speak ? "
Surely the cost of creating and routing another number , and flagging the difference to an operator on screen would be a tiny percentage of the annual budget for running the emergency services .
Will Shaw , Barnsley
So why has n't it been publicised that we need to press 999 and then 55 if we are in that sort of dangerous situation ?
Not rocket science , surely .
Jacqui , London
What you do n't mention is what to do in a situation where there is an emergency and the person can't talk or even obviously use the phone .
Dial 999 wait three seconds then press 55 ?
Wait longer to press 55 ?
Do the emergency services monitor repeat silent calls , such as the one from Ms Adams ?
Nadine Hengen , Christchurch
Can this not be taught in schools , so that others in a dangerous situation where they are frightened to speak or bring the phone out of their pocket or whatever , can add the 55 to the number and so get an immediate connection to help .
Whoever can do this - please !
Sarah , Wales
The emergency services cannot afford to take the chance that help is not really needed .
Because of this the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has a policy of a mandatory response to any incomplete call or interrupted one , to a police control room .
That one dialling may be the only chance a victim of crime or life - threatening situation has to desperately call for help .
Not checking it out is a NON OPTION , in my experience and opinion ...
( I have over 30 years experience in the emergency services in four different countries as a responder . )
Pat van der Ver , Wallasey , Merseyside I 'm disgusted .
I was taught at school , by visiting police , that a silent 999 call would be treated as a police matter and they would be dispatched immediately .
This has changed but would anyone in that situation be aware of this ?
The 999 service is not something to be treated with the same disdain as commercial operators treat their customer support services , and yet this " 55 " trick seems to come straight from the same hymn book .
Basically , it 's cheaper .
I 'm guessing the silent call that worked ( back in 1991 ) was before they introduced this Silent Solutions nonsense .
Still , with about 100,000 silent 999 calls per day , a better solution is not clear .
Eddie , Oswestry
Would the use of an emergency number which does n't consist of the same three numbers not reduce the number of " dialled by accident in your bag / pocket " calls ?
Sue , London I am not at all surprised at the number of silent calls , since even locked keypads still allow 999 emergency dialling - this is deliberately DESIGNED IN to mobile phones .
So even phones with locked keypads may dial emergency services if buttons are accidentally pressed - eg in a pocket .
Draigalban , Edinburgh , Scotland
As it appears that the majority of these calls are from mobile phones , I suggest the following to either eradicate the cause , or prevent the call from going through or being cancelled once activated .
Somewhere on the mobile a lock button can be fitted that can only be released by an emergency service officer .
The button is pressed and the emergency number dialled .
The button is released .
That number will now remain open so it can be traced .
The line will remain operative until the call is cancelled by an official in attendance .
Effectively it can not be disconnected by anyone else .
If an operator tries to disconnect , the emergency number will repeat call .
This should dramatically reduce the number of accidental calls - it may even save a life .
Tony Ive , Petersfield , UK
If you are trying to make a surreptitious emergency call , it is unlikely that you will be able to confirm your situation .
Could n't mobiles have a panic button with a suitable cover ?
To prevent misuse , triggering the alarm could then bar all numbers but 999 and a service number to call off the alarm being dialled .
Neil Turton , Lancaster , England I had always hoped if I needed it , I could do what Hannah did .
In fact my previous handset had an option to call 999 automatically if you played with a fixed pattern of buttons in your pocket .
So what are we meant to do ?
Texting seems an answer , but can the police quickly trace where the caller is if needed ?
Hugh , London
Home alarm systems have a silent call to police , why not add a digit to alert emergency services that this is a silent call ?
Candace , New Jersey , US
There should be enhanced hearing on behalf of the emergency services .

Fringe is so subtle and so unexpected , it ’s almost possible to walk past it without fully apprehending it .
An apron of pale blond horsehair sewn onto a band of white cotton , it hangs in the archway of an old stone bridge on Stanley Park Drive , at the foot of Ravine Trail in Stanley Park .
As Fringe flutters in the breeze , catching the thin autumnal light , Vancouver artist Shirley Wiebe talks to the Straight about its inception , its making , and the ways it interacts with its environment .
“ I chose an architectural site rather than a purely idyllic setting , ” she says .
“ The bridge spans Beaver Lake Creek . ”
¦It ’s a kind of shelter and passageway for wildlife and humans . ”
Then she adds , “ It is the underside — the shelter side — that I ’m drawn to for this installation . ”
Wiebe is one of six artists , including Tania Willard , Davide Pan , T’Uy ’Tanat Cease Wyss , John Hemsworth , and Peter von Tiesenhausen , chosen to participate in the Stanley Park Environmental Art Project .
( Pan and Wyss are working as a team , as are Hemsworth and von Tiesenhausen . )
A partnership of the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation , the Stanley Park Ecology Society , and the Community Arts Council of Vancouver , it evolved out of concern over the massive devastation that occurred when hurricane - force winds hit the city ’s biggest park in December 2006 .
The artists are mandated to create ephemeral and semi-permanent installations during their park residencies , using natural materials that will eventually decompose and disappear into their surroundings .
Their work , if successful , will honour the place , stimulate curiosity and conversation among passersby , and expand community understanding of our complicated relationship with the natural world .
Wiebe ’s Fringe speaks not so much to the big blow - down as to the piece ’s location between nature and culture , past and present , order and disorder .
“ My concept for the residency was to explore the social and physical relationships that take place in this forest within a city , and how they continue to shape the park , ” she explains .
Nearby , a small squirrel scrabbles around on a log leaning over the stream .
Insects skate across the water ’s surface and unseen birds chirp and chitter in the surrounding foliage .
At the same time , cars thrum on the Park Drive overpass and noise resounds from the dockyards across Burrard Inlet .
Hikers walk by , tourists take pictures , and a team of enthusiastic teenagers swarm over the place picking up litter .
“ The day before I installed the piece , the bridge had been tagged [ with graffiti ] , ” Wiebe recalls .
“ It made me realize that there are people here at all times of the day and night . ”
Wiebe ’s chosen material , horsehair , alludes to the horses that are stabled in the park : the broad draught animals that haul tourist carriages around the paved roadways and the sleek creatures ridden by Vancouver police officers patrolling the park ’s trails .
“ When I went to the stables , the groomers talked about how birds will perch on the backs of horses and pluck the hair out for their nests , ” Wiebe says .
“ I wondered if another species might try to appropriate hair out of this piece . ”
She adds that she likes horsehair for both its tactile and symbolic qualities .
“ I work from a premise that materials are laden with meaning .
But , like in dreams , association is embedded within layers of personal experience . ”
Personal experience also informs her work - in - progress , a temporary installation of soft , biomorphic sculptures in the old polar - bear pit in the former Stanley Park zoo .
Walking to that overgrown spot , in an area otherwise highly groomed and cultivated , Wiebe remembers visiting the park as a child , when her family was on holiday from their rural Saskatchewan home .
“ I was interested in the idea of how we like to observe something at a safe distance , ” she says , musing on the shift in public attitudes towards animals in captivity .
She was also struck by the dramatic design of the pit .
“ It ’s like a cubist theatre , ” she observes .
“ I want to create a kind of dynamic with these different forms and how they appear to be relating to each other in this space , ” she says .
“ I see it as a way of honouring the bears that were here , and also recontextualizing this history . ”
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Sunday expressed hope that the California Supreme Court would overturn Proposition 8 , the ballot initiative that outlawed same - sex marriage .
He also predicted that the 18,000 gay and lesbian couples who have already wed would not see their marriages nullified by the initiative .
“ It ’s unfortunate , obviously , but it ’s not the end , ” Schwarzenegger said in an interview Sunday on CNN .
“ I think that we will again maybe undo that , if the court is willing to do that , and then move forward from there and again lead in that area . ”
With his favorable comments toward gay marriage , the governor ’s thinking appears to have evolved on the issue .
In past statements , he has said he believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman and has rejected legislation authorizing same - sex marriage .
Yet he has also said he would not care if same - sex marriage were legal , saying he believed that such an important societal issue should be determined by the voters or the courts .

Schwarzenegger publicly opposed Proposition 8 , which amends the state Constitution to declare that “ only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . ”
On Sunday , he urged backers of gay marriage to follow the lesson he learned as a bodybuilder trying to lift weights that were too heavy for him at first .
“ I learned that you should never ever give up .
. . .
They should never give up .
They should be on it and on it until they get it done . ”
The governor ’s position on the fate of the existing same - sex marriages aligns him with California Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , who has said he believes that the state Supreme Court will uphold the existing marriages as valid .
The 14 - word constitutional amendment does not state explicitly that it would nullify same - sex marriages performed before the Nov. 4 election , although proponents say it will .
Legal experts differ on this point .

Schwarzenegger ’s comments came as protesters took to the streets for a fifth day in a row , sometimes marching to Catholic and Mormon churches that supported passage of the ballot measure .
Hundreds of Proposition 8 protesters in Orange County gathered down the hill from Saddleback Church in Lake Forest as several thousand congregants attended services inside the sprawling religious campus .
Martijn Hostetler , 30 , of West Hollywood held a sign that read “ Purpose Driven Hate , ” a dig at the church ’s celebrity Pastor Rick Warren , author of the bestseller “ The Purpose - Driven Life , ” who backed the ballot measure .
“ I do n’t think Jesus would approve of a gay - marriage ban , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think God discriminates . ”
While demonstrators received supportive honks from motorists , many members of the mega - church said they had little sympathy for the protesters because the matter had already been settled by voters .

“ We ’re a democracy and our strength is that the majority wins the vote , ” said John Kirkpatrick , a church member .
Sherrie Derriko , a longtime Saddleback Church member and hair salon owner from Mission Viejo , said she was bothered that protesters had targeted houses of worship .
As she drove by , she rolled down her window to offer some advice .
“ Read the Bible .
God made man and woman , and that ’s what a marriage is , ” she called from inside her SUV .
Derriko recounted the incident after attending services .
“ When we saw them out there , we thought , ‘ Why are they not over this ?
Do they think they ’re going to change anything , or are they just stirring up trouble at our church ? ’ ”

But for Sally “ Sal ” Landers , 52 , a Saddleback Church member from Lake Forest , her participation in the protest was a deeply personal matter .
Landers and her female partner of three years plan to marry and adopt children .
When she received an e-mail from Warren urging a “ yes ” vote on Proposition 8 , she said , “ I felt like I was kicked in the stomach by someone who loves unconditionally . ”
So on Sunday , Landers joined the protesters outside the church rather than the parishioners inside .
“ We really love him and respect his opinion , ” Landers said of Warren .
“ I need some reassurance that I ’m welcome here as a gay American citizen . ”
Other protests were staged outside Mormon temples or churches in Oakland , Yucca Valley and other cities .
In downtown Los Angeles , 150 protesters congregated in front of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels , chanting , among other things , “ What would Jesus say ? ”
The crowd was joined later in the day by protesters who marched from Lincoln Park on the city ’s Eastside .
Advertisement
Some churches , to be sure , assailed Proposition 8 as discriminatory .
“ We will continue to bless same - sex unions here until we can legally celebrate same - sex unions again , ” the Rev. Ed Bacon told 1,000 congregants during Sunday services at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena , which has blessed same - sex unions for 16 years .
After the service , Bacon and other clergy members held a news conference on the church steps .
They were surrounded by gay and lesbian couples , some standing with young children .
“ I know these couples .
I know their relationships , ” Bacon said , addressing a phalanx of television cameras .
“ They should be celebrated , rather than disparaged .
. . .
In the eyes of God , these people are married . ”

The NSW Government will introduce a congestion toll on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Harbour Tunnel in an Australian first .
Different charges will apply at different times of the day , with the toll rising to $ 4 during peak periods .
The changes will take effect " by February " .
In a mini - budget aimed clearly by a Premier without a driver 's licence at the problem of urban congestion , the Government has also announced a major increase in CBD parking levies in a bid to discourage people from driving into the city .
Chapter Twenty - seven
PANDORA'S BOX AND THE GREAT TEMPTATION
Some will say that the government would not do the kinds of things described in these pages .
The compilers of this material wish this were the case .
However , American history is littered with the carcasses of bad science and ill - conceived technologies .
Each year , in fact each month , it seems the citizens of all of the countries of the world are introduced to new scandals of military , " intelligence " and governmental abuses .
The temptation , the compulsion , and the addiction for more power and control over people are the first evils released from the Pandora 's Box of modern gadgetry .
The authors are not against technological advancement but , rather , hope science can be pursued in the open light of day and can lead toward improved human conditions .
" Political strategists are tempted to exploit research on the brain and human behavior .
Geophysicist Gordon J. FMacDonald - specialist in problems of warfare - says accurately - timed , artificially - excited electronic strokes ' could lead to a pattern of oscillations that produce relatively high power levels over certain regions of the earth ...
In this way , one could develop a system that would seriously impair the brain performance of very large populations in selected regions over an extended period '... No matter how deeply disturbing the thought of using the environment to manipulate behavior for national advantages to some , the technology permitting such use will very probably develop within the next few decades .
" 340 This statement was made over twenty - five years ago , and was a precursor for what became reality in 1995 .
In 1966 , MacDonald was a member of the President 's Science Advisory Committee and later a member of the President 's Council on Environmental Quality .
He published papers on the use of environmental control technologies for military purposes .
The most profound comment he made as a geophysicist was , " The key to geophysical warfare is the identification of environmental instabilities to which the addition of a small amount of energy would release vastly greater amounts of energy .
" 341 While yesterday 's geophysicists predicted today 's advances , the HAARP program managers are delivering on the vision .
The geophysicists recognized that adding energy to the environmental soup could have large effects .
What was not considered is the fact that humanity has already added substantial amounts of electromagnetic energy into our environment without understanding what might constitute critical mass .
The questions come ...
Have these additions been without effect , or is there a cumulative amount beyond which irreparable damage can be done ?
Is HAARP another step in a journey from which we cannot turn back ?
Are we about to embark on another energy experiment which unleashes another set of demons from Pandora 's box ?
340 Between Two Ages : America 's Role in the Technotronic Era , Zbigniew Brzezinski , Penguin Books , Mass .
1976 341 The Cooling , by Lowell Ponte , 1976 , pges .
166-169 .
As early as 1970 , Zbigniew Brzezinski , later National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter , predicted a " more controlled and directed society " would gradually appear , linked to technology .
This society would be dominated by an elite group which impresses voters by allegedly superior scientific know - how .
" Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values , this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society under close surveillance and control .
Technical and scientific momentum would then feed on the situation it exploits " 342 , Brzezinski predicted .
His forecasts proved accurate beyond what most people would have expected .
Today , a number of new tools for the " elite " are emerging , and the temptation to use them increases steadily .
The policies to permit use are already in place .
We are at the door to our " brave new world " .
How would the United States be changed , bit by bit , into the predicted highly controlled technosociety ?
Among the " steppingstones " Brzezinski expected were persisting social crises and use of the mass media to gain the public 's confidence .
343
Brzezinski apparently saw that both conservatives and " the doctrinaire left " might be inclined to justify heavy handed tactics .
The left could say that it serves progress , and the conservatives , " preoccupied with public order and fascinated by modern gadgetry , would be tempted to use the new techniques as a response to unrest , since they would fail to recognize that social control is not the only way to deal with rapid social change .
" 344 Even today , February 25 , 1995 , as we write these words , NBC Nightly News is announcing the widespread domestic surveillance of Americans and others , through the CIA 's and NSA 's monitoring and intrusion into the global Internet .
When does the proliferation of power end and a new compact with freedom begin ?
Brzezinski's vision , expressed in his book 25 years ago , was a prophetic view of the state of the world .
It predicted a direction which time has proven correct , in terms of outcome .
Those predictions yet to be realized are profound , and could lead to a very different and less desirable world .
The idea that science is the hammer of politicians is a reality which people can not ignore .
Government should consider a shift - from war to peace - for the use of these very advanced research efforts .
The possibilities of these innovations offer all people an opportunity to excel in health and intelligence .
All men and women should press for opening these technologies to positive and constructive , rather than destructive , purposes .
342 Between Two Ages : America 's Role in the Technetronic Era. Zbigniew Brzezinski , Penguin Books , Mass .
1976 ,
343 Ibid. 344 Ibid .
What propels these advances into the wrong directions ' ?
It is the tax dollars of unwitting Americans .
The system which can promote the use of science , for the true advancement of mankind , is an open system with a focus on individual opportunities for self actualization .
Systems which promote secrecy by military and intelligence leaders are fundamentally wrong .
They are too likely to be misused , which has been amply demonstrated in govern - mental systems .
Government flows from the people , and should be a full reflection of the value and belief systems of people , and not some shadow of the will of those with secret agendas , hidden in the dark rooms of paranoia .
We must press government to reflect our collective views towards a more balanced world , embracing foundational ideas upon which good governments are formed .

Sarah Palin believes in fossil fuels but not necessarily in fossils .
This is no trivial matter .
Of all the intense scrutiny Palin has faced in this campaign - not least on the matter of her wardrobe - nobody in America seemed much interested in asking her the dinosaur question .
That is : do you believe , or have you ever believed , that the world was created in the past 5000 or 10,000 years and that dinosaurs roamed the planet alongside humans ?
Palin 's political extinction may be only days away but somebody really should have asked this question of the woman who has advocated the discussion of creationism in the classroom ; the woman who might have been a heartbeat from the presidency ; the woman whom John McCain described as being among the " foremost experts in this nation on energy issues " .
Well , we know that Palin believes in oil , especially the stuff she wants drilled in Alaska .
But does the energy expert know where oil comes from ?
Does Palin , the daughter of a science teacher , know that the tiger in her tank is more likely a dinosaur - fossilised matter dating back a little further than 10,000 years ?
Add another 300 million years and she'd be getting warm .
During the 2006 gubernatorial debate in Alaska , Palin suggested schools could teach creationism as well as evolution .
" Teach both , " she said .
" You know , do n't be afraid of education .
Healthy debate is so important and it's so valuable in our schools .
I am a proponent of teaching both . "
Both ?
So , once the kids rigorously and logically dispense with evolution , they can arrive at only one other conclusion … and here in Alaska we have both kinds of music : country and western .
Palin later qualified her remarks to say she would not push for creationism to be required on the state curriculum .
She had only meant that debate should be allowed if the subject arose .
" I do n't think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class . "
Similarly , schools could allow healthy debate on flat Earth versus sphere , or sexual procreation versus the cabbage patch .
An Alaskan music teacher , Philip Munger , recalls two encounters with Palin which he regards as important " in light of the possibility that she might some day soon be in charge of thousands of thermonuclear weapons " .
In June 1997 , Munger writes in a blog , he was directing a community band while Palin delivered an address for home schoolers .
" It was held at her church , the Wasilla Assembly of God , " Munger writes .
" Palin had recently become Wasilla mayor … A large part of her campaign had been to enlist fundamentalist Christian groups and invoke evangelical buzzwords in her talks and literature .
" As the ceremony concluded , I bumped into her in a hall away from other people .
I congratulated her on her victory and took her aside to ask about her faith .
Among other things , she declared that she was a Young Earth creationist , accepting both that the world was about 6000 - plus years old and that humans and dinosaurs walked the earth at the same time .
" I asked how she felt about the second coming and the end times .
She responded that she fully believed that the signs of Jesus returning soon ' during MY lifetime ' were obvious .
' I can see that , maybe you can't - but it guides me every day . ' "
The next time they met , Palin had switched to the less strict Wasilla Bible Church .
By now people were beginning to encourage her to run for governor .
" I reminded her of the earlier conversation , " Munger writes , " asking her if her views had changed .
She was no longer ' necessarily ' a Young Earth creationist , she told me .
But she strongly reiterated her belief that ' the Lord is coming soon ' .
I was trying to get her to tell me what she felt the signs were , when she had to move on . "
Does it really matter what Palin believes about life , the universe and everything ?
Matt Damon , for one , reckons it matters how clever - or not - the vice - president is .
The actor told Associated Press : " I need to know if she really thinks dinosaurs were here 4000 years ago … I want to know that , I really do , because she 's going to have the nuclear codes . "
Should the heartbeat of a President McCain falter , climate scientists might struggle to advise his understudy on 740,000 - year - old evidence from ice cores .
But the prospect of a creationist vice - president may not be so alarming to many Americans .
A Gallup poll in 1997 found 44 per cent believed that " God created man pretty much in his present form at one time within the past 10,000 years " .
A CBS poll in 2006 found 55 per cent believed that God created humans in their present form , against 27 per cent who believed humans evolved but God guided the process , and 13 per cent who believed evolution needed no help from a god .
Palin's Democratic rival , Joe Biden , is clear on this .
" I refuse to believe the majority of people believe this malarkey , " he said two years back .
Courageous - even foolhardy - given the numbers .
But at least we know .
Since McCain drafted Palin , nobody has asked her what she really believes on the subject .
Someone really should .
And if she answered that , yes , she was a creationist , they might suggest she conduct the following exercise : step outside the front door of the Governor 's Mansion in Alaska ; draw an imaginary line to the vice - presidential residence in Washington ; imagine the starting point is the beginning of all time on Earth and that Washington is the present day .
Now , draw your creationist 's timeline parallel to the first line , then walk along the latter .
It will end before you reach the front gate .
Which might be just as well .

Hey
I have had a new love of Coda , I previously review it a couple of days ago , if you want to read it your can find it here .
Anyway I have been collecting tips for over the last week or so about Coda .
These tips and tricks are designed to help you work with Coda and get stuff done , as well as this some of the tips are designed to point out the obvious task to you , that are n’t quite as obvious .
They are in no real order .
If you have any more Coda tips and tricks please leave a comment .
1 ) Turn On Validation
One of the coolest little features of Coda is in - line html validation .
This enables you to know exactly which line has errors , before you put it into a html validator .
You can switch it on by pressing the small triangle in the bottom of the Coda window .
You will then see lots of Coda bubbles when you click on anything that has errors .
2 ) Line Numbers
Although line number are in the bottom right of the editor window , turning one line numbers can make it easier to work with documents .
Turn it on by pressing View > Show Line Numbers .
3 ) Option Click To Select A File
When you click a file it will open , although you can turn this off by going through preferences .
An easier way is to Option click on a file .
4 ) Stop Uploading Of Files
If you find that you are uploading the wrong files , you can stop the upload ( or download ) by clicking on the small activity circle to display a cross .
5 ) Install WordPress Clips Collection
Probably the coolest feature of Coda is the clips .
No need for copy and paste .
Download and install the WordPress clips file from WpCandy .
It features a lot of commonly used tags and commands in your WordPress theme .
6 ) General Clips
If you do n’t want to install just WordPress Coda clips you can use a site like Coda Clips to find more general clips to use .
Includes items such as CSS , PHP , Javascript .
7 ) Show File Path
To show the save path of a file Command +
Click on the tab to show the exact save path .
8 ) Block Edit Lines
A quick method of adding the same text to multiple lines .
Press Option and select the lines you want to edit .
Then type away .
The same letters / words will appear on the same lines .
You can do this multiple times on different blocks .
9 ) Add a CakePHP Book
If you use CakePHP in Coda you can add a custom book .
Go to the book tab click the plus in the bar at the bottom of the page .
Set the following parameters .
BookTitle : CakePHP
BookURL : http://book.cakephp.org/
Use For Mode : PHP-HTML
Search URL : http://book.cakephp.org/search
You can also add a logo .
The idea for this tip came from Douglas Jarquin .
10 ) Search Through Your Books From The Edit Pane
As long as you specified a URL and Use For Mode when you add a book you can Command and Double click on any word and it will search for it using the specified book .
If you have more than one “ Use For Mode ” Set you can encounter problems .
Unfortunatly you ca n’t do this for the default books , but there is a work around .
11 ) Add A PHP Searchable Book
One the same vein as number 9 add a new PHP book so you can search for it through your edit screen .
Add the following variables for a new book .
Book Title : PHP Online
Book URL : http://php.net
Use For Mode : PHP-HTML
Search URL : http://us2.php.net/manual-lookup.php?pattern=*&lang=en
12 ) Add A HTML Searchable Book
Similar to the previous tip add the following for a searchable book .
Book Title : HTML Searchable
BookURL : http://reference.sitepoint.com/html
Use For Mode: HTML
Search URL : http://reference.sitepoint.com/search?q=*
13 ) Add A CSS Searchable Book
You should know the business by know .
Book Title : CSS Searchable
BookURL : http://reference.sitepoint.com/css
Use For Mode:CSS
Search URL : http://reference.sitepoint.com/search?q=*
14 ) Add A jQuery Book
Book Title : jQuery
BookURL : http://docs.jquery.com/
Use For Mode : Javascript
Search URL : http://docs.jquery.com/Special:Search?ns0=1&search=*&go=Go
15 ) Duplicate A Tab
You can duplicate a tab by right clicking on a tab and select duplicate .
Any changes made in one tab will be reflected in another .
16 ) Split A Window Vertically ( or horizontally )
Although you can change this in the preferences you can split a window horizontally or vertically by pressing a button in the top right corner of a window .
If you press Option you can switch it from vertical to horizontal and vice versa .
17 ) Change Text Size
Press Command and then either the plus or minus key to increase or decrease the size of the text in the editor .
18 ) Cycle Through Modes
You can cycle through the modes ( Sites , Edit , Preview , CSS etc ) by pressing command and the numbers 1 through 6 .
19 ) Turn On Hints
Although it is blatantly obvious at the bottom of the screen , turn on hints so you can get small snippets of code info to help you code better sites .
20 ) Change The Sites Image
If you want to change the image in the sites mode pane , right click on the image and select change image .
You can also refresh the image if the image show is out of date .
21 ) Slow Down Eye Candy
If you want the eye candy of the sites image flipping over , press and hold Command +
Option and double click on the sites image .
Everything will be in slow motion .
22 ) Show .htaccess and invisible files
If you want to view hidden files such as .htaccess and similar .
Go to View > Show Hidden files .
This is very useful since you do n’t need to use Terminal to edit these files .
23 ) Enable Apple Scripts Menu
You can enable the Apple Scripts menu in Coda by going into the preferences and selecting Show Scripts Menu .
You can then place your Apple Scripts in ~/ Library / Scripts / Applications / Coda .
24 ) Use SubEthaEdit Syntax Files
If you already use SubEthaEdit , you can use your syntax mode files be copying them to the Coda folder in your Application Support folder .
25 ) Highlight The Current Line
If you have a really big complicated document you can change the colour of the currently selected line by going into Preferences > Colours > Highlight Current Line .

Lonesome penguin cheered up by his new friend ... a stuffed toy
A baby penguin which had to be separated from its family after a greedy sibling continually ate all its food has found companionship - with this stuffed toy .
The penguin - called Pingu - began to lose weight and appeared weak after its bigger relative regularly helped himself to all the fish on offer .
Concerned keepers were forced to remove Pingu from the enclosure , but at just three - weeks - old the penguin was in desperate need of company .
Staff bought a £ 3.99 toy penguin from the zoo shop which acts as a surrogate sibling to the chuffed chick - who cuddles up to its new friend all day .
Mates : Pingu the penguin chick at the Living Coasts zoo in Torquay who has found solace with a stuffed toy
Pingu - an African penguin whose sex has yet to be determined - was born with its sibling at the Living Coasts attraction in Torquay , Devon .
Senior head keeper Tony Durkin said : ' At first it seemed everything was going well but then we noticed one sibling was growing more quickly than the other .
' You do get size differences in the wild but it only becomes a problem if the difference gets too great .
' We prefer not to interfere , as it's better for parent birds to rear their young naturally .
But as the size difference increased , so did the problem .
' The smaller chick was getting some food , just not enough .
When it fell in the pool we decided to give it a helping hand .
' The cuddly penguin toy is something for the chick to cosy up to and be comforted by - a surrogate family for the time being . '
Pingu is living in a snug den made out of foam matting and towels with a shelter to imitate a normal burrow .
Comforting : Staff at the zoo decided to hand rear the baby African penguin after noticing it 's older sibling kept eating all it's food
Feeding time :
The penguin - called Pingu - began to lose weight and appeared weak after its bigger relative regularly helped himself to all the fish on offer
For the first two or three days the chick was fed warm , liquidised fish from a syringe before being gradually weaned onto chunks of sprat .
Pingu now takes small whole sprats and is being fed six times a day by a team of five foster mothers .
African penguins chicks are about the same size as those of a domestic chicken .
They grow quickly and at eight weeks are close to full size .
Soon after they lose their downy feathers and grow their juvenile plumage , which they keep until they are about one - and - a - half years old .
Keeper Lois Rowell added : ' The chick is quiet but quite inquisitive .
It enjoys a shallow warm bath and being preened by us when its feathers need a clean up . '
The youngster will return to the colony when it is strong enough to compete with the others for food .
As well as a stuffed penguin Pingu also cuddles up to a toy puffin .

Representaajuste a la baja de 90.13 dls respecto a julio
[ email protected ]
La mezcla mexicana llegó a un precio de 42.58 dólares por barril , es decir , 27.42 dólares por debajo de los 70 dólares fijados en la Ley de Ingresos para 2009 .
El nivel alcanzado representa un ajuste a la baja de 90.13 dólares con respecto a la cotización máxima registrada el pasado 11 de julio del presente año , que se situó en 132.71 dólares por barril .
Sin embargo , en agosto pasado , México compró contratos derivados para garantizar el precio mínimo de 70 dólares por barril en el mercado internacional , con la finalidad de evitar un desajuste en el presupuesto .
Los contratos tuvieron un precio de mil 500 millones de dólares , de acuerdo con información del diario británico Finacial Times .
El movimiento financiero “ pudo haber incrementado la presión de los precios de petróleo a la baja , cuando bancos involucrados en el trato — Barclays Capital y Goldman Sachs — descargaron parte de su riesgo al vender futuros , dijeron corredores de bolsa .
Los contratos garantizan un rango de cotización del barril de la mezcla mexicana , de un mínimo de 70 a un máximo de 100 dólares .
No es la primera vez que el gobierno mexicano adquiere este tipo de contratos , con los que ha protegido 20 o 30 % de sus exportaciones de crudo , dijo Financial Times .
En ese contexto , los futuros del petróleo West Texas Intermedio ( WTI ) registraron un valor de 59.43 dólares por barril en las operaciones de este martes , lo que representó una pérdida de 4.47 % respecto al lunes .
En tanto , el crudo Brent de Londres mostró un precio de 55.58 dólares por barril , respecto a las cotizaciones del lunes ( 59.08 dólares ) , lo que significó una contracción de 3.5 dólares , equivalente a menos 5.92 % .
La Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo ( OPEP ) dijo que el grupo podría recortar la producción en un millones de barriles diarios , cuando se reuna en Argelia , debido a la desaceleración de la demanda mundial .
El grupo acordó que a partir de noviembre reducirá la producción en 1.5 millones de barriles diarios , tras la fuerte caída de los precios .
The New Xbox Experience , a.k.a. the new Xbox 360 Dashboard , hits tomorrow .
If you 've got an Xbox 360 that 's connected to the internet , you 're going to be prompted to update your console as soon as you turn it on .
No exceptions ; this is what your machine will look like until either it dies , you die , or Microsoft decides to make ANOTHER Xbox Experience .
Unfortunately , unlike Batman , you did n't have time to prepare .
Here are the ten things you should know about the new Xbox experience so you can be set for tomorrow .
1 ) Installation is quick .
Owners with hard drives that are n't 100 % full will be able to update with no problem , but Xbox 360 Arcade fans that rely on memory cards can get in on the free 512MB card deal from Microsoft .
We 'd recommend you go for the 20 GB hard drive for $ 20 if anything .
The update wo n't be as fast as the 10 - second patches you 're used to for standard Xbox Dashboard upgrades , but clocking in at somewhere between five to ten minutes , it 's still faster than standard PS3 firmware refreshes .
And this changes the entire UI !
Advertisement
2 ) Avatars are neat , but need some work .
They 're not necessary in the sense that you 've still got the option of using your old gamerpics to represent your gamertag to the rest of Xbox Live , but everyone can create a Nintendo Mii - like avatar .
Because there are only a handful of clothing options and customizability selections , your Mii will only kinda look like you .
They 're neat , though , and can be used in future games so you can control a virtual you instead of , say , Venus Williams or Marcus Fenix — the second being extremely unlikely .
3 ) Performance gains are found everywhere .
One of the things Microsoft with the new Dashboard was lift restrictions about how much resources it could use , resulting in a much speedier and more fluid browsing experience .
For example , your Xbox Live Arcade game list loads instantly , instead of one at a time in the order you downloaded them .
Other time savers are the ability to bring up the Xbox guide from wherever you are and jump into another game , bypassing the need to reroute from back in the Dashboard .
Advertisement
4 ) Everything is much more usable because it 's organized better .
By putting in a game and going to its info screen , you can look at its achievements , all its possible downloads and access game details like whether or not it supports 1080 p and co-op .
In fact , you can do this for all the games in the marketplace , giving you an easy way to browse around and learn whether or not Fable 2 supports online multiplayer ( it does ) .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
5 ) Blades are still there if you want them .
Although you 're " stuck " with the new interface in the actual Dashboard , you can hit the Xbox guide button on your controller and hop around the console that way .
There really is n't a reason to dislike the new interface , but if you 're one of those weirdos that hates things because they 're new ( why are you on THIS website again ? ) , you 've got an option .
Advertisement
6 ) Netflix movie and TV streaming look great .
As Mark covered in his impressions , Netflix streaming to your Xbox works fantastically as long as your connection is fast enough .
HD streaming requires 8 M bps for their highest tier quality , but Mark was fine with 5 M bps in their second tier .
This all requires you to have an actual Netflix account to be able to access the feature , but the convenience of movies on demand , directly to your TV should make you at least sign up for a trial .
7 ) Hard disk game installs save time , save wear - and - tear on your DVD drive .
As bingegamer details , installing a game on a hard drive usually cuts down load times and improves streaming from the disk in sandbox games .
It 's very rare that installing actually makes games slower , but it 's been known to happen in Halo 3 and a couple other titles .
The other benefit , besides speeding up gaming sessions , is that you eliminate DVD noise .
You still need to have the disc in the drive when you play , so you can't go rent games , install them and return them .
8 ) Media Center and media playback still work .
No change in Media Center or DivX / XviD playback functionality in case you were worried about compatibility issues before upgrading .
9 ) Ads are basically everywhere .
You know how there 's space set aside in the current Dashboard for ads and promo content ?
Well , in NXE , promo content can be mixed into the regular menu system , which makes it more difficult to tell at a glance whether you 're firing up your own copy of Gears of War 2 or clicking to the Gears of War download page where they want you to download themes .
It 's not too horrible , on the whole .
Advertisement
10 ) The future looks good for NXE .
Instead of sticking to the Spring / Fall update cycle , NXE allows Microsoft to roll out incremental updates for your Xbox whenever they 're ready .
This means more timely feature bumps ( stuff like Netflix , for example ) , and special one - off changes that can skin your interface based on whatever hot game is due out soon .
And hell , who would n't want to be able to download a Gears of War suit for your avatar ?
Our final verdict is that NXE is a good thing .
It 's great of Microsoft to be devoting precious resources to revamping a usable interface ( you wo n't see a new Wii Experience anytime soon ) three years into a console 's lifetime because they think they can do a better job the second time around .
Get ready to install a whole new Xbox tomorrow .

SAN FRANCISCO 
In a sharp rebuke to supporters of a contested state ballot measure that banned same - sex marriage , the California attorney general said Friday that the measure was constitutionally indefensible and should be overturned .
The attorney general , Jerry Brown , had previously hinted of his opposition to the measure , Proposition 8 , but made his legal opinion concrete on Friday in a brief to the California Supreme Court , which is reviewing the measure .
“ Proposition 8 must be invalidated because the amendment process cannot be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification , ” Mr. Brown said in a statement .
Opponents have argued that the proposition fundamentally altered the state Constitution by taking away the right to marry from same - sex couples , who had been free to do so since May , when the California Supreme Court legalized such marriages .
Proposition 8 overturned that decision by defining marriage in California as between only men and women .
Supporters of Proposition 8 asked the court in a separate legal brief filed Friday to invalidate the approximately 18,000 same - sex weddings performed before the ban was passed .
New NASA Technique Measuring Glacier Driven Sea Level Changes
This image shows Malaspina Glacier , a classic Gulf of Alaska mountain glacier , in southeastern Alaska .
The glacier spills into the Yakutat Bay , where researchers determined the most ice mass loss occurred during their study period between 2004 and 2007 .
The image was created from a Landsat satellite image and NASA 's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission .

Greenbelt MD ( SPX ) Nov 07 , 2008
A NASA - led research team has used satellite data to make the most precise measurements to date of changes in the mass of mountain glaciers in the Gulf of Alaska , a region expected to be a significant contributor to global sea level rise over the next 50 - 100 years .
Geophysicist Scott Luthcke of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , and colleagues knew from well - documented research that changes in the cryosphere -- glaciers , ice caps , and other parts of the globe covered year - round by ice -- are a key source of most global sea level rise .
Melting ice will also bring changes to freshwater resources and wildlife habitat .
Knowing that such ice - covered areas are difficult to observe consistently , the team worked to develop a satellite - based method that could accurately quantify glacial mass changes across seasons and years , and even discern whether individual glacier regions are growing or shrinking .
The study 's authors found that the annual ice mass lost from glaciers in the Gulf of Alaska has been 84 gigatons annually , about five times the average annual flow of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon and equal to the entire amount of water in the Chesapeake Bay .
" The Gulf of Alaska region is 20 times smaller than the ice - covered area of Greenland , yet it contributes nearly half as much freshwater melt as Greenland and accounts for about 15 percent of present - day global sea level rise stemming from melting ice , " said Luthcke , lead author of the study which will appear this week in the Journal of Glaciology .
" Considering that the Gulf of Alaska makes such a disproportionate contribution , it is vital that we know more about the nature of glacial change there . "
Luthcke and colleagues found a way to remotely measure the " mass balance " of a glacier ; that is , the net annual difference between ice accumulation and ice loss .
Past measurements of glacial mass balance in remote mountain ranges have been sparse or imprecise .
Ground - based sensors can provide long - term data , but such data points are scattered due to the inaccessibility of many remote mountain ranges .
Altimeters aboard aircraft can measure changes in the height of glaciers , but the sampling is sporadic because flights are relatively infrequent .
Glaciers in the coastal environments on the edge of the Arctic or Antarctic shed and gain mass rapidly , a high mass turnover that is particularly sensitive to climate change .
Warming seas can accelerate the motion of tidewater glaciers , and melt water on glacial surfaces can flow to the floors of glaciers and serve as a lubricant as the ice slides toward the sea .
The subsequent addition of freshwater to the ocean contributes to one of two sources of global sea level rise ; " eustatic " rise resulting from melted ice in the form of freshwater , with the other source set off by " thermal expansion , " sea level rise that occurs due to warming ocean temperatures .
The Goddard - led research team developed a new data analysis technique for NASA 's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) mission .
GRACE is made up of twin satellites that orbit Earth about 137 miles apart and 300 miles above Earth 's surface .
The positions of the two satellites change in response to variations in Earth 's gravity field , which is stronger or weaker depending on the land or ice mass that they are flying over .
Microwave ranging systems measure the distance between the two satellites down to the width of a human hair , so by measuring the change in the distance between the satellites over time , researchers can essentially " weigh " the changes in Gulf of Alaska glaciers .
Using data collected by the GRACE satellites from 2003 - 2007 , as well as unique processing and analysis techniques , Luthcke and colleagues were able to measure the mass of the glaciers every 10 days across an area spanning 18,919 square miles , about the equivalent of Vermont and New Hampshire combined .
The team found the largest ice mass losses occurring in the Yakutat , Glacier Bay , and St. Elias regions .
Those observations are consistent with recent studies from aircraft - based altimeters and other satellites .
" The consistent and direct measurement of ice - mass change made possible by the GRACE data and the analysis techniques applied in this study provide unprecedented observations that further our knowledge of the region 's complex ice evolution , " said Luthcke .
The most rapid glacial melt , according to Luthcke and colleagues , came in response to the summer heat wave of 2004 , when the region 's glaciers shed 374 gigatons of ice , or about 98 cubic miles of ice .
In comparison , the record for Greenland ice melt was 500 gigatons , or about 131 cubic miles , during the summer of 2007 .
" With such rapid change taking place in such a critical area , we need to be able to more reliably observe how these glaciers are responding , " said Luthcke .
" The direct measurement of ice - mass variation is important for improving our modeling capability and for ultimately predicting future changes . "
The latest expansion for World of Warcraft , Wrath of the Lich King , attracted a staggering 2,000 people to its Oxford Street launch – more than turned out for launches like the PlayStation 3 or Apple 's iPhone 3G .
World of Warcraft is one of the most played games on the planet , with in excess of 10 million active accounts – paying a monthly fee for access to the virtual world of Azeroth .
Although a whole wealth of competitors have sprung up including key names in the same fantasy arena that Warcraft uses – including Warhammer , Lord of the Rings and Age of Conan – it is Blizzard 's game that has completely dominated the MMO market .
New WoW
The expansion , focusing on Arthas Menthil , the titular Lich King , brings new continent Northrend for the mass of high - end players as well as a welter of new equipment , a Death Knight class , a new trade ' inscription ' , siege weapons and takes the level cap from 70 to 80 .
One confirmed fan told TechRadar : " I 've been waiting for this for months – now there will be a race to discover the new items , get the best equipment , hit the new level cap of 80 and become the best on the server ; at least until the next expansion arrives ! "
WoW launched in 2004 , but after becoming an immediate hit it has actually gathered momentum as people rush to pay the £ 8.99 subscription and £ 24.99 for expansions which give them access to whole new areas .
Many have publicly asked just what can rein WoW back in , but there are major games developers with big names behind them attempting just that ; including a new Star Wars MMO recently announced by Bioware .
I am not the most experienced person but I have a bit of it in working in small & big national or multinational companies .
In any company I ’ve worked for , I ’ve noticed a very distinct authoritarian way of doing things but I never got around to thinking exactly what is is .
Fortunately , my recent post regarding proprietary software companies led me to an insight on this .
A corporation works in a very distinct way .
Non-Management workers in it , have no political rights , as in , they have no say in the direction the company takes and in the choice of the people who rule them .
Indeed , the people who rule them , are selected by each other with small or no oversight .
The workers of a company are always assumed to be working for the best of the company .
Those who are not or who do not fully align themselves with the wishes of management , are ejected .
The workers of a company do not receive the full result of their work .
There must always be some profit which is the difference from what the company makes and what it has to pay on workers , maintenance and raw materials .
Thus , one can consider that the profit , divided equally among the workers , is the “ tax ” they have to pay in order for the whole company to prosper .
Workers can be discarded or moved around at any point .
Without them having any say in it .
Barring external factors ( as in , a larger state ) , workers have no rights .
One cannot demand a bigger pay or less hours , or a pension .
They will only receive what bonuses the company deems right in regards to what is best for the company .
In short , they will only grudgingly give a bonus if they are cornered .
The Management has all the power in their hands in hierarchical order .
The owner answers to no -one .
The owner alone has the last word on “ what is best ” for the company .
There is one political system that very closely resembles this type of setup .
“ Socialist ” Dictatorships , of which the purest form is Stalinism ( But Fascism , Nazism , Maoism etc are all very similar )
In Stalinism , which unfortunately is what most people think of when they think of “ Socialism ” , the state is simply the ultimate Capitalist .
All the conditions I described above apply to Stalinism but in the place of Company , we simply put “ Country ” or “ The Party ” .
We can easily agree that such political systems are bankrypt .
I know very few people who would wish to live in a Socialist Dictatorship and there are quite a few people , especially US Americans who love to call their opponents “ Socialists ” , who find the perceived antonym to be the best possibility : Capitalist Democracy .
But my question is this :
Do you really have a Democracy when your society ’s basic group for production is organised like a Dictatorship ?
Does n’t this fact undermine your whole concept of democracy ?
Indeed , this is true .
Democracy has become a farce of hypocricy under this setup .
Because people are living a significant part of their daily lives within a mini-dictatorship , they are conditioned to think in a similar vein .
The workers , if they care to at all , only exercise a political action twice per decade and maintain an illusion of democracy .
The management live in a constant state of power and thus find it only natural to extend this state to the rest of their lives .
It should come thus as no surprise that Corporations were best buddies with Fascist regimes who ’s rampart cronyism gives corporations eventually absolute power over the whole country .
Like seeks like .
It is the biggest irony that for all the U.S. American ’s foaming at the mouth against “ the evils of socialism ” , they are more than happy to work their whole lives in exactly the same state they would be , were their fears to materialize .

Jeff Larson is a prominent Republican consultant whose firm has been tied to the onslaught of negative robocalls from Senator John McCain ’s campaign .
Mr. Larson was also the chief executive of the local host committee for the Republican National Convention .
Now it appears that Mr. Larson may have been the personal shopper for Gov. Sarah Palin ’s lavish shopping spree — or at least he initially picked up the tab .
Federal Election Commission records show that Mr. Larson was reimbursed by the Republican National Committee in September for more than $ 130,000 in purchases at Saks Fifth Avenue , Neiman Marcus , Macy ’s , Barney ’s New York , and Atelier New York , a men ’s clothing store .
The spending spree , first reported by Politico.com , was apparently to outfit Ms. Palin and her family .
Should she decide to keep the clothing , its value would have to be taxed as income .
I.R.S. rules allow for employees to deduct the cost of uniforms worn for work — as long as the clothing has no use other than one ’s job .
But if the same clothing can also be worn day - to - day , the cost cannot be deducted from income .
And if paid for by someone else , as in this case , the value of the clothing must be reported as taxable income , Robert S. McIntyre , director of Citizens for Tax Justice , a nonpartisan tax policy research group , said on Wednesday .
“ If the clothes were only used for work , it would not be taxable income , ” Mr. McIntyre said .
“ But if you can use them to go to lunch with your husband , it would . ”
The Republican National Committee confirmed the reimbursements to Mr. Larson , but said that the clothing bought for Ms. Palin and her family would eventually be given to charity .
Mr. Larson did not return messages left for him today at his business in Minnesota .
Apart from Mr. Larson , the McIntosh Company in Dallas , which appears to be a fund - raising firm run by Alison McIntosh , who has been identified in news reports as a fund raiser for the McCain campaign , was apparently reimbursed for $ 4,537 in purchases at Macy ’s in Minneapolis , according to the commission records .
It also appears that a woman by the name of Lisa Kline was reimbursed for several hundred dollars in purchases made at high - end children ’s stores in Minneapolis , the Gap and Macy ’s as well as a sewing supply store in New York .
The full shopping list for Ms. Palin and her family , according to records of the Federal Election Commission , looks like this :
• $ 75,062.63 spent at Neiman Marcus on Sept. 10 .
• $ 41,850.72 to Saks Fifth Avenue in New York on Sept. 10 .
• $ 7,575.02 to Saks Fifth Avenue in St. Louis on Sept. 10 .
• $ 5,102.71 to Bloomingdale ’s in New York on Sept. 10 .
• $ 789.72 to Barney ’s New York on Sept. 10 .
• Charges of $ 4,396.94 and $ 512.92 at Macy ’s in Minneapolis on Sept. 10 .
• $ 4,537.85 to Macy ’s in Minneapolis on Sept. 22 .
• $ 349.50 to Lord & Taylor in New York on Sept. 25 .
• $ 4,902.08 to Atelier New York , a men ’s clothing boutique , on Sept. 10 .
• Two separate charges of $ 98 to Pacifier , a high - end baby store in Minneapolis , on Sept. 10 and Sept. 25 .
• $ 98.50 to Steinlauf & Stoller , a sewing supply store , in New York on Sept. 25 .
• $ 133 to the Gap in Minneapolis on Sept. 25 .
The money for the clothing came out of the budget of the Republican National Committee ’s co-ordinated campaign fund , not the McCain campaign , an important legal distinction , said Kenneth Gross , a campaign finance expert at Skadden Arps in Washington .
Had the money come from the McCain campaign , it would be a conversion of campaign funds into personal use , which is prohibited .
The same rule does not apply to money from party committees .
“ The R.N.C. is not made up of campaign money , ’’ said Mr. Gross .
“ It ’s not subject to the same restrictions as campaign money .
The R. N. C. cleverly used the party committee ’s money to avoid the liability that would have occurred if campaigns funds were used .
It ’s a fine line , but it separates what is legal from what is not . ”
Aspirin , that old standard in everyone 's medicine chest , can really pack a wallop .
So much so that the American Heart Association has long recommended aspirin therapy for people who 've had a heart attack , stroke caused by blood clot , unstable angina , or " ministrokes . "
The AHA also notes that even people who have not experienced such an event but who are at increased risk because of family history , say , may also stand to gain from aspirin therapy .
We 're certainly familiar with our aspirin : About 60 percent of people ages 65 and older pop aspirin at least once a week .
But this cheap , over - the - counter pill is not benign , and regular use should be discussed with a doctor .
And beware marketing claims .
Bayer was sent warning letters by the Food and Drug Administration today for touting two products — Bayer Women 's Low Dose Aspirin + Calcium ( Bayer Women's ) and Bayer Aspirin with Heart Advantage ( Bayer Heart Advantage ) — for making unproved health claims .
Along with its benefits , aspirin has limitations , too .
A roundup of recent research suggests taking aspirin regularly may do the following :
1 ) Cut pre-eclampsia risk during pregnancy .
A research review published in The Lancet in 2007 suggests that pregnant women who took aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs were 10 percent less likely to develop the disorder that involves high blood pressure and potentially serious complications for mother and fetus .
Aspirin therapy during pregnancy should definitely be discussed with an obstetrician .
2 ) Reduce risk of developing colorectal cancers .
The journal Gastroenterology published a study earlier this year that found a significantly lowered risk of developing the cancers in men with regular , long - term aspirin ( and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ) use .
The benefits , however , were not evident until individuals had amassed a total of five consistent years of regular use .
Also , the dose with the biggest benefit — 325 - mg pills more than 14 times each week — is greater than typically recommended .
3 ) Lower a woman 's risk of breast cancer .
A research review published this month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found a 13 percent relative risk reduction in women who used aspirin regularly compared with those who did not .
The findings found an overall reduced risk of 12 percent for regular use of NSAIDs in general .
Previous research on breast cancer risk and NSAID use has shown conflicting results .
4 ) Throw off test results for prostate cancer .
In an issue of this month 's journal Cancer , researchers reported that men who used aspirin and other NSAIDs regularly had about 10 percent lower levels of the prostate marker prostate - specific antigen .
The researchers suggest this may hinder the detection of prostate cancer in regular users .
5 ) Offer some protection against Alzheimer 's disease .
Research has been inconclusive , but a review published this year in the journal Neurology found people who used aspirin had a 13 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's .
The study added to an ongoing debate about whether certain types of NSAIDs , say ibuprofen vs. aspirin , were more beneficial .
6 ) Help prevent strokes — unless you also take ibuprofen .
A small study published this year in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found that stroke patients taking daily aspirin to prevent another stroke who also took ibuprofen — say , for their arthritis — reaped no antiplatelet benefit .
After the patient stopped the ibuprofen , the aspirin became effective .
The Food and Drug Administration warns that aspirin's benefits may be diminished by ibuprofen use .
7 ) Prevent asthma in middle - aged women .
A study published in the journal Thorax this year found that women 45 and older who took 100 mg of aspirin every other day were 10 percent less likely to develop asthma over the next decade than women given a placebo .
The study authors note that aspirin could exacerbate symptoms in about 10 percent of people already diagnosed with asthma .
8 ) Protect against Parkinson 's disease .
A 2007 study published in Neurology suggests that women who used aspirin regularly ( defined as two or more a week for at least a month at any point in their life ) may be 40 percent less likely to develop the disease .
9 ) Provide zero protection against heart attacks in people with diabetes .
This month , the British Medical Journal published research that suggests diabetics taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack were no less likely to experience an attack than those taking a placebo .
People with diabetes are at least twice as likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke as the general public .
10 ) Offer no protection to some sufferers of heart attack or stroke .
A research review published in the British Medical Journal in January found that nearly 30 percent of people with cardiovascular disease who took prescribed aspirin were resistant to its effects .
Such " aspirin resistance , " the study found , makes such patients four times as likely as those for whom aspirin had an effect to have a heart attack , stroke , or die .
11 ) Cause stomach troubles .
People taking aspirin or another NSAID are at higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and stomach ulcers — particularly with long - term use of the drug .

It ’s no big surprise that the Mozilla team decided for sure to release a third beta of Firefox 3.1 before moving to release candidate mode .
That was all but voted on at last week ’s meeting ( I thought ) but Mozilla “ corporate ” PR folks informed me that no decision was made .
The formal proposal for beta 3 was only issued today .
With that , beta 2 is now expected to be available in early December and beta 3 in early January , according to information available on the Mozilla web site .

“ After that discussion , the decision was to propose that we add a third beta milestone for Firefox 3.1 , ” lead developer Mike Beltzner wrote in his blog .
Aside from fixing the remaining “ blockers , ” a third beta will give testers more time to test recently added features debuting in beta 2 such as Private Browsing Mode , Worker Threads , Speculative Parsing and TraceMonkey …. with wide - reaching changes like those listed above , it was felt that this was prudent , especially if it could be done without major impact to schedule , ” Belzner wrote .
Mozilla said the code is essentially frozen and no new features will be added to Firefox 3.1 .
“ Beta 3 code freeze will be scheduled based on the results of the triage , but is expected to be in early January 2009 , ” Beltzner summed up in the group ’s meeting notes .
ABC News reported last week that the U.S. State Department 's Bureau of Diplomatic Security hired U.S. Investigations Services ( USIS ) , a Falls Church , Va. - based security and information services company , to staff a special unit that investigates possible misuse of force against civilians by American private security contractors ( PSCs ) in Iraq .
Under the $ 4.4 million contract , USIS is providing eight investigators , two translators , and a senior advisor / liaison to work with the State Department 's new Force Investigation Unit ( FIU ) " Go Team . "
The unit was created in response to the September 2007 shooting in Baghdad , Iraq , when guards working for Blackwater Worldwide were accused of firing on civilians without provocation , killing 17 and injuring several others .
To date , no security contractor in Iraq has been prosecuted for misuse of force .
The contract has sparked a controversy .
There is concern the State Department is breaking the law by outsourcing an inherently governmental function that must be performed by government employees only .
Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR ) subpart 7.503 ( c ) lists " the direct conduct of criminal investigations " as one of several inherently governmental functions that may not be outsourced .
Yet that is exactly what USIS is doing .
Its investigators are conducting " complex and sensitive investigations , " performing such tasks as interviewing witnesses , collecting and analyzing evidence , analyzing incidents for compliance with policy , laws and regulations , and testifying in administrative and judicial proceedings .
The contract states USIS will only " assist " Diplomatic Security personnel , but with USIS providing the majority of the team 's investigators , the contractor employees could easily exert undue influence on the FIU .
That the contract was even outsourced in the first place is another source of controversy .
Last October , Ambassador Patrick F. Kennedy , Under Secretary of State for Management , assured the public the FIU would include only State Department employees :
Question : Great , okay .
Listen , who are on these Go teams ?
These are n't going to be Blackwater or part - contractors on the Go teams --
Ambassador Kennedy : No .
Question : -- are they ?
Because that would be the same --
Ambassador Kennedy : No , no , the Go teams are composed of State Department employees from the Regional Security Office .
Last month , Sen. Russell Feingold ( D - Wis. ) wrote a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking about the FIU contract .
" It is highly troubling that the Department is apparently outsourcing oversight of its security contractors , " Feingold wrote .
" The presence of contractors in the Force Investigation Unit could jeopardize this responsibility and undermine the perceived impartiality of the investigation unit . "
He urged Secretary Rice to cancel the contract and staff the FIU solely with government employees .
" I note that the Department has received funding to hire 100 additional Diplomatic Security personnel .
Therefore , there is no justification for outsourcing sensitive law enforcement activities to a contractor . "

Andrew Sullivan puts it perfectly :
WASHINGTON -
In the six weeks since lawmakers approved the Treasury 's massive bailout of financial firms , the government has poured money into the country 's largest banks , recruited smaller banks into the program , and repeatedly widened its scope to cover yet other types of businesses , from insurers to consumer lenders .
Along the way , the Bush administration has committed $ 290 billion of the $ 700 billion rescue package .
Yet for all this activity , no formal action has been taken to fill the independent oversight posts established by Congress when it approved the bailout to prevent corruption and government waste .
Nor has the first monitoring report required by lawmakers been completed , though the initial deadline has passed .
" It 's a mess , " said Eric Thorson , the Treasury Department 's inspector general , who has been trying to oversee the bailout until the newly created position of special inspector general is filled .
" I do n't think anyone understands right now how we 're going to do proper oversight of this thing . "
In approving the rescue package , lawmakers trumpeted provisions in the legislation that established layers of independent scrutiny , including a special inspector general to be nominated by the White House and a congressional oversight panel to be named by lawmakers .
According to the legislation , the special inspector is to be the primary overseer .
The measure calls for him or her to conduct audits and investigations of how the government spends money under the bailout program .
The leading candidate for the post is Neil Barofsky , a federal prosecutor in New York , and his nomination could come later this week , according to people familiar with the matter .
Barofsky is the lead prosecutor in the $ 2.4 billion accounting - fraud case against former executives of the collapsed financial firm Refco .
As officials await more formal oversight of the bailout plan , the Federal Reserve and other US regulators are urging banks to maintain lending to " creditworthy " borrowers and warning against dividend levels that would cut funds available for loans , causing a deeper slump .
Supervisors will act " when dividend policies are found to be inconsistent with sound capital and lending policies , " the Fed , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , and Office of Thrift Supervision said in a statement .
Dividends should n't be at levels that would hurt the ability " to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers . "
Legislators in Congress have expressed concern banks are n't using cash from the bailout program to revive credit .
Senate Banking Committee chairman Christopher Dodd today holds a hearing with four large US banks on their use of the funds .
House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank said on Oct. 31 that using cash for nonlending violates the law .

WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama signaled on Saturday that he would pursue a far more ambitious plan of spending and tax cuts than anything he outlined on the campaign trail , setting the tone for a recovery effort that could absorb and define much of his term .
In the Democrats ’ weekly radio address , Mr. Obama said he would direct his economic team to craft a two - year stimulus plan with the goal of saving or creating 2.5 million jobs .
He said it would be “ a plan big enough to meet the challenges we face . ”
Mr. Obama said he hoped to sign the stimulus package into law soon after taking office on Jan. 20 .
He is already coordinating efforts with Democratic leaders in Congress , who have said they will begin work next month .
Advisers to Mr. Obama say they want to use the economic crisis as an opportunity to act on many of the issues he emphasized in his campaign , including cutting taxes for lower - and middle - class workers , addressing neglected public infrastructure projects like roads and schools , and creating “ green jobs ” through business incentives for energy alternatives and environmentally friendly technologies .
DALLAS ( AP )  Northern
Texas has been getting more rare earth tremors , one day after several minor earthquakes made Halloween memorable for some people in the area .
Two almost simultaneous aftershocks were centered beneath Grand Prairie and Irving just before 7 a.m. Saturday .
The U.S. Geological Survey says the Grand Prairie quake measured 2.5 magnitude and the Irving quake came in at 2.7 .
Saturday 's tremors between Dallas and Fort Worth were in the same general areas as on Friday , when tremors of magnitude 2.5 set off car alarms .
Switchboards for 911 systems lit up with calls from people near the quakes ' epicenters but no damage was reported .

PARIS --
More than two centuries after the French cut off their king 's head , a pretender to France 's throne is planning a royal wedding .
Prince Jean d'Orléans , Duke of Vendôme , announced earlier this month that , at the age of 43 , he will soon marry , with the hope of extending his royal line .
His descendants would then be ready if the French monarchy -- which was toppled by the bloody Revolution of 1789 -- is ever brought back .

Tomgram : Frida Berrigan , Who Rules the Pentagon ?
[ Note for Readers : With this post , TomDispatch closes for the Thanksgiving holiday .
We 'll be back next Monday .
By the way , to listen to an audio interview about Obama and the Pentagon with today 's author , arms expert Frida Berrigan , click here . ]
The Obama national security " team " -- part of that much - hailed " team of rivals " -- does not yet exist , but it does seem to be heaving into view .
And so far , its views seem anything but rivalrous .
Mainstream reporters and pundits lovingly refer to them as " centrist , " but , in a Democratic context , they are distinctly right of center .
The next secretary of state looks to be Hillary Clinton , a hawk on the Middle East .
During the campaign , she spoke of our ability to " totally obliterate " Iran , should that country carry out a nuclear strike against Israel .
She will evidently be allowed to bring her own ( hawkish ) subordinates into the State Department with her .
Her prospective appointment is now being praised by the likes of Newt Gingrich and Henry Kissinger .
The leading candidate for National Security Advisor is General James L. Jones , former Marine Corps commandant and NATO commander , who remained " publicly neutral " during the presidential campaign and is known to be personally close to John McCain and , evidently , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as well .
Not surprisingly , he favors yet more spending for the Pentagon .
The reputed leading candidate for Director of the CIA , John Brennan , now head of the National Counterterrorism Center , was George Tenet 's chief of staff and deputy executive director during the worst years of the CIA 's intelligence , imprisonment , and torturing excesses .
The new Secretary of Defense is odds on to be the old secretary of defense , Robert Gates , a confidant of the first President Bush .
Still surrounded at the Pentagon by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 's holdovers , he has had a long career in Washington as a clever apparatchik .
He was the adult brought in -- the story of how and by whom has yet to be told -- to clean up the Bush foreign policy mess ( and probably prevent an attack on Iran ) .
He did this .
He now favors no fixed timelines for an Iraq withdrawal , but a significant American troop " surge " in Afghanistan , " well north of 20,000 , " in the next 12 - 18 months .
He has overseen the further growth of the bloated Pentagon budget and has recently come out for the building of a new generation of nuclear weapons .
( Other candidates for Defense include former Clinton Navy Secretary and key Obama advisor Richard Danzig , who may end up -- for the time being -- as an undersecretary of defense , Clinton former Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre , and Republican Senator Chuck Hagel , who might instead land the job as the Director of National Intelligence . )
Drop down a tier , as Yochi Dreazen of the Wall Street Journal wrote last week , and you find the Obama transition people using a little known think - tank , the Center for a New American Security ( CNSA ) , as a " top farm team " to stock its national security shelves .
The founders of the center are -- do n't be shocked now -- former Clinton administration officials providing yet more " centrists " to an administration that seems to believe the essence of " experience " is having been in Washington between 1992 and 2000 .
CNAS , by the way , is officially against a fixed timeline for withdrawal from Iraq .
In that , it seems typical of the coalescing national security team , almost none of whom , so far , opposed the invasion of Iraq ( other than the president - elect ) .
Having been anti-war is evidently a sign of inexperience and so a negative .
Add in the military line - up -- Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mike Mullen , Centcom Commander David Petraeus , Generals Raymond Odierno and David McKiernan , the U.S. commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan -- all second term Bush picks , all reportedly ready to push for a major " surge " in Afghanistan , all evidently against Obama 's timeline for withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq .
Now , mind you , so far we 've only been considering the foreign policy issues of empire that face the next team .
Domestically , if Gates remains , the Air Force might get kneecapped ( perhaps losing the F - 22 Raptor , the weapons system it wants for a war that will never be fought ) , but the Army and Marines will expand , as ( so he promises ) will the Navy .
The essence of the matter is simple enough , as Frida Berrigan , arms expert for the New America Foundation and TomDispatch regular , indicates below : The Pentagon , even in the toughest of economic times , is likely to prove relatively untouchable .
The Obama transition team 's explanation for the remarkably familiar look to its emerging national security line - up , suggested David E. Sanger in a recent front - page think piece in the New York Times , is " that the new administration will have no time for a learning curve .
With the country facing a deep recession or worse , global market turmoil , chaos in Pakistan and a worsening war in Afghanistan , ' there 's going to be no time for experimentation , ' a member of the Obama foreign policy team said . "
In other words , we need the sort of minds , already imprisoned in Washington 's version of " experience , " who helped lead us into this mess ( long term ) , to get us out of it .
" Experimentation " is obviously for times when it is n't needed .
For these custodians of empire , better a steady hand and the same - old thoughts .
No ?

In his introduction , Abrams said he wanted the film , to be released in May 2009 , to feel " legitimate and real " .
Speaking at London 's Vue West End cinema on Tuesday morning , the film - maker admitted he had " never really been a huge Star Trek fan " .
Reporters were treated to cupcakes bearing the Starfleet insignia " It was always someone else 's show , " he continued , citing the original TV series ' limited resources and " cardboard planets " .
On reading the script , however , he said he would have been " jealous " had another director taken on the project .
He also praised the contribution of British actor Pegg , who said he was " pant - wettingly excited " to be in attendance .
" I 'm a fully paid - up geek , " said the Shaun of the Dead star , who said he " could n't put into words " the thrill he felt appearing in scenes alongside the Spock character .
Warning : if you do not want to know more about the Star Trek film , stop reading now .
Zachary Quinto , known to millions as Heroes villain Sylar , plays Mr Spock
The preview began with a screening of the latest trailer , which showed scenes of Kirk and Spock as children and Eric Bana as Romulan villain Nero .
Abrams then introduced the first excerpt , in which " farm boy " Kirk gets into a bar brawl with four Starfleet officers .
Kirk is subsequently seen being smuggled on board the Starship Enterprise on its maiden voyage by doctor Leonard " Bones " McCoy , played by Karl Urban .
Leonard Nimoy ( right ) makes a cameo appearance as the older Mr Spock A third scene introduced Pegg 's character Montgomery Scott , while a fourth revealed some effects - laden footage from the film 's finale .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama wants to renew the U.S. commitment to finding al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , according to his national security advisers .
Osama bin Laden remains on the run despite a $ 25 million reward for his capture .
The Obama team believes the Bush administration has downplayed the importance of catching the FBI 's most - wanted terrorist because it has not been able to find him .
" We will kill bin Laden .
We will crush al Qaeda .
That has to be our biggest national security priority , " Obama said during the presidential debate on October 7 .
But tracking down bin Laden wo n't be easy .
In May , al Qaeda released an audiotape featuring bin Laden .
But U.S. intelligence officials say they have n't had a solid lead on the terrorist mastermind 's whereabouts since late 2001 , when he was nearly captured in a battle with U.S. forces near Tora Bora , Afghanistan .
Robert Baer , a former CIA field officer , told CNN he 's talked to " a dozen CIA guys who 've been on the hunt for him , and half of them told me they assumed he was dead , the other half said they assumed he was alive , but the key word here is assume .
They do n't know . "
Watch the hunt for bin Laden »
Intelligence officials believe bin Laden is hiding in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan , a remote and primitive region with mountain peaks as tall as 14,000 feet ( 4,270 meters ) that make the terrain difficult to navigate .
" If you think of this as sort of a combination of [ the hunt for ] Eric Rudolph , who was the Olympic bomber , and the movie ' Deliverance , ' multiplied by a factor of 10 , that 's really what you 're focusing on in trying to find bin Laden , " said Robert Grenier , the former CIA station chief in Pakistan .
The region is divided into tribes , some of them warring .
Developing sources in the area has been extremely difficult .
See a timeline of bin Laden 's terror messages »
" What you literally need to have is an army of individual informants , hopefully focused on the areas that you think bin Laden is most likely to be hiding in , " said Grenier , now a security consultant with Kroll .
" But again , you need to have a whole lot of them , because one individual who may have access to the families and the clans in a particular valley , if he goes to the valley next door and starts asking questions , he 's probably gonna end up dead pretty quickly . "
The U.S. government is offering a $ 25 million reward for information leading to bin Laden 's capture , but officials who have worked in the region say the people living there would consider it dishonorable to take the money .
The United States has had some success killing al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan using unmanned drones equipped with Hellfire missiles , but those attacks have killed innocent civilians as well , complicating the political situation between the two countries .
Obama plans to send more troops into Afghanistan to push back the growing Taliban insurgency , but experts warn there could be severe consequences .
" The president is going to inherit the problem the Soviets had roughly 15 years ago during the Soviet jihad .
You cannot tame the people in the North - West Frontier Province and on the border in Pakistan and Afghanistan , " said Dalton Fury , the commander of special operations at Tora Bora .
" The only army that has been successful has been Genghis Khan and his Mongol horde .
They cut off heads and killed everyone in the villages , and since we have self - imposed rules of warfare , we are not going to do what they did . "
Cooperation from Pakistan 's military has been touchy , and most experts agree finding bin Laden is not a priority for Pakistan 's troops .
Fury says the best route for the president - elect to take would be to change the dialogue about bin Laden .
Intelligence officials do not believe he is playing an operational role and so has no reason to move around or communicate .
" I think it 's important to understand that bin Laden had his chance at martyrdom .
He was in the mountains of Tora Bora , he ran away .
In my opinion , I think we ought to promote this , " Fury said .
He believes taunting the al Qaeda leader may force him to prove he 's relevant and , in the process , lead the United States right to him .
Despite the challenges , many experts agree it is important to capture bin Laden .
" I do n't think the American people will accept him surviving and us leaving .
We will be the laughingstock of the world , " Fury said .

In the second post in this series on suburbia and peak oil , I ’ll consider one of the threats that peak oil poses to suburbia : the increasing cost of commuting to and from work for suburban residents .
My conclusions may surprise readers : suburbanites are n't particularly vulnerable to the rising cost of gasoline .
Instead , like all of us , they are vulnerable to general economic shocks that may be caused by peak oil , but the elasticity of their commuting budgets may better position them to deal with these shocks than urban residents .
The first thing that comes to mind when people discuss peak oil and suburbia is the massive amount of gasoline used to commute to and from work .
I think this is also the least problematic .
However , to the extent that it is a problem it wo n’t result in the abandonment of suburbia — rather , it will act as a catalyst to reshape the economic structure of suburbia .
For the purposes of this article , I ’ll discuss the hypothetical suburban commuter who drives 10 miles to and from work 22 days each month .
I realize that many suburbanites drive farther than this , and that some drive shorter distances , but it ’s an easy number to work with .
Here ’s a graph of what that commute costs each month at varying prices of gasoline and vehicle MPG figures :
Not very scary , is it ?
It ’s important to remember that most suburbanites drive more than just to and from work , that most suburban families are two - income / two - commute families , and that there are more costs of commuting than just the gasoline ( auto depreciation , parking , etc. , though these do n’t generally increase with increasing gasoline costs ) .
So let ’s make a more extreme , scary , and arguably realistic graph .
Here ’s the cost to a family that drives two cars 40 miles each per day , plus 48.5 cents per mile ( the IRS business deduction ) as an approximation of cost of car - ownership , plus $ 10 per day for parking for each commuter , plus $ 100 for insurance for both cars ( that ’s $ 1394 / mo baseline plus the cost of gasoline ) :
There ’s a number of take - aways from these graphs : 1 ) these numbers are higher than average cost of commuting , 2 ) to the extent that they ’re accurate , commuting is VERY expensive , 3 ) the majority of the cost of commuting is the base cost , not the gasoline , 4 ) for most suburbanites , the ability to afford life in suburbia is more a function of the shape of the overall economy ( e.g. the earning power of suburbanites ) than it is a function of gas prices in isolation .
What are the options to commuting ?
First , looking at the graphs above , it should be clear that eliminating a suburban family ’s need for one of their two cars will have a greater effect than doubling the miles per gallon of both of their cars .
There are many ways to do this : ride sharing , mass transit , and telecommuting are the most obvious .
Ridesharing ( Carpooling ) :
For all the talk about improving vehicle efficiency , there are few solutions that are simpler , more elegant , and more practical than putting more than one person in each car .
For our hypothetical suburban family in the example above , if the happy couple can drive to work together and only maintain , insure , and park one car , they would save $ 697 after - tax dollars per month -- and this is assuming no reduction in car - miles driven .
Similarly , workers can organize car - pool clubs , etc .
The downside of ridesharing is inconvenience .
It ’s convenient to only go straight from your house to work and not pick anyone up along the way .
It ’s convenient to pick when you commute .
It ’s convenient to have access to a car while at work in case you need to run an errand , etc .
If , for our hypothetical family above , they can afford $ 32 / day and the convenience gained is worth more than that , then it probably makes financial sense to drive alone ( ignoring environmental arguments , etc. ) .
Mass Transit : Mass transit is another option for most suburbanites .
Again , the viability of mass transit is a matter of weighing the cost savings against the inconvenience .
In some cases , mass transit may actually be more convenient , but for most suburbanites it 1 ) takes longer , 2 ) is less flexible , and 3 ) does n’t address the “ last mile ” and still requires one car ( and its associated costs ) per commuter .
Telecommuting : Working from home , one or more days per week , is another approach to making suburbia viable .
This is already a common practice , and the ability to expand upon it has been explored here before .
I sense that , at this point , many readers will be a bit baffled by my focus on the base cost of commuting rather than the variable cost of commuting caused by higher gas prices .
This is , after all , an article about peak oil and suburbia .
I think it ’s critical to focus on this differentiation — - the base cost of commuting vs. the variable cost .
If the variable cost ( as gasoline gets more expensive ) of commuting is what will kill the finances of suburbanites , then urbanites will be far better positioned to adapt to the impact of peak oil .
They do n’t have these long commutes , they often do n’t have a need to own one car per family , let alone 2 + .
However , if it ’s the base cost that is the primary issue ( as I argue here ) , then we need to envision the scenario where suburbanites can no longer afford this base cost .
This is even more true to the extent that America ’s auto fleet gradually improves in efficiency ( a topic I have largely ignored ) .
As long as suburbanites maintain their present income levels , they should be able to afford their present costs of commuting -- in most cases rising gas prices wo n't break the bank , and can largely be addressed through improved efficiency .
However , a sharp economic downturn has the potential to dramatically reduce these income levels .
Here ’s the key : a sharp economic downturn will most likely reduce urbanites ’ income levels by a similar amount .
So while these economic troubles may make life in suburbia much more difficult , it will also make life in urban areas much more difficult .
Precisely because the issue is base cost of commuting , not variable cost , this economic impact is felt equally in suburban and urban areas .
In fact , because there are so many viable ( if inconvenient ) options for suburbanites to reduce base commuting costs ( outlined above ) , it may be easier for suburbanites to adapt to a sharp economic downturn than urbanites .
Cutting down from two commuter cars to one could cut a suburbanite 's total expenditures by 10 - 20 % + per month without great change .
That 's a large chunk of suburban budgets that is quite elastic , and lends a great deal of resiliency to suburbanite finances .
How many urban households can cut expenses by this much merely by doing something as simple as carpooling ?
My purpose in writing this series is not to make a partisan stand in favor of suburbia .
Rather , my intent is to push the debate beyond “ suburbia sucks ” to the more important question of how we will address its weaknesses .
As I argued last week , it is n’t practical to think that we ’ll simply abandon suburbia in favor of some preferable urban option .
This week , my conclusion is that suburbia may actually be no worse situated to deal with the economic impact of peak oil than urban areas .
It is the base cost of commuting , not the variable cost , that most impacts suburban finances — - suburbanites have already ( by definition ) budgeted for this cost , and have more viable options to reduce this cost than urbanites have viable options to comparably reduce their expenditures .
Next week I ’ll argue that suburbia may be more than on equal footing with urbia — - it may actually be better positioned to deal with the more extreme potential impacts of peak oil such as food shortages , water shortages , and energy shortages .
“ In theory , we could use this stream of information to learn about other disease trends as well , ” said Dr. Philip M. Polgreen , assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Iowa and an author of the study based on Yahoo ’s data .
Still , some public health officials note that many health departments already use other approaches , like gathering data from visits to emergency rooms , to keeping daily tabs on disease trends in their communities .
“ We do n’t have any evidence that this is more timely than our emergency room data , ” said Dr. Farzad Mostashari , assistant commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in New York City .
If Google provided health officials with details of the system ’s workings so that it could be validated scientifically , the data could serve as an additional , free way to detect influenza , said Dr. Mostashari , who is also chairman of the International Society for Disease Surveillance .
A paper on the methodology of Google Flu Trends is expected to be published in the journal Nature .
Researchers have long said that the material published on the Web amounts to a form of “ collective intelligence ” that can be used to spot trends and make predictions .
But the data collected by search engines is particularly powerful , because the keywords and phrases that people type into them represent their most immediate intentions .
People may search for “ Kauai hotel ” when they are planning a vacation and for “ foreclosure ” when they have trouble with their mortgage .
Those queries express the world ’s collective desires and needs , its wants and likes .
Internal research at Yahoo suggests that increases in searches for certain terms can help forecast what technology products will be hits , for instance .
Yahoo has begun using search traffic to help it decide what material to feature on its site .
AFTER President McCain or Obama takes the oath of office in January , he may have a shiny new black limousine to go along with his not - so - new White House .
General Motors is believed to be putting the final touches on a new First Car .
An analysis of unauthorized photographs taken while the car was being tested last summer on public roads suggests that the presidential ride will be a truck - based Cadillac .
It will presumably replace the Cadillac that President Bush has used since 2005 .
This new car will be a Caddy like no other .
The photos by Chris Doane , a spy photographer who hunts big automotive game  future models that have n’t been publicly revealed  for magazines and Web sites , provide clues about how specialized presidential transportation has become since the first White House fleet was ordered for William Howard Taft in 1909 .
President
Taft rode in a stock
White steam car or a conventional Pierce - Arrow , but the next president will travel in a fortress - like vehicle that was mostly built from scratch .
The photographer noted that the limousine was being tested , possibly for comparison purposes , with a pair of GMC Topkick medium - duty trucks .
The limousine seemed to be riding on the same 19.5 - inch Goodyear Regional RHS tires as the trucks , indicating that it is far heavier than a civilian Cadillac  even the longest stretch limousines built with the G.M. division ’s heavy - duty coachbuilder package .
Indeed , it is believed that the limo is based on G.M. ’s 2500 line of trucks , which includes an extra - heavy - duty version of the Suburban .
Tim Russert ’s famous white board was reincarnated in another form tonight .
Reporting from West Palm Beach , NBC correspondent Kerry Sanders held up a white piece of paper on air and quickly scribbled a diagram with black ink to explain why some voters there were confused by the ballot .
The tricky design had two boxes by the name of each candidate .
Voters were supposed to fill in the space between the two boxes to indicate their selected candidate .
Instead , Sanders said , some voters said they checked one box or put an X in the middle .
“ Whether it ’s a very close vote here in Florida , specifically in Palm Beach Country , that will then become an issue , ” Sanders said .
Anchor Brian Williams shook his head incredulously .
“ How many people are watching right now saying , ' Does it have to be this hard ? ' ” he said .

Since the time of fire , man has had arguments – rare or well done ?
Of course , arguments depend on your point of view , or in the case of husbands and wives , what the wife thinks .
Some arguments are never - ending .
Over the centuries , there have been some doozies that have kept philosophy students and teachers debating .
To be included on this list of Arguments That Ca n’t Be Won , the argument must have no clear answer that cannot be countered with another opposing view .
Disclaimer : TopTenz.net is in no way trying to lead you to think in one way or another .
We are only trying to present the arguments in a meaningful context .
Evolution or Creation ?
Theologists and scientists have been arguing this one for centuries as well .
The argument goes back to the time when organized religion was almost as powerful as the monarchies ruling countries .
When people starting postulating that the Earth was not the center of the universe , it gave way to the rise in questioning the idea of a seven - day creation and God ’s role in creating the Earth .
Enter Darwin and his Theory of Evolution and the debate truly kicks off with an unholy fevered pitch .
Add in that there are many stories of creation across many different religions and your brain can really start to hurt .
Nature vs. Nurture
Does how you are raised affect your views as an adult more than what your genetic codes dictate ?
If your family has always been carpenters , are you destined to be a carpenter because of your genes or because of your familial upbringing ?
When identical twins are separated at birth and grow up to have identical tastes is that an argument that it has more to do with nature than nurture ?
However , is it nature to love spicy food , when that ’s all that your family and friends eat ?
Gun control
It ’s not guns that kill people , it ’s the bullets .
In America , citizens have a right to bear arms , which has proven to be dangerous for many other citizens and police over the centuries since the country ’s birth .
On the other hand , large portions of the gun-toting population are careful citizens who have never crossed the law .
Why should one group ’s rights to bear arms be stripped away because another group feels unsafe ?
Or why should they be allowed to bear those weapons of death among a land of peaceful citizens ?
Euthanasia
Dr. Kevorkian helped many people commit suicide due to their health conditions and their desires .
His motives were questioned because all life is supposedly precious , but his patients wanted to move on from their frail existence .
What if those patients did n’t have a say and we had the opportunity to choose whether they live in agony or die in peace by not giving them medication or a procedure ?
What is the better option ?
The Death Penalty
Centuries ago , the prevalent rule of thumb was an eye for an eye , or in some cases , a life for a life .
So the question becomes have we advanced far enough in our social and political structures to ban the death penalty ?
Or when is the death penalty justifiable ?
Is the death penalty appropriate for an accidental homicide ?
How about for a mass murderer ?
Abortion or Pro-life ?
Does a woman have the right to control her body by ending a life inside her ?
When is a fetus truly alive ?
Is all life truly precious ?
What happens when a woman is raped and becomes pregnant – is that life still precious ?
There may never be answers to these questions ; however , the government has helped us out many times by entering its own opinion whether the pro-lifers like it or not .
Free will or Destiny ?
The free will or destiny argument stems back to the Christian doctrine that God is omniscient and has seen everything that will happen .
So if God can see everything that happens , is it free will or destiny that makes you choose to continue reading ?
Some have argued that God knows you will read this but you still have a choice .
However , if the path is already apparent to one being , then the path has already been decided for you .
However , that directly contradicts our everyday actions where we constantly make decisions – is something , a destiny foreseen by God , guiding us or are we truly free of the strictures of destiny ?
Morals – Relative or Universal ?
Like the question of gun control , whether ethics being morally relative or universal comes down to whether the good of the one outweighs the good of the many .
If it is fine to sleep with another man ’s wife in one society but not in another , then the problem is that the morals are relative to the society or person .
But why would n’t it be universal that it is wrong to sleep with another man ’s wife or woman ’s husband in any society ?
Why is it OK to speed , when it is breaking the law ?
Should n’t breaking any law be just as wrong ?
If you would never steal a person ’s purse , why would you pirate a DVD ?
The chicken or the egg ?
Perhaps one of the most fun arguments on this list , the chicken or the egg debate has raged for centuries mainly because it asks the questions does the animal evolve and then reproduce or was it hatched ?
That debate can then be transferred to our own existence , which leads into the argument of Evolution or Creation .
Does God Exist ?
Since the dawn of recorded time , there have been people trying to prove that there is a higher being or beings that have caused the worlds and its creation .
Organized religion comes down to having faith that there is a higher being and a place to go after death .
Most people , if not already deeply religious in their life , find religion and start believing as they near their twilight years because they want to believe there is somewhere to go and someone to be with .
So the question is how do you prove that god , in which ever religion you believe , exists ?

Okay , quick … how many people besides Alan Kay can you name that worked at Xerox PARC ?
Not very many , eh ?
Yeah , that ’s your loss .
It was n’t all about the guys like Kay that get all the glory , you know … .
Warren Teitelman was by far my favorite speaker .
Unfortunately my notes got worse as the day drug on , so I simply cannot do justice to him .
Yeah , Guy Steele is …you know …
Guy Steele .
( OMG !
The guy who wrote the lambda papers is sitting right behind me !
Uh… can I have your autograph ? )
Fritz Kunze seemed like he ’d have been a great guy to go out drinking with .
And we ’d heard from John McCarthy himself , for crying out loud … .
But Teitelman came off as being at once knowledgeable and approachable .
He did n’t exude any of the “ dysfunctional Lisp - programmer ” type attitudes at all .
( Not that anyone else did … . )
And his work at PARC and InterLisp seemed to address things that the Lisp community as a whole seems to have overlooked somewhat in the years since .
He ’d been right in the middle of some pretty significant moments of computer history , but he still seemed like a pretty humble guy in spite of it .
Teitelman ’s early work had to do with debugging Lisp programs while they were still running .
When he presented it at a conference in 1968 , he was completely flamed by Dijkstra !
“ We should n’t make it easier for programmers to recover from bugs , ” Dijkstra said angrily .
( He ’d been visibly shaking his head through out the talk even before this outburst . )
“ How many bugs are we going to tolerate ? ” he demanded .
“ Seven , ” Teitelman shot back .
The audience laughed , of course , but Dijkstra never forgave him .
From that day forward , Dijkstra referred to him as the Internationally Renowned Computer Entomologist !
In 1970 he worked on the DWIM features of InterLisp .
He ’d been discussing the feature for weeks , but somehow the implications of it were just not evident to the people he worked with .
The idea was that the computer should be able to automatically correct doubled and transposed characters and such like .
He rolled out the code for it into production and soon one of his colleages burst into the room and explained breathlessly : “ I was talking on the phone and typed the wrong thing … and … and the computer corrected it ! ”
Until you have something out there , the user ca n’t be sure what it can do , Teitelman said .
So yes … we were all sitting there listening to the guy that pretty much impelented the first spell checker , the first undo system ( for a Lisp environment ) , and the first online help system .
There were some court cases between Microsoft and Apple back in the eighties over who had these features first , but Teitelman of course has printouts from long before either one were on the scene !
I think he was one of the first people to get a personal computer .
( It cost $ 150,000 … .
It was something called a “ Dorado ” . )
And when windowing systems were first developed at PARC , he rewired the Lisp programming tools to work with it .
He was the first person to use the term “ programming enviornment ” in print .
Incredible .
He concluded by quoting Alan Kay as saying that there are n’t enough languages these days that are late binding self - reflexive .
Teitelman said that we ’ve got to strive to separate the business process from the code .
Your average developer , though , just thinks , “ hey … I can easily build this rule in Java ! ” Do n’t !!!
This is a concept that people do n’t get .
If the program is rapidly changing or needs to look at itself , then you really need those late binding self - reflexive features , he said .
After hearing about many of the wonderful developments in the various branches of Lisp , Kent Pitman told us about extremely Machiavellian process of consolidating them under Common Lisp .
( Earlier in the day , Fritz Kunze had remarked that this was a “ deeply flawed ” process and that the mailing archive revealed it to be an “ unfolding disaster . ” )
Pitman had a strikingly cynical slide detailing the strategies of the process organizers : “ due process is an illusion , ” it said .
Other bullet points sounded like something out the Art of War : “ turn opponents against each other and let them wear each other down . ”
“ Soliciting volunteers gives critics something to do , ” another said , “ which dilutes their passion , pacifies them , and makes them feel involved . ”
In order to isolate the Interlisp guys , dark rumors were spread about various computing nightmares caused by Teitelman ’s DWIM features !
While at MIT , Pitman recounted how he ’d written the MacLisp manual and naively signed the copyright over to them .
“ Oh , it ’s just a formality , ” they said .
Not really understanding what copyright was about , he did n’t really think anything of it .
He also did n’t see a dime of the money that MIT brought in with the book sales .
Pitman wrote up the standard for the Common Lisp project and was very careful to avoid a similar deal for that .
The committee would vote on the truth of the various propositions , but he would do all of the writing .
No matter what , he was not going to give up the copyright for any reason !
When ANSI Common Lisp was finally finished , Pitman described how people simply could not come to grips with the fact that it was portable .
“ What platform is this implementation for ? ” people would ask .
After failing to get people to try it out , these same people would end up calling two years later and say , “ hey , you know … we tried it and it works .
Can we use this ? ”
Talk abut not getting the point !
He had another slide detailing an eerie phone conversation between him and someone from ANSI .
Each side engaged in subtle forms of intimidation to try to get their way .
After being pushed to turn it over , Pitman said flatly : “ Our commitee just voted on the truth of things , not the text .
Copyright covers the form of the text , not the truth . ”
He held his ground and somehow ANSI figured something out .
The tragedy is that you ca n’t get a decent copy of the language standard anymore !
And due to all of these maneuverings , it was years before Pitman could get his work published on the web …
( Steele ’s CLtL books actually beat him , much to his chagrin … . )
Stallman was not happy with the way Pitman handled copyrights : “ I do n’t care about useful , ” he said , “ it has to be free ! ”
Pitman seemed to have a knack for being a day late and a dollar short .
He decided to write a Lisp based web server back in the nineties and after six months of working on it Franz ( I think ) came out with a free one .
As a result of this experience , he has reservations about not only giving up his copyrights , but also with the open source development model in general ….
( I apologize for the poor quality of this post .
There so much that could be done to get this right , but I have limited time , etc .
Hopefully this will suffice to give people a sense of the sessions until something better is released . )

RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Rescue workers rushed to help stricken residents in southern Brazil Monday after landslides and floods caused by heavy rain killed at least 59 people and forced more than 43,000 from their homes .
The state of Santa Catarina declared an emergency as rescuers used helicopters and motorboats to reach those displaced or stranded by the floods after days of torrential rain .
“ Santa Catarina is facing its worst weather tragedy , ” state Gov. Luis Henrique Silveira told reporters .
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called Silveira and told him the federal government stood ready to provide medicine and other supplies , the state said on its Web site .
The state government said the floods and mudslides had affected 1.5 million people , leaving about 150,000 people without electricity and eight towns out of the 60 affected completely cut off by flood waters and landslides .
The death toll was likely to rise as several people were missing , state officials said .
The floods also shut down a branch of a pipeline carrying natural gas from Bolivia to Brazil , cutting off supplies to Santa Catarina and neighboring Rio Grande do Sul state , the company that operates the line said .
Brazilian newspapers showed photographs of streets submerged by the waist - high flood waters in the state , which is one of Brazil ’s wealthiest and known for its large number of descendants of German and Italian immigrants .
Transport in the state was paralyzed as roads were cut off by the flooding and landslides .
Television footage showed hillsides breaking away and sliding into rivers of mud .
A lane of one main road collapsed after its earth foundations crumbled .
Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper said at least one town was rationing water because of purification problems .
Thirteen people died after being buried by landslides in the town of Blumenau , where officials declared a state of emergency late Sunday and warned that more mudslides were possible .
Eight died in Gaspar town and six more died in the town of Jaragua do Sul .
“ The big challenge Monday will be supplying the shelters with medicines and food , ” Blumenau Mayor Joao Paulo Kleinubing said , according to the Civil Defense Agency ’s Web site .
The first deaths were reported Saturday after two days of heavy downpours and weeks of steady rain .
Forecasters said the rain was expected to ease in the coming days .
The South American country is in spring season when rains in the southern part of the country are at their heaviest , ending months of usually dry winter weather .
I was trying to figure out how to explain to you all that is involved in the case of the U.S. v. Lori Drew , the cyberbullying case that so many lawyers are expressing concerns about .
I felt I needed a lawyer to explain it , but where would I find one who felt like doing some unpaid work , and over the Thanksgiving holiday to boot ?
Then I had a brainstorm .
I could show you the amicus brief [ PDF ] submitted in the case by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the Center for Democracy and Technology , and Public Citizen , which was also signed by " 14 individual faculty members listed in Appendix A who research , teach and write scholarly articles and books about internet law , cybercrime , criminal law and related topics at law schools nationwide " .
Appendix A is at the very end .
If you look at the list , you 'll see that it 's some of the finest and most knowledgeable lawyers and law professors specializing in cyberlaw .
The brief was written by Jennifer Granick of EFF and Philip R. Malone of Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society 's Cyberlaw Clinic .
I think when you read it , it will turn your hair white .
It did me .
In fact , I do n't think it 's overstating it a bit to say that unless this case is overturned , it is time to get off the Internet completely , because it will have become too risky to use a computer .
At a minimum , I 'd feel I 'd need to avoid signing up for membership at any website , particularly MySpace .
Why particularly MySpace ?
The Times Online has their statement : MySpace , which is a division of News Corporation , owner of The Times , said in a statement that it respects the jury 's decision and will continue to work with industry experts to raise awareness of cyber - bullying and the harm it can potentially cause .
If it respects this decision , I do n't feel safe there .
I did n't even want to visit its web site to try to find its terms of use .
But according to this article , MySpace gets to be the one that decides if we 've violated their terms :
MySpace users agree that the social networking site has the final say on deciding whether content posted by users violates a long list of regulations contained in the agreement .
There is no recourse .
They make the law and if you mess up , you go to jail .
You used a computer , after all , did n't you , and their server is n't yours , and if they say you have violated their terms , you have .
I 'd also never upload anything to YouTube , and I would n't use anyone 's blogging software .
I 'd definitely stay out of the Cloud , because I do n't own those computers either , leaving me open to Computer Fraud & Abuse Act allegations , which is what Drew was charged with .
In short , it'd be time for me to just pack up and leave , if this verdict stands .
If you think EULAs were bad , imagine after this ruling if they can be tied to the CFAA .
Do you think it 'll be long before folks are tossed in jail for defining fair use in ways a copyright owner does n't like ?
Would Microsoft hesitate to criminalize its EULA terms ?
You think ?
You trust ?
The case is not yet done , in that there is a motion that the judge took under advisement and said he will rule on this coming Monday .
And there are other developments , as reported by St. Louis Today : Drew lawyer H. Dean Steward has filed a motion to dismiss the case , arguing repeatedly that prosecutors in Los Angeles over - reached and that Drew could only be prosecuted if she both read MySpace 's terms and knowingly and intentionally violated them .
Wu has appeared to lean towards granting that motion in court , although he has declined prior chances to do so .
Steward has also filed a motion for a new trial , which could lead to a federal appeals court tossing out the case .
Wu is the judge , the Honorable George H. Wu .
There are some serious issues , legal issues , raised by the case , in other words .
The legal issues are not about who is or is n't morally awful ; the legislative branch can always write new laws to address a new issue that they realize someone needs to write a law for .
The legal issues raised are what happens to everyone who uses a computer if the Computer Fraud & Abuse
Act is applied to actions that were not contemplated as covered by the legislators when they drafted the act .
Here 's the analysis by the US Departmenet of Justice of the CFAA , dated long before this case .
More reactions : " The statute was never intended to cover this kind of conduct , " says Michael Scott , professor of law at Southwestern School of Law , Los Angeles .
" Lori Drew did not do the key acts that the prosecution alleged , but rather a third party did , so it seems strange that the person who pulled the trigger is not prosecuted but the one standing next to her is . "
Or at least criminalize it before you prosecute anyone .
Andrew Grossman goes to the heart of the matter , in the Christian Science Monitor : " What happened to Megan Meier was a tragedy , not a crime , " says Andrew Grossman , senior legal policy analyst in the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
" This case should never have been brought .
The strongest evidence for the prosecution had nothing or little to do with the charges .
This verdict is a loss for civil liberties and leaves all Internet users at risk of prosecution under federal law .
It is a prime example of overcriminalization . "
[ Grossman explains what he means by overcrimilaization in detail in this article . ]
And that 's why it'd be time to get off the Internet and go back to a typewriter .
Really .
You read a great deal about judges and how they should n't be allowed to be activists and use their positions to create law .
But the amicus brief raises a serious question : what about prosecutors ?
Is society in safe hands if prosecutors get to broadly interpret a law retroactively in creative and aggressive ways to make it apply to activities that have nothing to do with what the law was written to address ?
How about web sites ?
If violating a web site 's terms of use is criminalized by the CFAA , have we not given private companies the ability to write the criminal laws ?
Do you feel safe if they are allowed to arbitrarily decide what is or is n't criminal ?
And then change it whenever they feel like it , without notice to you ?
Here 's a question for you , from AlmostLegally :
At my office , the company I work for says dont send personal email from your work computer .
But if I do , is that a federal crime ?
For example , Groklaw has terms of use .
I ask you not to post comments about politics and not to troll or spam or personally attack anyone .
If you violate those terms , should I apply the CFAA to you and send you to jail ?
One year for each misdemeanor and a $ 100,000 fine , because you violate something I made up to suit myself ?
On what basis should I be given such power ?
Have we lost our minds ?
I surely do n't want any such powers .
Note that 's one of the concerned comments in the New York Times article I linked to at the very beginning , a comment by Andrew M. Grossman , senior legal policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation , again : " If this verdict stands , it means that every site on the Internet gets to define the criminal law , " Grossman told The Times .
" That 's a radical change .
What used to be small - stakes contracts become high - stakes criminal prohibitions . "
Did you ever think you could be criminally prosecuted for not abiding by a web site 's terms of use ?
Neither did I .
And that raises another question .
Do I now have a responsibility to police you and make sure you are abiding by my ' laws ' ?
Does anybody know ?
And there 's another point that the brief raises : can you retroactively define something as criminal and put people in jail for conduct they had no notice was criminal conduct before they did it ?
The law is not supposed to surprise or ambush you .
The law draws a line in the sand , as drawn by the legislators , who draw it where they think they need to to accomplish something very specific .
They do n't write laws that say , " Do n't do bad stuff . "
If they did , it'd be likely found unconstitutional , on the grounds of vagueness , because who knows what " bad stuff " is if it is n't defined ?
Did you know that YouTube 's Terms of Use say not to do " bad stuff " ?
I did n't either , never having read it , because like the majority of you , I rarely read terms of use .
But the brief tells us that it says that .
If we apply the CFAA to that web site 's terms of use , is it now a crime to do " bad stuff " ?
Actually , yes , if you use a computer to do it , whatever it is that someone someday might conceivably define as " bad stuff " .
Who gets to define " bad stuff " ?
Google ?
Some prosecutor somewhere you do n't even live ?
A blogger mob ?
An enemy who can't sleep without inventing new and mean ways to ruin your life ?
Does the CFAA not empower such conduct ?
Do you actually want a world like that ?
In some ways , it 's worse than lawlessness , worse than the old Wild West .
Why worse ?
Because in the West in the old days , might made " right " .
That 's clear enough , and you knew where you stood .
Practice shooting , or move East where there were laws .
But if the law is vague or retroactively redefined just to get you , because someone in power decides you deserve it , you have laws but you can't rely upon them , because they are not necessarily fairly applied or reliably defined , so you are in constant danger of having a law used just to get you personally , because someone does n't like the way you part your hair .
Like that never happens in real life .
The entire point of the rule of law is that it 's dependable and predictable and it applies equally to everyone .
You do n't wake up to a knock on your door , and find the police have defined you mysteriously as a criminal without warning .
I 'm not talking about this case 's specifics now .
Everyone agrees that bullying is not a good thing , and I sympathize with prosecutors .
I 've known some , and I liked them all .
They are men and women , in my experience , who care deeply about the victims of crime , and that 's a beautiful quality .
But the rule of law is beautiful too , but only if it 's dependable , fair , and applied without favoritism .
Not to mention Constitutional .
Anonymous speech is protected under the US Constitution , as the brief points out .
PCWorld quotes some more lawyers :
If the charges against Drew are upheld , it will be a serious blow to anyone who wants to remain anonymous on the Internet , said Brock Meeks , a CDT spokesman .
" Everybody that is sympathetic to this case and saying finally we 've got something to nail her on here , they 're not looking hard enough at the fact that the Justice Department blundered by using this anti-hacker law , " he said .
The charges suggest that anyone who uses a fake name to sign up for a Web service like Yahoo or Gmail could be charged with a federal crime , Meeks said .
" If that 's a federal crime , then I 'm certainly guilty of a federal crime and there are probably a million other people out there who are probably also guilty . "
Is it not Kafkaesque if you can be dragged into court on a whim in any location in the world , if the computer you are alleged to have misused is located there , even if it 's half a country or even a world away from where you reside and they can put you in jail for a crime that was n't defined as a crime at the time of your conduct in question ?
It 'd be one thing if you were given a notice that this was the new interpretation ; but if you just wake up to find out you are a retroactive criminal , you might as well be in a Kafka novel , because there is absolutely no way to ever know what the definition of criminal conduct will be tomorrow or when it can retroactively be applied to you .
Drew , according to reports of the testimony at trial , never read the terms of use .
Yes , but she should have known , said the prosecutor .
She must have .
How do you know ?
Should the law guess ?
We can be put in prison because although there is no proof we knew something , we might have or could have or must have ?
If you think I am overstating what the brief is saying , feel free to say so , but do read it .
At least then , you 'll know what the uproar is all about .
I know from some of your comments that you think the verdict was all about Lori Drew .
I do n't think so .
I think it 's about us .
Update : I remembered reading a detail about the case in one of the first articles about it , if not the first , namely that Megan was underage when she opened her MySpace account , and that her mother allowed her to do so , despite it being a violation of the web site 's Terms of Use , and I found it now , from the St. Charles Journal : MySpace has rules .
A lot of them .
There are nine pages of terms and conditions .
The long list of prohibited content includes sexual material .
And users must be at least 14 .
" Are you joking ? " Tina asks .
" There are fifth - grade girls who have MySpace accounts . "
As for sexual content , Tina says , most parents have no clue how much there is .
And Megan was n't 14 when she opened her account .
To join , you are asked your age but there is no check .
The accounts are free .
As Megan 's 14th birthday approached , she pleaded for her mom to give her another chance on MySpace , and Tina relented .
She told Megan she would be all over this account , monitoring it .
Megan did n't always make good choices because of her ADD , Tina says .
And this time , Megan 's page would be set to private and only Mom and Dad would have the password .
If only the parents would have the password , it means to me that they were the ones who set it up .
And at the time of the suicide , Megan was still not yet 14 , the age limit MySpace sets for opening an account .
" This time " is referring to an earlier account that the parents had shut down , so they apparently allowed her to have an account even earlier , or she just opened it herself .
Either way , it was a violation of the web site 's terms of use : Tina Meier was wary of the cyber - world of MySpace and its 70 million users .
People are not always who they say they are .
Tina knew firsthand .
Megan and the girl down the block , the former friend , once had created a fake MySpace account , using the photo of a good - looking girl as a way to talk to boys online , Tina says .
When Tina found out , she ended Megan 's access .
So the girl herself set up a fake account as well as violating the terms of use by opening an account when she was underage .
Excuse me for pointing this out , but should n't this mother also be prosecuted for violating MySpace 's Terms of Use , now found a violation of a criminal statute , the Computer Fraud & Abuse Act ?
Before you answer , remember that Drew was found not guilty of intent to cause harm .
If not , I 'd like to hear your arguments .
That same article , by the way , tells us about an incident that makes me wonder just what exactly caused the suicide : Monday , Oct. 16 , 2006 , was a rainy , bleak day .
At school , Megan had handed out invitations to her upcoming birthday party and when she got home she asked her mother to log on to MySpace to see if Josh had responded .
Why did he suddenly think she was mean ?
Who had he been talking to ?
Tina signed on .
But she was in a hurry .
She had to take her younger daughter , Allison , to the orthodontist .
Before Tina could get out the door it was clear Megan was upset .
Josh still was sending troubling messages .
And he apparently had shared some of Megan 's messages with others .
Tina recalled telling Megan to sign off .
" I will Mom , " Megan said .
" Let me finish up . "
Tina was pressed for time .
She had to go .
But once at the orthodontist 's office she called Megan : Did you sign off ?
" No , Mom .
They are all being so mean to me . "
" You are not listening to me , Megan !
Sign off , now ! "
Fifteen minutes later , Megan called her mother .
By now Megan was in tears .
" They are posting bulletins about me . "
A bulletin is like a survey .
" Megan Meier is a slut .
Megan Meier is fat . "
Megan was sobbing hysterically .
Tina was furious that she had not signed off .
Once Tina returned home she rushed into the basement where the computer was .
Tina was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back at people .
" I am so aggravated at you for doing this ! " she told Megan .
Megan ran from the computer and left , but not without first telling Tina , " You 're supposed to be my mom !
You 're supposed to be on my side ! "
Am I the only parent who notices that this child was left alone on the Internet , with admonitions to stop but delayed enforcement ?
And can you * prove * in a court of law that it was not the mother 's failure to support her , as the child apparently viewed it , that actually caused the death ?
This child had tried to kill herself before , the article points out , an attempt that had nothing to do with the cyberbullying .
No doubt that 's why the local authorities did n't prosecute , since they said there was no way to actually say what exactly caused the suicide : " We did not have a charge to fit it , " McGuire says .
" I do n't know that anybody can sit down and say , ' This is why this young girl took her life . ' "
Incidentally , Megan 's mother was quoted in that article saying this : " I do n't feel their intentions were for her to kill herself .
But that 's how it ended .
"
That is what the jury found , actually , that Drew had no intention of causing a suicide .
She did n't set up the account , according to testimony at trial , or send the messages .
But if the mother recognized that there was no intention to cause the suicide , why did she not tell the court that and prevent the prosecutor from going after Drew for intent to cause the suicide ?
Update 2 : Orin Kerr , one of Drew 's attorneys , has posted his summary of what happened and what happens next :
The jury agreed that it is a federal crime to intentionally violate the Terms of Service on a website , and that Drew directly or indirectly did so , but it acquitted Drew of having violated Terms of Service in furtherance of the tortious act .
That is , the jury ruled that Drew is guilty of relatively lower - level crimes for violating MySpacs Terms of Service ( for being involved in the setting up of a fake MySpace account ) .
It acquitted Drew for any role in inflicting distress on Meier or for anything related to Meier 's suicide .
The maximum allowed penalty for the misdemeanor violations are one year in prison for each violation , although the majority of federal misdemeanors result in a sentence of probation .
The next step in the case is that the trial judge will rule on whether there was enough evidence for the jury to find that Drew violated the Terms of Service intentionally , or whether the TOS violation was only negligent or reckless or knowing .
If the judge agrees that there was enough evidence for the jury to find that Drew violated the Terms of Service intentionally , the case will go on to sentencing for the crime of having violated MySpace 's Terms of Service .
After sentencing , if that happens , the sentence will be followed by an appeal before the Ninth Circuit on the legal question of whether it is in fact a federal crime to violate the Terms of Service of a website .
For those not following my coverage of the case , I am one of Drew 's attorneys , and yes , if there is an appeal , I will be very heavily involved in it .
The local prosecutor in Missouri investigated the matter , by the way , and then explained why they did n't prosecute :
In December 3rd , after his review of the case , Jack Banas announced that no charges would be brought .
In Banass reckoning , the Drews are conclusively guilty of little except egregious judgment that set off a chain of horrible events , and deep insensitivity in their aftermath .
He invoked the Duke lacrosse case as a cautionary example of due process succumbing to the passions of a community inflamed .
 Are you going to hug this lady , say she did something great ? he told me .
 No .
She made a huge , fatal mistake by trusting these kids .
But there are undisputed facts and disputed facts , and even if you believe all of them they still dont give you a criminal fact pattern in the state of Missouri . 
The Meiers do not hold Ashley Grills responsible , nor do they blame Michele Mulfords daughter , who sent the message that kicked off the online melee on October 15th .
 If you dont think that child wishes she could go back and change that . . .  Tina said .
 It could easily have been Megan doing that .
Update 3 : You might find it helpful to read the indictment [ PDF ] and the memorandum , points of law and authorities .
The charges she was found guilty of were accessing MySpace without authorization , due to violating the terms of use .
For example , here 's Count 4 , on page 10 of the indictment : " Count 4 , 10/16/06 : Unauthorized Access :
In violation of MySpace TOS , accessed MySpace servers to obtain information regarding M.T.M. "
She did that on three occasions , according to the indictment , accounting for charges 2 - 4 , so that 's three years in prison and $ 300,000 in fines , potentially .
Here 's why the prosecutor thought she could be charged , despite her never reading the terms of use , since she did n't open the account and testified she never saw the terms , from page 4 : A copy of the applicable MySpace TOS was readily available to prospective members , members , and users of the website , who could click on a link titled " Terms of Service " or " Terms " to be directed to a web page where prospective members , members , and users of the website could review those rules .
Also , I found the motion for acquittal [ PDF ] and the prosecutor 's opposition [ PDF ] .
Final Update , Sept. 1 , 2009 : The judge 's ruling -- acquittal [ PDF ] .

2 FACTS AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT Defendant Lori Drew is a Missouri resident charged in the Central District of California with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( " CFAA " ) .
The Government alleges that in the fall of 2006 , Defendant created a MySpace account under the name of " Josh Evans . "
Indictment , United States v. Drew , No. 08-00582 , 6 ( C.D. Cal. May 15 , 2008 ) .
Through the " Josh Evans " account , Defendant communicated and developed an online relationship with Megan Meier , a 13 - year - old girl also living in Missouri .
Indictment at 6 .
At some point during their communications " Josh Evans " said hurtful things to Miss Meier .
Id. at 7 - 8 . Tragically , Miss Meier took her own life .
There are state and federal statutes that regulate harassing and otherwise harmful speech , carefully identifying speech that falls outside of First Amendment protection .
See , e.g. , 47U.S.C. § 223(a) ( 1) ( C ) ; R.S.Mo. 565.090 ( former ) .
1
Neither of those statutes appears to criminalize the communications from " Josh Evans " to Miss Meier here .
In the absence of applicable First Amendment - compliant criminal statutes , the Government has chosen to indict Defendant for violating the CFAA , 18 U.S.C. § 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) , and for conspiring to violate it .
The Government theory is that Defendant 's use of a fictitious name and registration information and her hurtful speech violated the MySpace terms of service ( TOS ) .
See Terms and Conditions -- MySpace.com , http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.terms ( last modified Feb. 28 , 2008 ) .
Defendant allegedly failed to provide truthful and accurate registration information ; failed to refrain from using any information obtained from MySpace services to harass , abuse , or harm other people ; failed to refrain from soliciting personal information from anyone under 18 ; failed to refrain from 3 promoting information that she knew was false or misleading ; and failed to refrain from posting photographs of other people without their consent , all in violation of the terms of use .
Indictment at 6 - 7 .
On the Government 's view , account holders who use their MySpace accounts in violation of the TOS are accessing the company servers " without authorization " or " in excess of authorization . "
In this way , Defendant victimized MySpace when " Josh Evans " did not follow its terms of service .
The Government 's novel and unprecedented response to what everyone recognizes as a tragic situation would create a reading of the CFAA that has dangerous ramifications far beyond the facts here .
Terms of service include prohibitions both trivial and profound .
As detailed in examples below , the Government 's theory would attach criminal penalties to minors under the age of 18 who use the Google search engine , as well as to many individuals who legitimately exercise their First Amendment rights to speak anonymously online .
This effort to stretch the computer crime law in order to punish Defendant Drew for Miss Meier 's death would convert the millions of internet - using Americans who disregard the terms of service associated with online services into federal criminals .
Indeed , survey evidence shows that the majority of teenage MySpace users have entered at least some false information into MySpace , and would thus be subject to prosecution under the Government 's theory .

In fact , child safety advocates like the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre of the British government specifically encourage children to protect themselves by providing misleading identifying information instead of real names on social networking sites .
See Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre , Thinkuknow : Social Networking , 4 http://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/(X()S(z4uckb3yrpokhbemgzsglhm2))/8_10/control/s ocial.aspx ( last visited July 31 , 2008 ) ( " It 's a good idea to use a nickname rather than your real name . " ) .
To the best of amici's knowledge , never before in the 22 - year history of the CFAA has a criminal prosecution been based on such a theory .
The case is reminiscent of United States v. LaMacchia , 871 F.Supp. 535 ( D. Mass. 1994 ) , where the district court rejected a Government attempt to stretch the scope of the federal wire fraud statute , U.S.C. § 1343 , to cover the unauthorized , non-commercial distribution of copyrighted software products over the internet by an MIT student .
At the time , copyright law did not contain criminal provisions against non-commercial infringement .
Noting that the key question was whether , metaphorically , " new wine can be poured into an old bottle , " id . at 536 , the court recognized that : [ w ] hat the Government is seeking to do is to punish conduct that reasonable people might agree deserves the sanctions of the criminal law .
. . .
While the Government 's objective is a laudable one , particularly when the facts alleged in this case are considered , its interpretation of the wire fraud statute would serve to criminalize the conduct of not only persons like LaMacchia , but also the myriad of home computer users who succumb to the temptation to copy even a single software program for private use .
Id. at 544.2
The case is also reminiscent of United States v. McDanel , prosecuted by this same United States Attorney 's office under a different provision of the CFAA before ___________ 5 the Government admitted error on appeal and moved to overturn the defendant 's conviction .
See United States v. McDanel , Government Brief , attached as Exhibit A , at 6 , 8 .
In McDanel , the Government stretched the definition of " harm to the integrity " of a computer system to cover truthful reports about a security vulnerability that could endanger a customer 's private communications .
The Government 's proposed interpretation of the CFAA in this case is a similar stretch , one that is unsupported by case law or Congressional intent , is overbroad and unconstitutionally vague , and would punish constitutionally protected activities .
This Court should reject the unwarranted expansion of the CFAA and dismiss the indictment .
I. THIS COURT SHOULD DISMISS THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT CHARGES AGAINST DEFENDANT DREW BECAUSE HER ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE MYSPACE TERMS OF USE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE " UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS " OR " EXCEEDING AUTHORIZED ACCESS " UNDER THE STATUTE A MySpace account holder does not gain unauthorized access or exceed authorized access to MySpace servers by disregarding conditions set forth in that service 's terms of service ( TOS ) .
The CFAA criminalizes unauthorized access to a computer system or to information on the system .
Both the plain language of the statute and the legislative history show that the statute is meant to punish trespassers and " hackers , " not users who ignore or violate sites ' contracts or customers who misuse the service .
A. By Its Plain Terms , The Computer Fraud And Abuse Act Prohibits Trespass And Theft , Not Mere Contractual Violations Of Terms Of Use
The fundamental question in this case is when access to a highly popular , everyday web site is " without authorization " or in excess of authorized access .
3
The 6 plain language of the CFAA does not criminalize an account holder 's use of a computer in violation of TOS , but rather a trespasser 's access to computer systems or areas of computer networks without permission .
In other words , the statute prohibits trespass and theft , not improper motive or use .
Every exercise of statutory interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute .
Christensen v. C.I.R. , 523 F.3d 957 , 962 ( 9th Cir. 2008 ) ( Courts look to the plain language of a statute , and to legislative history ) .
The Government charged Defendant with 18 U.S.C. 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) , which states : ( a ) Whoever -- ... ( 2 ) intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access , and thereby obtains --... ( C ) information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication ; ... shall be punished as provided in subsection ( c ) of this section .
Although Congress did not define the phrase " without authorization , " it did so for the phrase " exceeds authorized access " .
The term " exceeds authorized access " means : " to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accessor is not entitled so to obtain or alter . "
18 U.S.C. § 1030 ( e ) ( 6 ) ( 2008 ) .
The plain language of the statute prohibits trespass , either by outsiders who have no rights to the computer system , or by " insiders " who have some rights to access the computer system , but have limited rights to access or alter information on that same system .
The Indictment in this case does not allege whether the defendant 's access to the MySpace service was " without authorization " or " in excess of authorized access " or both .
Regardless , both prongs of 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) are straightforward prohibitions against computer trespass .
The first covers outsiders who have no rights to the computer system , and the second covers " insiders " who have some rights to access the computer system , but do not have rights to access or alter certain files or information on that same system .
If the computer owner gives 7 the user the ability to access to particular information , then the user does not exceed his authorization by accessing that information , regardless of the purpose or manner of such access .
Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Speed , 2006 WL 2683058 , * 5 ( M.D. Fla. Aug. 1 , 2006 ) ( plain reading of " exceeds authorized access " means " those [ who go ] above [ their ] authorization , meaning those that go beyond the permitted access granted to them typically insiders exceeding whatever access is permitted to them " ) .
The plain language of Section 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) targets " the unauthorized procurement or alteration of information , not its misuse or misappropriation . "
Shamrock Foods v. Gast , 535 F. Supp. 2d 962 , 965 ( D. Ariz. 2008 ) ( citing Brett Senior & Assocs . , P.C. v. Fitzgerald , 2007 WL 2043377 ( E.D. Pa. July 13 , 2007 ) ) .
B. The Legislative History Supports The View That The CFAA Prohibits Trespass And Theft , Not Improper Motive Or Use .
The legislative history confirms that Congress intended the CFAA to criminalize intruders who trespassed on computers and computer networks .
Int'l Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Werner - Masuda , 390 F . Supp. 2d 479 , 495-96 ( D. Md 2005 ) ( citing S. Rep. No. 99-432 , at 4 ( 1986 ) , reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479 , 2482 ( explaining that the CFAA " is a consensus bill aimed at deterring and punishing certain ' high - tech ' crimes " ) ) .
The CFAA was originally called the Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and was enacted in 1984 .
Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , Pub . L. No. 98-473 , Title II , § 2102 ( a ) , 98 Stat. 1937 ( 1984 ) ( prior to 1986 amendment ) .
The 1984 House Committee emphasized that " section 1030 deals with an ' unauthorized access ' concept of computer fraud rather than the mere use of a computer .
Thus , the conduct prohibited is analogous to that of ' breaking and entering ' rather than using a computer . . . in committing the offense . "
H.R. Rep. No. 98-894 at 20 ( 1984 ) reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3689 , 3706 .
Consequently , the committee report emphasized concerns about " hackers " who " trespass into " computers and the inability of " password codes " to protect against this threat .
Id. at 8 10 - 11 , reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3689 , 3695 - 97 .
The 1984 version of the law criminalized actions of one who gains " unauthorized access " or who " having accessed a computer with authorization , uses the opportunity such access provides for purposes to which such authorization does not extend . "
In 1986 , Congress deleted the part of the statute that prohibited those with authorization from using the system for unauthorized purposes and substituted the phrase " exceeds authorized access . "
Werner - Masuda , 390 F . Supp. 2d , 479 , 499 n. 12 ( D. Md. 2005 ) ( quoting S. Rep. No. 99-432 , at 9 ( 1986 ) , reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479 , 2486 ) .
As the court in Werner - Masuda explains :
By enacting this amendment , and providing an express definition for " exceeds authorized access , " the intent was to " eliminate coverage for authorized access that aims at `purposes to which such authorization does not extend , ' " thereby " removing from the sweep of the statute one of the murkier grounds of liability , under which a [ person 's ] access to computerized data might be legitimate in some circumstances , but criminal in other ( not clearly distinguishable ) circumstances that might be held to exceed his authorization .
Id. at 499 n.12 ( quoting S. Rep. No. 99-432 , at 21 , 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2479 , 2494-95 ) ( alterations in original ) .
Congress used the " exceeds authorized access " language to avoid extending criminal liability to employees where administrative sanctions were more appropriate .
Id .
This intention is further supported by the fact that , when discussing the CFAA , and specifically section ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) , legislators often referred to " hackers " and the need to protect sensitive information from theft .
See , e.g. , 142 Cong. Rec. E1621-03 ( daily ed. Sept. 17 , 1996 ) ( statement of Rep. Goodlatte ) ; see also 14 Cong. Rec. S9423 ( daily ed. June 29 , 1995 ) ( statement of Sen. Leahy ) .
The modern , conventional usage of " hacker " is usually someone who gains unauthorized access to a computer typically to obtain information of value he or she is not entitled to obtain , or to cause damage .
See , e.g. , Oxford English Dictionary , Oxford Univ .
Press ( defining , inter alia , a hacker as " a person who uses his skill with computers to try to gain unauthorized access to computer files or networks " ) ; see also United States v. 9 Riggs , 739 F. Supp. 414 , 423-24 ( N.D. Ill. 1990 ) ( citing approvingly to sources that define hackers as those using computer skills to gain unauthorized access to a computer system ) .
The legislative history makes no mention of unauthorized or excessive access obtained through ignorance or disregard of private terms of service .
The legislative history supports the conclusion that the CFAA criminalizes trespasses in which the user gains access to computer services or information to which he is not entitled , not those in which an authorized individual uses the services or information in an impermissible manner .
Defendant Drew had an account on MySpace , a free interactive internet - based social network open to anyone who signs up for the service .
There are no fees , no vetting , no checks on who may use the service .
Usernames and passwords are deployed , not to keep people off MySpace , but to give users control over their own account profiles and keep such profiles separate .
Defendant Drew allegedly used her account to access MySpace services and information .
She had no special skill with computers and did not circumvent any security measures , technological or otherwise .
As is any member of the public who signs up and holds an account , she was authorized to use the service and to access the system , including information stored there .
The way she used her account , if the allegations are true , was reprehensible .
But unless her hateful speech rises to the level of harassment or stalking , it is not criminal and cannot be punished ; attempting instead to punish that speech under the CFAA merely because it took place on the internet in contravention to a private terms of service is improper .
C. Courts Are Justifiably Wary Even Of Civil Enforcement
Of Website Terms
Of Service Adopting the erroneous view of the CFAA propounded by the prosecution in this case would criminalize the actions of internet users or web service account holders who violate a mere contractual promise to use a computer in a certain way or who ignore or disregard terms of service hidden behind a " legal notices " hyperlink at the bottom of a webpage .
As detailed in Section III.A , infra , many , perhaps most , 10 internet users do not even read or understand these documents , which are often long , riddled with legalese , and poorly organized and formatted or typically are written at a level of difficulty that exceeds the ability of most consumers to understand .
Accord Robert W. Gomulkiewicz , Getting Serious About User - Friendly Mass Market Licensing for Software , 12 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 687 , 692-94 , 701-02 ( 2004 ) ; Alan M. White & Cathy Lesser Mansfield , Literacy and Contract , 13 Stan. L. & Pol 'y Rev. 233 , 235-42 ( 2002 ) .
Significantly , the Government in this case has not alleged that the Defendant or co-conspirators ever read or even looked at the MySpace terms , but only that the terms " were readily available " to users " who could click on a link titled ' Terms of Service ' or ' Terms ' to be directed to a web page where [ they ] could review those rules . "

Indeed , the current prosecution would impose criminal liability for merely ignoring or violating terms of service at a time that courts and academics continue to debate the extent to which and under what circumstances such documents should be enforced as a matter of regular civil contract law .
See , e.g. , Mark A. Lemley , Terms of Use , 91 Minn.
L. Rev. 459 , 462-63 , 475-76 ( 2006 ) ( citing cases and noting differences in enforceability between corporate - entity defendants and individuals ) .
Among the thorny issues that are presented by such cases are whether the user receives adequate actual or constructive notice of the terms , whether the user effectively consents and whether the terms are unconscionable .
Whatever the merits of recognizing private , civil contract obligations and remedies in such situations , however , the imposition of serious criminal liability in light of these problems would be fundamentally unfair .
11 D. Imposing Criminal Liability For Ignoring Or Violating Terms Of Service Would Be An Unprecedented , Extraordinary And Dangerous Extension Of Federal Criminal Law George Washington University Law Professor Orin Kerr has argued thoughtfully and persuasively that " unauthorized access " should not include access to a computer in violation of a contract or terms of service .
Doing so would : threaten a dramatic and potentially unconstitutional expansion of criminal liability in cyberspace .
Because Internet users routinely ignore the legalese that they encounter in contracts governing the use of websites , Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) , and other computers , broad judicial interpretations of unauthorized access statutes could potentially make millions of Americans criminally liable for the way they send e- mails and surf the Web .
Orin S. Kerr , Cybercrime 's Scope : Interpreting " Access " and " Authorization " in Computer Misuse Statutes , 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1596 , 1599 ( 2003 ) .
Consider the remarkable and disturbing results that a contract - based approach to authorized access can create under the CFAA : Imagine that a website owner announces that only right - handed people can view his website , or perhaps only friendly people .
Under the contract - based approach , a visit to the site by a left - handed or surly person is an unauthorized access that may trigger state and federal criminal laws .
A computer owner could set up a public web page , announce that " no one is allowed to visit my web page , " and then refer for prosecution anyone who clicks on the site out of curiosity .
By granting the computer owner essentially unlimited authority to define authorization , the contract standard delegates the scope of criminality to every computer owner .
Id. at 1650 - 51 .
Professor Kerr 's concerns are not merely hypothetical .
There are many surprising terms of service provisions that , if violated , would convert authorized users into federal criminals .
Take for example , two of the internet 's most popular websites ' terms of service : " You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if ( a ) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Google , " Google Terms of Service , § 2.3 , http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS
( last modified Apr. 16 , 2007 ) . 12 " [ Y ] ou agree to . . . provide accurate , current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Site ( " Registration Data " ) . . . [ and ] maintain and promptly update the Registration Data , and any other information you provide to Company , to keep it accurate , current and complete . . . . "
Facebook Terms of Use , http://www.facebook.com/terms.php ( last modified June 7 , 2008 ) .
On the Government 's view , a user who is under the age of majority violates the CFAA every time she enters a search query on the Google.com webpage and obtains information .
Under Facebook 's terms of use , if a user changes jobs or addresses or even her thoughts on what her favorite movie is , she would need to immediately tell Facebook , as this is information she has provided to the company , or run the risk that her continued use of the site could lead to criminal sanctions .

In another example , the Electronic Frontier Foundation reports that terms of service for the popular dating site Match.com require users of either the website or the dating service to be single or separated from their spouses .
See , e.g. , Match.com Terms of Use Agreement , http://www.match.com/registration/membagr.aspx
( " You must be at least eighteen ( 18 ) years of age and single or separated from your spouse to register as a member of Match.com or use the Website . " ) ( last visited July 30 , 2008 ) .
The brief 's author has not been able to visit the site to confirm the report ; because she remains happily married , doing so would be a violation of the site 's terms , potentially a criminal act under the interpretation of the CFAA advanced by the Government here .
13 E. The Better View , Supported By More Recent Cases , Rejects CFAA Liability For Authorized Users Acting Outside the Terms and Conditions of That Authorization Professor Kerr 's concern about applying the CFAA to contract violations followed holdings by several courts in civil cases that a disloyal employee 's use of a computer or a competitor 's automated searching of a system for commercial purposes could violate the statute .
However , the more recent and better view , consistent with Kerr 's well - reasoned analysis , rejects the idea that authorized access becomes unauthorized , and thus criminal , when the user acts with his own purposes , rather than those of the computer owner , in mind .
See , e.g. , Werner - Masuda , 390 F . Supp. 2d at 495-96 ; Brett Senior & Assocs. , 2007 WL 2043377 ; Diamond Power Int'l , Inc. v. Davidson , 540 F. Supp. 2d 1322 ( N.D. Ga. 2007 ) ; Lockheed Martin Corp. , 2006 WL 2683058 .
This better view rejects CFAA liability even where the defendant is a former employee violating a negotiated employment contract or confidentiality agreement by transferring confidential information to a rival company for the employee 's own economic benefit and to the detriment of the computer owner .
The instant case is a far easier one : all that is alleged here is that the defendant violated the standard MySpace service terms of use , and did so without any purpose to gather trade secrets or commercial or proprietary data , or to gain any economic advantage .
1 . More Recent , Better - Reasoned Cases Adopt A Narrower View Of " Exceeding Authorized Access "
The better - reasoned cases hold that if a user is authorized to access a computer and information stored there , then doing so is not criminal , even if that access is in violation of a contractual agreement or non-negotiated terms of use .
For example , in Werner - Masuda the plaintiff argued that the defendant , a union officer , exceeded her authorization to use the union computer when she accessed a membership list to send to a rival union , and not for legitimate union business .
The defendant had signed an agreement promising that she would not access union computers " contrary to the 14 policies and procedures of the [ union ] Constitution " .
Werner - Masuda , 390 F. Supp. 2d at 495 ( D. Md. 2005 ) .
The District Court rejected this argument , holding that even if the defendant breached a contract , that breach of a promise not to use information stored on union computers in a particular way did not mean her access to that information was unauthorized or criminal .
Thus , to the extent that Werner - Masuda may have breached the Registration Agreement by using the information obtained for purposes contrary to the policies established by the [ union ]
Constitution , it does not follow , as a matter of law , that she was not authorized to access the information , or that she did so in excess of her authorization in violation of the [ Stored Communications Act ] or the CFAA .
. . .
Although Plaintiff may characterize it as so , the gravamen of its complaint is not so much that Werner - Masuda improperly accessed the information contained in VLodge , but rather what she did with the information once she obtained it .
. . .
Nor do [ the ] terms [ of the Stored Communications Act and the CFAA ] proscribe authorized access for unauthorized or illegitimate purposes .
( citations omitted ) Id. at 499 .
Here , too , the gravamen of the Government 's complaint is not that Defendant improperly obtained information to which she was not entitled on the MySpace servers , but rather that she used the MySpace service for an unauthorized or illegitimate purpose .
The CFAA does not proscribe authorized access for unauthorized or illegitimate purposes .
Thus , to the extent that Defendant may have breached the Terms of Service by using a MySpace account contrary to the policies established by the company , it does not follow that she was not authorized to access the MySpace servers in violation of the CFAA .
Subsequent cases have followed the reasoning of Werner - Masuda based on either plain language or legislative history .
In Lockheed Martin Corp .
the court found no CFAA violation under the plain language of the statute .
" Exceeds authorized access , " the opinion states , refers to those employees " that go beyond the permitted access granted to them typically insiders exceeding whatever access is permitted to them . "
Lockheed Martin Corp. , 2006 WL 2683058 , at * 5 . In Diamond Power Int'l , Inc. v. Davidson , the District Court similarly rejected 15 a CFAA claim against an employee who violated an employment agreement by using his access to his employer computer system to steal data for a competitor .
The defendant transferred information from password - protected computer drives to his new employer while still employed with the former company in violation of a confidentiality agreement .
Davidson , 540 F. Supp. 2d at 1327 -31 .
Correctly identifying the narrower interpretation of " exceeding authorized access " as " the more reasoned view , " the court held that " a violation for accessing `without authorization ' occurs only where initial access is not permitted .
And a violation for `exceeding authorized access ' occurs where initial access is permitted but the access of certain information is not permitted . "
Id. at 1343 .
In Brett Senior & Assocs. , an employer alleged that its former employee misused confidential information at his new employer in violation of the CFAA .
While still working with his former employer , the employee interviewed with a rival company and showed it a list of his employer 's clients and those the details of those clients ' business with the company .
Before leaving to join the new firm , the employee then contacted 20 of his clients and convinced 15 of them to come with him to the new firm .
Brett Senior & Assocs. , P.C. , 2007 WL 2043377 at * 1 .
The court relied on the legislative history to reject the former employer 's CFAA claim .
The employee defendant had full access to information contained in the computer system until his departure , and the court concluded that a CFAA violation is a trespass offense , not a misuse of services offense .
Id. at * 3 . In Shamrock Foods v. Gast , under similar facts , the District Court relied on Davidson and Werner - Masuda to hold that the defendant did not access the information at issue " without authorization " or in a manner that " exceed[ed ] authorized access . "
Shamrock Foods , 535 F. Supp. 2d at 968 .
The defendant had an employee account on the computer he used at his employer Shamrock and was permitted to view the specific files he allegedly emailed to himself .
The CFAA did not apply , even though the emailing was for the improper purpose of benefiting 16 himself and a rival company in violation of the defendant 's Confidentiality Agreement .
6 See Werner - Masuda , 390 F.Supp. 2d at 496 ( interpreting the same language " prohibit[ing ] only unauthorized access and not the misappropriation or disclosure of information " in the Stored Communications Act ( SCA ) , 18 U.S.C. § 2701 ( a ) to mean that " there is no violation of section 2701 for a person with authorized access to the database no matter how malicious or larcenous his intended use of that access . " ( quoting Educ'al Testing Service v. Stanley H. Kaplan , Educ'al Ctr. , Ltd. , 965 F. Supp. 731 , 740 ( D. Md. 1997 ) ( " [ I ]t appears evident that the sort of trespasses to which the [ SCA ] applies are those in which the trespasser gains access to information to which he is not entitled to see , not those in which the trespasser uses the information in an unauthorized way . " ) ) ) .
2 . Older Cases Wrongly Adopted A Broader View Of " Exceeding Authorized Access "
The cases discussed above contrast with and reject earlier decisions , most importantly Shurgard Storage Ctrs. , Inc. v. Safeguard Self Storage , Inc. , 119 F. Supp. 2d 1121 ( W.D. Wash . 2000 ) , which introduced an agency theory of authorization under the CFAA that several courts have followed .
Shurgard follows neither the plain language nor the legislative intent of the CFAA and would lead to a variety of troubling and potentially unconstitutional results .
See id .
The reasoning in Werner - Masuda is both persuasive and correct and , to the extent that Shurgard takes a different approach , this Court should reject it .
In Shurgard , the District Court denied a motion to dismiss a CFAA claim brought by an employee that took employer information from the computer system 17 with him to his next job .
Id. at 1129 .
The court relied on the Restatement ( Second ) of Agency , § 112 ( 1958 ) , to hold that when the plaintiff 's former employees accepted new jobs with the defendant , the employees " lost their authorization and were ' without authorization ' [ under the CFAA ] when they allegedly obtained and sent [ the plaintiff 's ] proprietary information to the defendant via e-mail " ) .
Shurgard , 119 F. Supp. 2d at 1125 .
The court examined the Senate report accompanying Congress 's 1996 amendments to the CFAA , and concluded that Congress intended the statute to have " broad meaning " that was intended to cover the situation under dispute .
Id. at 1129 .
But the 1996 amendments were of little relevance to the authorization issues in Shurgard or here , as those amendments replaced the term " federal interest computer " with " protected computer . "
18 U.S.C. § 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) ( 2008 ) .
In contrast the district court in Werner - Masuda relied heavily on the 1986 Senate report accompanying the CFAA .
Werner - Masuda , 390 F. Supp. 2d at 497-499 .
The 1986 amendments are the relevant ones because those are the amendments that added the term " exceeds authorized access . "
16 U.S.C. § 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) ( 2008 ) .
This is the term at issue here because it is the part of the statute that reaches insiders who are allowed access for some purposes , but not for others .
For this reason , Werner - Masuda 's take on the legislative history of the CFAA is far more persuasive than that of the court in Shurgard on the critical issue of whether Defendant Drew gained unauthorized access or exceeding authorized access .
A few cases find that , in the civil employment context , the principles of agency mean that an employee accesses a computer " without authorization " if , without knowledge of the employer , the employee uses the employers computer system in a manner adverse to the employer 's interests .
See , e.g. , Int'l Airport Ctrs. , L.L.C. v. Citrin , 440 F.3d 418 , 420-421 ( 7th Cir. 2006 ) ; ViChip Corp. v. Lee , 438 F. Supp. 2d 1087 , 1100 ( N.D. Cal. 2006 ) .
Several earlier cases also found a CFAA violation for non-employees , but only after clear and repeated warnings that the user 's conduct was not authorized , and only under circumstances where the user 18 either had a fiduciary duty to the computer owner or where the access was for competitive commercial gain , facts significantly absent in this case .
See EF Cultural Travel BV v. Zefer Corp. 318 F.3d 58 ( 1st Cir. 2003 ) , ( rejecting a CFAA claim based on a " reasonable expectations " test but stating in dicta that " a lack of authorization could be established by an explicit statement on the website restricting access " ) ; EF Cultural Travel BV v. Explorica Inc. , 274 F.3d 577 ( 1st Cir. 2001 ) ( finding CFAA liability where the defendant poached an ex-EF employee , who in turn revealed confidential information about his former employer which improved the competitor 's use of automated tools to search and " systematically glean company 's prices from [ competitor 's ] website " ) ; Southwest Airlines Co. v. FareChase Inc. , 318 F. Supp. 2d 435 ( N.D. Tex. 2004 ) ( defendant created an automated tool that " scraped " web site information and allowed corporate travelers to search online for airline fares , including Southwest 's .
despite the plaintiff 's " repeated warnings and requests " to cease ) ; Register.com , Inc. v. Verio , Inc. , 126 F. Supp. 2d 238 ( S.D.N.Y .
2000 ) ( court enjoined automatic searching of the registrant contact information contained in domain registry database after lawyers specifically objected to the defendant 's use and sent out a terms of use letter to the defendant ) , aff'd in part as modified by Register.com , Inc. v. Verio , Inc. , 356 F.3d 393 ( 2d Cir. 2004 ) ( reversing the trial court 's CFAA finding on the basis that there was insufficient likelihood of showing the $ 5,000 damage threshold necessary for private claims , but upholding a trespass to chattels claim ) ; America Online Inc. v. LCGM , Inc. , 46 F. Supp. 2d 444 ( E.D. Va. 1998 ) ( " AOL " ) , ( the defendant transmitted more than 92 million unsolicited and bulk e-mail messages advertising their pornographic Web sites to AOL members in violation of AOL 's email policies and terms of use ) .
These civil cases are readily distinguished from the criminal prosecution of Defendant Drew here because all but AOL involve actual prior notice to the defendant that their computer access was unauthorized , rather than the mere posting of terms of service on a website which could be ignored or violated by a user .
These 19 cases also all involve use of the plaintiff 's computer service for the defendant 's commercial advantage to the detriment of the computer system owner .
See Lemley , 91 Minn.
L. Rev. at 476-77 ( noting a greater willingness of some courts to enforce terms against businesses than against consumers ) .
Here , Defendant Drew allegedly failed to provide truthful and accurate registration information ; failed to refrain from using any information obtained from MySpace services to harass , abuse , or harm other people ; failed to refrain from soliciting personal information from anyone under 18 ; failed to refrain from promoting information that she knew was false or misleading ; and failed to refrain from posting photographs of other people without their consent .
The indictment does not allege even that Defendant had seen or knew of these terms in the MySpace TOS , but she certainly did not receive any direct warnings to stop .
Nor was she acting for commercial advantage in a way that could be seen as unfairly competing with or harming MySpace 's business , factors important to the decisions in virtually all the above cases .
Apart from these important factual distinctions , for the reasons stated , these cases were wrongly decided , in light of the plain language and the legislative history of the CFAA .
F. The Rule Of Lenity Requires The Narrower Interpretation Of The CFAA 's " Access " Language
The rule of lenity should guide the construction of section 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) in this case because the CFAA is first and foremost a criminal statute .
See Leocal v. Ashcroft , 543 U.S. 1 , 12 n. 8 ( 2008 ) ; United States v. Thompson / Center Arms Co. , 504 U.S. 505 , 517-18 ( 1992 ) .
The rule of lenity " requires a court confronted with two rational readings of a criminal statute , one harsher than the other , to choose the harsher only when Congress has spoken in clear and definite language . "
Shamrock Foods , 535 F. Supp. 2d at 965-67 ( plain language of the statute , legislative history and rule of lenity support a narrow view of the CFAA ) ; see Pasquantino v. United States , 544 U.S. 349 , 383 ( 2005 ) ; McNally v. United States , 483 U.S. 350 , 359-60 20 ( 1987 ) .
Here , because Congress has not proactively specified that the CFAA 's " access " provisions criminalize mere violations of terms of service , the rule of lenity requires that courts adopt the " less harsh " interpretation .
See , e.g. , United States v. Miranda - Lopez , 2008 WL 2762392 at * 5 ( 9th Cir. July 17 , 2008 ) ( " the ' longstanding ' rule of lenity requires us to resolve any ambiguity in the scope of a criminal statute in favor of the defendant " ( citations omitted ) ) .
This is the approach taken by the court in Shamrock Foods Co. in adopting the narrower interpretation of " accesses . . . without authorization or exceeds authorized access . "
The court there used the rule of lenity to reject imposition of CFAA liability on a disloyal former employee , concluding " [t ] he approach advanced by Shamrock would sweep broadly within the criminal statute breaches of contract involving a computer .
. . .
The Court declines the invitation to open the doorway to federal court so expansively when this reach is not apparent from the plain language of the CFAA . "
Shamrock Foods at 967 ( emphasis added ) .
United States v. LaMacchia reached a similar result as the rule of lenity would require .
Because Congress had failed to criminalize non-commercial distribution of copyrighted materials , the Government was not entitled to stretch a broader statute regulating a different kind of conduct to punish admittedly bad conduct .
LaMacchia , 871 F. Supp. 535 ( D. Mass. 1994 ) .
If Congress wanted to criminalize the conduct at issue here , it could have .
If Congress wanted to give the force of law to terms of service agreements , it can .
But it did not , and the rule of lenity does not permit the Government to use the CFAA to reach that result .
G. The Government 's Previous Attempt In This District To Expand Civil Cases Interpreting the CFAA into the Criminal Context Led To The Wrongful Conviction And Incarceration Of An Individual For Constitutionally Protected Activities
In a disturbingly similar expansion of civil CFAA cases to support a criminal prosecution under a different section of the CFAA , 18 U.S.C. § 1030 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) , the United States Attorney 's Office in this district from 2001 to 2003 prosecuted 21 computer programmer Bret McDanel , United States v. McDanel , Ninth Circuit Case No. 03-50135 , Central District of California Case No. CR-01-638-LGB .
McDanel worked for a Tornado , a Los Angeles firm that provided Web - based email and voice mail services .
While employed there , he discovered a serious security flaw in the company 's email system , which intruders could exploit to read customers ' private messages .
He brought the flaw to the company 's attention , but it was n't fixed .
After he left Tornado , McDanel sent an anonymous email to Tornado customers , describing the security flaw , and directing customers to a website McDanel had set up providing more information .
The Government indicted McDanel for violating the CFAA , alleging that because he sent emails to customers '
Tornado.com email addresses , and these emails gave customers information that the company did not want its users to have , McDanel intentionally caused damage to the integrity of Tornado 's email server .
The Government relied heavily on Shurgard 's agency law theory , arguing that McDanel acted without the best interests of Tornado in mind , so his emails were improper .
McDanel was convicted and sentenced to 16 months in prison .
On appeal to the Ninth Circuit , 7 the Government reversed its position , " confess[ed ] error , " and moved to dismiss the charges against McDanel .
( See United States v. McDanel , Government Brief , attached as Exhibit A , at 6 , 8 ) .
While McDanel sent information to Tornado 's servers , and while that information caused harm to Tornado 's business ( by reducing customer confidence in the privacy and security of their messages ) , the Government admitted that that type of harm could not be a CFAA violation unless it was intended to help someone illegally access the system or change data there .
Id. at 8 .
The flaw in the current prosecution and that of McDanel is the same .
The Government seeks to extend the reasoning of disfavored civil law cases from the employment or commercial context to argue that any use of 22 a computer server in a manner contrary to the interests of the server owner is a crime .
As with the prosecution of Mr. McDanel , this prosecution is in error .
II .
APPLYING THE CFAA TO DEFENDANT'S CONDUCT IN THIS CASE WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS ENCROACHMENT ON FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL LIBERTIES , INCLUDING FREEDOM OF SPEECH A. The First Amendment Assures The Right To Speak Anonymously Online Individuals have the qualified right to speak anonymously , including on the internet , so criminal prosecution for failing to supply accurate identifying information to an online communications service endangers First Amendment rights .
Yet one of the alleged violations of the MySpace terms of service on which the Government bases this Indictment is Defendant 's use of a fictitious name in registering for an account .
See Indictment at 6 .
Average internet users may have numerous valid reasons for wanting to keep their identities secret .
Individuals may want to protect themselves from unwanted attention or from unwanted advertising , even while the service providers hope to sell customer 's personally indentifying information or send advertising .
They may wish to avoid having their views stereotyped according to their racial , ethnic or class characteristics , or their gender .
They may be associated with an organization but want to express an opinion of their own , without running the risk that readers will assume that the group feels the same way .
They may want to say or imply things about themselves that they are unwilling to disclose otherwise .
And they may wish to present provocative ideas that they fear could subject them to retaliation .
Not surprisingly , in a recent survey , almost one - third of social network users admitted to providing false information to protect their identities .
Antony Savvas , Social Network Users Hide Identities , Computer Weekly , Sept. 25 , 2007 .
The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right to anonymous speech in a variety of contexts , noting that " [ a ] nonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority . . . [ that ] exemplifies the purpose [ of the First Amendment ] to protect 23 unpopular individuals from retaliation ... at the hand of an intolerant society . "
McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n , 514 U.S. 334 , 357 ( 1995 ) ; see also id . at 342 ( " an author 's decision to remain anonymous , like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a publication , is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment . " ) ; Gibson v. Fla. Legislative Investigative Comm. , 372 U.S. 539 , 544 ( 1963 ) ( " [ I ]t is ... clear that [ free speech guarantees ] ... encompass [ ] protection of privacy association ... " ) ;
Talley v. California , 362 U.S. 60 , 64 ( 1960 ) ( finding a municipal ordinance requiring identification on hand - bills unconstitutional , and noting that " [ a ] nonymous pamphlets , leaflets , brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind . " ) .
The First Amendment applies fully to internet communications , including email and the World Wide Web . Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844 , 870 ( 1997 ) ( there is " no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment protection that should be applied to " the internet ) .
Numerous courts have specifically upheld the right to communicate anonymously on the internet .
See , e.g. , Doe v. TheMart.com Inc. , 140 F. Supp. 2d 1088 , 1092 ( W.D. Wash .
2001 ) ( " The right to speak anonymously extends to speech via the internet .
Internet anonymity facilitates the rich , diverse , and far ranging exchange of ideas . " ) ; ACLU v. Johnson , 4 F. Supp. 2d 1029 , 1033 ( D.N.M. 1998 ) ; ACLU of Ga. v. Miller , 977 F. Supp. 1228 , 1230 ( N.D. Ga. 1997 ) ; see also ApolloMEDIA Corp. v. Reno , 526 U.S. 1061 ( 1999 ) , aff'd 19 F. Supp. 2d 1081 , 1085 n.5 ( C.D. Cal. 1998 ) ( protecting anonymous denizens of a web site at www.annoy.com, a site " created and designed to annoy " legislators through anonymous communications ) ; Global Telemedia Int'l v. Does , 132 F. Supp. 2d 1261 , 1267 ( C.D. Cal. 2001 ) ( striking complaint based on anonymous postings on Yahoo ! message board based on California 's anti-SLAPP statute ) .
It is true that the constitutional privilege to remain anonymous is not absolute .
Plaintiffs may properly seek information necessary to pursue reasonable and meritorious litigation .
Columbia Ins. Co. v. Seescandy.com , 185 F.R.D. 573 , 578 24 ( N.D. Cal. 1999 ) ( First Amendment does not protect anonymous internet users from liability for tortious acts such as defamation ) ; Doe v. Cahill , 884 A.2d 451 , 456 ( Del. 2005 ) ( " Certain classes of speech , including defamatory and libelous speech , are entitled to no constitutional protection . " ) .
Also , individuals can choose to waive their free speech rights , and courts may enforce confidentiality agreements over a First Amendment defense .
See Snepp v. United States , 444 U.S. 507 , 510 ( 1980 ) ( per curiam ) .
However , the law does not presume a waiver of constitutional rights in contract so courts give heightened scrutiny to the enforceability of such agreements .
Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n , 301 U.S. 292 , 307 ( 1937 ) .
To enforce such a contract , the waiver must not undermine the relevant public interest .
See D. H. Overmyer Co. v. Frick Co. , 405 U.S. 174 , 187-88 ( 1972 ) .
In this case , even assuming , arguendo , that the MySpace TOS is privately enforceable in spite of its contractual infirmities and restrictions on protected anonymous speech , monetary damages , not criminal convictions and prison sentences , " are always the default remedy for breach of contract . "
United States v. Winstar Corp. , 518 U.S. 839 , 885 ( 1996 ) ( plurality opinion ) .
" Our system of contract remedies rejects , for the most part , compulsion of the promisor as a goal .
It does not impose criminal penalties on one who refuses to perform his promise , nor does it generally require him to pay punitive damages . "
Canada Dry Corp. v. Nehi Beverage Co. , 723 F.2d 512 , 526 ( 7th Cir.1983 ) .
Yet the Government 's construction of " without authorization or exceeds authorized access " in this case , based in part on Defendant Drew 's alleged failure to supply " truthful and accurate registration information , " Indictment at 5 , 7 , would make the assertion of protected anonymity the basis for criminal liability .
While " [t ] he Government may violate [ the First Amendment ] in many ways , . . . imposing criminal penalties on protected speech is a stark example of speech suppression . "
Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal. , 535 U.S. 234 , 244 ( 2002 ) .
The First Amendment problems begin with , but do not end with , the right to 25 speak anonymously .
Under the Government 's construction of the CFAA , speech that violates any terms of service would be unauthorized or in excess of authorization and potentially criminal .
If the comment policy of a web site specified " no comments favorable to Democrats " or " no comments that are off - topic " or " no bad stuff " those expressions too would be swept into the reach of the CFAA .
B. Constitutional Avoidance Dictates A Narrow Reading Of " Access " Under The CFAA
This Court need not decide whether enforcing the CFAA would violate the First Amendment in this case .
The mere fact that the question arises , however , requires this Court to interpret " exceeds authorized access " narrowly , so as to avoid a potentially unconstitutional application .
" ' [ I ]t is a cardinal principle ' of statutory interpretation . . . that when an Act of Congress raises ' a serious doubt ' as to its constitutionality , `this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute 62 is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided . ' "
Zadvydas v. Davis , 533 U.S. 678 , 689 ( 2001 ) ( quoting Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22 , 62 ( 1932 ) ) .
A narrow construction of " unauthorized access " and " exceeds authorized access " one which does not punish the failure to use truthful identification information when using online services that indicate an interest in collecting this data in their terms of use is both possible and otherwise compelled by the statutory language and history of the CFAA .
III .
APPLICATION OF THE CFAA WHEN A USER IGNORES OR VIOLATES WEBSITE TERMS OF SERVICE WOULD VIOLATE DUE PROCESS AND RENDER THE STATUTE VOID FOR VAGUENESS AND LACK OF FAIR NOTICE Grounding criminal liability under section 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) , as the Government seeks to do here , on an interpretation of " access without authorization " and / or " exceeds authorized access " that is based entirely on whether a person has fully complied with the vagaries of privately created , frequently unread , generally lengthy and impenetrable terms of service would strip the statute of adequate notice to citizens of what conduct is criminally prohibited and render it hopelessly and 26 unconstitutionally vague .
If the Government 's proposed construction of 18 U.S.C. 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) in this case is correct , not only the defendant but also potentially millions of otherwise innocent internet users would be committing frequent criminal violations of the CFAA through ordinary , indeed routine , online behavior which they have been given no reason to believe would make them felons .
The lack of notice under the Government 's interpretation is stark ; counsel for amici are not aware of a single criminal prosecution or conviction in the entire years of the CFAA 's existence that has attempted to base criminal liability on disregard for the contractual terms of service on a website .
The Supreme Court has stated that , " [ i] t is a fundamental tenet of due process that ' [ n ] o one may be required at peril of life , liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes . '
Lanzetta v. New Jersey , 306 U.S. 451 , 453 ( 1939 ) .
A criminal statute is therefore invalid if it ' fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden . '
United States v. Harriss , 347 U.S. 612 , 617 ( 1954 ) . "
United States v. Batchelder , 442 U.S. 114 , 123 ( 1979 ) ; see also Grayned v. Rockford , 408 U.S. 104 , 108-09 ( 1972 ) .
A plurality of the Supreme Court has further specified that " [ v] agueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons .
First , it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits ; second , it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement . "
City of Chicago v. Morales , 527 U.S. 41 , 56 ( 1999 ) ( Stevens , J. , plurality opinion ) .
In the Ninth Circuit , " [ t ] o survive vagueness review , a statute must ' ( 1 ) define the offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited ; and ( 2 ) establish standards to permit police to enforce the law in a non-arbitrary , non-discriminatory manner . ' "
United States v. Sutcliffe , 505 F.3d 944 , 953 ( 9th Cir. 2007 ) ( quoting Nunez v. City of San Diego , 114 F.3d 935 , 940 ( 9th Cir. 1997 ) .
" Vague statutes are invalidated for three reasons : ' ( 1 ) to avoid punishing people for behavior that they could not have known was illegal ; ( 2 ) to avoid 27 subjective enforcement of laws based on ' arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement ' by government officers ; and ( 3 ) to avoid any chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms . ' "
Humanitarian Law Project v. Mukasey , 509 F.3d , 1122 , 1133 ( 9th Cir. 2007 ) ( quoting Foti v. City of Menlo Park , 146 F.3d 629 , 638 ( 9th Cir. 1998 ) ) .8
Nothing in § 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ) , its legislative history , or the case law interpreting it provides any sort of " fair notice " to citizens , including the defendant here , that such everyday behavior could constitute a federal crime .
For at least the following four reasons the interpretation advanced by the Government would fall short of providing required notice and avoiding vagueness .
Given that courts should adopt a narrow construction of a statute to avoid vagueness and other unconstitutional infirmities , see Zadvydas v. Davis , 533 U.S. at 689 , the Government 's proposed view of the CFAA must be rejected .
A. Web Site Terms of Service are Routinely Ignored or Not Fully Read or Understood
The fallacy of any notion that internet users are on " fair notice " that disregarding the terms of service of the many web sites and web services they visit puts them at risk of serious criminal liability is revealed by the widespread ( and widely accepted ) understanding that large numbers of users never read these terms , or read and understand only limited portions of them .
First , terms are often poorly accessible .
Many web sites or web - based services post their terms behind a " legal notices " or " terms of service " hyperlink which users can only access by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking on the link .
To access the MySpace terms of use , for example , one must scroll down to find a hyperlink labeled " terms " .
See MySpace.com Home Page , http://www.myspace.com/ 28 ( last visited July 28 , 2008 ) .
Nothing about the link indicates that it is exceptionally important , much less that failure to click on it and read the underlying terms could subject the user to criminal penalties .
Second , the terms of service presented by many web sites and other online services are lengthy and impenetrable .
In one particularly daunting example , Network Solutions , the domain name registrar , has a TOS that takes up 115 pages when pasted into a single spaced , 12 - point font Microsoft Word document .
See Network Solutions Terms of Service , http://www.networksolutions.com/legal/static-service-agreement.jsp ( last visited July 28 , 2008 ) .
The MySpace terms at issue here contain over 60 separate paragraphs or subparagraphs and takes up roughly ten pages when pasted into a Word document .
See Terms and Conditions --MySpace.com , http://www.myspace.com/ index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.terms ( last visited July 28 , 2008 ) .
Not surprisingly , then , many commentators recognize that few consumers actually take the time to read and understand digital terms of service ( or similar software download agreements ) before saying they agree to them .
See Restatement ( Second ) of Contracts § 211 , cmt. b ( 1981 ) ( " Customers do not . . . ordinarily understand or even read the standard terms . " ) ; Robert L. Oakley , Fairness in Electronic Contracting : Minimum Standards for Non-Negotiated Contracts , 42 Hous .
L. Rev. 1041 , 1051 ( 2005 ) ( " Clickwrap licenses are ubiquitous today , and most people click to accept without reading the text . " ) ; Robert A. Hillman & Jeffrey J. Rachlinski , Standard - Form Contracting in the Electronic Age , 77 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 429 , 429-31 ( 2002 ) ( " with increasing alacrity , people agree to terms [ in clickwrap contracts ] by clicking away at electronic standard forms on web sites and while installing software " ) ; Michael I. Meyerson , The Reunification of Contract Law : The Objective Theory of Consumer Form Contracts , 47 U. Miami L. Rev. 1263 , 1269 & nn. 28-29 ( 1933 ) ( citing cases recognizing the failure of most consumers to read form 29 contracts ) .

In one notable example , public disregard for license terms was graphically illustrated by a software company that surreptitiously inserted into its license agreement an offer to pay $ 1000 to the first person to send an email to a particular address .
It took four months and more than 3000 installations before someone noticed the offer and claimed the prize .
Jeff Gelles , Internet Privacy Issues Extend to Adware , Newark Star - Ledger , July 31 , 2005 , at 5 .
See also Ting v. AT & T , 182 F. Supp. 2d 902 , 930 ( N.D. Cal. 2002 ) ( holding a customer service agreement procedurally unconscionable because lack of notice contributed to surprise , the court acknowledged that " AT & T's own research found that only 30 % of its customers would actually read the entire CSA [ consumer service agreement ] and 10 % of its customers would not read it at all " ) .
Similarly , empirical research confirms that , in the online context , a majority of users ignored the EULA entirely when installing such popular software as Google Toolbar on their home computers .
Nathaniel Good et al. , Commentary , User Choices and Regret : Understanding Users ' Decision Process About Consensually Acquired Spyware , 2 I/S : J.L. & Pol 'y for Info . Soc'y 283 , 321 ( 2006 ) .
Furthermore , even the few people who do read the terms of service are unlikely to take notice of more than a handful of the provisions .
Due to human cognitive limitations , even rational consumers will be ignorant of non-salient terms in form contracts .
Melvin Aron Eisenberg , The Limits of Cognition and the Limits of Contract , 47 Stan. L. Rev. 211 , 244 ( 1995 ) .
Moreover , as noted earlier , most website terms , like other form contracts , are long , written in impenetrable legalese and poorly organized .
See Robert W. Gomulkiewicz , Getting Serious About User - Friendly Mass Market Licensing for 30 Software , 12 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 687 , 692-94 , 701-02 ( 2004 ) .
Such contracts often written at a level of difficulty that exceeds the ability of most consumers to understand .
See Alan M. White & Cathy Lesser Mansfield , Literacy and Contract , 13 Stan. L. Rev. 233 , 235-42 ( 2002 ) .
Drafters of these agreements give little attention to readability , instead relying heavily on legal boilerplate and including restrictive terms primarily designed to limit the company 's exposure to liability .
See Gomulkiewicz , supra , at 692- 94 , 701-02 ; Russell Korobkin , Bounded Rationality , Standard Form Contracts , and Unconscionability , 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1203 ( 2003 ) .
Given the difficulty of comprehending form contracts , and the typically low - dollar amount of the transactions to which they apply , a consumers ' decision to forego reading a website 's terms of use is not only common , but entirely rational .
Eisenberg , 47 Stan .
L. Rev. at 240 - 44 ; Meyerson , 47 U. Miami L. Rev. at 1269 - 70 .
Thus , even persons who are conscientious about reading the terms of service may be unaware of some of the provisions .
Under these circumstances , whatever the validity of holding such contracts enforceable for purposes of contract law , the transformation of their terms into the defining criteria for serious criminal violations creates serious risks of criminal sanctions for unwitting violations that cannot pass vagueness and notice review .10 B. Web Site Terms Are Frequently And Arbitrarily Changed By Site Owners With Little Or No Likelihood Of Actual Notice To Users
Many terms of service contain clauses which state that the website owner can unilaterally change the terms at any time , and that continued use of the website implies acceptance of the new terms .
For example , the MySpace terms at issue here , even if actually read and understood by a user when he or she visits or signs up for 31 an account , expressly state that they can be changed without further notice to the user merely by updating the agreement on the MySpace website the user is then presumably obligated to review the entire terms for changes every time he or she visits .
See Terms and Conditions --MySpace.com , http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.terms ( last visited July 28 , 2008 ) ( " MySpace may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modification shall be effective upon posting by MySpace on the MySpace Website .

There may be less than 20,000 rhinoceros in the world , with one species perhaps already extinct and another with possibly only four animals remaining in the wild .
As the populations of these animals age and become infirm , successful breeding becomes increasingly difficult .
In an article scheduled for publication in Theriogenology , An International Journal of Animal Reproduction , researchers from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research , Berlin , Zoo Budapest and the University of Veterinary Medicine , Vienna , report on the first live birth of a rhinoceros resulting from artificial insemination ( AI ) with frozen and thawed semen .
Using semen collected from a 35 - 36 year - old Southern white rhinoceros , frozen for 2 to 3 years and then thawed , a 30 year old female rhinoceros was artificially inseminated in two attempts .
The first failed , but the second resulted in pregnancy and the birth of a healthy offspring .
At the time of conception , the female was housed at the Budapest Zoo in Hungary and the male donor in Colchester Zoo in the United Kingdom .
Techniques for AI in rhinoceros have improved in recent years and the first live birth by AI occurred in 2007 .
However , that instance used fresh semen from a male rhinoceros in the same zoo , limiting the widespread use of the technique .
By demonstrating that frozen semen could be thawed and used to successfully inseminate a female at a remote location , the researchers have opened a new avenue to the preservation of endangered species .
Semen samples can be collected and preserved from both wild and captive populations to maintain a genome resource bank and to boost reproduction in these megaherbivores .
Writing in the article , Dr. Robert Hermes , Med. Vet. , and colleagues state , " This achievement joins a fairly short list of fewer than 30 wildlife species , most of which are closely related to domestic species , in which artificial insemination with frozen - thawed semen has been successful in producing live offspring .
The use of frozen - thawed semen holds great potential as a means to overcome the crisis most captive and wild rhinoceros populations are facing in various ways . "

David Gergen is considered very somber and portrays himself as one of the wise ones .
Last night , on CNN , Gergen said the angry frenzied mobs at the McCain and Palin rallies could lead to violence .
Violence .
In 2008 .
McCain and Palin are basically inciting violence on the campaign trail :
COOPER : There ’s also the question of ruling after this and bringing the country together .
It ’s going to be all the more harder to do that whoever wins with all this anger out there .
GERGEN : Yes .
There is this —
I think one of the most striking things we ’ve seen now in the last few days .
We ’ve seen it in the Palin rallies .
We saw it at the McCain rally today .
And we saw it to a considerable degree during the rescue package legislation .
There is this free floating sort of whipping around anger that could really lead to some violence .
I think we ’re not far from that .
COOPER : Really ?
GERGEN : I think it ’s so — well , I really worry when we get people — when you get the kind of rhetoric that you ’re getting at these rallies now .
I think it ’s really imperative that the candidates try to calm people down .
And that ’s why I ’ve argued not only because of the question of the ugliness of it .

“ Dear Sirs ,
In view of current developments in the banking market , if one of my checks is returned marked " insufficient funds " does that refer to me or , to you ?
Yours faithfully …�? - Unknown
We are all grateful for the rebound in several markets including our favorite stuff .
However , as they say in sports , “ better keep your eye on the ball .�?
The overriding fundamentals have not changed .
In fact , they have probably gotten a lot worse .
Those emerging markets recently the darlings of Wall Street have very quickly turned into Horror Show Halloween Ugly .
Russia was doing quite well on a variety of fronts and suddenly the bottom fell out .
Inflation , just 3 - 4 weeks ago was reported to be 50 % and their primary national income ; that of natural gas and oil was chopped in half over - night .
Catastrophes have broken out all over Eastern and Western Europe .
Now , unbelievably , it ’s spreading into the super wealthy Middle Eastern oil producers .
Their income was halved and then in a double whammy , their shares and owned companies , for the most part were decimated .
Meanwhile their spending is up .
Governments as well as individuals have a propensity to believe the good times roll forever once they taste huge success .
The reality is they do n’t .
What goes up comes down .
And , often on the down side , the selling skid is a whole bunch faster scaring the wits out of those who had pyramided substantial new debts predicated on their new - found wealth .
Now , that wealth is proving to be fog , smoke , and mirrors just like so many times in history .
Worst of all , New York derivatives , are without a doubt , infinitely and immeasurably far beyond previous financial disasters .
We suspect when all the financial dead bodies are counted throughout the world within the next ten years , this widespread carnage will surpass the total dollar wreckage since historians have kept records ; ever .
Cleaning Up And Starting Over Could Take A Decade
So of it ’s that bad how do we get out of it ?
This massive pile of uncountable debt must be ( 1 ) paid - off , ( 2 ) repudiated or , ( 3 ) inflated away .
We suspect all three of these solutions are implemented with very little allocated to the paid portion .
Why ca n’t it be paid back over time using inflation , selling more bonds , increasing productivity and through grand new savings plans ?
First of all , the accounting in derivatives is so screwed - up it can not be untangled .
Nobody knows their own liability and nobody can even determine what others owe to them .
To fix it , some counterparties can simply write - off or renounce many of these debts .
If two banks owe each other $ 100 mm each for derivatives , they take offsetting gains and losses and probably some aggressive positions regarding taxes , too .
Should the auditors question these moves , who could ever do a clean audit and figure it all out ?
Over 800 auditors working on the F&F ’s ( Fannie & Freddie ) have been busy since 2004 and still can’t figure it out and never will .
Somebody reported that when a nation has debts exceeding 6 % of annual GDP there is no coming back .
They are sliding down the slippery slope to oblivion .
The last report we saw was the US had over 7 % and they were headed a lot higher .
Fighting two simultaneous wars , running armies in over 100 foreign nations and burying the USA national budget in unfunded Social Security , Medicare and an additional laundry list of Gimme - Gimme ’s , has smashed any hope of a balanced budget , ever .
This mountain of debt will never be paid back and the idiots doing the spending know it , too .
They simply do not care .
Money means nothing to them as they are focused on power , getting votes and leaving a magnificent legacy .
We ’ve seen reports about the USA having its first trillion - dollar budget .
Forget that number as reality is many times higher .
The senior director of the national budget office has been screaming about this for months but no one wants to hear it especially politicians voting for and creating this un - payable debt to buy votes .
Smart consumers and business people in particular who clearly understand the laws of economics are running for the exits .
Thousands are moving overseas and quietly taking their wealth with them .
There are few places in the world for folks to go but if you can afford it , there are some choices .
The incident that really got our attention this week was a discussion by Rush Limbaugh on Fox News saying in effect , the Democrats were preparing a new plan to take ( seize ) private 401K pensions and combine them with Social Security .
The SS Fund is super broke and this would help to strengthen it albeit in a semi-legal - illegal commingled fashion .
Then , to add insult to injury , when a pensioner took out some of this saved cash in old age , they would be forced to pay taxes on it all .
In our view this is a very ominous and dangerous development .
It is indicative of how broke our government has become and how desperate they are for new revenue to pay bills .
Argentina did something similar just a few days ago and their bond market sank like a rock in a cesspool .
Their lady president in her infinite wisdom , implemented a plan designed by her husband , and just decided to literally take - over their private pensions .
This has happened before and the results were a major disaster .
Commodities Were Smashed But New , Higher Prices Lay Ahead Commodity selling this summer and early fall , particularly in dominant crude oil , was expected on normal technicals but never to the degree we ’ve just seen .
The good news is that after some markets took haircuts of 50 % or more , the whole pile is on the rebound , even grain .
Near and dear to our little trading hearts are , of course gold and silver .
Silver got hit the worst falling from $ 21.50 to just over $ 8 bucks .
Gold , on the other hand sold down to roughly $ 675 after peaking at $ 1040 .
Based on our examination , gold is showing the best staying power for the longer pull .
However , little sister silver despite the big whack it took , is a tiny market and moves a lot faster .
Recoveries in both as well their corresponding shares have based and begun new rallies .
We think for the intermediate term ( until March , 2009 ) silver will outperform gold .
Then , as silver commercial applications diminish , gold speeds ahead with more power .
Eventually , both will land so much higher than where they are now that if we gave the next forecast we would be called an idiot .
Here Is Why Things Really Go Sour
The credit markets are an international mess .
Unless central and domestic banks begin lending in earnest , cash and credit are frozen in time and nothing moves .
For now , banks receiving tons of new borrowed cash from central banks are holding it in fear and not lending .
Banks do not trust each other .
American housing will continue to fall down for the next three years .
We see no bottom until 2011 - 2012 .
This is a primary engine of US growth and for now its dead and getting deader .
As commercial real estate falls down the slippery - slope , pension funds and insurance companies are feeling real pain as they own this stuff for income .
The Sheeple are fooled as our wonderful U.S. Dollar had a recent rebound .
Nothing has changed and it will sell much lower due to piles of bad debts , inflation , and dilution .
Somewhere soon , the dollar slides under .5000 to about .4500 -.4600 and then supports .
Theoretically , it should go to zero but being the world ’s reserve currency with mammoth inflation ahead , support is expected .
Japan , who never got out of their mess after 1989 is working hard to save it ’s economy and that of the US .
We give them credit for taking on the Herculean task of trying to repair the Unites States .
Corporations seeing how easy it was for bad - boy banks to extract billions from our government in a quest to subvert ‘ too big to fail positions ’ are jumping in line for their share , too .
General Motors on the brink of bankruptcy will probably get Chrysler ’s Jeep and Van operations , then flush the rest .
They ’ll borrow lots of new billions from Uncle Sam under the phony guise of using the cash for R&D on green vehicles .
That ’s a lot of crap .
They are broke and need the cash to live on for a few more months .
The big three auto companies wrecked their businesses and now want the taxpayer to save their butts .
Further , GM wants Chrysler ’s $ 11 billion in cash , which they would burn through in 11 months at current rates .
The government ’s lending window is open to every jerkwater corporate failure from nonsensical operations to formerly blue - chip , now broke major companies .
Consumers were the former backbone of the American economy .
Now they have experienced major home value losses , cannot borrow on their homes any more , and their share portfolios are decimated .
Credit is gone and jobs are fleeing with lost credit .
Social ills of this legendary mess will be terrible ; crime , divorce , lost homes , no college , no insurance , etc , etc .
Automobile and credit card defaults are the next tragedy becoming more visible in the first and second quarter of 2009 .
Unemployment in Michigan is nearing + 20 % ( official number is +8 % ) and nationally , the real number is above +15 % .
We think Michigan will hit the magic 1930 ’s depression 25 % unemployed ( for real , not newspaper numbers ) in 2009 .
The auto industry and its highly paid jobs are toast .
Largest Loss Of Wealth In History Our nation and the world at large has suffered these events with varying severity overtime and survived .
This current cycle seems to be the worst of all promulgated by extreme excesses .
Our primary worry is what happens politically .
Do we lose our freedom or , merely go socialist ?
Will American citizens behave themselves trying to work their way through these problems or turn to violence ?
Since these questions cannot be clearly answered with so many variables involved , we think now is the time to protect family and friends with physical gold and silver and perhaps some trading in shares for gain .
Debts and unmanageable obligations should be shunned and paid - off or , at least paid down .
This is not a time for buying fancy stuff and frivolous items .
Hunker down and save .
Plan for the worst and hope for the best .
The sun shall rise tomorrow .
Just be ready if it ’s only fair to partly cloudy .
Worse yet , gird yourself for huge currency storms .
We think with October market dangers mostly over but having an election to win , the PPT will continue to prop their little hearts out not permitting the Dow and S&P 500 to get out of control .

BBC News , Rome
Walter Veltroni criticised Mr Berlusconi's right - wing policies
A huge rally has been held in the Italian capital , Rome , to protest against the government of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi .
Opponents accuse Mr Berlusconi of taking Italy too far to the right .
The leader of the centre - left opposition told the crowds that Mr Berlusconi was incapable of handling Italy 's social and financial crises .
The demonstration was the biggest anti-government rally since Mr Berlusconi was returned to power in April .
Rome 's ancient chariot track , Circus Maximus , was the setting for the protest .
Huge turn out
Estimates of the exact numbers taking part vary from hundreds of thousands to more than two million .
Either way , it was a substantial turn - out from Italy 's left - of - centre opposition .
Mr Berlusconi still enjoys a clear lead in the opinion polls
Its leader , Walter Veltroni , told the crowd that Italy was becoming more fascist under Mr Berlusconi .
Mr Veltroni has been relatively invisible since April 's elections which returned Mr Berlusconi to power .
The prime minister 's policies against crime and illegal immigration especially have earned him high ratings in the polls .
But those measures and others in education which involve cutting funds to universities and holding separate classes for immigrant children who can't speak Italian , have started to galvanise the opposition again .
Its parliamentary muscle may be no match for Mr Berlusconi's , but at street level it is still able to command widespread support .
Damn Small Linux , a.k.a DSL is a popular extremely small distro .
It is a 50 MB live CD , but it can also be installed on the hard drive .
DSL can be run completely in RAM , and it can install more programs from an online repository .
DSL recommends a P200 and 64 MB .
Puppy Linux is another installable live CD .
It should run on any Pentium with at least 32 MB and boot under 60 seconds .
It aims to be as easy to use as possible and assumes no technical expertise .
Feather Linux is a Linux distribution which runs completely off a CD .
It takes up under 128 Mb of space .
It is just like DSL a Knoppix remaster ( based on Debian ) , includes software which most people use every day .
Feather can be installed on a USB stick , but AFAIK not on a hard drive .
DeLi is a Linux Distribution for old computers , from 486 to Pentium III or so .
It 's focused on desktop usage and it includes email clients , graphical web browser , an office programs with word processor and spreadsheet , and so on .
A full install , including XOrg and development tools , needs only 750 MB of harddisk space .
Vector Linux .
Vector Linux Standard GOLD is the freely downloadable distribution , which includes applications for every task .
It is based on Slackware and specifically designed for use on older computers with slower processors and less RAM .
It can be run effectively on a Pentium 200 with 128MB of RAM and 3GB of hard drive space .
The forthcoming VL Light will take only 350 MB in full install and needs only 64 MB RAM to run .
Zenwalk is another distribution based on Slackware .
It is designed to be fast and simple , with no redundant applications .
It is optimized for i686 , but is still compatible with i486 .
Zenwalk requires for comfortable use a Pentium III class processor , 128 MB RAM and 2 Gb free disk space .
Antix is a lightweight , installable live - cd remaster of Mepis .
It should run on most computers as long as you have a P266 with 64MB .
antiX - M7 will not run on older processors such as Pentium I , AMD K5 , and AMD K6 as it uses an i686 kernel .
PClos TinyME is a lightweight remaster of PCLinuxOS .
It includes Abiword , Opera web browser , Audacious for playing music , Sylpheed email client and other famous programs .
TinyME requires a Pentium processor and at least 64 MB RAM .
Screen resolution 800×600 is recommended .
In this post , I will introduce ten most useful and best known lightweight distributions .
Eight of these distros are meant to be lightweight , and do not demand newest hardware .
The rest two can be used as the basis of a custom lightweight system .
I will not present any detailed review of the distributions as I intend to present them later one by one in more depth .
During the next few months I will install them on one of my computers .
I have already during the last seven years used most them for at least some time as my main desktop system .
It will be interesting to see how they have developed in the last years .
First four miniature distributions :
The next four could be called mid-sized distributions :
And finally two full - size distros which lend themselves especially well to custom lightweight installs :
These two classics should not need any introduction .
These ten distros are of course not the only possibilites for installing Linux on an low end computer , but to make a list of ten I had to leave something out .
Did I forget to mention Your favourite lightweight distribution ?
Mother - of - two unknowingly paid neighbour 's water bill for 16 YEARS
Jean
Shaw holds the offending bills .
She had been paying for her neighbour 's water for 16 years
A woman is suing a water company after finding out she had been paying her neighbour 's bills for 16 years .
Jean
Shaw made her children share baths , only washed clothes once a week and avoided flushing the toilet to try to save on her water bill .
Mrs Shaw moved into her home in 1992 and started using water frugally after receiving a first quarterly bill of £ 75 , which she thought expensive at the time .
Her husband left soon after moving in and she always believed the expensive bill was caused by her two children using too much water .
It was n't until February this year - by which time the hospital clerk 's children , Jane , 25 , and James , 24 , had left home - that she noticed something was wrong , when a bill arrived for £ 185 .
After informing the water company , tests were carried out to find out whether a leak was causing the increased usage .
Mrs Shaw , 50 , collapsed in tears when a water engineer told her she had been connected to next door 's meter and had been paying their bill for 16 years .
To make matters worse , Yorkshire Water continued to bill her for her neighbour 's meter until September this year , despite her protests .
Mrs Shaw 's neighbour 's house in Bradford , West Yorkshire
As there was no reading for her household , there is no way of working out how much Mrs Shaw has overpaid .
Yorkshire Water has offered her £ 150 compensation .
But Mrs Shaw , of Bradford , West Yorkshire , is seeking £ 10,000 from the company for the money she has lost and the mental strain it put her family under .
She said : ' This had such a strong psychological effect on me , always straining to keep the water levels down .
The first bill was around £ 75 , which was a lot of money 16 years ago .
' There was no way I could handle it going any higher so we were only bathing in four inches of water and all three of us were using the same water .
The last one in would get in the mucky water .
We were n't flushing the toilet unless absolutely necessary and I was putting bricks into the cistern to try and cut down the flow .
' For 16 years we would only do one clothes wash a week . '
A Yorkshire Water spokesman said : ' Our investigations into Mrs Shaw 's complaint have revealed the meter was connected to the wrong property , which is obviously regrettable and something we accept full responsibility for .
' Mrs Shaw did exactly the right thing in contacting Yorkshire Water to query her bill , which brought the incorrect connection to light .
' Since then , we have offered to go back through Mrs Shaw 's bills to work out if she has been over or undercharged - something which she has declined .
' Nevertheless , we have written to Mrs Shaw to explain the circumstances and to offer her compensation for any distress we may have caused as a goodwill gesture .
We are currently awaiting her response . '

TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
More than a third of married couples in Japan have stopped having sex , many of them because they are too tired or just ca n’t be bothered , a government - backed medical researcher said on Wednesday .
About 37 percent of couples surveyed this year by Kunio Kitamura , head of the Japan Family Planning Association , said they had not had sex for at least a month , compared with 32 percent in 2004 .
The most common reason , given by a quarter of the males surveyed , was being too tired after work , while 19 percent of women said sex was too much of a hassle , he told Reuters .
“ It ’s a question of work - life balance , ” Kitamura said in a telephone interview .
“ This is not something that the individual can tackle alone .
The people who run companies need to do something about it . ”
His written survey involved 647 men and 821 women aged up to 49 , who are married .
The trend could have serious consequences for Japan , whose falling birthrate and aging population are continuing headaches for the government .
The average number of children born to a Japanese woman in her lifetime was 1.34 in 2007 , compared with 2.1 in the United States in 2006 .
Kitamura said doctors may also be partly to blame for Japan ’s negative attitudes toward sex during pregnancy or after giving birth .
He is set to report to the Ministry of Health on his findings next year .
DIGG THIS
The idea that the United States is the global hegemon , that we have first dibs on the title of world policemen — indeed , our entire post - WWII foreign policy — is nothing but a delusion .
That is one of the chief lessons of the recent economic downturn , one that , unfortunately , the incoming administration has yet to face up to — and the pundits ( ensconced as they are in the culture of hubris ) have yet to realize .
Delusions die hard .
This poor woman — faced with the dire prospect of having to sell the Palm Beach cottage , and , omigod , lay off Yolanda , the thrice weekly cleaning lady — is just beginning to wake up , albeit with great reluctance .
Along with these people , she will live in a world of reduced expectations .
Our rulers , however , show every sign of inflexibility in the face of the need to change .
For decades , we ’ve been living inside a bubble , here at the epicenter of the imperial metropolis , protected from the dire fate of the rest of the world ’s peoples — who live in poverty , tyranny , and worse — by the productive and political capital amassed by our intrepid ancestors , who built the world ’s most successful ( and freest ) constitutional republic , and , because of that were able to create an enormous amount of wealth .
Both are gone , now , and yet we are still acting as if they ’re intact , like an amputee who feels pain in an arm that no longer is attached to his shoulder .
For example , the New York Times reports that President - elect Barack Obama is already backpedaling on his pledge to get our troops out of Iraq in sixteen months — yet how does he imagine we ’ll have the means to keep them there even that long ?
The Times tells us that " the officials made clear that the withdrawal of all combat forces under the generals ’ recommendations would not come until some time after May 2010 , Mr. Obama ’s target . "
But by that time the Chinese will have long since stopped lending us the money to pay for it all .
President Obama is pledged to launch an Afghan " surge " that will dwarf our continuing efforts in Iraq — but how will we pay for it ?
He and his surrogates pontificate on the need to " reconstruct " Afghanistan , when he ’ll be hard - pressed to reconstruct the economy in the wake of a devastating deflation .

The Best of Justin Raimondo
Ola Bini , a core JRuby developer and author of the book Practical JRuby on Rails Projects , has been developing a new language for the JVM called Ioke .
This strongly typed , extremely dynamic , prototype based object oriented language aims to give developers the same kind of power they get with Lisp and Ruby , combined with a nice , small , regular syntax .
Ola explains the basic nature of Ioke :
Ioke is a strongly typed , extremely dynamic , prototype based object oriented language .
It ’s homoiconic and got built in support for several kinds of macros .
The languages that most closely influence Ioke is Io , Smalltalk , Self , Ruby and Lisp ( Specifically Common Lisp ) .
The language is currently built on top of the JVM , but I ’m currently considering compiling it down to JavaScript and run it on V8 .
I have several goals with the language but the most specific one is to create a language that combines the things I like about Ruby and Lisp together .
It turns out that Io already has many of the features I ’m looking for , but in some cases does n’t go far enough .
I also wanted to have a language that is very well suited to express internal DSLs .
I want to have a language that does n’t get in my way , but also gives me loads of power to accomplish what I want .
To that event I ’ve designed a macro system that some people will probably find insane .
InfoQ had a small Q&A with Ola Bini about the design of Ioke :
InfoQ :
It seems that one of the key features of Ioke is the fact that it uses prototype based inheritance .
Do you feel that its benefits are so overwhelming compared to the dominant class based orientation ?
OK , so yes , this is one of the features of Ioke , but I 'm not sure if it 's a key feature or not .
It changes the design of some things substantially , yes .
I feel more comfortable in it , than in a class based system , actually , and since Ioke is primarily a language I develop for my own sake , my comfort tends to be important .
In Ruby , you can use the singleton classes to achieve something that looks a bit like prototype based OO , and I find that you can model algorithms quite cleanly that way .
And there is no obvious problem in power , since you can always do class - based OO by convention , if you want .
One of the main guiding principles for Ioke is that I do not want to take any decisions for granted .
Should I use class based OO just because it 's the dominant paradigm ?
Not necessarily .
There are obviously good reasons for many things , but there are also lots of historical baggage that does n't make that much sense for most applications .
So I 'm trying to revisit as much as possible during the development of Ioke .
InfoQ : Since the only mainstream language with prototype based inheritance is JavaScript , do you think that this paradigm has a potential to be widely understood and used ?
I actually think that prototype based OO is more natural , and easier to understand than class based OO .
I think class based OO have to be learned , and that most people will find prototype based OO more intuitive once they unlearn the class based OO mantra .
Of course , JavaScript might not be the best comparison , since the prototype based nature of the language easily gets hidden beneath all the cruft and corner cases of the language model , which means that most developers does n't actually know how to use these parts of the language in a good way .
InfoQ :
It seems that Ioke has been designed from the ground up to be a JVM language .
Do you think that this will be the dominant trends for new languages for a long time to come ?
My current thinking is that it does n't really make sense to create your own virtual machine from scratch .
Most new languages are garbage collected , for example , and I do n't understand why people who create languages want to write their own GC .
It will just take months from their lives and they will generally have done a subpar job .
Just look at all the trouble Ruby has with GC .
This thinking obviously is relevant for many other things too - especially libraries .
So yeah , Ioke is a JVM language ( but most of the language is not dependent on it .
you could reimplement it on top of another platform , quite easily .
The core is very small ) .
And yes , I believe that languages targeting the JVM , the CLR , Parrott and to a degree LLVM should be the norm .
There are very few cases where it makes sense to write your VM from scratch .
InfoQ :
The conditions system you are implementing for Ioke seems similar to the exception handling system in Java , but more flexible .
Can you give us some examples that demonstrate better it value ?
Well , you could say that exceptions provide a subset of the functionality of a condition system .
There are two differences - the first one is from the point of protocol and abstraction .
Everything that exceptions are used for does n't have to be exceptional or an error .
Or take warnings .
In most dynamic languages there are ad - hoc logging based warning systems .
But what if you want to do something else ?
In Ruby you could change the warn method to raise an exception .
But this still means there is a divide between how warnings and exceptions are handled .
Or take system interrupts , or thread interrupts .
All of these are superficially different features , but can be viewed as the same thing , really .
Conditions allow you to unify these .
They provide a uniform protocol for talking about these kinds of events .
The functionality conditions provide you is twofold .
The first is restarts , which is actually almost totally separate .
A restart is something you can register in a block .
It 's basically pieces of code to execute when a restart is invoked .
And then there are some methods to invoke a named restart , find all active restarts and so on .
A restart can be seen as an exception mechanism , almost .
It 's dynamic in scope .
Conditions allow you to register handlers for something that can happen .
When that condition happen , a handler can choose to handle it , or pass it along to the next handle .
But this is n't unwinding the stack ( not yet at least ) .
If a handler wants to do something about a condition , ( and a handler is also a piece of code ) , that piece of code will be executed in the lexical context of the handler , but in the dynamic scope of the place where the condition was first signaled .
This means that a handler several method calls away from a condition signaling point can actually do stuff in that context .
This is n't that strange , you could do it in pure Ruby for example .
But it loses a bit of it's power if it is n't available in the standard library .
In Common Lisp it 's very powerful .
When you use Common Lisp interactively , the default handling of a condition is to dump you into a debugger .
This debugger runs in the context of the place where the error happened , and it can do the same thing as a handler can do - including provide new values for variables and so on .
The debugger does n't need to do anything special it all , it 's really only a specific use case for the condition system .
I really can't overemphasize how powerful this is .
InfoQ : How do you think
Ioke measure up in terms of maintenance and refactoring , being dynamic but also strongly typed ?
Hard to say at this point .
Since it 's quite terse and provide powerful features for succinctness , it should be very maintainable .
Automated refactoring is probably not that interesting at this point for the same reason .
Just like Lisp , Ioke provides syntactic abstractions .
They take two forms , the first one is macros , which is basically like method calls with lazy arguments that can be evaluated in special ways .
The other form is syntax , which works a lot like Common Lisp defmacro .
These together provide the possibility of creating new control structures and define new abstractions .
The language is powerful enough to allow you to create your own method types , for example .
If you do n't like keyword arguments , you can define a new method type that does n't have them .
The DefaultMethod currently in Ioke could be implemented purely in Ioke , using macros .
InfoQ : For the syntax of Ioke you have chosen to follow the examples of Lisp and Smalltalk , e.g. the usage of the space .
Someone could suggest that this will alienate most developers that are used to read and write C - like code .
Do you think that this is the case ?
I 've been a C , C++ and Java programmer for a long , long time , and I never got comfortable with it .
It is really a cumbersome syntax , and as many people before me has noted it 's actually a large stumbling block for powerful abstractions .
Doing syntactic macros is very inconvenient when you have an AST that looks like these languages .
The syntax is a large part of that , since it 's so extremely ununiform .
So , yes , people might find it unnatural at first , but I really like how it reads , and I think that people will like that aspect of it .
I find Ioke to be highly readable in a way that Java is not , for example .
There is n't that many punctuation characters that get in the way .
Compare Java , Ruby and Ioke : Arrays.asList ( " foo " , " bar " , " quux " ) .map ( new Function < String , Pair < String , Int > >( ) { public Pair < String , Int > call ( String str ) { return new Pair < String , Int > ( str , str.length ( ) ) ; }}) .select ..... // this gets too long , ok ? [ " foo " , " bar " , " quux " ] .map { |str| [ str , str.length ]}.select { |n| n [ 1 ] > 3} [ " foo " , " bar " , " quux " ] map ( str , [ str , str length ] ) select ( second >
3 ) The difference with Ruby is not that large in this case , but it can differ wildly too .
I find that it 's much easier to read method applications separated with whitespace .
Using dots to terminate an expression also makes a really large difference .
So , as a Lisp person , it feels slightly heretical to say this , but syntax actually matters .
My goal with Ioke is to get the same kind of power I get with Lisp and Ruby , but combine it with nice , small , regular syntax .
If you are interested in following the development of Ioke , you can check it out at Ola ’s git repository , or visit the project pages .

The Detroit News is in the middle of a series of articles on speed limits .
One of their articlese , excerpted below , gives a good overview of how to fight a speeding ticket in Michigan :
But motorists often lose their cases because they are n’t aware of a recently enacted state law that opens the door for challenges of many speeding tickets , [ NMA Michigan Activist Steve ]
Purdy said .
Michigan Public
Act 85 , which took effect in November 2006 , changed the way municipalities may set speed limits .
It gave them three choices :
Communities may set speed limits based on the frequency of driveways and cross streets on a particular stretch of road .
If a community conducts an engineering and traffic study , it may post a speed limit by using the 85th percentile of free - flowing traffic , meaning the speed at which 85 percent of drivers are traveling during the traffic study .
If communities do n’t use either of those two methods , a 55 mph limit applies by default , except in platted subdivisions and in business districts , said Lt. Gary Megge of the Michigan State Police Traffic Service Section .
“ There are many roads in Michigan where the speed limit is n’t in compliance with the law , ” said Megge , who travels the state helping communities set proper speed limits .
“ A lot of speed limits are set artificially low . ”
And if the speed limit is n’t in compliance with the state regulations , any ticket written for violating it is invalid .
Pirate pride is alive and well in Sweden , where notorious file - sharing search hub The Pirate Bay is moored .
The site announced today that it set a new record of 22 million active peers this week , up from only 12 million in April of this year .
If P2P growth has slowed , the most prominent public tracker in the world certainly is n't feeling the squeeze .
The first rule of high seas hijinks , of course , is never trust a man with a peg leg and an eye patch , so are the numbers accurate ?
We have to take the site 's word for the tremendous growth , but if true , that growth is explosive .
In April , the site admins set a target of 20 million concurrent peers , which they hoped to reach at some point in 2009 .
But only seven months after setting the target , The Pirate Bay has broken it .
In addition , the site operators announced in late September that they had topped three million registered users — also a new record ( most users are unregistered ) .
And these tremendous numbers have been racked up by a team of " uploaders , seeders , leechers , mods , and admins , " all laboring together , all volunteering time and resources , all coordinating their activity through the Internet in order to bring change to a prominent coastal town filled with bigwigs and fatcats .
" Say it loud , say it proud ! " says the blog post . "
Yes .
We. Can ! I am The Pirate Bay ! "
We would love to bring you The Pirate Bay 's own take on its explosive numerical growth in 2008 , but like a very different US presidential campaign , the site admins have decided to wage war on the media .
" All planned and booked interviews are to be considered suspended , " they said in a post this summer .
" All future interviews are to be considered impossible .
We have no longer any interest in participating in traditional media since it 's apparent that they are not trustworthy or willing to adopt [ sic ] .
The mail sent to the press spokes person will not be read .
The phone will not be answered . "
So , instead , we 'll just note that 22 million peers is a pretty staggering number .
The rise of the BBC's iPlayer catch - up TV service , US - based Hulu , Last.fm , Pandora , and other legal , simple alternatives to hoisting the Jolly Roger have only succeeded in limiting the site 's growth rate to nearly 100 percent in just over half a year — in other words , they have n't helped at all .

Operating System Time to reach user login prompt Windows 7 Ultimate
( Preview , PDC edition ) 27 seconds Windows Vista Ultimate
Update : Without Service Pack 1 installed ! 34 seconds Windows XP Professional 27 seconds
Final result : The Windows 7 Preview boots 20.6 % faster than Windows Vista , but in exactly the same amount of time as Windows XP .
Because of the slower IDE drive on my test system , and the preview status of Windows 7 , it 's very probable that Win7 will be even faster than XP in its final releases .
My test system has an Intel Core 2 Duo processor running at 3.16GHz with 4GB of RAM .
The only difference between XP , Vista , and the Windows 7 Preview is that Win7 is installed on an IDE hard drive , and XP and Vista are booting from SATA drives .
That puts Win7 at a slight disadvantage because IDE drives are not as performant as SATA .
Also : the version of Windows 7 that I 'm using is the Preview release from last month 's PDC conference , an incomplete , earlier - than - beta , for - testers - only edition .
One can only assume it will get better ( read : faster ) in the final release .
Since I 'm triple - booting the three operating systems , I used a simple handheld timer to get my numbers , starting at the " Choose your operating system " screen ( which comes after the BIOS startup ) and ending at the user login screen .
These tests doinclude the amount of time it takes to load the user 's desktop , because that depends entirely on what 's in your Windows startup .
This is simple , pure , operating system boot here — no desktop or BIOS involved .
Here are my final numbers from starting the three operating systems on the same box and timing them :
On a related note , only 23 % of you said your computer boots up in under 30 seconds , so it sounds like " faster boot time " might be one of the less sexy but much - appreciated features coming in Windows 7 .
A TV blog has the overnights
The Obama - mercial was fairly highly rated across the three broadcast networks ( CBS , Fox and NBC ) in the early metered market numbers .
Between the three networks it scored an impressive combined 17.8/29 ( household rating / share ) .
If ABC truly hoped that by being only scripted programming on broadcast for 8:00 pm - 8:30 p , it would help out Pushing Daisies , that plan went awry .
My guess is ABC was more likely just looking to burn off an episode .
Daisies scored a 4.2/7 , pretty much the identical rating it had a week ago up ( 4.2/6 ) .

A previous post described a data type of functional linear maps .
As Andy Gill pointed out , we had a heck of a time trying to get good performance .
This note describes a new representation that is very simple and much more efficient .
It ’s terribly obvious in retrospect but took me a good while to stumble onto .
The Haskell module described here is part of the vector - space library ( version 0.5 or later ) and requires ghc version 6.10 or better ( for associated types ) .
Edits :
2008 -11-09 : Changed remarks about versions .
The vector - space version 0.5 depends on ghc 6.10 .
2008 - 10 - 21 : Fixed the vector - space library link in the teaser .
Linear maps
Semantically , a linear map is a function f ∷ a → b such that , for all scalar values s and " vectors " u , v ∷ a , the following properties hold : f ( s ⋅ u ) = s ⋅ f u f ( u + v ) = f u + f v
By repeated application of these properties , f ( s 1 ⋅ u 1 + ⋯ + s n ⋅ u n ) = s 1 ⋅ f u 1 + ⋯ + s n ⋅ f u n
Taking the u i as basis vectors , this form implies that a linear function is determined by its behavior on any basis of its domain type .
Therefore , a linear function can be represented simply as a function from a basis , using the representation described in Vector space bases via type families .
type u :-* v = Basis u → v
The semantic function converts from ( u :-* v ) to ( u → v ) .
It decomposes a source vector into its coordinates , applies the basis function to basis representations , and linearly combines the results .
lapply ∷ ( VectorSpace u , VectorSpace v
, Scalar u ~ Scalar v , HasBasis u ) ⇒
( u :-* v ) → ( u → v )
lapply lm = λ u → sumV [s *^ lm b | ( b , s ) ← decompose u ]
or lapply lm = linearCombo ∘ fmap ( first lm ) ∘ decompose
The reverse function is easier .
Convert a function f , presumed linear , to a linear map representation : linear ∷ ( VectorSpace u , VectorSpace v , HasBasis u ) ⇒
( u → v ) → ( u :-* v)
It suffices to apply f to basis values : linear f = f ∘ basisValue
Memoization
The idea of the linear map representation is to reconstruct an entire ( linear ) function out of just a few samples .
In other words , we can make a very small sampling of function 's domain , and re-use those values in order to compute the function 's value at all domain values .
As implemented above , however , this trick makes function application more expensive , not less .
If lm = linear f , then each use of lapply lm can apply f to the value of every basis element , and then linearly combine results .
A simple trick fixes this efficiency problem : memoize the linear map .
We could do the memoization privately , e.g. , linear f = memo ( f ∘ basisValue )
If lm = linear f , then no matter how many times lapply lm is applied , the function f can only get applied as many times as the dimension of the domain of f .
However , there are several other ways to make linear maps , and it would be easy to forget to memoize each combining form .
So , instead of the function representation above , I ensure that the function be memoized by representing it as a memo trie .
type u :-* v = Basis u ↛ v
The conversion functions linear and lapply need just a little tweaking .
Split memo into its definition untrie ∘ trie , and then move the second phase ( untrie ) into lapply .
We 'll also have to add HasTrie constraints : linear ∷ ( VectorSpace u , VectorSpace v
, HasBasis u , HasTrie ( Basis u ) ) ⇒
( u → v ) → ( u :-* v)
linear f = trie ( f ∘ basisValue )
lapply ∷ ( VectorSpace u , VectorSpace v , Scalar u ~ Scalar v
, HasBasis u , HasTrie ( Basis u ) ) ⇒
( u :-* v ) → ( u → v )
lapply lm = linearCombo ∘ fmap ( first ( untrie lm ) ) ∘ decompose
Now we can build up linear maps conveniently and efficiently by using the operations on memo tries shown in Composing memo tries .
For instance , suppose that h is a linear function of two arguments ( linear in both , not it each ) and m and n are two linear maps .
Then lift A2 h m n is the linear function that applies h to the results of m and n .
lapply ( lift A2 h m n ) a = h ( lapply m a ) ( lapply n a )
Exploiting the applicative functor instance for functions , we get another formulation : lapply ( lift A2 h m n ) = lift A2 h ( lapply m ) ( lapply n )
In other words , the meaning of a lift A2 is the lift A2 of the meanings , as discussed in Simplifying semantics with type class morphisms .
A previous post described a data type of functional linear maps .

Lisa Rinna is a Juvederm Junkie ( Photos )
We 've been calling outon numerous occasions about her obsession with fat lips and puffy cheeks .
Apparently she has come to see the truth .
In a shocking realization , Rinna apparently gazed at herself in a recent photo and gasped at what the camera had captured .
The photos in question were quite likely of Rinna and her husband Harry Hamlin at the 30th Anniversary Carousel of Hope Ball on October 25 , 2008 - photos above .
Lisa shared with InTouch during an exclusive interview , on newsstands November 7 , that she went overboard and had too much filler injected .
She told the magazine , " We all know everyone does it ! "
She fessed up that this time the procedure was over the top .
When she caught a glimpse of herself she had one of those ' wow ' moments and said , " Uh , oh . "
She went on to say , " you have to be careful .
I 'm a perfect example of that . "
Nothing new here other than the fact that the Juvederm junkie expects to be back to normal in three months and may have her doctor dial back a bit in the future .

Hugo Chavez has reduced Venezuela 's support to foreign allies and is poised to make deeper cuts at home and abroad as plunging oil revenues hit his self - styled socialist revolution .
The government has warned of austerity measures after years of breakneck spending on social programmes , nationalisations , arms and diplomacy , an exhilarating splurge when there seemed no end to petro-dollars .
South America 's energy giant relies on oil for half of its exports and 95 % of government revenue , leaving Chavez 's ideological and political ambitions vulnerable to a crunch .
" Oil revenues are the weapons he has been using to fight this war .
He is going to have to make big changes , " said Pietro Pitts , an oil analyst who publishes Latin Petroleum magazine .
" He will have to cut spending or devalue the bolivar , or both .
Both are very politically sensitive . "
Chavez recently said Venezuela would ride out any financial storm and that oil prices at $ 80 to $ 90 a barrel would be sufficient - an estimate which now looks optimistic .
Earlier this year he suggested prices could soar to $ 200 .
With next year 's budget plans already in tatters , and foreign investment slowed to a trickle , the government started making cuts even before the latest price tumble .
Last month it postponed construction of a $ 4bn refinery in Nicaragua , a key ally in its anti-US front , and announced tougher terms for subsidising oil exports to some Caribbean countries .
The state oil company , PDVSA , slashed spending on social programmes which have underpinned Chavez 's popularity .
Aid to Bolivia and Ecuador , and subsidised oil to Cuba , may be hit next .
The finance minister , Ali Rodriguez , signalled the 2009 budget " will have significant restrictions " compared to this year 's $ 63.9bn and that high - rolling government officials would have to cut back on sports utility vehicles and whiskey .
" Many expenses , such as expenses on certain types of vehicles , cellulars and parties , will be eliminated . "
Some analysts think Venezuela can weather the crisis with the help of $ 40 bn reserves reportedly squirelled away during the boom .
" The government should have plenty of room to conduct the sort of fiscal stimulus policies being employed by nations such as the US , the UK and China , " according to the Centre for Economic and Policy Research , a think tank sympathetic to Chavez .
Others are less sanguine , especially since Venezuela is wracked by 36 % inflation , one of the world 's highest , and because of precedent : previous governments crashed when oil crashed .
• The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday 6 January 2009 .
In the article above we described the Centre for Economic and Policy Research as a thinktank sympathetic to Chávez .
That is the author 's view based on reports published by the thinktank .
The CEPR does not accept this description and says it is independent and not affiliated to any government .

I happened to visit Facebook ’s Business Solutions page , and was struck by how , at least on the surface , these advertising formats seem like exactly the kind of innovation that should be helping Facebook achieve Goolge - style revenue — which is of course what Facebook ’s $ 15 billion valuation assumes will happen .
And yet with 100 MILLION users , Facebook ’s 2008 revenue was only projected to be $ 300 million .
( The number may higher , have n’t seen , but it would be big news if it was much higher . )
Can you imagine a traditional media company with 100 MILLION viewers / readers / subscribers and only $ 300 million in revenue ?
Which leads to the question that should be on the mind of every media executive , from startups to big legacy players :
Why is n’t Facebook making more money ?
Thinking about that question , I went over to Google ’s Advertising Solutions page to compare the way AdWords is described to the way Facebook ’s offerings are described .
So let ’s compare Google ’s value proposition with Facebook’s :
Google says :
Reach people actively looking for information about your products and services online
Facebook says :
Promote your website or Facebook Page with highly - targeted advertising .
Make your ads even more effective by attaching them to News Feed stories about the users ’ friends .
Allow your customers to share with their friends the actions they take on your website .
Connect with your customers on Facebook similar to the way they connect with their friends .
With Google you can reach people who are looking for precisely what you have to offer .
With Facebook you can insert your ad into news about peoples ’ friends .
You can let people share their shopping habits with their friends .
And you can , as a company / brand , be “ friends ” with your consumers .
What ’s the key difference between Google ’s value proposition and Facebook’s ?
With Google , the value to users and the value to advertisers is perfectly aligned .
Everybody wins .
With Facebook , if you read between the lines , it ’s really the same value proposition as traditional advertising — advertisers forcing themselves on users , in a way that creates little or no value for the users .
How many Facebook users have a burning need to find ads in their friends ’ newsfeeds ?
Or share their shopping habits ?
Or make friends with brands ?
On Google , when you search for something , the adds are a form of search result — i.e. something you asked for , that you opted in to receive .
On Facebook , the ads , despite all the innovation , still are n’t something users are really asking for .
Is it possible on the web to have a more perfect alignment between advertiser and user value than search advertising ?
I do n’t know , but it seems a pretty safe bet that Facebook ’s ad formats are n’t it .
( And pre-roll video advertising sure as heck ai n’t it .
Could there be anything more antithetical to the fundamental web experience in the broadband era than having to wait 15 seconds to access the content you ’re trying to load ? )
If you ’re in media in the web era , you ’d better be working on a business model that creates huge value for users .
Either that , or be content to have a small business by traditional media standards .
The odds of us ever seeing this exact form factor in a Nokia handset are n’t great but a recently filed patent illustrates an interesting new take on the candy bar form .
When closed and viewed head on as in figure 21 above , the handset looks like a standard QWERTY candy bar reminiscent of the E61i or E71 .
As figure 22 reveals however , half of the display tucks behind the keypad and pivots open to reveal what would be an amazingly large widescreen .
We ’re not sure why Nokia took the concept further than this , but figure 25 shows the display swiveling from side to side once open .
The only reasoning we can think of for the swivel : Perhaps Nokia envisions the display rotating a full 180° and then folding back down so that the handset can be used as a full touchscreen device with the QWERTY keypad facing away from the user .
Whatever the case , if the Finns can manage to plant a kick stand a la N96 on the back of the keypad it would make for some pretty sweet multimedia viewing , that ’s for sure .
Would you be interested in a swiveling , rotating touchscreen handset with a full QWERTY keyboard ?
Thanks , Justin !

Jeff Reeves became a local hero in one Yorba Linda neighborhood after spending a day and a half spraying down his neighbors ' homes with his water truck .
Reeves , a grading contractor , heard that people in his neighborhood were encountering a fierce fire .
So he pulled the water truck out of his yard , filled it with 2,250 gallons of water and , at 10:15 a.m.
Saturday , when the fire hit , began spraying homes with loads of liquid .
He kept going all day and all night , repeatedly spraying dozens of threatened homes with gushes of water , which emerged from a nozzle on the side of the white vehicle bearing a U.S. flag .
He sprayed out 49 loads , finishing up at 5 o'clock the next morning .
On Sunday his neighbors and friends on Big Horn Mountain Way and Blue Ridge Drive showed their appreciation as he took joyrides with the vehicle , children clinging onto the side .
" This dude saved a ton of houses , " said Tim Tooney , a friend whose house Reeves passed over with the water many times .
" I owe you my life , man , " said Bob Tillmon , Tooney 's next - door neighbor and a 16 - year homeowner , snapping a photo of the truck .
" This guy 's a hero . "

↑これはいまの佃島（と月島）。国土地理院の 「 国土変遷アーカイブ 」 で当時の航空写真を探したら、1963年のものがあった。見事に、まさに架けかけ中の佃大橋が写っていた。ご存じのように、いまは佃島と月島は地続きになっているけど、もともとは佃島は江戸時代1645年に埋め立てられた島。浮世絵だとこんな。実際はこんなにぽつんとはしてなかったと思うけど。川って広く描かれるよね。心理的距離が反映されてるんでしょう。それか、かなり広角レンズで描いたか。当時の地図をみるとこんなだ。これが明治になるとこんな。北石川島は、いまは「リバーシティ21」なんて浮かれた名前のタワーマンション群だけど、ついこのあいだまでは石川島播磨の工場だった。明治のここの地図でもそうなってて、調べたら
石川島造船所って、ペリー来航後にここにあせってつくられたものなのね
。あと、佃島はもともと家康が大阪の佃にいた漁師を連れてきたのが始まりっていうのも知らなかった。さらに地形図で見るとこんな河口で砂が堆積したのもあると思うけど、造船所つくるときにかなり盛ったんじゃないでしょうか。目立って石川島の北岸が高い。この番組内の空撮のショットでも工場の様子がちらりと写っている。面白いのは、この番組けっこうノスタルジックなんだけど、いまから見ると1974年自体がノスタルジックなので、ノスタルジックが漂白されたというか、メタノスタルジックになっちゃったというか、でぜんぜんノスタルジックに感じられない。堤防が築かれたので船が見えなくなった、とか言うんだけど、そのとき映ってる風景がすでに1974年だからねえ。
一方で、この佃島って戦災にも遭わなかったからいまだに昔ながらの街並みで、周辺に比べるとそう変わっていない。フィルム映像の質感と番組としての作り方の古めかしさがなければ、もしかしたら今の映像と言っても分からない場面がいくつかあった。そうそう、当時の映像の間のとり方ってすごい。というか、映画、あるいは写真的なつくりかた。だって、番組始まって1分20秒近くなにもナレーションがなくって、ようやくしゃべったと思ったら「朝の光が、汚れた隅田川を美しく見せます」だよ。すごくない？ドキュメンタリーとはいえ、今なかなか「汚れた隅田川」っていきなり言えないよね。しかもこのひとこと言ったっきり、また20秒ほど黙り込んじゃう。全編この調子。ひとことしゃべって20秒黙り込む、の連続。すごくいい。ぐっときた。さっき「ノスタルジー」って書いたけどこういう淡々としたナレーションのせいで、ぜんぜんべたべたしていない。今のオリンピックの中継のほうがよっぽど扇情的。あと、こういう手前にもの入れて撮るショットがすごく多い。ぼくはあんまり映像に詳しくないけど、これいまあまり見ないよね。すごく写真的。そして三脚立てないのがふつうだったのか、画面がつねに細かく揺れてる。210円。例によってWindowsでieでしか見ることができないし、買った後3日間しか視聴できないっていう問題はあるけど、一見の価値ありです。

' Pro-family ' :
An emboldened movement that 's soon to overplay its hand
by Jeremy Hooper
When it comes to whether or not Prop 8 was an explicitly Christian / Mormon battle ( hint : it was ) , the social conservatives are beginning to drop the mask .
And they are now telling us that we gays better just accept this Christian nation and the Christians ' role in saving us all from ourselves , or else .
This from the Concerned Women For America 's Mario Diaz :
The fact is that , whether homosexual activists want to accept it or not , Christians are protecting all people , including homosexuals , by protecting marriage .
They appealed to the people to win the vote on marriage and they won .
Homosexual activists should learn from that .
Fear , intimidation and violence will get them nowhere .
It might give them a sense of power and maybe provide a place for some stress relief , but it will not make their position any more true or desirable .
It wo n't change hearts and minds , and it wo n't change the Word of God , which is the basis for Christian belief .
This writer replies :
" Hmm --
Accept it or not , accept it or not ? [ :: writer thinks for a minute ::] ..... .... .... .... ... ...
Okay , I 'm ready : I 'm gonna go with an emphatic NOT !!!!!
No Mr. Diaz , I will not accept that you know more about my life , my love , and my equal citizenship than I do .
I will not accept that you know more about protecting my family than I do .
I will not accept your idea that the young people in my life should be shielded from my joy .
I will not accept that your version of religious interpretation is better than mine , or that either of our faiths or spritualities should govern this nation .
I will not accept that gay people ' chose their lifestyles . '
I will not accept that , for the first time in modern history , it is the discriminatory side who is in the right .
I will not accept the idea that I should be ' changed . '
I will not accept altering precious governing documents to take rights away .
I will not allow you to paint my community as ' violent ' because of a few isolated incidents that have crept up among the hundreds of thousands of folks who have peacefully protested .
I will not accept your code words .
I will not buy into logic that I find offensive not only to my existence as a homosexual , but also my existence as a thinking American .
I will not be persecuted .
I will not even be ' tolerated . '
I will be respected .
And until I am , I will challenge the self - professed ' pro- family ' movement without hesitation or apology .
Your side can keep telling yourselves that hearts and minds are not changing , if it makes you feel better about your clearly floundering movement .
The truth is that this church - state marriage that you all have nurtured is heading towards an inevitable divorce .
Those of us who have suffered from the cruel tyranny of the restrictive bond could not be any more ready to see the long - overdue dissolution . "

" Fear , intimidation and violence will get them nowhere . "
Of course the handful of bloody murders of gay men and women every week on this planet would be described by Diaz as " good christian love . "

Hey everyone !
Go to the Concerned Women of America website ( go to the feedback section from their homepage ) and innundate their website with comments about overcoming their bigotry and other testimonies similar to what Hooper is saying .
It 's time that we also fought their bigotry on every level in clear , concise , educated and persuasive ways .
Also it is important that we mobilize as a community in any way we possibly can .

WASHINGTON 
If the Supreme Court does not act , the solicitor general of the United States somberly told its justices on Tuesday , the children of America may be in for some rude surprises .
“ The world that the networks are asking you to adopt here today , where the networks are free to use expletives , ” said Gregory G. Garre , the solicitor general , may include “ the extreme example of Big Bird dropping the F - bomb on ‘ Sesame Street . ’ ”
In a lively argument heavy on euphemism and concern for the state of the culture , the Supreme Court considered the role of the Federal Communications Commission in regulating “ fleeting expletives ” on broadcast television  essentially , whether the government can penalize a network for letting a dirty word slip onto the air .
The narrow question before the court was whether the commission had given a sound reason for changing its approach to the treatment of isolated , as opposed to repeated , swearing .

The stars of the hour , apple and ginger !
You know a dish is a keeper when you do n’t want to wash your hands for hours afterwards because they smell so delicious .
When Katie announced this week ’s Iron Chef Challenge ingredients I knew that I could n’t go with the obvious , so I immediately crossed any and all baked goods off my imaginary list .
But I ’m still a little embarrassed that I came up with my dish because Peter Brady popped into my head , “ Pork chops and appleshauche , porkchops and appleshauche … ”
Obviously , my Peter Brady was a vegan one .
I wanted a tender seitan .
Not soft exactly – toothsome but not tough .
I ’ve been wanting to try chickpea flour in the Veganomicon seitan recipe instead of nutritional yeast and it really did the trick – exactly what I wanted .
Simmered seitan was the way to go here because baking or steaming would give too stiff a texture .
Once simmered and cooled , I sliced them lengthwise in kind of a diagonal to create a more organic shape because I was n’t up for eating any right angles or geometry of any sort .
I used whole wheat panko to coat the cutlets , with lots of fresh rosemary and pan fried in olive oil to get a crispy on the outside , tender on the inside bite .
You have got to love the aroma or fresh rosemary in the frying pan .
And finally – the star of the evening !
Thick slices of rome apples with a little maple syrup and brown sugar and loads and loads of fresh minced ginger .
I threw in a handful or dried cranberries and baked until tender and just a little caramelized .
I also made a separate pan of crispy sauteed shallots for another dimension of savory with a hint of sweet .
And then I smothered it all over the chops .
And it was good .
It looks like a hot mess but I did n’t feel like taking a lot of time to set it up , I really wanted to eat it – I served with sweet and salty maple baby carrots , brown basmati and sauteed purple kale
Seitan Chops Smothered In Apples And Ginger
Serves 4
For the Ginger And Apples :
3 Tablespoons fresh minced ginger
2 pounds rome apples ( or any crisp red apple ) , peeled and sliced into 1/3 to 1/2 inch slices
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon olive oil
handful dried cranberries ( about 3 tablespoons )
2 tablespoons brown sugar
For the shallots :
2 cups thinly sliced shallots
1 tablespoon olive oil
For the seitan cutlets :
1 recipe Veganomicon seitan ( with chickpea flour instead of nutritional yeast , and minus the garlic and lemon ) , shaped into 4 cutlet shapes ( please do n’t make me write out that recipe !
You have v-con right ? ) and cooled
Breading ingredients :
3/4 cup panko breadcrumb , preferably whole wheat
3 cloves minced garlic
3 tablespoons fresh chopped rosemary
1/4 teaspoon salt
Several dashes fresh black pepper
Olive oil for pan frying
Preheat oven to 350 F .
Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper .
Put all the apples on the sheet and toss with maple syrup and olive oil to coat .
Spread out into a single layer .
Scatter in the cranberries and ginger and then sprinkle on the brown sugar .
Cover loosely with tin foil and bake for 20 minutes .
Remove the tin foil and flip the apples .
Bake for 15 more minutes or until tender and slightly browned .
While the apples are baking prepare your shallots .
I used the same cast iron pan for the shallots and the cutlets to cut down on dish duty .
Just saute the shallots in the oil over medium high until shallots are nice and brown and crispy in spots .
Transfer them to a bowl and cover with tin foil to keep warm .
Now make the cutlets .
They should be cool to the touch and still damp from the simmering .
Slice them lengthwise and at an angle to create 8 pieces .
On a plate , toss together all of the breading ingredients .
Preheat your pan to medium heat .
Press each pieces into the breading to coat well .
Pour a nice thick layer of oil into the pan .
You ’re not deep frying so do n’t go overboard but 1 / 4 inch of oil would be just great .
Pan fry the seitan for about 3 minutes on each side and then another 2 to 3 minutes or so on each side until nicely browned .
Do it in two batches so that you do n’t overcrowd the pan .
To plate :
Lay each cutlet on the plate , top with some shallots and then smother in lots of apples .
This was so fun , thanks for the great ingredients Katie !

BOGOTA , Nov 23 ( Reuters ) - Coffee - growing nations should buy Starbucks and create their own distribution chain as the U.S. company grapples with slowing sales , Colombia ’s coffee federation chief said in an interview published on Sunday .
Gabriel Silva , director of the National Federation of Coffee Growers , also told El Tiempo newspaper that Colombia will accumulate four times the coffee stocks it did a year ago to build inventories and shore up coffee prices .
Starbucks SBUX.O , famous for its pricey lattes , has fallen victim to the U.S. economic downturn as sales growth slows in the United States and the Seattle - based chain plans to close 600 U.S. stores .
“ I am going to propose to my colleagues that we chip in to buy Starbucks .
This will reinforce our fight to defend coffee origins , ” Silva said .
“ What I am proposing is not so difficult .
With $ 200 million to $ 300 million , the coffee world could control Starbucks . ”
Prices for commodities from oil to metals have slumped on fears a global recession will cut into demand .
But coffee producers believe the bean is better placed to rebound because market fundamentals will support prices .
ICE Futures U.S. March arabica KCH9 closed 0.60 cent lower at $ 1.1075 per pound on Friday .
“ We are going to participate more aggressively in the market to build stocks in the next few months ... the idea is to accumulate coffee to support the price .
It is not so difficult as there is a world deficit in coffee , ” Silva said .
“ To impact the market , we need to accumulate around 200,000 sacks , ” he said .
“ Until we have a renumerative price , it is better to store coffee than export at a low price . ”
Colombia , the world ’s No. 1 exporter and top producer of high - quality arabica beans , said recently rains had trimmed its production for this year to around 12 million sacks , though it still expects to output to rise to 17 million bags by 2014 .
Silva said exports for this year should be around 11.2 million sacks .
He said around half of the 860,000 hectares ( 2.1 million acres ) of coffee - producing land in Colombia had been renewed and he expected all producing areas to be renewed in five years .
Silva said the federation would have 170 stores for its branded Juan Valdez product this year -- 135 in Colombia and 35 overseas with a target of 300 stores by 2010 .

Pak Taliban kill married woman for ' adultery '
November 10 , 2008 17:30 IST
Last Updated : November 10 , 2008 17:31 IST
The Pakistani Taliban [ Images ] have killed a married woman after pronouncing her guilty of committing " adultery " in the troubled northwestern
Swat valley , and warned women in an adjoining tribal area against applying for national identity cards .
The Taliban tried the woman in a ' Shariah court ' in Matta sub - district of Swat for allegedly committing adultery and found her guilty .
They then asked her brother - in - law to shoot her dead in their presence .
The brother - in - law killed the woman on Sunday by spraying bullets at her , The News daily reported on Monday .
The Taliban have been running Shariah courts in areas controlled by them and punishing people with impunity .
The courts have given death sentences and punished " criminals " with public flogging .
The militants also put up posters at Landi Kotal in the Khyber tribal region warning women against visiting offices of the National Database and Registration Authority to apply for identity cards .
A large number of men have been accompanying their wives to the NADRA office in the Khyber Agency to apply for identity cards so that the women can enroll for the Benazir Income Support Programme launched by the government for the poor .
Women are entitled to a monthly stipend under the programme .
The Taliban posters in bazars of Landi Kotal described the practice as " obscene " and " un-Islamic " .
The militants threatened the families of women applying for identity cards with " serious consequences " .
Local residents had earlier complained that the NADRA office did not have female staff to cater to women .
The Taliban have also continued destroying girls ' schools in the Swat valley .
They blew up two more girls ' schools recently .
Both schools were reduced to rubble by the blasts .
The militants have destroyed over 120 girls ' schools in Swat and also targeted health facilities and bridges to pressure the government .
WASHINGTON — Striking new evidence has emerged of a widespread gap in the cost of health insurance , as women pay much more than men of the same age for individual insurance policies providing identical coverage , according to new data from insurance companies and online brokers .
Some insurance executives expressed surprise at the size and prevalence of the disparities , which can make a woman ’s insurance cost hundreds of dollars a year more than a man’s .
Women ’s advocacy groups have raised concerns about the differences , and members of Congress have begun to question the justification for them .
The new findings , which are not easily explained away , come amid anxiety about the declining economy .
More and more people are shopping for individual health insurance policies because they have lost jobs that provided coverage .
Politicians of both parties have offered proposals that would expand the role of the individual market , giving people tax credits or other assistance to buy coverage on their own .
“ Women often fare worse than men in the individual insurance market , ” said Senator Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee .
Contrast that with the realities of an energy crisis .
We cannot heat our homes with the promises of oil , or the electronic transfer of ownership of fragments of a tanker load making its way from Ras Tanura to the Gulf ports .
We need the physical presence of the oil , natural gas or wood that we will consume .
When we run out , we need to get some more .
As a result , for the vast majority of us who do not keep our money in the mattress , financial solvency and insolvency is defined by electronic statements about the nature of our accounts , without there being a pile of gold sitting in the bank to define it .
And , when the banks and other companies holding such accounts get into trouble , loans can and have been arranged for them , that are similarly electronic transactions , without large trucks pulling up at either Fort Knox , where 147.3 million ounces currently sit , or to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York , that holds about 216 million ounces .
Rather the transactions occur electronically , and there is relatively little need for the physical presence of the cash .
One of the considerable differences between the ongoing financial problems of the world , and the coming energy crisis lies in the nature of the commodity of concern .
In the first case the problem focuses around money , though not really the physical and tangible cash that one uses less and less to pay for groceries , the rent , or the occasional book .
The US has already transitioned to a point that more than half the time we use credit and debit cards to pay the bill .
( The quote is from a year ago )
If we are in Western Europe that means that though we buy , for the sake of example , natural gas from Turkmenistan , we have to pay the Russians to transport it through their gas lines , and the Ukrainians to allow its passage , before we can enjoy the fruits of our purchase .
It is the nature of this physical reality that makes the energy problem that much more difficult to resolve , and in some cases to prepare for .
There was a poignant reminder of this in a story that Leanan caught on Sunday from the Buffalo News .
I had mentioned last week the increased popularity of pellet stoves in the North East .
But pellets are an easily storable commodity , and demand cannot keep up with supply .
And thus we have :
At the same time that firewood supplies tighten , slowing lumber production for home building is reducing supplies of wood pellets , a sawdust - based fuel used in specialized furnaces .
Pellet seller Forest Products
Firewood receives calls from people all over the state seeking a winter supply of the fuel , which has been sold out since Labor Day , Clay said .
“ They say ‘ what do you mean you ’re out — I heat my house with them , ’ ” she said .
If wood pellets are the only fuel that you can use to heat your house and there are n’t any to be had , then life gets complicated .
I have previously cited the problems that New England has seen in the supply of natural gas .
In the book Cape Wind by Williams and Whitcomb , the authors describe a situation that occurred when there was a cold snap in 2004 .
Natural gas supplies to New England are fairly limited , and the companies that supply natural gas to homeowners and to power plants use natural gas from the same pipelines .
At the beginning of the cold snap , homeowners and businesses suddenly started drawing more natural gas for heat .
This usage drained all the available natural gas away from the power stations that planned on using it to provide electric power for the region .
The loss of natural gas supply was a surprise to the utility relying on natural gas , not too different from the lack of pellets in the example above .
If one is heating with wood , one can tell by the lack of a stack of wood in the yard that one has an upcoming problem in getting through the winter warmly .
The sudden lack of electricity in the middle of a cold spell , when the power fails , is something else again .
The incoming Administration is likely to be faced with an Energy problem sooner , rather than later .
These problems will likely divide into two partially distinct parts , the need for a reliable source of heat and electricity , and a source of liquid fuel for transportation .
Within four years , there will be a need for more electric power generation capacity .
Given the short time - frame , it is likely to be too late to rely on the addition of nuclear or coal power plants to provide an immediate answer , since they take too long to be permitted and constructed .
There are a large number of coal - fired plants that have been planned but are currently on hold because of uncertainty regarding the treatment of future carbon emissions if a cap and trade program or other carbon legislation is passed .
Some form of a decision on the future of coal power should be made fairly soon , so that plans can move forward , one way or another .
In that regard , it is worth noting that as Senator , President - elect Obama did support the FutureGen project in Illinois .
FutureGen is a plan for a near - zero emissions coal fired power plant in Illionois , including carbon capture and storage .
With respect to liquid fuel , the last Administration bet heavily on ethanol .
While there has been considerable growth in ethanol production , there are increasing signs of local concerns with the plants and , as Leanan noted , the financial climate is worse .
VeraSun Energy Corp. ( NYSE : VSE ) , a cash - strapped ethanol company that lost big in hedging corn prices , said late Friday it had filed for bankruptcy .
. . . . .
VeraSun claims to be the largest ethanol producer in the world , citing data from the Renewable Fuel Association and its own estimates .
As of Sept. 5 , the company was running 14 ethanol plants that , combined , had the capacity to produce 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol per year , or about 14 percent of the U.S. ethanol production capacity .
VeraSun was adding three more plants to bring its total capacity to 1.64 billion gallons per year by the end of 2008 .
This has some relevance to future liquid sources of fuel , since corn - based ethanol is easier to produce than cellulosic - based fuel , and already in production .
If current producers are having difficulty surviving in the marketplace , then plans for producing other biofuels ( pdf ) must be considered more difficult and longer term .
It has been suggested that the search for biofuels should take the form of an Apollo - type of program , and as you may have picked up from earlier posts , I am not sure that this single focus type of effort is necessarily a good thing .
For example the Department of Energy is planning an Algal Fuels Workshop ( pdf ) to plan out the Agency program , in Washington in December .
However it is “ by invitation only , ” so I fear that among other things , you wo n’t be able to read about what they are planning here .
I have , in the past , commented that I favor a more comprehensive approach where there is initially a broader search for ideas , rather than the focus on single larger efforts such as that favored by DARPA .
Again , however , this will continue , for around a decade , to be more of a research program , rather than a solution .
We are stuck with the uncomfortable reality that we need fuel within the next four years , for both vehicles and for our electric switches .
In that short - term , the immediate shortage of an adequate supply of fuel and energy to warm houses , fuel power stations and power vehicles will become more evident .
Debating points will have to be turned into reality , and the physical presence of an adequate fuel must be provided .
It will be interesting to see where it comes from .
Most likely a considerable portion will have to come from conservation , but that is not , in itself , going to be adequate .
Sept. 23 , 2008  -- Barack Obama 's candidacy for president both underscores sharp racial divides in this country and offers avenues for progress : Political engagement by blacks is up sharply , Americans across racial lines think the 2008 campaign will change blacks ' self - image for the better and most see Obama 's nomination as a sign of broader racial progress .
It 's already fostered pride and involvement alike .
Blacks are following the election more intensely than other Americans , at a level unseen in the last three presidential elections .
They 're more apt than Americans of other races to have contributed money or time to a political campaign this year .
And voter registration by blacks is higher than in pre-election polls since 1984 .
Click here for a PDF with charts and full questionnaire .
Regardless of their candidate preference , 61 percent of Americans – 70 percent of blacks , and about six in 10 whites and Hispanics alike – think Obama 's candidacy will change the way blacks think about themselves , and nearly all who feel that way say it 'll be for the better .
Seven in 10 Americans , similarly , think his candidacy represents broader progress for all blacks , not a single case of individual advancement .
But beyond that agreement this ABC News / USA Today / Columbia University poll also finds broad divides among the races , in vote choices , issue concerns , life experiences and identity .
And there are further divides among blacks themselves , on fundamental questions of racial identity , individual initiative and the root causes of social problems .
Race & Discrimination in America
This extensive poll on race , politics and society was conducted with the participation of Columbia University 's Center on African - American Politics and Society , part of its Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy .
Interviews were done among random national samples of 1,941 adults , including 1,032 blacks and 315 Hispanics ( the latter interviewed in English or Spanish , as preferred ) .
It finds , strikingly , that 76 percent of blacks say they personally have encountered racial discrimination , as do 58 percent of Hispanics ; that falls very steeply among whites , to 29 percent .
The experience of discrimination resonates across a range of other attitudes : Blacks who 've experienced it , are , for instance , far less likely to see racial equality as achievable in their lifetimes , more likely to think they need to play down their racial identity in order to succeed , more apt to see racism as the root of blacks ' challenges and more likely to favor race - based affirmative action .
Identity is another basic point of division .
Blacks split evenly , 45 - 46 percent , on whether they think of themselves first as blacks or as Americans ( with black identity higher among blacks who 've experienced discrimination ) .
Hispanics divide similarly on the question – 42 percent think of themselves as Hispanics first , 50 percent as Americans .
Whites are different : Ninety - one percent see themselves first as Americans , while just 4 percent profess greater racial than national identity .
At the same time , in a finding with broad potential ramifications , class identity trumps racial identity : Sixty percent of blacks , and about as many Hispanics as well , say they have more in common with members of their social class ( e.g. , working - class or middle - class ) than with members of their race .
And even with their enthusiasm for Obama , blacks by a wide margin , 60 - 23 percent , say it 's more important for African - Americans to build economic rather than political power .
Another key finding , perhaps surprising given personal experience , is that blacks do not broadly blame racism as the chief barrier African - Americans face in improving their situation .
While 37 percent say racism is the more important factor , slightly more , 44 percent , say it 's lack of initiative among blacks themselves .
( Half of Hispanics , and 56 percent of whites , share that view . )
Life experience again is a factor :
Blacks who 've often experienced discrimination are 20 points more apt than those who have n't experienced it at all to call racism the main barrier facing blacks .
Barack Obama 's Historic Candidacy Injects Race into Presidential Campaign
Changes in political engagement among blacks are remarkable : Eighty - four percent report being registered to vote , up from 78 percent in the 2004 ABC News / Washington Post pre-election tracking poll , and likewise more than in ABC pre-election polls dating to 1984 .
( Fewer Hispanics , 69 percent , report being registered . )
Fifty - six percent of blacks also say they 're following the election very closely , compared with 48 percent of whites and 33 percent of Hispanics ; that 's the highest level of engagement among blacks since 1992 – 9 points higher than in pre-election 2004 , 21 points higher than in 2000 and 24 points higher than in 1996 .
Nearly a third of blacks , 31 percent , say they 've donated money to a political campaign , compared with 21 percent of whites and 16 percent of Hispanics .
Fourteen percent of blacks say they 've worked for a political party or candidate in the past year , twice the rate among whites and Hispanics .
And , locally , blacks are more apt than whites and Hispanics , by 9 and 12 points , to report having attended a town or school meeting .
Blacks broadly reject the suggestion that Obama has avoided issues of special concern to African - Americans in order to sharpen his appeal to whites .
At the same time , race is a vast differentiator : Among registered voters , 92 percent of blacks support Obama over John McCain , as do 57 percent of Hispanics but just 36 percent of whites .
Still , support among whites for McCain over Obama , 56 - 36 percent , can't easily be seen as based on the candidates ' races , since whites divided by a similar 58 - 41 percent for George W. Bush over John Kerry , and by as wide or wider margins for George H.W. Bush in 1988 and for Ronald Reagan in both of his elections .
Similarly , Obama 's 92 percent support from blacks is much like Kerry 's 88 percent and Al Gore 's 90 percent ; blacks are the single most reliable Democratic voting group .
Nonetheless , Obama 's candidacy clearly has struck a chord with blacks .
Fifty - one percent say his nomination makes them more proud to be Americans – down from its peak , 64 percent , during his nominating convention , but still a substantial number .
Notably , there are some whites who are particularly in tune with African - American concerns , and more apt than their counterparts to support Obama .
Nearly a third of whites , 32 percent , say blacks have too little influence over government policies ; they support Obama by 58 - 39 percent .
Whites who instead say blacks have the right amount of influence , or the few who say they have too much , back McCain by 66 - 27 percent .
Similarly , Obama leads McCain by nearly 2 - 1 among whites who support race - based affirmative action ; McCain leads by nearly 3 - 1 among whites who oppose it .
Seventy percent of blacks say there 's such a thing as a " black experience . "
Among them , 89 percent say Obama 's in touch with it .
Seventy - one percent of blacks say Obama 's mainly addressing concerns of special interest to blacks ; just 16 percent say he 's avoiding them .
And few blacks – just 12 percent – think Obama is playing to whites when he urges that blacks take greater responsibility for their actions .
Most Americans across the board reject the notion that if Obama were elected blacks would gain too much influence in government :
Just five percent of blacks , 10 percent of whites and 13 percent of Hispanic say so .
Great Expectations for Obama
Some blacks are keeping their expectations muted ; while nine in 10 support Obama , fewer , albeit a still - high 72 percent , expect him to win .
Just 13 percent of blacks expect McCain to win .
Asked why , the most prevalent answer by far is racism or an unwillingness among whites to vote for Obama , volunteered by 40 percent in this group .
Still , that means that overall just 5 percent of blacks expect McCain to win and racism to be the reason .
( Whites and Hispanics who expect McCain to win attribute that more to his experience than to any other cause ; very few cite racism . )
The view that Obama 's candidacy will change blacks ' self - image peaks among his supporters , but remains prevalent among others .
Seventy - four percent of Obama supporters think his candidacy will cause a change for the better in the way blacks think about themselves ; this declines to 49 percent of McCain supporters .
Even among blacks who think McCain will win , a still - majority 54 percent think Obama 's candidacy will change blacks ' self - image for the better .
Poll : Blacks Put Economic Security Atop Priority List
There are great differences by race in local issues and national political priorities alike .
A vast 71 percent of blacks identify a lack of jobs and other economic opportunities as a serious problem in their own community ; just 37 percent of whites report the same concern .
Fifty - five percent of blacks say their community suffers from poor schools ; among whites , it 's just 25 percent .
On these , most blacks and whites alike say they blame not individuals , but conditions in society more broadly .
There are other issue differences , some seen as individual in cause , others social .
Forty - two percent of blacks call crime a serious problem in their community , and nearly as many Hispanics agree , while this drops sharply to 19 percent among whites .
Blacks and Hispanics alike also are at least twice as likely as whites to identify domestic violence , teen pregnancy and lack of volunteerism as serious community problems , and also more apt to report serious problems with the prevalence of unwed mothers and an absence of high moral and ethical standards .
Blacks are particularly attuned to another issue , the treatment of African - Americans in the criminal justice system :
Sixty - eight percent call it a serious problem in their community , essentially matching lack of economic opportunity as the No. 1 local concern .
Concern about this issue drops sharply to a third of Hispanics and just 17 percent among whites .
There are some differences on local issues within black groups ; among them lower - income blacks are much more likely than those with middle or higher incomes to rate crime , drugs , teen pregnancy , single mothers and domestic violence as serious problems in their area .
Striking Differences in National Issues
On the national front , there are several issues on which blacks and Hispanics are far more likely than whites to desire top priority attention from the next administration .
Those include poverty programs , the minimum wage , affirmative action , health care , education and criminal justice .
Some of these differences , again , are particularly striking .
Fifty percent of whites say the next administration should give its highest priority to health care issues ; that jumps to 72 percent of blacks and Hispanics alike .
Education is similar – 50 percent of whites give it top priority , rising to seven in 10 blacks and Hispanics .
And just 38 percent of whites give highest priority to poverty programs ; that jumps to nearly two - thirds of blacks and Hispanics .
Hispanics , for their part , are much more apt than whites or blacks to cite immigration as a top priority .
Nonetheless the agreement of most blacks and Hispanics on many of these issues may serve to diminish the notion of a so - called black - brown divide ; the two groups have much in common on a range of issue concerns and priorities , if not all .
Indeed among all groups – blacks , whites and Hispanics alike – there 's agreement on the single top issue , the economy .
Seventy - six percent of whites , and 80 percent of blacks and Hispanics , say it should get the government 's highest priority .
In another measure , the economy is by far the single most important issue in the presidential race , cited by just under four in 10 whites and Hispanics , and even more blacks , 50 percent .
And in a gauge strongly influenced by economic discontent , three - quarters of whites and Hispanics , rising to 91 percent of blacks , say the country 's " seriously off on the wrong track . "
Affirmative Action
There are big racial differences on race - based affirmative action programs ; support ranges from 76 percent of blacks to 57 percent of Hispanics and down to a third of whites .
But there 's a way to reduce this divide : Majorities of all races support such programs if they 're poverty - based rather than race - based .
And majorities support either race - or poverty - based programs that give assistance , rather than preference , to their targeted constituencies .
Anywhere from 76 to 82 percent of blacks support any of these approaches to affirmative action .
But among Hispanics , support swells from 57 percent to more than seven in 10 if the approach moves away from race - based preference .
And among whites the change is most dramatic :
While just 33 percent support race - based preference programs , six in 10 favor poverty - based preference programs or race - based assistance programs , and more still favor poverty - based assistance programs .
Support for affirmative action peaks among blacks who 've personally experienced racial discrimination ; in this group 81 percent support race - based preference programs , compared with 62 percent of whose who have n't experienced discrimination .
All the same , affirmative action is not a top - tier issue .
It was given highest priority by about three in 10 blacks and Hispanics and just 9 percent of whites – in all cases , far below other , more pressing concerns .
One issue rates lower still , the idea of government reparations for slavery .
Twenty - four percent of blacks assign it a top priority , last on the list even for blacks .
Reparations are of greater interest to low - education blacks ( 30 percent give it a top priority ) than to those with college degrees ( just 5 percent ) .
Blacks Still Reach for Racial Equality
There 's general agreement across groups that blacks have not yet achieved racial equality , though with still - wide differences :
Just under four in 10 whites think so , declining to a quarter of Hispanics and just 11 percent of blacks themselves .
Most think that , if not yet , they will soon ; but a substantial number of blacks , 44 percent , think racial equality will not come in their lifetime , or will never come .
There are differences among groups .
Pessimism , as noted , peaks among blacks who 've personally experienced racial discrimination – 50 percent in this group say equality will not come in their lifetime , or wo n't ever come ; among those who have n't experienced discrimination just 26 percent say so .
Blacks divide , 49 - 46 percent , on whether they need to play down their racial identity in order to get ahead ( most whites and Hispanics think not ) .
As noted , blacks who 've personally experienced discrimination are more apt to think it 's necessary for blacks to play down their racial identity .
And this view peaks among higher - income blacks ; among those with $ 100,000 incomes , 63 percent think they have to play down their racial identity .
That drops to 48 percent among those with lower incomes .
In another measure , slightly more blacks say the history of slavery has too much rather than too little influence in how blacks think about themselves today , 31 percent vs. 26 percent , with the rest saying it 's about right .
( Whites and Hispanics say it has too much influence , by much wider margins . )
Blacks are inclined to reach out : Eighty - six percent say they 're better off building coalitions with other ethnic and racial groups than working alone to solve community problems .
But they also display group cohesion ; 64 percent of blacks think that what happens to blacks generally impacts them personally .
Some of that , as with many views among blacks , is influenced by racial discrimination .
Among blacks who 've experienced discrimination , 70 percent say they 're impacted by what happens to others of their race .
Among blacks who have n't felt discrimination , far fewer , 48 percent , share that view .
METHODOLOGY : This ABC News / USA Today / Columbia University poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 11 - 14 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 1,941 adults , including oversamples of African - Americans ( for a total of 1,032 ) and Hispanics ( 315 ) .
Groups were weighted to their correct share of the national population .
Results for the full sample have a 2 - point error margin ; for blacks , 3 points ; for whites , 4 points ; and for Hispanics , 5.5 points .
Columbia 's University 's participation in the survey was supported by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York .

The famously disciplined " No Drama Obama " team has allowed a third day of speculation that he 'll name former rival Hillary Clinton as his top diplomat .
Tomasky discussed the downsides last week .
Chief among them , for Mike : Obama and Clinton do n't seem to get along personally , so foreign leaders could wonder if Clinton is really speaking for him , or freelancing her own foreign policy .
Also , Obama won .
To the extent that Obama does owe Clinton for her support during the general election campaign , the nation 's top diplomatic job is a heck of a chit for her to call in .
Another question US papers have been asking : Can Clinton overcome the Obama team 's rigorous vetting process ?
In Bill Clinton 's eight years out of office , he has amassed a fortune in speaking fees and has built a global philanthropic effort .
He would be required to release the list of donors to his William J Clinton Foundation and to the Clinton presidential library in Little Rock , something he refused to do during Clinton 's campaign for the Democratic nomination .
According to the New York Times this morning , the Obama team has begun a review of the former president 's " finances and activities " .

Huntsville .... I do n’t know if you appreciate the scope of DIGG .
Think of DIGG as a Drudgereport that is programmed by me and you .
Have you noticed that the little DIGG link is all over articles on the net ?
DIGG is used by millions as a way for the best articles on the net to be set up for them instead of going after articles .
I used DIGG for tech articles .... it saves me time so that I get the best without looking .
The same goes for politics , etc .
When I first started FR , I was surprised they were n’t DIGGing articles ... its the best way to push out articles to people who might otherwise not see them .
Go do a search on Palin and you ’ll see dozens of hate filled articles that have been circulated to millions of people .
This has to change !!
I do n’t understand why the staff of FR is not actively promoting the use of DIGG .
If you want to make an impact out there , you have to do more then preach to the choir here .

Moreover , we should pass around a sign - up sheet where FReepers committ to posting a certain number of articles over there ( and then repost the Digg links over here to be FReeped ) between now and election day .
10 posts each ought to just about do it ( =20 , one here and one there for each post at Digg ) .
If ever FReeper did that , Digg would be inundated with articles and video exposing ObamaNation from now to election day !!!

Reddit is better , although smaller .
In addition to adding and voting in sites you want to advance , you can vote down bad articles .

Just judging by the outraged reaction of the liberal Diggers ( How dare FReepers come to OUR site ?
We own the Internet ! ) , I 'd say flooding Digg is an excellent idea .
If for no other reason than to poke a thumb in their collective eye .

Well , not everyone has heard of it , but there are plenty of people there , to influence .
Why you think the liberals are busy digging ?
They are smarter than the McCain people .
I read that William Ayers in the 90’s was busy helping the Democrats with online outreach !
To each is own , you do what you feel is effective or are you doing anything ?
Let us do what we feel is EFFECTIVE !

Fake polls mean squat .
When FR had polls they would list member and
non member separate results and combined .
A case in point Ron Paul would just get a few
votes from members but a bunch from non members .
Repeat after me FAKE POLLS , Photo shops and cut
or edited videos mean squat .
I joined FR to read things , read replies and not
to watch cut or edited videos or go to fake polls .

If you believe Digg is influential then Ron Paul would have been the Republican nominee .

Government plans that would force tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain , unbranded packets could be the most powerful tool yet unleashed in the war on smoking .
The tobacco industry has admitted that the tactic , being pioneered in Britain but likely to be followed elsewhere , will slash profits and inflict enormous damage on cigarette manufacturers .
Tobacco analysts have warned in a leading industry magazine that a ban on branding and logos on packets would lead smokers to abandon well - known brands such as Marlboro and Silk Cut , which cost up to £ 6 a pack , and switch to cheaper options .
Public health officials say it will strip cigarettes of their glamorous image and reduce the numbers of young people taking up the habit .
The Department of Health is considering outlawing the use of logos , colours and graphics on packets and requiring them to be sold in plain packaging .
The latest issue of Tobacco Journal International reports that ' according to analysts from Morgan Stanley , if generic packaging becomes a legal requirement in the UK , not only could it have a domino effect on other markets , but it could also have a materially adverse impact on cigarette brand equity [ and ] could result in considerably reduced profits ' .
David Adelman of Morgan Stanley said : ' If plain packaging were adopted in the UK , some other nations would most likely mandate [ it ] as well . '
Adam Spielman , a tobacco analyst at Citigroup , told the publication : ' Plain packaging would level the playing field , making premium brands less attractive to smokers , and would lead to a rapid worsening of the downtrading [ falling sales ] trend which has been going on for years in the UK , far and away the most expensive country in Europe for smokers . '
Tobacco companies fear that introducing the plain packaging would prompt many smokers to abandon the premium brands such as Marlboro and Benson and Hedges , and instead switch to much cheaper makes costing £ 3.50 to £ 4 .
As for the global tobacco industry , the seminal legislation could pose a real risk to profitability in the future , reports TJI .
It points out that , as cigarette advertising is banned in the UK , packs have become more elaborate as they are the best way manufacturers can promote their brands and distinguish them from rival products .
In an insight into the industry 's finances , the journal says : ' While the cost of production is roughly the same for both and , according to analysts , the difference in quality is barely perceptible , the profit margin of premium brands is considerably higher than that of low - priced cigarettes . '
The Health Department recently closed its consultation on a raft of measures to reduce the number of smokers even further , which has fallen to 22 per cent of the adult population .
They include plain packaging , banning cigarettes from public displays in shops , outlawing packs of 10 and getting rid of vending machines .
It received even more responses than the 55,000 it got before last year 's public smoking ban .
Most respondents supported the plans , including plain packaging .
Deborah Arnott , director of health campaigning charity Ash , hailed plain packing as 'an idea whose time has come .
The industry knows that plain packs spell the death knell to industry profitability , ' she said .
' The industry cannot survive without recruiting replacements for the 100,000 UK citizens its products kill each year .
Most of these new smokers are children and young people , who our research shows find plain packs much less attractive . '
The tobacco industry argues that the moves will lead to a rise in cigarette smuggling , more counterfeiting of tobacco products and will threaten small retailers ' livelihoods .

Much overseas expansion has occurred in the past five years , and even more recently than that for the Middle East and Asia , according to statistics compiled by the National Law Journal , a trade publication .
In Hong Kong , there was a 48 percent increase in the number of lawyers from the 250 biggest American law firms from 2007 to 2008 , based on data from the journal .
In Abu Dhabi , their ranks grew 144 percent .
In February , Latham & Watkins announced three new offices in the Middle East — in Dubai , Abu Dhabi and Doha , Qatar — in one fell swoop , to reach its total of 14 .
Dewey & LeBoeuf , based in New York , closed offices in Connecticut , Florida , North Carolina and Texas this year .
But in the same October memo the firm sent to its eight Charlotte lawyers and staff members to inform them of the closing there , the firm ’s executive director announced the opening of new outposts in Doha and Abu Dhabi early next year .
And the beat goes on .
“ I know of at least 10 or 11 associates who are throwing their résumés out here , or coming by to visit to check it out , ” says Arjun Ahluwalia , an associate in the Dubai office of the London - based Allen & Overy , who moved there from Shearman & Sterling in New York .
Mr. Ahluwalia , 30 , grew up in Dubai , went to law school in Michigan and began his career in New York .
Now , he says , he sees a big push from young lawyers hoping to find work in the Middle East .
“ Even kids currently in law school are coming by Dubai for jobs , ” he says .
“ I met a very enthusiastic candidate from a Chicago law school in his second year who basically flew to Dubai for four days and actually cold - called and made visits to a bunch of firms . ”
BRUCE MacEWEN , a lawyer in New York who also consults with law firms on strategic issues , says firms “ have realized that based on demographics and petrodollars , there ’s going to be growth in Asia and the Middle East that was n’t in their plans 5 to 10 years ago . ”
But staffing the new offices with qualified lawyers to handle growing demand has n’t always been easy .
The talent pool is n’t large enough in Hong Kong or Dubai to absorb the work , so firms often find themselves soliciting lawyers from their offices in the United States or Britain , enticing lateral hires from other firms or promising younger lawyers a chance to do high - level client work much sooner than they might in New York .

x264 Revision 1000 Party !
A few weeks ago , we realized that revision 1000 of x264 was coming up , and it was going to be big .
I mean , 1000 revisions of x264 ?
That 's about 5 years of development from the thin shell that was the original x264 in 2003 .
I had already prepared many commits for the actual thousandth revision ( in the end , a total of seventeen were simultaneously committed , the list can be found
But where would we have the party ?
And how would we get many people to come ?
I mean , x264 users are spread far and wide , and I do n't even live anywhere near Akupenguin , the other primary x264 developer .
So we considered various locations .
And we decided that ... what better place to have the party than ...
... DivX headquarters ?
I mean , considering Project Remoulade ( DivX's beta H.264 decoder and encoder ) , DivX 's buyout of Mainconcept , and their recently announced plans to enter the H.264 market with their " DivX 7 " , what a perfect place to have a party !
We first entered with the cake not hinting at who we were ; the opening of the cake with the x264 logo was covered with some papers and a CD - ROM .
But our identity was soon revealed ( to the utter shock of the DivX folks out front ) , so we took some quick group pictures ( me and some of the DivX guys ) before the cake was devoured by ravenous DivX employees .
I'm on the right of the image , in my Avail Media T - shirt .
Now , interestingly enough , today was also DivX's Halloween party .
And the creative geeky costumes were out in force .
As were the pumpkins .
We were introduced to the party right in the middle ; certainly , nobody had expected us .
Upon the mention of x264 , the room broke out in cheering , and I introduced myself and the cake .
While its hard to see , the cake originally read " Congratulations on Project Remoulade " , with the x264 logo in the middle .
It was devoured rather quickly by the DivX staff ( after being cut up into macroblocks , of course ) and the various others who had showed up for the Halloween party .
After some fun partying and discussion with various people at DivX , we were led on a short tour of some of the facilities .
I also presented the cards , including one from Guillaume Poirier , who , being an x264 developer in France , was not able to attend the party .
I also got to discuss the upcoming DivX 7 profiles and their various restrictions -- while they 're still not official or released yet , hopefully this will lead to more communication in the future !
Though I only had about two or three hours there total , it was an incredibly fun and surprisingly productive experience ( and , quite tasty , one might say ) .
Thanks to the guys at DivX for a great party and good discussion on various video topics -- along with the showing of their hilariously creative costumes ( including John McCain , a Rick Astley imitation , the above Tetris group , and many others ) .
Despite the surprise of an x264 developer turning up on their doorstep on Halloween ( and without a costume , too ! ) , they were extremely receptive .
And the cake was delicious !
( Oh , and you ask who was the " we " ?
A certain will - not - be - named former DivX employee was kind enough to drive me down from Los Angeles to DivX 's headquarters in San Diego , but requested he not be named in this post for certain reasons .
Thanks also to him for paying for the cake and various other logistical aspects of this . )
I told you there would be cake .
Here is its story .

I had already prepared many commits for the actual thousandth revision ( in the end , a total of seventeen were simultaneously committed , the list can be found here ) .
But such a milestone was certainly worthy of more than just a flood of commits -- it needed a party .
And there 's one thing you pretty much have to have for a party .
So , we got a cake : But where would we have the party ?
And how would we get many people to come ?

The image is coming into focus .
Even McCain ’s confidants are now suggesting that it was his anger and frustration with Obama that led him to embrace Steve Schmidt ’s Willie Horton - on - Steroids campaign for the White House .
And whether it ’s the appearance before the Des Moines Register Editorial board or his tense refusal to make eye contact during the first presidential debate , I do n’t think many people would deny at this point that McCain ’s hostility and contempt for Obama — what even Wolf Blitzer calls his “ disdain ” — is palpable .
After the first debate many people wondered aloud whether it was hostility and contempt or fear and intimidation that kept McCain from looking Obama in the face even once .
But with two weeks and more evidence to consider , it is clear that it was both : Hostility that is magnified by the person ’s mortifying inability to face the person who inspires it .
That ’s the kind of unchanneled , clogged up anger that makes you unsteady , that makes you make mistakes .
McCain ’s moral cowardice has been one of the subtexts of this campaign ever since he wound up the nomination and turned his attention to Barack Obama .
But I did not realize it would reveal itself in such a physical dimension .
The tell came this week as McCain unearthed the Ayers story which , for whatever its merits , was fully aired months ago and has no clear relation to the particulars of October other than McCain ’s collapsing poll numbers .
He ’s on it .
Palin ’s on it .
He ’s releasing slashing new TV ads like this one .
Both of them are ginning their crowds up into spiraling gyres of right - wing delirium — a ready - made Lord of the Flies ( and let ’s admit that ’s a gentle allusion , given the tone of these barnburners ) if Obama happened into one of the auditoriums at the wrong moment .
He ever swaggered on for a couple days about how he was going to ‘ take the gloves off ‘ when he met up with Obama in Nashville .
But when the two of them were there in each others physical presence … nothing .
By a myriad of gestures and reactions Obama owned him .
Nor is it a matter of shifting off the tactics , because as soon as McCain made his hasty retreat from the stage at Debate # 2 he was right back at it .
In every other aspect of life , high and low , refined and unlovely , we have a word for that kind of behavior : cowardice .
And now Obama can lightly taunt McCain with that very cowardice , his inability to just say it to his face .
And if my take on the inner workings of McCain ’s mind at the moment is right that should simply unhinge him even more .
RICHMOND , Ky. , Nov. 11 ( UPI ) --
Officials say they are preparing to destroy 157 gallons of the chemical warfare nerve agent GB , or sarin , after a container leaked in Kentucky .
The process was expected to begin Wednesday at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond , Ky. , and comes after more than a year of delays and detailed preparations , the Lexington ( Ky. ) Herald - Leader reported .
Advertisement
In August , one of the three steel containers holding the GB leaked in what was described by officials as the largest leak in the history of the 14,500 - acre chemical weapons depot .
The GB was originally stored in a steel one ton container in a storage igloo beginning in the mid-1980s , the newspaper said .
In 2004 , portions of the stockpile were transferred to two other containers because the chemical and decontaminants had eaten away at the bolts of the original container .
Depot operations officials , after previously saying the August leak posed no threat , told the Herald - Leader Monday that the ton containers would continue to pose a potential risk if the GB was not destroyed .
If you think the celebrity sniping in Heat magazine is bitchy , it has nothing on a good old academic slanging match .
The pages of New Humanist magazine this month are filled with one of the best intellectual cat - fights I 've seen in ages .
It starts with the philosopher Prof AC Grayling 's less than congratulatory review of sociologist Prof Steve Fuller 's book Dissent over Descent or " nearly 300 pages of wasted forest " as Grayling puts it .
Fuller has form on this topic .
He appeared as a witness for the defence in the infamous trial in Dover , Pennsylvania , in December 2005 over the teaching of intelligent design - he was there to advocate the teaching of ID in science lessons .
Fuller describes ID as an effort to establish that life was purposefully designed by an intelligent agency that works " by the usual scientific appeals to reason and evidence " .
" No , " cries Grayling , as he wades into a " swamp of BS " .
It starts from a fixed conclusion , and looks for evidence to support it .
Does it specify what would refute the fixed belief in a designing intelligence that is its starting point ?
Does it tell us what would count as a test of what it has already accepted in advance , before the search for allegedly supportive evidence begins ?
It does not .
Fuller emphasises science 's religious roots , while Grayling champions the atheist contribution to science .
Well , let 's see : it removed the risk of scientists being burned at the stake for controverting the divinely revealed truth that " the lord hath laid the foundations of the earth so that it shall not be moved for ever " ( Psalm 104 ) ...
It removed the necessity of having to distort observations , facts , experimental results and observations to fit an antecedent doctrine as far from what observation and experiment revealed as one could possibly get .
Fuller 's come - back is that Grayling simply " does not know what he is talking about " .
In light of this modus operandi , I conclude that either Grayling simply did not " read " the book as ordinarily understood , or he was afraid to admit he was not up to the job of reviewing it , and so he figured he could bluff his way by saying philosophy - looking things that effectively preached to the converted ( ie " new humanists " ) .
And what of the status of design ?
To be sure , the design inference has been strongly contested , but the dispute ranges over who bears the greater burden of proof : defenders of design or chance .
Which general form of explanation is simpler ?
Intuitions have varied across history , but what comes through clearly in these debates is that some combination of chance and necessity of the sort associated with Neo - Darwinism are today presumed to be more plausible than Intelligent Design until shown otherwise .
This distribution of the burden of proof reflects little more than a bias in favour of the scientific orthodoxy , whose relationship to the beliefs of rank - and - file trained scientists we simply do not know .
The folk at New Humanist helpfully stoked the ideological flames further by giving Grayling another chance to respond .
" Steve Fuller complains , as do all authors whose books are panned , that I did not read his book properly ( or at all ) .
Alas , I did . "
Ouch !!
In his retort he cleverly lists a few of the countless examples of spectacular mal - design in nature .
Painful errors that surely an omniscient being or beings would have avoided .
He concludes :
Barack Obama celebrates his victory as President of the United States at Grant Park in Chicago in 2008 .
In the final days of the election many Republicans seem to have given up the fight for power .
But do n't be fooled : that does n't mean they are relaxing .
If you want to see real Republican elbow grease , check out the energy going into chucking great chunks of the $ 700 bn bail - out out the door .
At a recent Senate banking committee hearing , the Republican Bob Corker was fixated on this task , and with a clear deadline in mind : inauguration .
" How much of it do you think may be actually spent by January 20 or so ? "
Corker asked Neel Kashkari , the 35 - year - old former banker in charge of the bail - out .
When European colonialists realised that they had no choice but to hand over power to the indigenous citizens , they would often turn their attention to stripping the local treasury of its gold and grabbing valuable livestock .
If they were really nasty , like the Portuguese in Mozambique in the mid-1970s , they poured concrete down the elevator shafts .
Nothing so barbaric for the Bush gang .
Rather than open plunder , it prefers bureaucratic instruments , such as " distressed asset " auctions and the " equity purchase program " .
But make no mistake : the goal is the same as it was for the defeated Portuguese - a final , frantic looting of the public wealth before they hand over the keys to the safe .
How else to make sense of the bizarre decisions that have governed the allocation of the bail - out money ?
When the Bush administration announced it would be injecting $ 250bn into US banks in exchange for equity , the plan was widely referred to as " partial nationalisation " - a radical measure required to get banks lending again .
Henry Paulson , the treasury secretary , had seen the light , we were told , and was following the lead of Gordon Brown .
In fact , there has been no nationalisation , partial or otherwise .
American taxpayers have gained no meaningful control over the banks , which is why the banks are free to spend the new money as they wish .
At Morgan Stanley , it looks as if much of the windfall will cover this year 's bonuses .
Citigroup has been hinting it will use its $ 25 bn buying other banks , while John Thain , the chief executive of Merrill Lynch , told analysts : " At least for the next quarter , it 's just going to be a cushion . "
The US government , meanwhile , is reduced to pleading with the banks that they at least spend a portion of the taxpayer windfall for loans - officially , the reason for the entire programme .
What , then , is the real purpose of the bail - out ?
My fear is this rush of dealmaking is something much more ambitious than a one - off gift to big business : that the Bush version of " partial nationalisation " is rigged to turn the US treasury into a bottomless cash machine for the banks for years to come .
Remember , the main concern among the big market players , particularly banks , is not the lack of credit but their battered share prices .
Investors have lost confidence in the honesty of the big financial players , and with good reason .
This is where the treasury 's equity pays off big time .
By purchasing stakes in these financial institutions , the treasury is sending a signal to the market that they are a safe bet .
Why safe ?
Not because their level of risk has been accurately assessed at last .
Not because they have renounced the kind of exotic instruments and outrageous leverage rates that created the crisis .
But because the market will now be banking on the fact that the US government wo n't let these particular companies fail .
If they get themselves into trouble , investors will now assume that the government will keep finding more cash to bail them out , since allowing them to go down would mean losing the initial equity investments , many of them in the billions .
( Just look at the insurance giant AIG , which has already gone back to taxpayers for a top - up , and seems likely to ask for a third . )
This tethering of the public interest to private companies is the real purpose of the bail - out plan : Paulson is handing all the companies admitted to the programme - a number potentially in the thousands - an implicit treasury department guarantee .
To skittish investors looking for safe places to park their money , these equity deals will be even more comforting than a triple - A from Moody 's rating agency .
Insurance like that is priceless .
But for the banks , the best part is that the government is paying them to accept its seal of approval .
For taxpayers , on the other hand , this entire plan is extremely risky , and may well cost significantly more than Paulson 's original idea of buying up $ 700 bn in toxic debts .
Now taxpayers are n't just on the hook for the debts but , arguably , for the fate of every corporation that sells them equity .
Interestingly , mortgage fund giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both enjoyed this kind of unspoken guarantee before they were nationalised at the start of this crisis .
For decades the market understood that , since these private players were enmeshed with the government , Uncle Sam could be counted on to always save the day .
It was , as many have pointed out , the worst of all worlds .
Not only were profits privatised while risks were socialised , but the implicit government backing created powerful incentives for reckless business practices .
With the new equity purchase programme Paulson has taken the discredited Fannie and Freddie model and applied it to a huge swath of the private banking industry .
Again , there is no reason to shy away from risky bets , especially since the treasury has made no such demands of the banks ( apparently it does n't want to " micromanage " . )
To further boost market confidence , the federal government has also unveiled unlimited public guarantees for many bank deposit accounts .
Oh , and as if this were not enough , the treasury has been encouraging the banks to merge , ensuring that the only institutions left will be " too big to fail " , thereby guaranteed a bail - out .
In three ways , the market is being told loud and clear that Washington will not allow the financial institutions to bear the consequences of their behaviour .
This may be Bush 's most creative innovation : no -risk capitalism .
There is a glimmer of hope .
In answer to Senator Corker 's question , the treasury is indeed having trouble dispersing the bail - out funds .
So far it has requested about $ 350bn of the $ 700bn , but most of this has n't yet made it out the door .
Meanwhile , every day it becomes clearer that the bail - out was sold to the public on false pretences .
Clearly , it was never really about getting loans flowing .
It was always about doing what it is doing : turning the state into a giant insurance agency for Wall Street , a safety net for the people who need it least , subsidised by the people who will most need state protections in the economic storms ahead .
This duplicity is a political opportunity .
Whoever wins on November 4 will have enormous moral authority .
It should be used to call for a freeze on the dispersal of bail - out funds , not after the inauguration but right away .
All deals should be renegotiated , this time with the public getting the guarantees .
It is risky , of course , to interrupt the bail - out process .
Nothing could be riskier , however , than allowing the Bush gang their parting gift to big business - the gift that will keep on taking .

“ The Best baseball you ever ate . ”
That ’s the slogan of the shortbread cookie company based in Cooperstown , New York ( home of the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum ) .
The cookie company ’s main product is simple short bread cookies shaped like baseballs .
While on the surface , it may not seem like much , the company does a good job selling their simple treat .
Each pack of two shortbread cookies comes in a small tin with the company ’s logo on it .
Inside , in addition to the cookies , baseball fans will find trivia questions such as : What Hall of Fame pitcher won at least 20 games in five straight seasons in the 1970s ( The answer to which is provided on their website is Jim “ Catfish ” Hunter ) ?
The company has been all over baseball during the past half decade with many of baseball ’s biggest stars , including Craig Biggio and Whitey Ford , using the Triple C for their family events .
According to the company , the , “ New York Yankees shared 1,200 customized tubes at the 2007 and 2008 Welcome Home Dinner , ” while the , “ Detroit Tigers gave 200 tins to their Season Suite holders . ”
The treat has also received national recognition as it was named one of Rachael Ray ’s “ Snacks of the Day ” on her television show .
While the shortbread cookie is no doubt their trademark , the company has done a lot to revolutionize the way they sell their product .
They offer many different ways to purchase their cookies from large tins to bags and even offer a program that will put a company ’s logo on a baseball sticker on the outside of a package of their cookies .
Their cookies come in four flavors including Classic Shortbread , All Star Almond , Boys of Summer Lemon and Mudville Mudball Chocolate Chip .
The simple shortbread cookies taste how one might expect a good shortbread cookie to taste .
Their simple packaging and style seems to cater to the old school baseball fan looking for an off - the - field way to keep the game they love in their life .
Their design is simple , yet presentable , and does give the impression of a company who has done their research and knows how to relate to the historic baseball community that surrounds them in Cooperstown .
In addition to producing these products , the company has also been active in their community and pledges part of all of their proceeds to the Pathfinder Village which is , “ a residential community for children who have Down syndrome . ”
They are also known for their involvement with a company called Human Technologies Corporation which is , “ a company of diverse businesses committed to enhancing the quality of live for people with disabilities . ”
Their small containers would make perfect stocking stuffers for a baseball fan and their larger options would be a good coffee table treat for guests around the holidays .
Other products they offer include a line of memorabilia with the theme of “ Baseball … Anyone Can Play , ” which sends the right message of participating in America ’s game to fans of all ages .
Overall , the product is a low price way to show a baseball fan that needs something special during the holiday time that the gift giver knows something about them .
Product Grade : 4.5/5

System On A Chip ( SOC ) - Credit : Central News Agency
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A world - wide expert on wireless communications , Professor Jri Lee of the National Taiwan University ( NTU ) and UCLA PhD conferred has created a system on a chip ( SOC ) with transmission speeds 100 times faster than WiFi and 350 times faster than 3.5G cell phones .
Professor Jri Lee 's team broke the speed record with the SoC design which is about 1/10th the size and cost of existing chips .
Preliminary figures indicate the SoC chip can be massed - produced for less than $ 1 per unit .
A demonstration of Professor Lee´s SoC chip was conducted recently at NTU .
The system on a chip combines Front - End Circuits and an antenna array to reach the ultimate transmission speed .
In practice the SoC chip can download a 4 - GB video in about 10 seconds .
The same video would take up to 2 - hours using WiFi , 1.5 - hours using ADSL and 4.5 - hours using Bluetooth to complete the download .
According to Professor Lee , as reported by Taiwan News , the new chip can be used to connect to all domestic audio- visual components like television , stereo , video recorder and transmit to TV screens anywhere in the home instantaneously .
In airports and train stations , the SOC could download an entire movie to a cell phone in a couple of seconds and upload thousands of pictures from a digital camera to a computer in a blink of the eye .
Professor Jri Lee´s team at the National Taiwan University Graduate Institute of Electrical Engineering introduction of the SoC chip edges out U.C. Berkeley and IBM´s researchers who are working on a similar solution .
The SoC can be used by cell phones and digital cameras as long as the corresponding hardware is developed .
NTU and Professor Lee´s team is in the process of applying for a patent .
Professor Lee´s academic career began at NTU .
He achieved a combined Master´s degree and PhD in electrical engineering from the University of California , Los Angeles in 2003 .
His work experience includes Cognet Microsystems in Los Angeles and Intel Corporation where his work included the SONET OC - 192 and OC - 48 transceivers .
Since 2004 , he has been Assistant Professor of electrical engineering at NTU and serves on various committees pertaining to broadband data communication , solid state circuits and other interest areas .

NM 's David Iglesias Pressured by Republicans to Bring ' Voter Fraud ' Charges Against Voter Registration Group
But Prosecutor Found No Case Worth Bringing ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/5/2007 , 9:05 pm PT
As reported by Democracy Now on Wednesday ...
U.S. Attorney Fired After Failing to Indict ACORN for Voter Fraud
There are new developments in the scandal over the Bush administration 's firing of eight U.S. Attorneys .
One of the dismissed prosecutors has revealed that he was pressured by Republican officials to target the advocacy group ACORN for voter fraud .
ACORN was working on a voter registration drive in low - income and largely minority neighborhoods in New Mexico .
David Iglesias told Newsweek that he found no case worth bringing against ACORN .
But that apparently did not please the White House .
Last week Attorney General Alberto Gonzales 's ex-chief of staff D. Kyle Sampson testified that during the run-up to the mid-term election White House adviser Karl Rove complained that Iglesias and two other U.S. Attorneys had not done enough to prosecute so - called voter fraud .
Ah yes , the always reliable GOP " vote fraud " scammers ' " ACORN canard " rears it 's ugly ( and unsubstantiated ) head again .
The NEWSWEEK article referenced above is here .
ACORN is the " Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now " , a group which has successfully run voter registration drives across the country in low - income and minority areas .
As we reported back in December of 2005 --- when high - level GOP operative James Tobin was actually found guilty of jamming Democratic ' Get out the Vote ' phone lines in order to keep voters away from the polls in 2002 by " orchestrating an election day phone - jamming plot against New Hampshire Democrats " --- the ACORN nut had already fallen off the Republican 's " vote fraud " tree .
ACORN had " been vindicated of the various bogus charges , as virtually all of the frivolous lawsuits and investigations the GOP liars made so much noise about had simply collapsed by then , " as we reported at the time in linking to ProjectVote.org 's coverage .
And yet , the scam , built deep in the heart of Texas ( by Rove and his slimy , democracy - hating operative buddies at the phony ACVR ) , just kept rolling ...
New Mexico attorney John Boyd , who was working with state Dems at the time , had a front - row seat to the bogus 2004 " voter fraud " charges in the state , and wrote about it , in some detail , for BRAD BLOG a few weeks ago .
It 's always been about undermining democracy for these jerks .
From 2000 on up to 2008 , the quest for power trumps the people in the minds of the wretched GOP evil doers .
The Panic of 2008 is a crisis of trust .
Investors do n't trust the value of bad debts enough to offer market - clearing prices .
Banks do n't trust one another to stay in business long enough to do business together .
And there 's definitely no trust that Washington can avoid creating costly new moral hazards as it attempts to bail out the system .
But the most paralyzing loss of trust may be in Wall Street 's system itself :
How did the smartest people at the best banks running the most sophisticated financial models fail to forecast ...

The whole story is hysterical , and McCain 's campaign is the hypocrisy that keeps on giving .
WOW I love that last kicker in this entry too - " preconditions " indeed .
KUDOS to ACORN !
They are doing an exemplary job of standing up for themselves in the face of all the disgusting accusations .

So the Cinncinnati Enquirer has a story on voter fraud in the 2002 and 2004 elections .
They asked every Ohio precinct if there was any fraudulent votes .
AND THERE WAS .
How much you ask ?
10 % no
5 % no
1 % no
.05 % no
.005 % no
.0005 % nope
The actual percent ?
0.0000444 %
In all of Ohio , with over 9,000,000 votes they found 4 voters voting that should not have been allowed to vote .
Yep , lots of voter fraud out there .
The story is here http://news.cincinnati.c...81013/NEWS0106/310130049

You know if you go on Youtube and search " ACORN " all you get back are page after page after page of Reich wing lying ass lunatics lying through their teeth .
This is how they are going to steal this election or at least this is their plan .
Sadly they will probably get away with it because the rethuglicans will relentlessly spew this bullshit every where continuously 24/ 7 .
ACORN will " try " to fight this by themselves but the absolutely WORTHLESS democrats will not lift a finger to help them , if anything they may try to distance themselves from them and as usual apologize for doing nothing wrong .
This wont change the REAL election but it will give them the EXCUSE they need to steal it by denying 100s of 1000s to vote in key swing states , just enough to get it close enough to easily steal .
The democrats are determined to snatch defeat from the jaws of overwhelming victory .
So much so that it really does n't pass the smell test .

Do n't know about other fascist media Talking Points campaigns .
But out here in Sacramento , we had at least Tom Sullivan ( 1530 KFBK AM Radio today ) talking crap about Acorn and completely spinning the facts ,
Then over at the Broadcast Television front Sharon Ito on News 10 ( 10.1 DT / 10 Analog ) doing similar propaganda spin .
It would be funny if people did n't believe it .
But people do believe it and that get 's law enforcement to do the wrong thing .
e.g. raiding ACORN , and not the people that turned fake names in .
It gets fascist media to ratchet up the noise , eventually nothing will be left but the propaganda lies .
Now they 're talking about how they have arrested ACORN members .
Yet I have n't heard a specific name quoted of one member .
And finally it get 's people to believe the lies about voter fraud , and focus on that instead of electronics , and election fraud which has destroyed our Constitution , and much more !
Nunyabiz has it right , Worthless Democrats wo n't fix it .
Because of that , it wo n't stop fascist media lies .
It wo n't counter sue the cops .
It wo n't help tell the story correctly .
It 's wo n't overhaul the morass of bullshit that has infected our elections with terminal cancer .
Putting officials in jail will .
Firing the law enforcement responsible for this will .
Putting the canvassers that tried to meet their quota to get paid will ( which is where the real problem started , yet exploited by media . )
Forcing fascist media to make public apologies will .
I am sick of this shit .
Also notice every time some important political thing happens fires break out in California .
Who in the GOP is lighting those ?
Karl Rove perhaps ?
It 's time for these fuckers to spend the rest of their days in our country in prison .
No more snooping on citizens , the citizens need to snoop on the officials .
No more unconstitutional law , rollback all that shit !
No more representatives that break their oath of office -- life in prison for that shit !
Are you stupid people reading this ( not the bradblog folks ) going to wait until you have nothing before you get off your fucking ass ?
Surely some of you assholes in fascist media have got to realize that the shit you spew every day is going to come back and bite your own life 's livelihood in the ass ?
No ?
I have no respect for you then .
Your an idiot , and idiots get people killed .
Your worse than a terrorist in that respect , cause at least that we can fight , meanwhile , an idiot will fuck up every time guaranteed .
Your actions or in -actions are going to ruin my country , my home , my economy .
Your upturned nose insolence will be your own fall .
You need to start caring about this country .
Not like the " lawless nationalists do " but as God Damned fucking Americans that know right from wrong do !
If this country does go into depression , it will be your fault , and the day you ask me for an orange , because your starving to death , I am going to ask you to give me your + $ 100,000 camera .
No camera , no orange .
PEOPLE GET OFF YOUR ASS , GO TO YOUR LOCAL NETWORK STATION AND FILE A FUCKING COMPLAINT IN THEIR PUBLIC FILE !
DO IT NOW !
Then go read / listen what Naomi Wolf said .

The maverick independent hockey pitbull lady seems to be good at one thing and one thing only — completely alienating independent voters from supporting the John McCain campaign :
A majority of likely voters in a new Washington Post - ABC News national poll now have unfavorable views of the Alaska governor , most still doubt her presidential qualifications and there is an even split on whether she “ gets it , ” a perception that had been a key component of her initial appeal .
In polling conducted Wednesday and Thursday evenings , after the disclosure that the Republican National Committee used political funds to help Palin assemble a wardrobe for the campaign , 51 percent said they have a negative impression of her .
Fewer , 46 percent , said they have a favorable view .
That marks a stark turnaround from early September , when 59 percent of likely voters held positive opinions .
The declines in Palin ’s ratings have been even more substantial among the very voters Republicans aimed to woo .
The percentage of white women viewing her favorably dropped 21 points since early September ; among independent women , it fell 24 points .
More broadly , the intensity of negative feelings about Palin is also notable : Forty percent of voters have “ strongly unfavorable ” views , more than double the post - convention number .
Nearly half of independent women now see her in a very negative light , a nearly threefold increase .
By Peter Bauer
Bill Maher 's new rule : Republicans can't spend the next four years making false accusations against Barack Obama like they did against Bill Clinton .
In a fitting irony , the static that once bothered scientists trying to tune in to the universe has turned out to be an incredibly rich source of information about it .
Probing these signals over the past 40 years — known as the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) radiation — scientists have dug out cosmological secrets that have revolutionized the field .
Next , European scientists will spy on the relic photons with instruments of unprecedented detail , when they launch the Planck satellite in early 2009 .
But the Planck mission wo n’t be about putting the proverbial “ one more number after the decimal . ”
For the first time , it will probe the dynamics of the early inflationary universe .
By sifting through the details of how the temperature of the early universe varied slightly in different directions , the many different models of inflation — the furious exponential expansion of space that took place around 10 – 35 second after the big bang — can be put to the test , as each makes its own unique predictions .
The satellite will also look for evidence of primordial gravity waves , providing theorists with more data to apply to their ideas .
And it will more accurately measure the densities of ordinary matter , dark matter and dark energy that occur in puzzling proportions in the universe ( 5 , 23 and 72 percent , respectively ) .
After years of planning , construction and testing , “ smiles are on all faces , ” says Jean - Michel Lamarre of the Paris Observatory , the instrument scientist for one of the satellite ’s two onboard specialized cameras called the High - Frequency Instrument .
( The other is the Low - Frequency Instrument . )
About the size of a family car , the Planck satellite will launch from French Guiana in tandem with the European Space Agency ’s Herschel Space Observatory .
It should begin returning data in the summer and has a mission lifetime of 21 months .
The European Space Agency began plan­ning the Planck mission in 1992 , when NASA ’s Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) satellite began sending back data on anisotropies in the CMB — subtle but definite fluctuations in the remnant background heat of the universe ( –270.42 degrees Celsius , or 2.73 degrees above absolute zero ) .
Evident at only 10 parts per million , these energy density fluctuations ultimately led to the development of structure in the universe — galaxy clusters and large voids between them — and their measurement uncorked a stream of findings about the big bang .
In 2003 the field took another leap forward when the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) satellite looked at the CMB with 45 times more sensitivity .
It gave scientists accurate measurements of the age of the universe ( 13.73 billion years ) , its rate of expansion ( 70.1 kilometers per second per megaparsec , where a megaparsec is 3.26 million light - years ) , and the proportions of the stuff making up the universe .
WMAP confirmed the leading theory in cosmology , so - called lambda - CDM ( cold dark matter ) , which is a universe governed by Einstein ’s theory of general relativity and dominated by gravity - repelling dark energy .
The Planck satellite will measure the fluctuations of the CMB to two parts per million , which is about three times better than WMAP did .
And its two sophisticated cameras will gather light from nine frequency channels ( WMAP had five , in a limited range ) with noise lower by an order of magnitude .
“ Planck will tell us fundamentally new things , complementary to WMAP , ” says Oliver Zahn of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , who has been elbow - deep in the calculations that will turn Planck ’s raw data into cosmological parameters .
“ I ’ll be surprised if Planck is not as surprising as WMAP and the Hubble Space Telescope have been . ”
WMAP can measure less than 10 percent of the information contained in the CMB temperature anisotropies and only a tiny fraction in the directional deviations of the CMB ’s polarization ( the bearing of its electric and magnetic fields as it propagates through space ) .
In contrast , Planck ’s full - sky view will measure essentially all the temperature information and a significant part of the polarization data .
The most exciting results could come from the so - called B modes of the polarization data , which have never been measured .
The strength of the gravity waves predicted to be generated by the universe ’s inflationary phase determines the amplitudes of these B modes , so measuring them can pinpoint the best among competing models of inflation .
Planck could , then , provide proof that the universe went through an inflationary phase and indicate the scale of the energy that drove it .
“ Of all the exciting science that we will do , this is the most exciting possible measurement of all , ” says Jan Tauber , the European Space Agency ’s chair of the Planck science team .
And , as always , the best thing to come from Planck could be completely unexpected .

A visit to Google , Yahoo ! , or AOL ’s home pages today are testaments of that fact .
AOL ’s is even animated .
But more interesting than that logo wearing makeup , or even the 24 - hour news and blogging coverage on media sites , is how social media uses , well , social media , to get out the vote .
For example , expert blogger Allyson Kapin reported on the Twitter Voter Report , enabling voters to share their experiences via text message , Twitter tweet , calling in , or using an application built for use on the iPhone or Android phone .

10 Mind - blowing Internet Facts That You Have to See to Believe
Three people walk into a bar .
One wants to buy a dress , another wants to check in on his cousin and the last person is trying to find a date to meet up with .
What do all three of these people do to achieve their desired goals ?
They go online !
Alright .
We admit that was n’t much of a riddle but it does lay down the groundwork for what we ’re going to be talking about here .
The internet is hugely popular .
It ’s something that more people than the internet ’s architects every thought possible use and if you ’re reading this blog post , you ’re part of the pro-internet camp .
Despite how central the internet is to our lives , most of us know very little about it .
To remedy that issue , our team has compiled 10 interesting internet facts that we think you ’re going to enjoy reading !
1. The Internet ’s Population Is Massive and Growing
Take a guess as to how many people access the internet regularly ?
We ’re willing to bet that whatever you guessed falls well below the actual number of today ’s internet users .
According to Internet World Stats , nearly 4.5 billion people use the internet !
That number is billions more than the number of people that were using it back in 2010 and over half of the world ’s population .
With how fast the world ’s population is growing and people ’s increased reliance on the internet , there is a lot of worry as to whether or not the internet is going to buckle under all of its user ’s weight !
2. The Internet ’s Birthday Might Surprise You
Depending on how old you are , you might not even remember a year where the internet did n’t exist .
If that ’s the case for you , we ’re going to blow you away with this internet facts favorite .
Internet infrastructure was hatched shortly before it launched publicly in 1991 .
That means that the internet is only 28 - years old !
3. Real Estate on the Internet Is Expanding
Given the number of people that are using the internet , it stands to reason that the amount of places that those people can visit online would be growing as well , right ?
Right !
Today , there are 1.7 billion websites online .
Some of those websites are publicly accessible while others are for private use only .
That number of websites goes up every second of every day !
4. Some People Are Addicted to the Internet
Out of all of the internet facts that we ’re going to share with you , this is probably the fact that you knew already .
Some people are addicted to the internet .
Like , literally addicted .
In fact , China has full - blown rehab centers for people whose lives have been dismantled because of their inability to unplug .
5. Hackers Are Flourishing Online
With more websites come more opportunities for hackers .
Per that fact , 300 million hacking attempts take place every single day .
Some of the ones that are successful cost business owners in the vicinity of 3.9 million dollars in damages .
6. People Send Out Way Too Many Emails
Have you ever been at work and thought to yourself , “ Man , people send out way too many emails . ”
You probably do n’t know the half of it !
It is estimated that 250 billion emails go out every day .
Can you imagine the amount of bandwidth those notes eat up ?
That just goes to show you that no matter how many emails you get in a day , there ’s somebody that ’s getting a heck of a lot more .
7. The First Website Ever Is Still Running
No .
Google was not the first website ever .
The first website ever is a site called “ http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html“.
Not exactly catchy …
The website was made by the father of the World Wide Web himself , Tim Berners - Lee .
Check the original website and compare it to your favorite website today .
That stark comparison will give you a sense of how much we ’ve grown technologically over the last 28 years .
8. Asia is Dominating Internet Speed
Do you get upset because your internet provider is so darn unhelpful and their service is beyond slow ?
You might have to pick up and move to Asia to enjoy better service at a better price .
South Korea and Japan hold titles for the fastest average internet speeds across the country so we ’d start our search for better broadband there if we were you .
Not only is the internet itself incredible but the websites that the internet has allowed to catch fire are almost equally as impressive .
Perhaps the most noteworthy website online today is the social network , Facebook .
Facebook , which you may know was started out of a college dorm room , now plays host to a quarter of the world ’s population .
Hundreds of years ago , everybody was separated by thousands of miles of barren landscapes .
Today , 1 out of every 4 people across the globe is connected via a single website .
10 . Yes , Gangnam Style Is Still the Most Watched YouTube Video
PSY fans can take a moment to celebrate after reading the last of our internet facts .
On YouTube right now , his video “ Gangnam Style ” still holds the most - watched video title with over 3.3 billion views .

Here 's some news you can use , assuming you believe the word of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott -- tanning beds do n't prevent cancer .
Abbott filed an injunction Monday against Houston - based Darque Tan ( here 's a copy of it ) accusing it of false advertising .
False advertising ?
For the kind of people who go to tanning beds ?
Surely if there is any group of medically - aware and knowledgeable people out there , it 's tanning - bed users .
You do n't need false claims , you can simply sell them on the health benefits of getting skin cancer .
Abbott 's injunction says Darque Tan went way beyond the pale ( Ha ! A joke ! )
" Defendants make the health or medical claim that indoor tannng increases the user 's intake of Vitamin D and that increased levels of Vitamin D have been shown to reduce the incidence or risk of cancer , " the injunction says .
And then there 's this , which is simply hilarious : Darque Tan agents have " specifically made the following health or medical claims ... 2 ) `so would you be more worried about the skin cancer on your arm and being able to have it laser - cut out ... or would you rather have ovarian cancer that you can't get rid of ... and people die from ? "
Yeah , take that , doubters , and get yourself to a tanning salon stat !!
Darque tan , preferably !!
We 're not sure those other tanning salons cure cancer !!

" The shoe hurled at President George W. Bush has sent sales soaring at the Turkish maker as orders pour in from Iraq , the U.S. and Iran ...
The brown , thick - soled ' Model 271 ' may soon be renamed ' The Bush Shoe ' or ' Bye - Bye Bush , ' Ramazan Baydan , who owns the Istanbul - based producer Baydan Ayakkabicilik San. & Tic. , told Bloomberg News in this story .
" Baydan has received orders for 300,000 pairs of the shoes since the attack , more than four times the number his company sold each year since the model was introduced in 1999 .
The company plans to employ 100 more staff to meet demand , he said ...' We 've been selling these shoes for years but , thanks to Bush , orders are flying in like crazy , ' " Baydan said .
" ' We 've even hired an agency to look at television advertising . ' "
An Iraqi reporter angry at the war in his country threw his shoes at Bush to show disrespect during a Dec. 14 press conference .
Bush ducked , and later joked about the incident .
The reporter was seized by other journalists and security and jailed by the Iraqi government , and has asked for a pardon .
I have come to the conclusion I do n't like the phrase " science communicator " .
You would think that it goes without saying that all scientists must communicate their work , for what is the point of learning new things about how the world works if you do n't tell anyone about them ?
But , alas , the term seems to be reserved only for that small minority of scientists - increasing though its numbers have been in recent years - who recognise the importance of sharing their theories and observations with more than just the dozen researchers around the world who bother to read their highly specialised journal papers .
An even smaller minority , though - and I brazenly include myself - do n't so much stick their heads shyly over the parapets of their ivory towers to peer out at the big wide world as jump out on to the ledge with a loudspeaker .
But a question I wish to address here is one that does not receive a universal answer .
Should these science explainers restrict themselves in their public utterances to their own subject , or are they right to join in with other social commentators in the public arena to opine on wider societal issues such as ethics or faith ?
Which brings me to my reason for writing this piece .
Richard Dawkins , that less than shy champion of militant atheism , stepped down recently from his famous Charles Simonyi chair in science communication at Oxford .
His successor is the youthful professor of mathematics Marcus du Sautoy .
This is a great appointment , as Du Sautoy is already doing the sort of things this chair was created for .
But Dawkins 's stature and reputation have raised the profile of the Simonyi chair , making it a platform for utterances that are hugely magnified in their reach and influence .
In a way it is similar to what Stephen Hawking has brought to the Lucasian chair of mathematics at Cambridge - from which he retires next year - despite previous holders including the likes of Isaac Newton .
Of course , Du Sautoy will not , and probably should not , need to change what he does in his new role .
He is already a successful broadcaster and author as well as a serious academic .
And I certainly do not intend to offer him advice on the path he should take .
But whether or not one agrees with Dawkins 's confrontational , firebrand style , there is no denying that he has made moderate atheism - that which tries hard not to insult those of faith by trivialising what they hold dear - respectable .
By positioning himself on one extreme , Dawkins has allowed this cuddlier atheist to occupy the centre ground .
It is rather like the political spectrum of the latter half of the last century , when communism provided the buffer and excuse for the respectability of socialism .
Today 's world is very different , and with communism discredited , those of us who proudly labelled ourselves socialists in Thatcherite Britain now feel safer being re-branded as liberals with socialism the new extreme of the left .
I do feel strongly however that those scientists who have a voice must be doing more than simply popularising their field to attract the next generation into science .
Yes , this is vital ; but it is also vital that we help defend our rational , secular society against the rising tide of irrationalism and ignorance .
Science communicators , for want of a better term for now , have a role to play in explaining not just the scientific facts but how science itself works : that it is not just " another way of viewing the world " ; and that without it we would still be living in the dark ages .
I do not mean that everyone should become an expert in quantum mechanics ( although would n't that be great ) .
But when there are so many people ( such as the thankfully defeated Republican vice - presidential candidate in the US ) who truly believe that dinosaurs roamed the earth at the same time as humans , or that the universe itself was created six thousand years ago - or who spend millions of pounds on homeopathic remedies or magic crystals instead of real medicine - then we scientists simply cannot hide away in our labs .
I have recently been involved in making a BBC series on medieval science in the early Islamic empire .
While we marvel at the contributions to mathematics , astronomy and medicine that these scholars made a millennium ago , we tend to scoff at the more naive notions they entertained in folklore , astrology or alchemy - until we remember that they would n't look so out of place in 21st - century Europe or America .
Science communicators are therefore more than just cheap popularisers providing soundbites for a public hungry to know what subatomic exotica will be conjured into existence at the Large Hadron Collider .
They have a huge role to play in keeping the light of rationalism shining brightly .
Love him or loathe him , Dawkins has played his part in this .

The US is seeking Eduardo Arellano Felix 's extradition Mexican security forces have arrested a man they say is one of the leaders of the country 's notorious Arellano Felix drug trafficking cartel .
Eduardo Arellano Felix was arrested after a shootout in the city of Tijuana on the US border , officials said .
The family - run cartel is one of Mexico 's four big drug mafias , blamed for trafficking hundreds of tonnes of cocaine and marijuana into the US .
The US state department had offered offering $ 5 m ( £ 3 m ) for his capture .
Mr Arellano Felix , nicknamed The Doctor , was arrested on Saturday night after police chased his car to a wealthy neighbourhood of Tijuana , officials said .
A three - hour gun battle erupted involving more than 100 police and soldiers and the house was riddled with bullets , federal police were quoted by Reuters news agency as saying .
A girl , believed to be his 11 - year - old daughter , was at home at the time but was not harmed , police said .
" The generation of brothers who formed this criminal organisation has been dissolved , " said Mexican Assistant Public Security Secretary Facundo Rosas .
Internal feud The Arellano Felix family dominated drug - smuggling routes from Mexico to the US in the 1990s but the cartel has been weakened in recent years with the deaths or capture of its leaders .
The house where the suspect was seized was riddled with bullets
Two brothers are in jail in the US and Mexico , a third is now free after serving time in an American prison , while another was shot dead by Mexican police in 2002 .
Mexican officials believe the cartel is now run by a sister , Enedina Arellano Felix , and her son , Luis Fernando Sanchez Arellano .
Eduardo Arellano
Felix , suspected of being number two in the gang 's hierarchy , is sought by the US on drug smuggling and money laundering charges .
The blows against the Arellano Felix family have spurred other gangs to move in to their home turf of Tijuana , correspondents say .
The cartel itself is also reported to have been hit by internal feuding .
Tijuana , just across the border from the US city of San Diego , has been one of the focal points of bloody drug violence that has led to some 4,000 deaths in Mexico so far this year .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has deployed some 36,000 soldiers and federal police to battle the drugs gangs .
Last week , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that the US was making progress in releasing funds promised under the Merida Initiative , a $ 400 m package to help Mexico fight the drugs trade .

Google Mobile Uses Private iPhone APIs
Google ’s just - released and much - publicized update to their Google Mobile iPhone app features some very clever interaction design for the voice search feature .
There is an on - screen button you can tap to initiate a voice search manually , but , as illustrated in their example video , you can initiate a voice search just by lifting your iPhone to your ear .
In order to trigger this automatic voice prompt , you must :
Move the iPhone .
Trigger the proximity sensor next to the speaker at the top of the iPhone .
You need to do both , in that order .
1
The voice prompt is never triggered by motion alone , nor by covering the proximity sensor without first having moved the phone .
The only way it is triggered is by moving the phone and then triggering the proximity sensor .
It ’s very clever , and the resulting user experience is very nice .
But here ’s the intrigue :
There is no public API in the iPhone SDK for using the proximity sensor in this way .
As you might imagine considering the number of accelerometer - driven games in the App Store , there are plenty of public API calls to access data from the iPhone ’s accelerometer .
But the only thing apps can do with the proximity sensor is turn it on and off .
When the proximity sensor is on , the screen turns off and stops accepting touch input when you cover the sensor ( typically with your head , when holding the phone to your ear to , say , make a phone call , but you can just as easily trigger it by covering the sensor with your finger ) .
By default , the proximity sensor is turned off , and the overwhelming majority of apps leave it that way .
If you ’re a registered iPhone developer , you can read the relevant documentation for the proximitySensingEnabled property in the UIApplication Class Reference .
An app can check the status of this property ( is it on or off ? ) , and can toggle it , but that ’s it .
After an app has turned the proximity sensor on , the app never finds out when or if it has actually been engaged .
There is no way for an app to be notified when the proximity sensor has been triggered .
No way , that is , via the public APIs .
If you use something like the command - line strings utility to examine the UIKit framework , you can see that there ’s an undocumented ( and therefore private to Apple ) method named proximity StateChanged .
And if one were to strip the FairPlay DRM from the current Google Mobile application binary — which , of course , you would n’t do , because you ’re not supposed to strip FairPlay DRM , but I ’m just saying if one were to do this — a class dump of the application binary would show that Google Mobile does in fact implement proximityStateChanged .
So , ( a ) Google Mobile is using an undocumented API , and ( b ) to my knowledge , there is no way to duplicate the behavior of Google Mobile ’s “ just lift the phone to your ear to trigger the voice prompt ” feature using only the public APIs in the iPhone SDK .
Needless to say , using undocumented APIs violates the iPhone SDK Guidelines .
A developer that plays by the rules cannot do what Google is doing .
I can think of three explanations for how Google got away with this :
Whoever at Apple approved this Google Mobile update did not realize that it was using the private proximityStateChanged method .
Whoever at Apple approved it knew that it used a private API , but approved it anyway .
Google sought and obtained permission from Apple to use this method .
I do not believe # 3 is the case .
I ’m pretty sure that the App Store approval process is as much of a black box for Google as it is for everyone else .
That leaves # 1 and # 2 , either of which suggests that the Google Mobile team followed the adage that it ’s easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission .
If this is the case — if — it might explain why Google started publicizing the voice search feature several days before it actually appeared in the App Store .
The publicity from John Markoff ’s feature in The New York Times put pressure on Apple to accept the app .
If there was any internal debate within Apple about whether to allow this , it might explain why the app took several days longer to appear in the store than Markoff ’s story indicated Google expected .
# 1 is possible .
There is no technical barrier that prevents a third - party iPhone app from making calls to undocumented APIs , and I have heard that several apps that do so have slipped past the App Store approval process .
But I would presume the Apple employees who examine App Store submissions are well - versed regarding which hardware features are exposed through the official public APIs .
If it ’s # 2 , though , this stinks .
Third - party iPhone development is purportedly a level playing field .
If regular developers are forced to play by the rules , but Google is allowed to use private APIs just because they ’re Google , the system is rigged .
So here ’s to hoping that it ’s # 1 .
Even in that case , the situation just highlights the problem that a lot of cool features are behind the iPhone ’s private APIs — private APIs which Apple ’s own apps make full use of .
I understand the reason why the developers of Google Mobile used this method — without it , the feature is n’t possible ( and , frankly , the proximity sensor is n’t of much use ) .
The downside to third - party use of any undocumented APIs , however , is that undocumented APIs can change or vanish in future iPhone OS updates , which situations inevitably lead some users to be outraged that Apple does n’t support the unsupported .
My thanks to Robert Marini for assistance researching certain of the technical aspects of this article , including going so far as to build an iPhone app to test whether any documented application delegates are triggered when the proximity sensor is engaged .
( The answer is no . )
There is growing alarm and anger among Democrats over the economy Barack Obama will inherit .
Obey : U.S. falling into ' massive hole '
As Democrats move closer to taking command in Washington , there is growing alarm and anger in the party over the economy Barack Obama will inherit and the huge cost incurred after months of stalemate between Congress and President Bush over how to respond .
Thursday night , the White House was hoping to announce — possibly as early as Friday — plans to stave off bankruptcies in the auto industry by using available Treasury funds , a decision favored by Democrats .
But Congress and President Bush remain at loggerheads over any larger fiscal stimulus package — even after leading economists in both parties have urged action .

Democrats are reduced to speaking of a “ jobs salvaging ” bill that can only hope to slow the rise in unemployment next year .
Discussions have moved past just increasing food stamp and unemployment benefits and also include the possibility of Washington helping workers who lose their jobs to finance COBRA payments needed to keep their family healthcare coverage .
Given the long impasse , speed is a huge priority .
The first choice seems to be a single large fiscal - stimulus bill , but it ca n’t be ruled out that the money could move in tranches if other legislative vehicles become available .
Caught in the middle is House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey , who must spearhead the recovery package for Obama next month .
He told Politico that the transition has proven to be “ a disaster for the country because Bush is sitting around like Hoover did . ”
“ The target keeps changing , it keeps getting worse , ” the Wisconsin Democrat said of new estimates for what will be needed to jolt the economy .
“ These are calamitous events .
While I think people know the economy is in trouble , I still do n’t think they have a full appreciation of just how close we are to falling in the pit .
“ The tragedy is [ that ] immense damage is going to be done to the country over the next 30 to 40 days before Obama takes office , and government is sitting here in neutral trying to decide if it is going to go forward or backward .
“ We should have been able to get together with Bush and pass a major package right now .
Every day we do n’t makes this problem deeper and deeper , ” Obey said .
“ And the deeper it goes , the longer it is likely to last . ”
“ It is a massive , massive hole that we are about to fall into unless we do something dramatic .
And the question is whether it will be met by a massive and effective package . ”
The White House would argue that Democrats share the blame for failing to grasp a chance to strike a deal on the Colombia trade bill — a Bush priority — in return for stimulus spending .
But since the passage of the massive $ 700 billion financial markets rescue bill this fall , neither Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson nor the president has had the ability to guarantee Republican votes for any compromise .
This was seen most recently when Senate Republicans last week killed a White House - backed $ 14 billion loan package to keep General Motors Corp. and Chrysler afloat this winter .
Treasury was still reviewing details Thursday night , but the administration is expected to provide the money now by tapping unspent monies in the financial rescue fund after attaching conditions similar to those in the failed bill .
The auto industry crisis is all part of Obama ’s inheritance .
But the bigger focus is on the stimulus or economic recovery bill .
Only Monday , Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) was still predicting a $ 600 billion package of new spending and tax cuts , but that number seems almost certain to grow after a meeting of Obama ’s economic advisers Wednesday in Chicago .
The drop in consumer spending and business investment suggests a much larger gap needs to be filled :
Some say as much as $ 700 billion in calendar year 2009 alone .
Wednesday ’s meeting gave rise to press reports suggesting a new $ 850 billion , two - year estimate for the Obama bill .
That ’s too high for Congress , especially the Senate , say Democrats .
Much as the top line number makes for headlines , the real challenge is to find the right mix that will be credible -- both to investors and to the bipartisan support needed in Congress .
“ It ’s a God - damn complicated problem , ” said Obey .
“ You ca n’t just deal with the injection of money into the system .
It ’s got to be one - part cash and one - part confidence .
And if you do n’t take care of the confidence , the dollar can go to hell , and then we ca n’t even inject the cash . ”
Tax cuts will be part of the mix but are often less efficient in stimulating demand .
At the same time , there is only so much even Washington can spend in a year , and fiscal 2009 could be almost half over even if the bill were enacted by mid-February .
Two - year estimates are routine now ; as the time frame lengthens , there is a greater willingness to devote more money to longer - term investments in technology and infrastructure .
“ People say on an infrastructure package , it has to be stuff on which you can turn a shovel in 30 days , ” Obey explains .
“ Then it was 90 days .
Well , hell . . . .
This problem is going to be with us for well past two years , and to me that means a helluva lot more construction projects are eligible even if they do n’t have the desirable effect of getting a lot of money into the economy in the first six months … .
I sure as hell want us to look at options that have impact in the second year .
“ I do n’t think any of us have any real arguments over what ought to be in the package , ” Obey said .
“ The question is how tightly you can target it so that it does maximum good . ”
But he refuses to be drawn into any public discussion of the cost of the bill or its specific components
“ I do n’t think it will be nearly as big as it needs to be , ” he said .
“ If I had my druthers and we could find ways to make sure the money gets out the door fast enough to do some good , I think you are dealing with a problem that is well above $ 1 trillion .
I do n’t think the package will be anywhere in that neighborhood .
“ We are n’t anywhere near having specific numbers tagged down yet .
What we ’re trying to do is define the problem .
. . .
Obama is trying to do two things : define the problem and then come up with solutions that can meet the emergency and hopefully , at the same time , build the future .
“ The first job is to make sure the public understands the nature of the problem we are facing , ” Obey said .
And Pelosi is expected to use the opening weeks of the new Congress to try to pound this message home in House hearings .
“ You ever see red clay sheer off and fall into a lake ? ”
Obey asked rhetorically .
“ With this economy , you do n’t have a few grains of sand each day .
You have huge chunks of the landscape falling into the drink . ”
E -Harmony has not been providing matchmaking services to gays and lesbians on account of its " christian values " and claim that their love research was only done on heterosexual relationships giving them no basis for how to match queers .
Now , thanks to a lawsuit E - Harmony will open its service to gays and lesbians .
" Internet matchmaker eHarmony.com will provide same - sex matching services in 2009 under the terms of a settlement reached today in New Jersey .
The online dating service , founded in 2000 in California , has 20 million clients , according to its website .
Eric McKinley , a gay man from New Jersey , filed a discrimination suit against eHarmony Inc. in 2005 after the service refused to take his personal advertisement .
McKinley 's suit triggered a N.J. state investigation of the service .
Under the terms of the settlement , eHarmony agreed to provide a new service for gay men and lesbians by March 31 under the headings " male seeking male " and " female seeking female . "
In return , the complaint against eHarmony was dismissed by the N.J. Division on Civil Rights .
The company and its founder , Neil Clark Warren , were absolved of any liability . "
( JMG )
Too bad it took a court order to force them to expand their dating service to include gays and lesbians .
I know I for one will sign up for a " free " account , to demonstrate that there are gays and lesbians out there , but no way in hell will they get a dime from me for the regular basic membership .

High - tech thought leader shares advice to entrepreneurs and lessons as an investor
Esther Dyson , who came in recently to share her story to me about possibly rocketing to space , is widely regarded as an Internet / high - tech luminary , thought leader , and respectable investor , having put money in some of the hottest startups , such as Flickr and del.icio.us ( both part of Yahoo ) , and more recently 23andMe , which is backed by Google .
In this " Lessons learned " segment , Esther offers her advice to entrepreneurs and lessons learned to investors .
Her first is to listen .
" Whatever the context , people will think you 're smarter , " she said .
The second is to be focused and not be distracted .
" More companies die of indigestion , " she said .
" Pick one opportunity and do it well , rather than do five or six things badly ... opportunities will always be there . "
The third one is " always make new mistakes . "
The lessons she 's learned as an investor are trickier and not so straightforward .
The challenge for her has always been identifying the mistake in a failed investment and knowing how to apply that lesson to the next investment she 's made .
By and large , however , she realized that one way to get around this problem is to identify an entrepreneur she feels confident can be flexible and adaptable to bring in the right team when things change .
" No matter what you invest in , it wo n’t be the same , " she said .
" You need a person who can change when the companies change and bring in the right people to lead that change . "
Apostrophe catastrophe !
The rogue apostrophe is spreading like measles .
It 's time to fight back ...
This all started with a drink .
But it very nearly did n't because when I looked at the cocktail list in the otherwise swanky Charlotte Street Hotel in London and discovered that martini's ( sic ) were £ 10.50 and classic 's ( sic ) £ 10.50 I momentarily lost my thirst .
The price was bad enough .
But did you have to pay extra if you wanted to have your drink correctly punctuated ?
And would a martini - mine 's made with Plymouth gin , please , very dry , shaken with a twist - taste as good if it also contained a stray apostrophe ?
Caught up in a spasm of punctuation - rage I , perhaps slightly aggressively , asked the poor waitress what those two utterly extraneous apostrophes were doing there .
She backed away hurriedly and sent over the assistant bar manager .
Mariusz Szymecki may have been Polish but his English was fluent .
Or almost fluent .
' Both spellings - martini's and martinis - are correct , ' he said firmly .
' I know this is right because , when I heard what you wanted to know , I checked it on Google . '
On Google ?
Who in the name of a thousand question marks would rely on Google to be an authority on anything , least of all a grammatical matter ?
The internet is awash with misspellings and punctuation solecisms .
Nor is it much better out there in the real world .
And the poor apostrophe is the subject of more abuse than any other dot , dash or squiggle .
For decades the nation 's pedants have sighed and tutted over the so - called greengrocer 's apostrophe - the one you find on piles of fruit and vegetables advertising the fact that apple 's and banana 's are for sale by the pound or kilo when no apostrophe is required to complete the plural .
If only apostrophe errors were confined to market stalls !
Instead they have spread like a contagion , infecting public signs and notices , literature from reputable institutions , menus and shop signs - not to mention press releases , letters and emails .
According to a new study , the apostrophe causes more problems than any other punctuation mark .
Almost half of 2,000 adults who sat a simple test were unable to use it properly .
But is anyone really bothered ?
On Newsnight last week even the great interrogator Jeremy Paxman seemed prepared to shrug off the apostrophe problem , saying : ' Maybe it 's redundant now . '
Or if Paxo had his way , ' maybe its redundant now ' .
Nonsense !
It may be under threat , but we should stand up for the simple apostrophe .
We should defend its honour - as the Daily Mail 's own Keith Waterhouse has done for some time , with his organisation the AAAA ( Association for the Annihilation of the Aberrant Apostrophe ) .
I decided to spend a day policing apostrophes .
Surely if people realised the error of their ways they would be moved to do something about it , would n't they ?
I am barely awake when I stumble on my first howler , on the sandwich board outside the Shiraz Cafe , a greasy spoon on Hammersmith Road , West London , between my flat and the office , advertising ' pasta's , jacket potato's and panini's ' .
Inside , Roshi , the Iranian proprietor , smiles beatifically when I inform her of the problem .
' I do n't care , ' she says mildly .
But I do , I say .
I do n't add that the sight of an airborne curl of black where there should only be the white of the page stirs in me feelings of biliousness .
I had worried that this might be a bit of an overreaction , until I read popular grammarian Lynne Truss on the subject .
Strict :
If you still persist in writing : ' Good food at it 's best ' , you deserve to be struck by lightning according to author Lynne Truss
' No matter that you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice , ' writes Truss in her bestselling Eats , Shoots And Leaves .
' If you still persist in writing : ' Good food at it 's best ' , you deserve to be struck by lightning , hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave . '
Goodness .
Fortunately , wandering around Hammersmith , Kensington and Notting Hill I do n't find a single aberrant it's .
I do , however , find wheelbarrows full of greengrocer 's apostrophes .
There is one at an odds - and - ends shop advertising ' Pashmina scarf 's ' for £ 3 each .
' Yeah , ' says a shop assistant when I take him to task on it .
' I know it 's wrong .
But someone else did that sign .
He left about a month ago .
We might get round to changing it . '
There are several more offenders on the menus of nearby cafes and bars .
There is even one , threatening to ' copy plan's ' , plastered on the window of Copywell , a printing and copying centre .
Surely it should be incumbent on a printer to put his apostrophes in the right place .
I drag a charming young graphic designer called Anam Islam out on to the pavement to show him the problem .
' Yeah , that is wrong , ' he admits .
' And I did that one .
It 's funny because I was watching a documentary on apostrophes the other week and thought that I always got them right . '
Perhaps one of the reasons we remain so confused about the apostrophe is that it is relatively new to our language .
The last punctuation mark to be standardised , it has been around in its present form for about 150 years .
The Oxford English Dictionary says the first record of the actual word ' apostrophe ' in English is in Shakespeare 's late 16th century play Love 's Labour 's Lost and that it is rooted in the Greek for ' turning away , or elision ' .
This makes perfect sense : originally an apostrophe 's job was merely to indicate the omission of letters , and this remains one of its most basic - and easily understood - tasks .
You need only think of contractions such as can't and dare n't , dates such as the ' 80s or poems such as A Red , Red Rose by Robert Burns - ' Till a ' the seas gang dry my dear /
And the rocks melt wi ' the sun ' - to see how it works .
And yet for some reason many people seem to find it tempting beyond belief to apply apostrophes to a word as if they were visual garnish .
It 's not just fruitsellers who do this : a barrister friend shows me a letter to a judge positively strewn with extra apostrophes .
Plurals of abbreviations or acronyms are particularly prone to this treatment .
How many times have you seen a sign offering CD's ?
And another friend , a policeman , tells me he often comes across ASBO's .
Serial offender : Greengrocers are regular offenders when it comes to putting apostrophes in the wrong place ( file picture )
But worse than that , after popping into Nationwide Building Society to pick up a leaflet on savings , I find it blithely expounding on the subject of ISAs ( fine ) but also ISA 's ( not fine ) .
I phone the press office to remonstrate .
' The apostrophe should n't be there , no , ' admits a jolly man on the end of the line .
' It would appear to be human error , though rogue apostrophes do seem to be increasingly prevalent .
We 'll try to remember to take it out on the next print run . '
By now I have been staring so hard all day at apostrophes that I am beginning to lose it .
I can see them when I close my eyes , crawling like dark , specky insects across my retina .
And I have n't even tackled their possessive use yet .
According to the latest study , this is where people really struggle .
Most of us are fine with the fact that , as well as missing letters , apostrophes are used to indicate possession .
So , the bike belonging to the boy could be written as ' the boy 's bike ' .
But what if the boy 's name is James ?
Do we refer to James ' bike ?
Or to James 's bike ?
It started with a drink : Victoria Moore 's rage about misplaced apostrophes began when she saw martini's ( sic ) were £ 10.50 on a hotel menu
And what if there are several boys , all with bikes ?
When brain is engaged , most people are happy that the correct answer is ' the boys ' bikes ' .
But for some reason we are not entirely comfortable with this end - of - word apostrophe , particularly when it falls at the end of a sentence .
It 's an aesthetic objection and we deal with it by .
. . just missing off the apostrophe .
Because we feel like it .
Here are two examples : Visitors Toilet ( seen in a hospital ) ; Parents Association ( countless schools ) .
As I am musing on this , an email arrives from a PR contact inviting me to a Ladies Social Evening .
Just as I finish emailing prissily back , ' Dear Ellie , Should n't it be Ladies ' Social Evening ? ' my friend Tanya phones .
' Oh God , who cares about apostrophes ? ' she says , ' I think people who are uptight about them probably make terrible lovers . '
Is there a chance I am taking this too far ?
John Richards does not think so .
Based near Boston in Lincolnshire , he is a retired journalist with bushy eyebrows and an absolute intolerance of misplaced apostrophes .
' It makes me feel despair more than rage , ' he confides .
' I set up the Apostrophe Protection Society four years ago .
I have tackled people in person .
Usually offenders just get letters .
I 've sent out thousands .
You can only plug away . '
Mr Richards blames ignorance and laziness for our troubles .
He is engaged in a minor squabble with the proprietor of a local teashop who insists on offering customers tea's .
' When I asked him about it he said he would n't change it because he thought it looked better with one in .
What can you do ?
Needless to say , I have n't been in there for a tea or coffee . '
But what 's this ?
Mr Richards has also written a letter of complaint to the sainted Lynne Truss .
He claims she has got something wrong .
Before I tell you what it is , perhaps you could try to answer the following question .
Which is correct ?
( a) Dos and don'ts ( b ) Do 's and don'ts ( c ) Do's and do n't 's
The answer , according to Ms Truss , is ( c ) .
She says that for plurals of letters and certain words then an apostrophe is required .
For example , if you were asking how many s's there are in Mississippi or talking about the noise a crowd made on bonfire night - ' There were lots of oooh 's and ahhh's . '
The answer according to Mr Richards is ( a ) .
He says : ' Lynne Truss can write what she likes but she 's got to justify why you might use one when there are no missing letters and no possessive sense .
' There is no role for the apostrophe in plurals at all . '
Who will arbitrate ?
Well , David Crystal , professor of linguistics at Bangor University , is n't one for taking sides but he does believe that apostrophes in plurals are sometimes necessary .
' What if I ask you to dot your i's and cross your t's ?
How will you spell that ?
If you did n't use an apostrophe you 'd have the word ' is ' instead of i's . '
As he puts it in his book The Fight For English : ' Inserting an apostrophe is as good a way as any of showing there is an unusual plural . '
But Crystal goes further , and makes a good case for there to be a little more leniency in tricky circumstances .
' Punctuation has always been a matter of trends , ' he says .
' Commas , hyphens , semicolons , apostrophes - all have been subject to changes in fashion .
Thinking about these issues as a two - part solution ( correct vs incorrect ) does n't help .
' As with many linguistic issues , there are three solutions - correct , incorrect and optional ( i.e. ca n't decide ! ) .
Pedants forget about context , which is what removes ambiguity in most cases .
For example , in the case of the Parents '
Association , there could be no such thing as an association for one parent , so the apostrophe is simply unnecessary , which is why most people leave it out .
' The other thing people forget is that when the rules were drawn up 150 years ago , it was by printers who forgot about exceptions - such as some plurals - that had been in the language a long time . '
This is the point at which I decide I have had enough of apostrophes .
Yes , it will still distress me to be offered a list of martini's or cocktail's .
But I think in future I may require a more niche challenge .
It 's time to protest against the split infinitive .
Explosions can still be heard at the Taj Mahal hotel A team of South African bodyguards have been explaining how they led 120 hostages to safety from a hotel seized by gunmen in the Indian city , Mumbai .
The guards , armed only with knives and meat cleavers , helped other hotel guests to safety down a fire escape .
They carried a traumatised old woman in a chair down 25 flights of stairs .
" Everybody was calm and no - one became hysterical , " said Bob Nicholls , director of the security company in Mumbai for a cricket tournament .
Mr Nicholls said he and his employees were eating in the restaurant and were planning to get an early night when they heard shooting in another part of the five - star Taj Mahal hotel .
See map of Mumbai
They barricaded the doors to the conference centre shut with tables and refrigerators and kept guests calm while they worked out what to do .
" Shortly afterwards , we felt explosions rock the building and I became worried about how safe the people were behind those glass doors , " Mr Nicholls told South Africa 's Beeld newspaper .
' Surprise '
" We put the lights off in the restaurant to give us an element of surprise , " bodyguard Faisul Nagel told the AFP news agency .
They watched the lifts to see if the gunmen were coming their way .
When they realised the building was on fire they began to move the other hotel guests out .
" We told the security manager of the hotel to tell the police not to shoot , and then walked everyone down the fire exit at the back of the hotel very quickly , " Mr Nagel said .
Mr Nicholls said they had all been trained how to deal with threatening situations .
Bodies Meanwhile , all the South African nationals who were trapped in the other hotel attacked on Wednesday have now been freed .
South African officials said the Indian security forces had evacuated the remaining seven nationals from the Oberoi hotel , and they were safe .
Another five had been evacuated earlier .
All worked for the national airline , SAA .
Indian commandos who managed to enter other parts of the Taj Mahal say they found at least 30 bodies in one hall .
It is not clear if that number is included in the reported overall death toll of 130 .
Gunmen armed with automatic weapons and grenades targeted at least seven sites in Mumbai late on Wednesday , opening fire indiscriminately on crowds at a major railway station , the two hotels , the Jewish centre , a hospital and a cafe frequented by foreigners .
The attacks are the worst in India 's commercial capital since nearly 200 people were killed in a series of bombings in 2006 .
A claim of responsibility has been made by a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen .
However , most intelligence officials are keeping an open mind as the attacks have thrown up conflicting clues , BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says .

Miami attorney ... sorry , former Miami attorney John B. " Jack " Thompson , was officially disbarred over the weekend .
Florida judge Dava Tunis recommended permanent disbarment for the attention seeking lawyer on September 25th , a change reflected on the Florida Bar 's official web site , which notes that he is " not eligible to practice in Florida . "
The decision ends Thompson 's illustrious 31 - year career as a Florida attorney .
We have n't checked the trash folder in our Kotaku e-mail account to see what the future holds for Jack , but we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors .
Thanks to Dylan and GamePolitics for the reminder .

" Socialism " on Wall Street
There is a huge " moral hazard " problem here , says Nouriel Roubini , co-founder & chairman of RGE Monitor , where Wall Street firms have privatized their profits and socialized their losses .

“ You know what I like here ?
There ’s a bunch of black guys waiting in cars to shoot it up with a bunch of white guys , and it ’s not about race . ”
Leave it to Spenser , the irrepressibly sarcastic Private Eye from Robert Parker ’s durable series of detective novels , to find the ironic humor in a potentially lethal situation .
“ Be about power and money , mostly , ” agreed Spenser ’s fearsome ally , Hawk , employing the economical street patois he employed while on the job ( and abandoned , when it suited him , when he found himself in refined company ) .
In this instance , as described near the climax of the 2005 novel Cold Service , the duo was quietly preparing for the first volley in a multi-ethnic gang war in a Massachusetts village called Marshport , the government of which was run by a Ukrainian crime ring controlled by the Mayor - cum - mob capo Boots Podolak .
Hawk ’s motive was revenge :
He had nearly been killed in the ambush arranged by Podolak ’s men , an attack that claimed the life of a man Hawk was supposed to protect .
Spenser ’s motive was primarily loyalty to his friend and comrade from many previous campaigns .
Some of those who assembled for battle did it for purely mercenary reasons , working as subcontractors for Spenser .
Others were simply in pursuit of what most people in such conflicts seek : Control over turf , and the apparatus necessary to exploit it through the creative use of duress .
To obtain it , Podolak and his clique had to be removed .
In all of this , as Hawk pointed out , power and money played a much greater role than any atavistic attachment to ethnic or tribal loyalties .
As the USA careens toward bankruptcy and , perhaps — hopefully — some variety of schism , I find myself taking ironic consolation in the fact that the conflict wo n’t be defined by racial or ethnic divisions , despite the best efforts of our rulers to cattle - pen us into such categories .
Granted , this could change very easily .
Madame Obama could change her name to Winnie and start hanging around with a murderous “ football club . ”
The Holy One Himself ( peace be upon him ) comes under armed attack by some disposable dimwit with a conveniently conspicuous paper trail through Klan and neo -Nazi groups and a jones for The Catcher in the Rye .
But there ’s ample reason to believe that the Obamas — despite their successful shared career in racial shakedown politics and their cynical use of race to make themselves a marketable brand — are n’t interested in pursuing identity politics .
To judge from the composition of the Obama transition team , the Exalted Apostle of Change ( we pause to tug on our forelock ) is interested in little more than the standard politics of corporatist plunder .
Obama ’s signature touch is to transpose that agenda into the key of cultural Marxism , as opposed to the pious militarism that remains in favor with what remains of the Republican Party .
For Obama , the collapse of our financial system was a politically fortuitous event .
For reasons that defy rational understanding , the public perceives Obama as a transcendent figure who can cast his gaze upon the turbid markets and command them , “ Peace — be still . ”
The fact that the markets have reacted to Obama ’s election with something less than confident relief has yet to register with the True Believers , who likewise remain untroubled by the fact that those whom The One has gathered as his inner circle of disciples include many of the architects of our ever - deepening financial catastrophe .
Rahm Emmanuel , the issue of terrorist loins and one - time servant of an obnoxious foreign power chosen to be Obama ’s Chief of Staff , made a cool $ 200 K in 2001 through a sinecure at Freddie Mac ; this happened at a time when that government - sponsored entity ( GSE ) was one of the chief engines inflating the Housing Bubble .
Three of Obama ’s key economic advisers —
Anne Mulcahy , Richard Parsons , and William Daley — enjoyed similar posts at Fannie Mae .
Clinton - era Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , another prominent figure in the Obama transition team , was a master chef at cooking the books on behalf of Citigroup and a consulting gourmet for Enron when that company ’s degenerate corporate elite was looking for just the right recipe to use in swindling its shareholders .
And more than a third of the spots on Obama ’s transition team — which is a farm club for both ambassadorships and more consequential executive branch posts — are the most successful “ bundlers ” of corporate donations to His Holiness ’s campaign .
Already assuming the mien of a dictator before formally inheriting the mantle of dictatorship , Obama , asserting the suppositious authority of the non-existent “ office ” of president - elect ( a status he wo n’t actually enjoy until after the Electoral College meets next month ) , Obama “ is pushing Congress this year to approve as much as $ 50 billion to save cash starved U.S. automakers and appoint a czar or board to oversee the companies , ” according to a Bloomberg report .
This proposed nationalization of the auto industry , which has the support of the Wee Emperor , has been urged upon Obama by two of his key advisers , former Federal Reserve commissar Paul Volcker and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers — two veterans of the entrenched Establishment Obama supposedly seeks to de-throne .
In defining how Obama will rule , his practical connections to the entrenched corporate socialist oligarchy are much more important than his cultural Marxist background .
There is little danger of Obama instigating a proletarian revolution ; as John Derbyshire wryly pointed out , Obama ca n’t incite a worker revolt to seize control over the means of production , since all of our factories have already moved to China .
Besides , what ’s the point of staging a revolution from below to consolidate power in the state , when the Bush administration has already done all of the heavy lifting ?
The most tangible accomplishment of a generation of Republican rule is the creation of an apparatus of regimentation and wealth redistribution that Lenin would have coveted .
There is not a particle of hyperbole in that statement .
Witness the observation offered by Jeb Mason , the Treasury Department ’s liaison to corporate lobbyists seeking a portion of the $ 700 billion in “ bailout ” boodle .
Under siege by supplicants , Mason , a 32 - year - old GOP apparatchik who served under the feculent Karl Rove , commented to a friend : “ This must have been how the Politburo felt . ”
As I ’ve noted before , the mechanism of wealth redistribution from the middle and working classes into the hands of corporate parasites is now fully autonomous :
With the Treasury Secretary and the Fed Chairman able to create “ money ” in any volume they please , and disburse it as they see fit , with no oversight or accountability , Congress really does n’t have a role — other than that of misdirecting the public .
Those actually in charge of looting the country before its collapse — whether in the commanding heights , like Comrade Bernanke and Herr Paulson , or in the trenches , like K - Street Pimp Jeb Mason or the Wall Street bagman bearing the deliciously Dickensian name Neel Kashkari — are entirely unaccountable .
From their perspective , the uninitiated have no right so much as to know how much is being spent , let alone for what , and for whose benefit , the sums are being spent .
The $ 700 billion that raised the public ’s ire and attracted the attention of corporate lobbyists is merely a small bucket drawn from the immense pool of “ liquidity ” flowing from the Fed .
The ruling economic Triumvirate has actually taken on $ 5 trillion in liabilities since the financial collapse began last March , and I would be surprised if that figure did n’t at least double before Obama , sitting astride his magic unicorn , stages his triumphal entry into the Imperial Capital next January .
Once again , as Hawk might put it , all of this “ be about power and money , mostly , ” even though the racial aspect of Obama ’s impending advent is quite useful to the Power Elite that created his campaign , and are eager to exploit him as a human shield .
When The One acts as a conduit for policies created by the same gang of parasites that have ruled our nation for decades , every criticism will be cynically supplied with a spurious racial subtext .
This tactic will inspire critics on the left to stifle themselves .
It could eventually be used to imprison critics on the right .

YahooFinance is reporting Chesapeake Energy may sell $ 1.8B stock to get cash .
Chesapeake Energy Corp. , the nation 's largest producer of natural gas , seeks to raise up to $ 1.8 billion through common stock sales in an effort to fund its drilling and exploration activities and mitigate the impact of lower natural gas prices on cash flow .
In two filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Wednesday , the company said it will issue shares worth as much as $ 1 billion before fees and also registered 50 million shares worth at most $ 791 million for potential sale .
Oklahoma City , Okla . - based Chesapeake said it will use proceeds from the $ 1 billion offering for general corporate purposes , including fund exploration , development and other capital expenditures .
The move would dilute holdings of shareholders , who already suffered through a substantial decline in Chesapeake 's stock price this year .
Shares closed at $ 20.24 on Wednesday , off 73 percent from the stock 's $ 74 52 - week high set this summer .
But the company said cash flow , borrowings and cash on hand have not been enough to pay for capital expenditures .
Chesapeake has used up the remaining financing available under its $ 3.5 billion bank credit facility and only $ 251 million is left of another $ 460 million credit line .
Credit markets remain tight with financial institutions under duress .

Petrobras Cash Shortage
Petroleo Brasileiro SA was forced to borrow 2 billion reais ( $ 881 million ) from Brazilian state - owned discount bank Caixa Economica Federal as it faced “ momentary difficulty ” paying taxes , Energy Minister Edison Lobao said .
Petrobras , as the state - controlled oil company is known , said record profit in the third quarter resulted in a 11.4 billion - real tax bill in October , about 5 percent more than the 10.8 billion reais of cash it had on hand at the end of September , the Rio de Janeiro - based company said in a note on the Brazilian security regulator ’s Web site .
“ There were taxes that Petrobras had to pay that they really should n’t have had to pay because they were n’t generated by operating profit but by the strengthening of the dollar , ” Lobao told reporters in Brasilia .
“ The company had to take money out of its cash holding to pay the taxes . ”
Petrobras , which has spent more than 20 billion reais on investment so far this year and paid $ 6.2 billion in dividends , may also have had to borrow money from state - controlled Banco do Brasil SA to meet its obligations , Senator Tasso Jereissati said in a telephone interview .
The cash - flow problems may also have forced Petrobras to delay payments to suppliers over the last 30 days , Jereissati said .
Petrobras officials were n’t immediately available to respond to Jereissati ’s comments .
Petrobras said about a third , or 3.5 billion reais , of its record 10.9 billion - real third - quarter profit was the result of a 19 percent increase in the value of the dollar against the real in the quarter .
Petrobras ’s ability to generate cash and borrow may be further hurt by a 60 percent decline in the price of oil since reaching a high in July and the world credit crunch sparked by recent U.S. bank failures , Lucas Brendler , an energy analyst at Banco Geracao Futuro in Porto Alegre , Brazil , said yesterday .
OPEC Has All Options Open
OPEC has all options open , including a cut in production , when it meets this weekend in Cairo , said Shokri Ghanem , chairman of Libya ’s National Oil Corp .
“ We have to look for the possibility of stabilizing the market , ” Ghanem told reporters when he arrived at his hotel .
“ The whole financial market is in a shambles so prices may still go down more , but we are sure it ’s going to rebound . ”
The 13 members of OPEC , which supply more than 40 percent of the world ’s oil , are meeting for the third time in as many months to discuss a further cut in production after crude prices plunged more than 60 percent from July ’s all - time high of $ 147.27 a barrel .
The crude oil market is over - supplied , OPEC Secretary - General Abdalla el - Badri said today in an interview in Cairo .
He declined to recommend a course of action , saying any decision concerning production quotas was up to ministers to take .
Oil demand is falling faster than expected , Hasan Qabazard , head of research at the group ’s secrectariat , said in an interview in Cairo today .
Peak Oil vs. Falling Demand
Democrats on the U.S. Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees sent a letter to the White House last week asking for an accounting of steps the administration plans to take to preserve documents and submit them to the National Archives and Records Administration once President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney leave office .
According to the Associated Press , the letter was sent from Senators Sheldon Whitehouse ( D – RI ) , Patrick Leahy ( D – VT ) , John D. Rockefeller ( D – WV ) and Dianne Feinstein ( D – CA ) to White House attorney Fred Fielding .
" We believe it is vital the presidential and vice presidential documents belonging to the American people be preserved , including those related to key national security decisions in which the ( office of the vice president ) played an important role , " the letter said .
" We have particular concerns ... regarding documents in the possession of the Office of the Vice President , " the senators added .
Referring to ongoing litigation over the preservation of Vice President Cheney 's records , they wrote : " the declarations filed in that case by the Office of the Vice President raise serious concerns about its interpretations of the ( Presidential Records Act ) . "
The 1978 Presidential Records
Act requires presidential and vice presidential records to be transferred to the National Archives immediately upon the end of the president 's term in office .
But in the past , Cheney has maintained that his office is n't part of the executive branch and therefore is not subject to all of the same open records requirements that govern the presidential office .
Therefore the senators expressed concern that such an interpretation might be used to destroy records before anyone can even catalogue their existence .
The Washington Post had previously reported that Cheney keeps presidential orders related to the domestic surveillance program locked in a safe in the office of his lawyer , David Addington .
The command center of " the president 's program , " as Addington usually called it , was not in the White House .
Its controlling documents , which gave strategic direction to the nation 's largest spy agency , lived in a vault across an alley from the West Wing – in the Eisenhower Executive
Office Building , on the east side of the second floor , where the vice president headquartered his staff .
The vault was in EEOB 268 , Addington 's office .
Cheney 's lawyer held the documents , physical and electronic , because he was the one who wrote them .
New forms of domestic espionage were created and developed over time in presidential authorizations that Addington typed on a
Tempest - shielded computer across from his desk .
It is unlikely that the history of U.S. intelligence includes another operation conceived and supervised by the office of the vice president .
White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. had " no idea , " he said , that the presidential orders were held in a vice presidential safe .
An authoritative source said the staff secretariat , which kept a comprehensive inventory of presidential papers , classified and unclassified , possessed no record of these .
In an interview , Card said the Executive Office of the President , a formal term that encompassed Bush 's staff but not Cheney 's , followed strict procedures for handling and securing presidential papers .
" If there were exceptions to that , I 'm not aware of them , " he said .
" If these documents were n't stored the right way or put in the right places or maintained by the right people , I 'm not aware of it . "
In an e-mail sent to the Associated Press , White House spokesman Tony
Fratto took umbrage at the suggestion that anyone in the White House might destroy documents illegally .
" We do not need to be reminded about the Presidential Records Act by Chairman Leahy , " he wrote .

First lady defends Bush 's record WASHINGTON  President Bush may have joked about the shoe - throwing incident in Iraq , but first lady Laura Bush was not amused .
" As a wife , I saw this as an assault , and that 's what it was , " she told USA TODAY during an interview Thursday at the White House .
" And so I did n't laugh it off like he did . "
SHOE - THROWER : Journalist asks for pardon A month before returning to private life , Bush talked about her plans .
She said she will continue her public advocacy of women 's rights in Afghanistan and democracy for Burma .
A self - described " ambassador " for her husband 's policies over the past eight years , Bush praised her husband 's record in Iraq and Afghanistan .
She said she will be an active defender of those actions " because they are worth defending . "
" Fifty million people are free from tyranny because of the United States and because of my husband 's policies , " she said .
" These are very , very important , world - changing happenings , and they 're for the best . "
On Iraq , she said , " Do people really wish Saddam Hussein were still there ?
I do n't think so . "
Bush said she has seen the tape of her husband ducking the two shoes thrown by an Iraqi journalist .
" Of course , he is very quick , " she said .
" That was one of things I saw — he 's such a natural athlete . "
Asked if she worries about her husband 's security , she said , " Not really . "
But " any spouse of a president thinks at some time a little bit about the safety of their loved one . "
Afghanistan and Burma have been priorities and will continue to be after Jan. 20 .
Bush plans to work with her husband 's Freedom Institute , part of his presidential library at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
Bush said she has " met with a few publishers " about a book deal , though nothing is final .
" If I write a book , it 'll be about things that happened in the White House , and my take on them , " Bush said .
And will she try to get back at her husband 's critics ?
" That 's not really my personality , " she said .
The first lady said talks with Michelle Obama have been mostly about family .

The next potential victims of the nation ’s credit crunch : nearly 1.5 million people who ride buses and trains each weekday in Los Angeles County .
Transit officials say riders could soon be facing serious service cuts .
That ’s because the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority might have to quickly come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to pay investors under terms of deals it made involving American International Group , the troubled financial and insurance giant .
“ I ’ve lost a lot of sleep over this , ” said Terry Matsumoto , the chief financial service officer and treasurer for the MTA .
He said it was “ absolutely ” certain the agency would have to cut service if the deals sour .
The problem , Matsumoto said , could extend beyond the MTA to other large transit agencies that entered into similar deals between the late 1980s and 2003 , when tax laws were changed to discourage such transactions .
Among those is Metrolink .

The news comes at a tough time for the MTA .
The agency recently lost $ 133 million in state funds , and declining sales tax revenues mean it will have less money to help keep its buses and trains rolling .
An AIG spokesman declined to comment , citing the confidentiality of deals with its customers .
Between the late 1980s and 2003 , the MTA sold its rail equipment , more than 1,000 buses , a parking garage and maintenance facilities to investors that included Wells Fargo , Comerica and Phillip Morris in separate deals .
Lease - back deals are a common way to raise money in the corporate world .
A manufacturer , for example , could sell its factory to investors and then lease it back .
The manufacturer gets a large chunk of cash and the investors get a steady stream of lease payments as well as a tax break for their depreciating property .

“ It ’s a great way to get a shot in the arm in terms of cash without actually divesting yourself of your property , ” said Bill Holder , an accounting professor at USC .
Many of the nation ’s largest transit agencies participated in such deals .
Among them are the San Francisco Muni system , the BART rail system in the Bay Area , the Chicago Transit Authority and the Washington , D.C. , Metro system .
Metrolink , the Southland ’s commuter rail agency , also sold most of its train cars and locomotives in four lease - back deals -- three of which involved AIG -- and made a $ 35.5 - million profit as a result , said spokesman Francisco Oaxaca .
Metrolink , like the MTA , must now find another firm to replace AIG .
“ The potential is pretty horrendous across the industry , ” said James LaRusch , the chief counsel for the American Public Transportation Assn. , a trade group for transit agencies .
“ It ’s typically going to impact the largest transit agencies , because they were the ones that had the kind of assets necessary to get into these kind of deals . ”

LaRusch said about 30 of the largest transit agencies in the nation have some involvement in such deals .
“ Any time you take money from the agency , you are going to cause a cutback in service , ” he said .
In the case of the MTA deals , AIG provided $ 1 billion in loans to finance the transactions .
The company , in return for fees paid by the transit agency , also guaranteed that the lease payments to investors would be made on time .
Things started to go downhill when AIG ran short of cash after running up billions in losses tied to the housing slump .
Its credit ratings were slashed and the firm was on the verge of collapse last month when it was bailed out by the federal government .
The lower credit ratings triggered a clause in the lease - back agreements that require the MTA to either find a new firm to guarantee the deals or reimburse investors for their down payments and lost tax benefits , a scenario that could cost the transit agency between $ 100 million and $ 300 million .

As a frame of reference , Matsumoto said that $ 100 million equals about 10 % of the MTA ’s bus service .
However , the MTA board has not yet discussed what cuts might be made .
The MTA has not found a replacement for AIG , Matsumoto said .
“ With the current state of the markets , there are no people who are willing to provide a replacement for AIG at any price , ” Matsumoto said .
The agency has started talking to some investors in hopes of getting them to accept terms more favorable to the MTA , but Matsumoto said he does n’t know if investors are willing to renegotiate .
Under a worst - case scenario , Matsumoto said , the bill could rise to $ 1.8 billion , more than half the MTA ’s annual budget for this year .
“ There is no practical way we could ever pay that back , ” he said .

The agency has met with congressional staffers and asked the U.S. Treasury Department for help , hoping to get a piece of the $ 700 - billion bailout package recently approved by Congress .
Some of that money is to be used to buy troubled assets .
“ They did n’t tell us to go fly a kite ; that ’s hopeful , ” Matsumoto said .
“ But I do n’t know how practical it is .
We were n’t talking to decision - makers . ”
MTA board member Richard Katz said : “ The feds need to be concerned .
If they bailed out the companies , they also need to bail out the public agencies impacted by the companies ’ actions . ”
The credit crunch has eased a bit in recent days as interest rates for inter - bank loans have inched downward and short - term lending to corporations has picked up .
But it ’s unlikely that conditions will improve fast enough to provide significant relief to the MTA .

Both Matsumoto and LaRusch said the Federal Transit Administration encouraged transit agencies to make lease - back deals as a way to make extra money .
The MTA said it made about $ 65 million on the deals .
But an FTA spokesman disagreed .
“ FTA was not a cheerleader for these transit lease - back agreements , ” agency spokesman Dave Longo wrote in an e-mail .
“ We reviewed lease - back agreements submitted to us by transit agencies in terms of their compliance with federal transit law requirements .
When we determined those agreements met the requirements , we approved them from that perspective . ”

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama will take a break from campaigning Thursday so he can visit his ailing grandmother in Hawaii , an Obama spokesman said Monday .
Sen .
Barack Obama will take a break from campaigning so he can visit his ailing grandmother .
" Sen . Obama 's grandmother Madelyn Dunham has always been one of the most important people in his life , " spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters .
" In the last few weeks , her health has deteriorated to the point where her situation is very serious .
It is for that reason that Sen. Obama has decided to change his schedule on Thursday and Friday so that he can see her and spend some time with her , " Gibbs said .
The interruption will cause Obama to cancel Thursday events in Madison , Wisconsin and Des Moines , Iowa .
He will do an event in Indianapolis , Indiana , Thursday morning before leaving and will return to the campaign Saturday , Gibbs said .
Michelle Obama will fill in for her husband on Friday at previously scheduled events in Columbus and Akron , Ohio , his campaign said .
Obama speaks about his grandmother often on the stump , describing her as an integral figure in his youth who struggled against the glass ceiling in to make a better life for him .
" She 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life , " he said in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August .
" She poured everything she had into me .
And although she can no longer travel , I know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well . "
He and his family traveled to Hawaii in August to visit her .
The Obama team made the announcement after a busy day of trading attacks with Sen. John McCain on the Democratic presidential hopeful 's readiness for office .
Monday also marked the first time that Obama appeared with Sen. Hillary Clinton during the general election season .
Clinton went to Florida , a state she won in the primary but whose delegates she could not claim , to urge her supporters to turn out for Obama on Election Day .
Clinton called Orlando and central Florida " the battleground of the battleground " and practically begged the crowd to vote early .
" We are 15 days from the finish line and we cannot falter , we cannot stop , we cannot take a single vote for granted , " Clinton said Monday .
" I am asking you to work as hard for Barack as you worked for me .
If you made phone calls for me , make them for Barack .
If you walked streets for me , make them for Barack .
If you talked to your friends and neighbors for me , do it again for Barack .
We can not risk four more years of the same failed Republican policies . "
Earlier in the day , McCain told a crowd in Belton , Missouri , that the next president " wo n't have time to get used to the office . "
He was addressing comments made Sunday by Obama 's running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden , in which he said Obama would be tested within the first six months of his presidency .
" We do n't want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis and Americans are already fighting in two wars , " McCain said .
" What is more troubling is that Sen .
Biden told their campaign donors that when that crisis hits , they would have to stand with them because it would n't be apparent Sen .
Obama would have the right response .
The Obama - Biden campaign released a pre-emptive response after reading McCain 's scheduled remarks .
" With our nation facing two wars and 21st century threats abroad , Sen .
Biden referenced the simple fact that history shows presidents face challenges from day one , " Obama spokesman David Wade said .
" After eight years of a failed foreign policy , we need Barack Obama 's good judgment and steady leadership , not the erratic and ideological Bush - McCain approach that has set back our security and standing in the world . "
Earlier Monday , Obama denounced the " say - anything , do - anything politics " of McCain 's camp , but said " careless , outrageous comments " wo n't distract him from addressing the nation 's ills .
Obama added that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , McCain 's running mate , rejected some of the tactics when she spoke out against a flood of automated phone calls tying Obama to former radical William Ayers .
The calls were reported in several battleground states .
" It 's getting so bad that even Sen. McCain 's running mate denounced his tactics last night , " Obama said at a campaign event in Tampa , Florida .
" As you know , you really have to work hard to violate Gov. Palin 's standards on negative campaigning . "
Sunday night , Palin told reporters traveling with her that if she had her way , the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee would not be flooding battleground states with the automated phone calls , which she said the Obama campaign was using too .
Over the next 15 days , Obama said Monday , he will continue his quest for the Oval Office while disregarding the divisive politics that he said McCain is endorsing " to keep us from working together . "
The McCain campaign , meanwhile , continued its weekend assault on Obama 's tax plan , which it called an attempt to " spread the wealth . "
iReport.com : Send your questions for Sen. John McCain
Speaking at a campaign event in St. Charles , Missouri , a chorus of boos rang out as the Arizona senator described his take on the plan .
" He believes in redistributing wealth -- not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs and opportunities for all Americans .
Sen .
Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your piece of the pie than in growing the pie . "
In Colorado Springs , Colorado , Palin also continued her line of attack from the weekend , but softened her tone in that she did n't call Obama 's plan socialism .
Watch Palin say Obama sounds like a socialist »
Over the weekend , Palin and Sen. Mel Martinez , a Cuban - American GOP senator from Florida , called Obama 's plan socialism .
Martinez compared the plan to the tax structure in communist Cuba .
McCain has taken a softer tone .
On Sunday , he dodged a question from Fox News ' Chris Wallace about whether Obama was a socialist , but said his rival 's tax plan was an effort " to spread the wealth . "
" That 's one of the tenets of socialism , " McCain said .
Watch Obama defend his plan »
Obama 's tax plan calls for tax relief for 95 percent of workers and their families .
Though nonpartisan tax policy organizations agree that 40 percent of Americans do n't pay income tax , many of those are lower - income earners who file payroll taxes through their employers .
See the fact check
After receiving an endorsement from Colin Powell , a former Republican secretary of state and retired Army general , Obama asked if Powell and billionaire Warren Buffett -- No. 2 on Forbes magazine 's 2008 list of richest Americans -- would have extended their backing if he was a socialist .
Watch Obama explain Powell 's influence »
Obama said he simply wants to give the middle class a tax cut .
Powell came to Obama 's defense after endorsing the senator from Illinois .
Powell said he had grown tired of McCain 's negative campaigning and that the American people would prefer to focus on issues like education , infrastructure and the economy .
He specifically slammed Palin 's allegation that Obama 's tax plan is socialist , calling it misleading .

What do you think about Powell 's endorsement ?
" For us to say that makes you a socialist , I think , is an unfortunate characterization that is n't accurate . "
All About U.S. Presidential Election • John McCain • Barack Obama • Sarah Palin
Where in the world does the average citizen spend just two hours a week online ?
An isolated backwater , perhaps ?
Or maybe netizen figures from a far - off land trapped in a time bubble of its own desiring ?
Well , close .
This bastion of digital indifference is Italy , one of our closest neighbours , a super - rich G7 nation and homeland to the inventors of the telephone and radio .
Some think this technophobia is a good thing , preserving the Italy of laid - back " click with friends and family , not a mouse " yore .
Tourists for one find the low - tech lifestyle enchanting .
Turning off the net
Others feel it has put the country at a huge disadvantage , flinging it far over the wrong side of the digital divide where Italy will , in economic terms at least , continue to languish as the ageing , increasingly impoverished sick man of Europe .
And if moribund economies are measured by a lack of IT skills , high - speed connections and e-commerce , then Italy is very sick indeed .
The median amount of time Italian internet users spend online has actually decreased between 2007 and 2008 , according to one survey by tech trend specialists JupiterResearch .
Interestingly , what that survey suggests is that although there is more internet connectivity than ever in Italy , residents are actually spurning the net .
Could it be that Italians have better things to do ?
Face - to - face networking , old - fashioned chat and time to share news and gossip over a game of cards in the shade of a village piazza , perhaps - the same things that draw thousands weary of net - driven modern life to Italy every year ?
Information technology definitely presents a dilemma for many Italians , says Paolo Di Croce , the secretary of Slow Food International , who advocates a little less rush in all our busy lives .
He believes technology has its place but should not overshadow , for example , the emphasis placed on real - time relationships or physical communities .
" The personal element in Italian life is something that will not be exorcised .
So we have to find the right balance .
Just as with the Slow Food movement and its globalisation , the web and email have become our major tools .
Without internet we are not possible , but we must use them wisely , " he says .
" If you can't survive without sending 50 mails a day , without becoming a slave to the BlackBerry - this goes against our philosophy . "
That Italy produced the Slow movement in the first place indicates that there was always going to be some resistance to demands for instant results , efficiency , 24/7 and convenience .
And it 's not as though Italy does n't have form in its resistance to modern - day technology concerns and pressures : it spent the least of all the developed countries on fixing the millennium bug .
In the event , no problems worth reporting were experienced .
Seeing how the use of IT has often actually increased our workload and complicated daily life , some on the side of the more demanding , tech - reliant digital divide are eyeing enviously Italy 's less digitised , less demanding work practices .
Such practices may , in the long run , even be good for business .
Just as financial globalisation allowed a few to hijack our banking systems , Italy claims its banks are now in better shape because their less tech - savvy institutions do things the old way .
" America and the UK used to say the Italian banks were backwards , but it turns out we now have the soundest banks in Europe , " said Italy 's finance minister , Giulio Tremonti , following the global financial crisis .
Italy may suffer in other ways - creaking bureaucracy , protectionism , inefficiency and low growth - but shows less of the malaise that comes with overexposure to digital lifestyles or unregulated internet that the rest of the west is suffering .
Meanwhile , as the internet savvy suffer info overload , Italy continues with older IT practices that many of the digital generation would find puzzling - Flash - infested websites that are less - than - functional shop windows , a sometimes poor response to emails and a bureaucracy that has made it painfully slow and expensive to bring email to the masses .
Domenico Condello , the technical consultant to a company that is attempting to bring the internet to unconnected hills 30 miles east of Rome , Comunita Montana dell ' Aniene , says it has been a huge struggle to cut red tape holding back Italy 's answer to feeding broadband to its hilly regions - a fast WiMax service .
" There is pent - up demand here , " he says .
" Fast WiMax services such as ours should revolutionise the internet in Italy . "
But he admits the start has been slow and that probably only the young will be interested in using the service as it rolls out this autumn .
Italy 's half - hearted adoption of the internet and the older generation 's failure to grasp the importance of IT to a future economy has frustrated many youngsters so much that they simply give up and go abroad , says Bernhard Warner , who runs a tech consultancy in Rome .
Art and history
" But , " adds the American expatriate , who swears by his high - speed web connection : " There are certainly things to be learnt from the Italian way of doing things .
" I can't see myself living anywhere else .
Here , you can walk beyond your desk and realise there is more to life than tech things .
Being surrounded by such art and history keeps your perspective fresh .
I 'm pleased by the Italian sensibility . "
But even in the cities , he points out , where there may be broadband , the cost makes it a luxury for most Italians with their lower disposable incomes than the UK .
" The preferred way to contact is the mobile for most .
So far the net has been a tool for better - paid young professionals , " says Warner .
It 's a far cry from internet being as available as " air and water " , which is how the EU recently referred to its policy on broadband adoption .
Italy 's new government under Berlusconi is probably not helping .
The last election was about halting globalisation , protecting an inward - looking Italy , largely arguing against free trade and the opening of international markets - the internet being a large part of that .
Many who disagree with those policies have abandoned the country , leaving il bel paese - the beautiful country - to decide if it really does prefer life in the past - unhurried , and happily unwired .
Scientology Critic Blindsides Cultists During Stress Test Posted by RB on November 30 , 2008 · 6 Comments
I could n’t not post this truly epic video .
In it , tenacious Cult of Scientology critic AngryGayPope – whom the cult has gone to some lengths to thwart – went into a major Hollywood Scientology centre without being recognized and received a free stress test .
Unbeknownst to the Scientologists his videocam , which was around his neck , was recording .
For the entirety of the test he plays dumb and simply goes along with the test .
Once it is over , he is told that he has a lot of stress and should consider reading Dianetics .
He then reveals to the Scientologist that he is gay , and so he is particularly concerned about self - help services ’ views on homosexuality .
So he thumbs through Dianetics and instantly finds the section on homosexuality where it calls the homosexual a sexual pervert who suffers from an illness , which he reads aloud .
First the Scientologist tries to minimize the severity of the claims and then when AGP responds by inviting her to read the statements herself , she takes the book back !
Then he goes into Xenu and she , predictably , had him leave the centre .
Outstanding .

Mrs Rawlins was hit by a tour bus on the corner of Bourke and Swanston streets after her bicycle slipped over on tram tracks as she cycled to work on September 18 .
There were several tour buses parked on the corner where Ms Rawlins died this morning , even as the protesters , led by Mr Rawlins , made their way down Swanston Street .
Some of the protesters carried signs reading : " Make Swanston Street safe for cyclists " .
Fellow organiser Michael Frazzetto said Melbourne City Council is responsible for building a safer bicycle lane .
" We are calling on the experts in Melbourne City Council to fix up the street .
The council has a duty to provide safer conditions , " Mr Frazzetto says .
Meanwhile , hundreds more cyclists were taking part in official Ride to Work Day activities at Federation Square .
The day is jointly sponsored by the Government , health groups and cycling advocacy groups and aims to encourage non-cyclists to try cycling into work by offering free breakfast and peer support .
Over 1000 people arrived at Federation Square this morning where they were offered advice on helmet hair , free reflective ankle straps , free massages and breakfast .
Most people at the breakfast said they cycle to work and into town regularly .
Stuart Schnaars of Diamond Creek , who cycles for an hour into work three to four times a week , says organisation is the key to commuting by cycle .
" People probably just cannot be bothered , " he said .
" You have a change of clothes and all your showering gear at work because it is too far to ride carrying all the extra luggage " .
Andrew Libby from Rosanna says he started cycling into work regularly four or five years ago because he was sick of sitting in traffic each morning .
" The traffic is so bad , it is quicker for me to ride home than drive , " Mr Libby says .
" If I drive home , leaving at 6 pm , it is an hour and a half because the traffic is just so bad everywhere you go . "
Michelle Milton , from St Kilda , says she finds the on - road routes too dangerous at peak hours , so takes a longer route to work .
" I go all the way through Albert Park to stay away from cars because even though there is a bike lane for cyclists , cars just do not give you the privilege to ride down the roads , " Ms Milton said .
There was a lot of lycra , fluorescent clothing and helmets walking around Federation Square this morning , but Ms Milton says the cycling `uniform ' is all about safety .
" There is a lot of fluoro , but you want to be seen on the roads . "
Victoria Police were also on hand to engrave bicycles with identification numbers so they can be returned to owners if they are lost or stolen .
A spokesman for Victoria Police said the engraving service is available throughout the year from all police stations .
There were some non-cyclists who had been encouraged to cycle into work for the first time by friends and work colleagues .
Hung Chau , from Oakleigh , says he cycled in with colleagues .
" It is my first time today , although I cycle into the city on weekends , " Mr Chau says .
" I might cycle more regularly if I get fitter , " he joked .
Martine Ward was also encouraged by friends to cycle into work from her home in Fitzroy for the first time today .
Ms Ward says she was primarily motivated by environmental issues and borrowed a bicycle from a work colleague for today 's ride .
Loading " I would cycle in again if I had my own bike , " she said .
" It was an easy ride , about 25 minutes , but I was a bit wobbly at first , " she giggled .
Animating Multilayered Engravings
Get some movement and color to your engravings .
Author : Jani ' Japala ' Pönkkö Published : 20.02.2008
In English
Suomeksi Intro
It was seven years ago when I introduced engraving and edge lighting to the modding scene .
Since then , we have seen some great pieces of art made by several modders .
Most of the engravings today are done to a single sheet of acrylic but there is no reason why one could n't use several of them .
Added layers give some interesting possibilities like adding different colors to the design , make the design feel more 3D and finally , they enable animation .
This tutorial will be in two parts , all in this one article .
First we will see the concept with a single colored design .
After that I 'll show a bit more advanced variation of this technique .
Hope you like it .
The Concept
Like the name implies , multilayered design consists of two or more acrylic sheets .
These sheets can then have their own design and color .
When combined , the results can be quite spectacular .
The image is from the article that I wrote back in 2002 .
It described our new CNC - machine for PCB prototyping .
In this article I also demoed the multilayer technique with help from a naked lady with a red glowing fireball .
When I wrote about animation back then , I meant changing the color with a ColorFade circuit .
Today we talk about incorporating an illusion of movement into our design .
In most situations , the engravings are just series of thin lines .
To get the lines visible , one points a light source at them .
Usually this is a high intensity LED .
This makes the engraved areas catch the light and deflect it towards the viewer .
When animating , idea is to light only one layer at the time .
Then light the next one and then the next etc .
End result is bit like one seen in neon signs that have for example a guy waving .
Making it happen
Like I pointed out in the GlowPad article , it is best to draw and engrave the design on the backside of the sheet .
This will reflect the light better and you 'll end up with a brighter image .
Just remember to do the design as a mirror image !
This is something that even I sometimes forget .
With a random image it does n't matter that much but with a text the piece is ruined .
The reason why I chose the Intel Inside logo was that it was the first three piece design that came to mind .
I believe this was only a good thing as the logo does n't contain any overlapping items thus making it easier to align and play with the first time .
More advanced stuff coming soon .
After a short Dremel session , all three sheets were engraved .
Maybe not the best work quality but enough for prototyping purposes .
Sheets seem bit cloudy as the protective sheet is still intact on one side .

Introduction
Everyone knows that when you step into a virtual world , you can become any persona you want .
You can even become multiple personas at the same time .
This is the story of how I took this to the extreme when I played Asheron 's Call 2 .
Before you proceed ...
Some portions of the story make ganking and griefing ( basically harassing lower level players ) sound fun .
However I do seek not to promote nor encourage such actions ;
The story is a recollection how of how things were , and back then I possibly perceived such action as fun , but since then I 've matured a bit and like to promote an enjoyable virtual environment for all .
Fallen Kings
Asheron's Call 2 : Fallen Kings by Turbine Entertainment , released on 2002 , was a great game .
Though this article will not be a review of that game , but rather a personal recollection of my experience playing this game , which was the first MMORPG I ever played .
A review of Asheron 's Call 2 will be published in a separate article .
Roleplaying
I have a background of playing Table Top RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons ( D& D ) .
This requires lots of acting and roleplaying , hardcore .
So when I started playing Asheron 's Call 2 , I decided that I will keep the D&D roleplaying spirit alive and roleplay .
Plus , I figured , I might as well role play since it is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game .
Not to roleplay would have been a waste of time ( and subscription money ) .
I did a bit of research and gathered that Frostfell was an unofficial roleplaying server , and thus begin my adventures in Dereth ( The world of Asheron 's Call )
Alignment
In Dungeons and Dragons , a character can choose to be one of several different alignments , from evil to good .
My favorite alignment had always been chaotic good , and I opted to have my character follow that role .
I rolled a human defender , and named him Ridley Freeborn ( After the hero from the Dungeons and Dragons Motion Picture ) .
I faithfully followed the role I had taken upon myself , defend virtue and justice .
I joined a big and reputable guild ( called Hellhawk ) and spent a lot of my time helping others .
I would help newer players with quests , loot , helped them find their way around Dereth and it's portal system , and otherwise organize guild activities .
I had a pretty good reputation , and other players would turn to me if they needed a hand , and I also had no problems raising parties to face some more difficult and rewarding challenge .
I had established myself as a leader type and that had kept me busy , until ...
Lex Luthor
Something was missing in the game .
As they say , every hero needs a villain .
And there was no such villain in that server .
And I am not talking about some NPC boss which is supposed to be hard to kill but you still kill him over and over .
This was an MMORPG and I was hoping for a player rival .
But since nobody stepped up to the challenge , it struck me that I should step into those shoes .
I figured this would also be the ultimate exercise in roleplaying , having to be in constant flux between good and evil .
And so I rolled my new character , Qix , a Lugian Tactician .
Little did I know that soon things would spiral out of hand ...
The Calm Before the Storm
Tacticians were a great class .
They had little mobility , but they could build small fortresses with turrets and defensive walls .
This was perfect for leveling fast .
If you knew the best spots , you could set up camp and plant your turrets and let them kill monsters while you reap the experience .
And Ridley , my “ good ” character was well connected , so I had no problem learning about the good spots to level up my “ evil ” character , Qix .
I wanted Qix to level fast so that he could catch up with Ridley who was already at maximum level .
And indeed , I learned how to play the tactician effectively very fast , and in a couple of weeks I had reached the level cap .
Pandora
Now was the time to open the Pandora 's box .
Frostfell was a non pvp server , however it did have some PVP ( Player Vs Player ) areas .
The intention of the developers was that those who seek to PVP would go to those areas , and those who did not wish to partake in PVP would stay away .
However , there was one flaw : some of the main portal routes went through PVP areaa .
Portals were the prime way of transportation around Dereth , to get from point A to point B you would have to go through a series of portals .
Sure you could get anywhere by running or mounting , but that would take a very long time .
So I went and set up my Turrets near one of the contested PVP portals .
Now at this point Qix was very powerful , or “ Uber ” how they would say in MMORPG slang .
I had the best equipment possible , due to my connections to the Hellhawk guild with my other character .
It was ironic that the equipment provided to me by the Hellhawk Guild would soon be used against them .
Not only did I have the best equipment , but I also had learned a lot about proper set up of the turrets and strategic placement of the defensive walls and other skills in my arsenal .
Turrets were armed , and I eagerly awaited to the first victim to pass through the portal ...
Ambush
Sure after , a player from Hellhawk , 20 levels lower then me , materialized through the portal .
Wham !
He stood no chance .
The turrets killed him as fast as a blink of an eye .
Just so you understand , there is a second or two loading time when you exit a portal .
In that time you cannot move or otherwise act to defend yourself .
And those 1 or 2 seconds were enough for my turrets to chew through any armor .
And this went on for several days , people would come out of the portal straight into my ambush just to get killed .
My turrets would sometimes wipe entire parties .
Until Qix showed up there was no concept of a villain , the players on the server did not know what to do with with this situation .
Perhaps they thought it was temporary and that the problem would go away by itself .
But a few more days passed and I kept sitting there undisturbed .
I did not know if this was funny or sad , but the slaughter soon became boring .
Someone had to challenge me ...
Counter Ambush
Enough was Enough .
I logged in as Ridley and called in a guild meeting .
“ We have to do something about this Qix ” I pointed out the gravity of the situation .
“ We are a whole guild , and Qix is just one player who is ruining everybody 's playing experience ” I argued .
“ As the largest and most reputable guild in AC2 , we have to step up and stop him . ”
Ironically , I was put in charge of a task force to do just that .
I came up with the plan to send a 10 - player party around the portal and attempt to Ambush Qix from behind .
I coordinated and scheduled the ambushes myself , and of course we never found Qix there when we got to the portal .
Chaos
Back to Qix , ambushing the same portal slaughtering everyone coming through had become a bit of a routine , and as such boring Plus more and more players were now trying to go around the portal and attempt to kill me .
This was never successful as I had an exit strategy myself , as soon as an enemy was spotted , I would rush into the portal transporting myself to a non PVP area .
I would then go set up camp in a different PVP portal .
The failure to kill me increased frustration amongst the server .
Still , I knew it would not be long before they adapt so I found alternate ways to grief .
For example , one day I managed to infiltrate Hellhawk .
How did I do that ?
Well AC2 had this flawed guild system ( later corrected , probably because of me ) where only the person who recruited the guild member could boot that member out of the guild .
It was a hierarchy system of sorts .
Sure , the guild leader could boot him too but only if he knew who the recruiter was , and at that time there was no such means .
And so I had Ridley recruit a newbie player who had not yet heard of Qix , and then Qix would go to that player and get recruited into Hellhawk .
Soon , the server was wondering how come Qix is a part of Hellhawk and this hurt the guild 's reputation greatly until they figured out how to boot Qix from the guild .
And there were many other ways I would grief but I do n't want to go into to much detail as you get the idea by now .
At the same time , I would also play as Ridley and keep helping other players , even the same ones whom I had just ganked as Qix .
Notorious
Soon , everybody was talking about Qix .
I had become notorious .
There was n't a single player on the server who had not heard of Qix .
Forums were raging .
Guilds would unite in an attempt to stop me
And there was also a sense of frustration and rage the he could not be stopped .
Complaints to the Customer Service Game Masters ( GMs ) would not help as well ;
Anyone who complained was told that I was not breaking any of the game rules .
Like every great arch - villain , Qix now had followers and even copycats .
There was a huge spike in ganking and griefing .
The quiet days of the server were long gone .
Epilogue
One day I decided that things were spiraling too much out of hand , and I quit the game just like that .
When I talked to guild members later about Qix , I learned that despite the griefing and the ganking , Qix was missed because he made life on Dereth oh so interesting and once he was gone there was this unexplained void left .
A few others though told me that they were so frustrated from the ganking that it made them want to quit .
But most agreed that Qix had a positive influence on the server .
I planned on returning ( This time just as Ridley ) when things settled down , however the game shut down a year after ( an event not related to what I had caused ... at least that 's what I hoped ) .
And I never told anyone this story until now , and people still remember Qix as the evil arch - villain and Ridley as the good hero ( Well most likely nobody remembers Ridley anymore as Qix stole his show ) .
And thus concludes the story of how I single handedly threw a server into chaos .

No national or international medical association recommends routine circumcision .
Only the USA circumcises the majority of newborn boys without medical or religious reason .
Medicalized circumcision began during the 1800s to prevent masturbation , which was believed to cause disease .
Today 's parents are learning that the foreskin is a normal , protective , functioning organ .
Today 's parents realize circumcision harms and has unnecessary risks .
Circumcision denies a male 's right to genital integrity and choice for his own body .

The most comprehensive empirical study of digital music sales ever conducted has some bad news for Californian technology utopians .
Since 2004 , WiReD magazine editor Chris Anderson has been hawking his " Long Tail " proposition around the world : blockbusters will matter less , and businesses will " sell less of more " .
The graph has become iconic - a kind of ' Hockey Stick ' for Web 2.0 - with the author applying his message to many different business sectors .
Alas , following the WiReD Way of Business as a matter of faith could be catastrophic for your business and investment decisions .
Examining tens of millions of transactions from a large digital music provider , economist Will Page with Mblox founder Andrew Bud and Page 's colleague Gary Eggleton , looked to see how large and valuable the " Tail " of digital music may be .
They produced a spreadsheet with 1.5 million rows - so large , in fact , that it required a special upgrade to their Excel software ( and more RAM ) - and the three revealed their work at the Telco 2.0 conference this week .
They discovered that instead of following a Pareto or " power law " curve , as Anderson suggested , digital song sales follow a classic Log Normal distribution .
80 per cent of the digital inventory sold no copies at all - and the ' head ' was far more concentrated than the economists expected .
" Is the ' future of business ' really selling more of less ? " asks Page .
" Absolutely not .
If you had Top of the Pops now , you 'd feature the Top 14 , not Top 40 . "
Anderson bet that the orange portion - the " Tail " - has more value than the red portion - the " Head " .
But it does n't .
As Andrew Bud explains :
" The Long Tail 's argument is that the pattern of consumption for media is bent out of shape by the limits of the shops selling them .
Digital media lets the nature of people 's demand flow free .
Well , we now know what the shape of that demand curve looks like . "
Bud told the conference that the basic shape of consumer demand for digital music clearly fits the Log Normal distribution , " with eye - watering accuracy " .
That 's no surprise , he says , because so many sales curves he 's seen over the past ten years follow this distribution .
" Now we 've seen what happens when tens of millions of choices are thrown in the air and people can go pick them up .
What was astounding was the degree of inequality between the head and the tail - by a factor of three .
It 's specifically the Log Normal shape that leads to a rather poverty stricken Tail .
" There are Tails where the Tail lives as a kind of welfare state .
Not this one .
You starve in this Tail . "
Brown 's 1956 lognormal curve fits digital sales data much better than " The Long Tail "
This really is n't the upbeat fairy tale message Anderson has spent four years selling on the conference circuit .
However , as he took his " message " to Davos and beyond , the Long Tail has gradually developed into a ' Policy Based Evidence Making ' .
Having convinced himself of the truth of his hypothesis by looking at one US music service , Anderson widened his search for facts that might fit his theory .
But he did n't examine the numbers closely or critically enough , say the economists .
“ Now we 've seen what happens when tens of millions of choices are thrown in the air and land on the floor . ”
" You need to consider much more than just some flimsy volume - based Rhapsody data if you 're going to say the world 's changed , " says Page .
" For instance , understanding value both in terms of retail spend and then marginal profitability to the artist and songwriter would have been a logical extension "
In another surprise , 80 per cent of the revenue came from 52,000 songs .
What 's eye - catching about the number ?
Well , the typical inventory of a conventional high street record store was around 4,000 CDs .
Or ... around 52,000 songs .
He wrenched himself out of bed with agonizing regret yet again ; a modern day Sisyphus .
Outside , the fall weather dropped in fat , cold wafts and flows against the house ; wet and chill in the brittle dawn light .
Inside the room , however , it was pitch black thanks to heavy curtains .
On the bed was a heaped mess of thick sheets and not fewer than two enormous comforters .
The whirlpool of fabric formed the basis of the kindest and warmest of nests .
Why any intelligent creature would under his own power leave this cave of comfort is regrettable .
There , at his feet , the cat .
It had spent the lion 's share of the night curled up on his feet ; a fuzzy and breathing kind of hot water bottle .
Looking up with wise and innocent , sleepy eyes in the near - dark , the cat uttered a single word of wisdom : " Meow " and indignantly fell immediately back to sleep .

In the past few weeks , Sarah Palin has been variously described as a diva who engaged in paperwork - throwing tantrums , a shopaholic who spent $ 150,000 on clothing , a seductress who provocatively welcomed staffers while wearing only a towel , and a “ whack - job ” — contemporary code for hysteric .
Worse , she was accused by a suspiciously gleeful Fox News reporter named Carl Cameron of not knowing Africa was a continent , of being unable to name the members of NAFTA , indeed of being unable to name the countries of North America at all .
( “ But she can be tutored , ” Bill O’Reilly told Cameron , as though speaking of a small child . )
More significant than the dubious origins of these leaks , or the fact that the campaign that cried “ sexism ” at every criticism of its vice - presidential nominee was engaging in its own misogynistic warfare , is the fact that all of the allegations were so believable .
After all , Palin had earned herself a reputation as , in the words of one Fox News blogger , “ something of a policy ditz . ”
It ’s hard to get too worked up on Palin ’s behalf , of course ; she was complicit in her crucifixion .
But it is disappointing to watch what some have called the “ year of the woman ” come to such an embarrassing conclusion .
This was an election cycle in which candidates pandered to female voters , newsweeklies tried to figure out “ what women want , ” and Hillary Clinton garnered 18 million votes toward winning the Democratic nomination .
The assumption was that these “ 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling , ” as Clinton put it , would advance the prospects of female achievement and gender equality .
It has n’t exactly worked out that way .
In the grand Passion play that was this election , both Clinton and Palin came to represent — and , at times , reinforce — two of the most pernicious stereotypes that are applied to women : the bitch and the ditz .
Clinton took the first label , even though she tried valiantly , some would say misguidedly , to run a campaign that ignored gender until the very end .
“ Now , I ’m not running because I ’m a woman , ” she would say .
“ I ’m running because I think I ’m the best - qualified and experienced person to hit the ground running . ”
She was highly competent , serious , diligent , prepared ( sometimes overly so ) — a woman who cloaked her femininity in hawkishness and pantsuits .
But she had , to use an unfortunate term , likability issues , and she inspired in her detractors an upwelling of sexist animus :
She was likened to Tracy Flick for her irritating entitlement , to Lady Macbeth for her boundless ambition .
She was a grind , scold , harpy , shrew , priss , teacher ’s pet , killjoy — you get the idea .
She was repeatedly called a bitch ( as in : “ How do we beat the … ” ) and a buster of balls .
Tucker Carlson deemed her “ castrating , overbearing , and scary ” and said , memorably , “ Every time I hear Hillary Clinton speak , I involuntarily cross my legs . ”
Career women , especially those of a certain age , recognized themselves in Clinton and the reactions she provoked .
“ Maybe what bothers me most is that people say Hillary is a bitch , ” said Tina Fey in her now - famous “ Bitch Is the New Black ” skit .
“ Let me say something about that : Yeah , she is .
So am I … You know what ?
Bitches get stuff done . ”
At least being called a bitch implies power .
As bad as Clinton ’s treatment was , the McCain campaign ’s cynical decision to put a woman — any woman — on the ticket was worse for the havoc it would wreak on gender politics .
It was far more destructive , we would learn , for a woman to be labeled a fool .
When Sarah Palin first stepped onto the national stage , I was , like many women , intrigued by her .
Here was a woman who — even if you did n’t agree with her politics — seemed to have achieved what so many of us were struggling for : an enviable balance between career and family .
She was “ a brisk , glam multitasker , ” to quote the Observer ’s Doree Shafrir , with a good - natured stay - at - home husband at her side and several adorable young children in tow .
She was running a state and breast - feeding a newborn and yet , amazingly , did not seem exhausted .
There was something inspiring about seeing a woman so at ease with her choices , even as both liberal and conservative critics chided her for running for vice - president when her family needed her .
Politics aside , when , at the convention , she delivered a politically deft speech like a pro , it was pleasing to witness the first woman on a Republican ticket perform so well .
Of course , the myth of Sarah Palin unraveled almost as quickly as it was spun .
By now , her bizarre filibustering , discomfiting blank stares , weird locutions , and general tendency to trip over herself verbally are familiar .
First , there was the painful Charlie Gibson interview , in which Palin adopted a Toastmasters - style technique of repeating her interlocutor ’s name in a vain attempt to sound authoritative .
Then Katie Couric , with a newfound air of gravitas , smothered Palin with her simple questions and soothing manner : Palin appeared stunningly uninformed , lacking a basic fluency in foreign policy and economic theory .
Even if she had frozen up out of nervousness , or fell into the category of smart - but - inarticulate , it was still unacceptable that she could n’t recall Supreme Court decisions she disagreed with or name a single periodical she reads .
Time ?
Newsweek ?
Hello ?
Palin was recast as the charmer , the glider , the dim beauty queen , the kind of woman who floats along on a little luck and the favor of men .
In a recent issue of The New Yorker , Jane Mayer recounted how a handful of conservative Washington thinkers became besotted with Palin during a trip to Alaska and subsequently began to promote her in Washington :
The National Review ’s Jay Nordlinger described the governor as “ a former beauty - pageant contestant , and a real honey , too , ” Bill Kristol called her “ my heartthrob , ” and Fred Barnes noted she was “ exceptionally pretty . ”
While it ’s obviously not Palin ’s fault that men find her attractive , it is fair to criticize her for campaigning on a platform of charm rather than substance .
In what Michelle Goldberg called a “ brazen attempt to flirt [ her ] way into the good graces of the voting public , ” she waved and winked and smiled — even during the debate — and called herself “ just your average hockey mom . ”
( Never mind that it ’s impossible to imagine a male candidate mentioning fatherhood as the source of his readiness to be the nation ’s second - in - command . )
Her running mate called her “ a direct counterpoint to the liberal feminist agenda for America , ” and her “ Joe Six - Pack ” fans seemed to appreciate her nonthreatening approach .
To quote a former truck driver named Larry Hawkins who was interviewed by the Times at a Palin rally : “ They bear us children , they risk their lives to give us birth , so maybe it ’s time we let a woman lead us . ”
It was enough to incense those of us who related to Hillary Clinton and her plight .
“ What ’s infuriating , and perhaps rage - inducing , about Palin , is that she has always embodied that perfectly pleasing female archetype , ” Jessica Grose wrote on Jezebel.com , in a post titled “ Why Sarah Palin Incites Near - Violent Rage in Normally Reasonable Women . ”
Palin had taken a match and set fire to our meritocratic notions that hard work and accumulated experience would be rewarded .
“ As has been known to happen in less exalted workplaces , ” Katha Pollitt wrote , “ Palin got the promotion because the boss just liked her . ”
Her blithe ignorance extended from foreign policy to the symbolic value of her candidacy .
By stepping into the spotlight unprepared , Palin reinforced some of the most damaging and sexist ideas of all : that women are undisciplined in their thinking ; that we are distracted by domestic concerns or frivolous pursuits like shopping ; that we are not smart enough , or not serious enough , for the important jobs .
In a rare moment of sympathy for Palin , Judith Warner , writing in the Times , noted that Palin ’s admirers must “ know she ca n’t possibly do it all — the kids , the special - needs baby , the big job , the big conversations with foreign leaders .
And neither could they . ”
But many women do manage to do it all , or pretty close to all .
They at least manage to come prepared for the big conversations and the critical meetings , no matter what they have going on at home .
“ Do we have to drag out a list of women who miraculously have found a way to balance many of these factors — Hillary Clinton ?
Nancy Pelosi ?
Michelle Bachelet ?— and could still explain the Bush Doctrine without breaking out in hives ? ” wrote Rebecca Traister in Salon.com .
Why then must Palin ’s operatic failure be the example that leaves a lasting imprint ?
And so , here we are , nearly two years after Hillary Clinton declared her candidacy .
While it ’s true that societal change comes in fits and starts and the Clinton campaign went a long way toward helping voters imagine a female commander - in - chief , I ca n’t help but think that our historic step forward was followed by more than a few in the opposite direction .
In August , after Clinton had dropped out of the race but before Palin was selected as the vice - presidential nominee , the Pew Research Center published a study on gender and leadership .
A remarkable 69 percent of respondents believed that men and women made equally good leaders .
In fact , women were rated equal to or better than men in seven of eight “ leadership traits , ” such as honesty , intelligence , ambition , creativity , compassion — the only quality on which men scored higher was decisiveness .
Two months later , when voters were asked to rate the leadership ability of one particular woman , the results were just as striking .
According to exit polls , 60 percent of voters thought Palin was not qualified to be president if necessary .
It ’s true that Sarah Palin is only one woman , and we ’ve seen male candidates of questionable readiness , like the oft - mentioned Dan Quayle , and even presidents of questionable intelligence , such as George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan , whom Clark Clifford once called “ an amiable dunce . ”
But because so few women are present at the highest levels of government , they carry the burden of representing their gender more so than men .
In politics as in business , an unqualified woman does more damage than no women at all .
She serves to fortify the stereotypes that the next woman will have to surmount .
In the end , women can take pride in the fact that we helped break another set of retrograde stereotypes and prejudices with the election of Barack Obama .
Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson notes that “ for the first time since enfranchisement , [ women ] voted in greater numbers , and more progressively , than men , ” favoring Obama by a 13 percent margin , while men were almost evenly split .
In doing so , we selected a candidate whose views on issues like health care and equal pay and reproductive rights align with our interests .
But among the darker revelations of this election is the fact that the vice - grip of female stereotypes remains suffocatingly tight .
On the national political stage and in office buildings across the country , women regularly find themselves divided into dualities that are the modern equivalent of the Madonna - whore complex : the hard - ass or the lightweight , the battle - ax or the bubblehead , the serious , pursed - lipped shrew or the silly , ineffectual girl .
It is exceedingly difficult to sidestep this trap .
Michelle Obama began the campaign as a bold , outspoken woman with a career of her own , and she was called a hard - ass .
Now , as she prepares to move into the White House , she appears poised to recede into a fifties - era role of “ mom - in - chief . ”
It will be heartbreaking if , in an effort to avoid the kind of criticism that followed Hillary Clinton , the First Lady is reduced to a lightweight .
Many will say we ’ve come a long way this year .
The truth is we have a long way to go .
OTTAWA , Nov. 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Canadian scientists said Friday they have found fragments from the 10 - ton space rock that fell in western Canada last week .
The bright , colorful rock caused a late - night light show as it fell near the Alberta - Saskatchewan border .
Thousands of local residents witnessed the scene and videos and cameras recorded it .
Planetary scientist Alan Hildebrand and graduate student Ellen Milley from University of Alberta said they found meteorite fragments in a rural area near the border town of Lloydminster , Alberta , late Thursday .
They are currently searching the area to collect additional fragments , which they believe are strewn across a 20 - square - kilometer area .
They reportedly found the 10 fragments on a frozen pond , the biggest being a fist - sized meteorite .
They believe there may be thousands of fragments on the ground .
Canada 's largest meteorite shower took place in Alberta , when more than 700 fragments were recovered in 1960 .
IF it was intended to , the announcement on Friday by New York magazine ’s Insatiable Critic at the Rainbow Room in Manhattan certainly achieved the maximum frisson .
Gael Greene stood at the microphone during the annual Power Lunch for Women benefiting Citymeals - on - Wheels  the nonprofit she co-founded 27 years ago to feed the city ’s homebound elderly  and lamented the economic meltdown .
“ I ’ve just been downsized myself , ” she said , and indeed , two days before , Ms. Greene had been fired after 40 years at New York .
There were gasps , tsk-tsks and not a few shaken heads among the 340 leading ladies , including Nora Ephron , Martha Stewart , Kathleen Turner and Diana Taylor .
Most were unaware that the day before , Ms. Greene had sent her own news release about the sacking , referring to herself as “ the brand name of restaurant journalism ” at New York .
But even among those who might have seen it coming , many were taken aback at the expulsion of the sensualist who influenced the way a generation of New Yorkers ate , and who served as a lusty narrator of restaurant life in New York for decades .
“ It ’s as if they removed the lions from the library steps , ” said Michael Batterberry , editor and publisher of Food Arts magazine .
Turley : Bush calling Democrats ' bluff by not pardoning torturers David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 26 , 2008
Print This Email This The White House has begun announcing the names of people who will be receiving presidential pardons , but officials who have been involved in torture are unlikely to be among them .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the Bush administration has decided that blanket pardons for those officials are unnecessary because they are protected by the Justice Department 's " torture memos . "
" You remember those memos , right ? " MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow asked on Tuesday .
" Part of the Bush administration 's unofficial game plan to ... dismiss the Geneva Conventions and other laws by using the veneer of serious legal scholarship to create an illusion that these near - death interrogation tactics ... were somehow legal . "
However , constitutional expert Jonathan Turley told Maddow , " I do n't believe that anyone seriously believes in the administration that what they did was legal .
This is not a close legal question .
Waterboarding is torture .
It has been defined as a war crime . "
Instead ,
Turley suggested that " what 's really happening here is a rather clever move at this intersection of law and politics . "
" They know that the people what want him to pardon our torture program is primarily the Democrats , it 's not the Republicans , " Turley explained .
" The Democratic leadership would love to have a pardon so they could go to their supporters and say , ' Look , there 's really nothing we could do .
...
There really can't be any indictments now . ' "
" The Bush administration is calling their bluff , " stated Turley .
" They know that the Democratic leadership will not allow criminal investigations or indictments . "
" The question is the intestinal fortitude of the Democrats to stand with the rule of law , " he continued .
" Unfortunately , we have many people who campaign on principle but they govern on politics .
And I think that we 're seeing that with the balloon they 're floating saying , ' Let 's have a commission ... like the 9/11 Commission . ' ...
Everyone in Washington knows that commission 's being proposed so that there would be no serious criminal investigation or prosecution . "
" What would need to be done , " asked Maddow , " in order to ensure that torture is clearly illegal in the United States ? "
" This has always been a crime , " replied Turley .
" It 's always been a war crime ...
The question is not whether the act is immoral , but whether moral people will stand forward and say ... ' Let 's investigate it , and if there 's crimes here , let 's prosecute . ' "
However , Turley does n't see much chance of that happening .
He concluded scathingly , " The most successful democracy in history is just about to see war crimes , do nothing about it -- and that 's an indictment not just of George Bush and his administration .
It 's an indictment of all of us if we walk away from a clear war crime and say it 's time for another commission . "

US Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke has said more government spending may be needed to combat economic weakness .
A fresh round of stimulus would be a good idea , he told the US House of Representatives budget committee .
Although Mr Bernanke stopped short of saying the US was in recession , he said the American economy was now in a " very serious slowdown " .
Hopes of a fresh economic stimulus package pleased investors , with the main Dow Jones index ending up 4.7 % .
" Consideration of a fiscal package by the Congress at this juncture seems appropriate , " said Mr Bernanke .
His comments were welcomed by Democratic leaders in Congress , who called on Republicans and the White House to work together to formulate a plan .
A White House spokesman said it would have to wait and see what Democrats , who control both halves of Congress , put forward .
' Serious consequences '
A series of crises in the housing , credit and financial sectors have badly hit the US economy .
" If the Congress proceeds with a fiscal package , it should consider including measures to help improve access to credit by consumers , home buyers , businesses and other borrowers
Ben Bernanke , Federal Reserve chairman
Many analysts are forecasting the US economy will shrink later this year and early next year .
This would meet the classic definition of a recession - which is two quarters of negative growth .
However , some economists believe the economy is already in a recession , something that Mr Bernanke more than hinted at .
" We are in a very serious slowdown in the economy which has very serious consequences for the public , " he said .
" Whether it 's called a recession or not is of no consequence . "
' Promoting growth '
In his speech before the committee , Mr Bernanke suggested that Congress should design a stimulus package so that it would be " timely and well - targeted " .
He said it should limit the longer - term impact on the government 's budget deficit , which hit a record high in the last financial year .
Any government spending would need to kick in quickly to encourage people and businesses to boost spending and help the economy during the period in which economic activity would be otherwise weak , he said .
The Federal Reserve chairman also said the package should include provisions that would aid the jammed credit markets , which has been a major factor in the economy 's slowdown .
" If the Congress proceeds with a fiscal package , it should consider including measures to help improve access to credit by consumers , home buyers , businesses and other borrowers , " he said .
" Such actions might be particularly effective at promoting economic growth and job creation , " he added .

BERNE ( Reuters ) - Switzerland ’s top two banks took emergency measures to shore up their finances on Thursday , with the state taking a near 10 percent stake in UBS while Credit Suisse raised new funds from private investors .
A clock is seen beside the logo of Swiss bank UBS at the Paradeplatz square in Zurich October 16 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Arnd Wiegmann
UBS AG UBSN .VX is getting 6 billion Swiss francs ( $ 5.3 billion ) from the government in return for a 9.3 percent stake , while Credit Suisse Group AG ( CS ) CSGN .VX said it would raise 10 billion francs from investors including Qatar .
UBS , the biggest Swiss bank , will also unload $ 60 billion of toxic assets into a new fund controlled by the central bank .
Shares in both banks fell but outperformed most other European banks as investors welcomed the latest example of the measures being taken around the world to prop up banks squeezed by the credit crunch and market turmoil .
“ The recapitalization of UBS and Credit Suisse brings a certain stabilization to the Swiss banking system , ” said ZKB analyst Claude Zehnder .
“ It definitely sends out a clear signal of security , but on the other hand it shows how serious the situation was , particularly at UBS . ”
UBS , which has been worse hit than Credit Suisse in the crisis , said its foremost need was to cut exposure to illiquid assets and the creation of the new fund had laid the foundation for a return to its normal operating business .
It said it made a third - quarter net profit of 296 million francs -- helped by its own credit and tax gains -- but withdrawals from wealth and asset management accelerated to 83.7 billion francs -- or 3 percent of total assets under management .
While Credit Suisse saw strong inflows in the quarter , it made a net loss of about 1.3 billion Swiss francs ( $ 1.2 billion ) after fresh write - downs of about 2.4 billion on risky assets .
DEPOSITOR PROTECTION
The Swiss government said it did not want to hold the UBS stake for years and would sell it to private investors as soon as possible .
In return for the capital , it will make demands on corporate governance and risk controls .
The government said it also planned to boost depositor protection -- from a current 30,000 franc guarantee -- using steps taken elsewhere in Europe as a benchmark .
The banking regulator said other banks in the country were generally sound .
“ The government has decided to tackle the systemic crisis with these ... measures to restore confidence in the financial center , ” Switzerland ’s acting finance minister , Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf , told a news conference .
Keen to support a financial sector which accounts for nearly 15 percent of Swiss output , the government said if refinancing problems emerged it would guarantee banks ’ new short - and medium - term interbank liabilities and money market transactions .
Credit Suisse welcomed the government action but said it had declined to participate “ at this time ” given its ability to raise private funds on capital markets and the fact it did not have significant troubled assets .
Credit Suisse raised about 10 billion francs -- or about 12 percent of its outstanding equity -- from investors including the Qatar Investment Authority , already a big shareholder .
Israeli holding company Koor Industries KOR .TA had said on Monday it agreed to invest 1.2 billion francs in CS in exchange for a 3 percent stake in the bank .
Saudi conglomerate Olayan also took a stake , the bank said .
The injection means Credit Suisse can immediately meet strict new Swiss capital rules set for 2013 , while UBS said it will need more time and is still talking to the regulator .

“ In contrast to UBS , it did not have to be shored up by the state ... which is a sign of certain strength in the current environment , ” analysts at ZKB said in a note .
SHARE REBOUND
Shares in both banks reversed earlier gains after U.S. markets fell again .
CS bounced just before the close to end 0.87 percent down at 45.50 francs , while UBS fell 4.93 percent to 19.09 francs and the DJ Stoxx European banking sector index .
SX7P was down 7.12 percent .
UBS said the steps should help reverse the outflow of client assets , which gained pace in the third quarter .
“ We applaud this move as it should relieve fears about further write - downs and eventually stem money outflows in its core wealth management franchise , ” analyst Pangiotis Spilopoulos at banking group Vontobel said .
UBS said its wealth management business had net outflows of 49.3 billion francs in the third quarter , while its global asset management division had outflows of 34.4 billion francs .
[ ID:nLG668061 ]
The troubled UBS investment management business made new write - downs and losses of $ 4.4 billion in the third quarter .
UBS had already made a total of $ 42 billion of write - downs on toxic assets due to the credit crisis , more than any other European bank , and is slashing thousands of jobs , but it also raised $ 30 billion of capital before the turmoil mounted .
Credit Suisse said it had attracted third - quarter net new assets of approximately 14 billion francs , but it made a pretax loss of around 3.2 billion francs from investment banking , citing “ exceptionally adverse trading conditions in September . ”
More than 17 years ago , when he was still an infant , Spencer Elden 's parents dropped him into a swimming pool in California , where underwater photographer Kirk Weddle was waiting to snap an entire roll of film of the naked , buoyant baby .
The picture was later used as the cover image for Nevermind , the second studio LP from a little rock band out of Seattle called Nirvana .
Now , 17 - year - old Elden is a high school student , who told MTV News last year that " it 's kind of creepy [ to think ] that that many people have seen me naked — I feel like I 'm the world 's biggest porn star . "
Elden recently re-created the iconic album 's cover in the same pool at the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center in Pasadena , California , where it was originally shot — only this time , he was wearing shorts .
It remains unclear as to why Elden decided to shoot this new photo .
Elden 's parents were paid just $ 200 for allowing him to be photographed back in 1991 .
But last year , Elden told us that being the Nirvana baby has its perks .
He references it when trying to pick up ladies , he said : " I have to use stupid pickup lines like , ' You want to see my p---s ... again ? ' "
But it 's also led to some strange encounters as well .
He was once invited to swim in a rather wealthy woman 's pool for the mere fact that he was the Nirvana baby .
Another time , he even met " Weird Al " Yankovic , who famously lampooned the cover on his 1992 disc , Off the Deep End .
" I ran into him when I was going to do a TV interview , " Elden said .
" He was in the hallway , and he actually signed the back of my platinum record . "
Russian troops have launched a search for militants in the volatile southern region of Ingushetia after a deadly attack on a military convoy .
Official Russian reports of the ambush , which has been blamed on local Muslim separatists , said two soldiers were killed and at least seven injured .
But other reports suggested as many as 40 Russian soldiers were killed .
The convoy came under grenade attack and machine gun fire near Nazran , capital of the north Caucasus region .
Frequent attacks
" A search of the area is currently taking place , the bandits who carried out the attack on a defence ministry military column are being tracked , " said a Russian official , quoted by Interfax news agency .
Russian news agencies reported that one armoured personnel carrier and two lorries had been damaged in the incident .
However , an Ingushetian law enforcement source quoted by Reuters said 40 soldiers were killed in the ambush .
The source said three armoured personnel carriers and two lorries were hit , and all but one of the soldiers in the convoy were killed .
If confirmed this would be the worst loss for the Russian military in a series of recent attacks on troops in Ingushetia .
The territory borders on Chechnya , where Russian forces have engaged in heavy fighting with separatist rebels in recent years .
The Ingush authorities say they are fighting a war against terrorism , and blame Islamist militants for the attacks .
Last month the Moscow Helsinki Group , a human rights organisation , said " state - sponsored terror " in Ingushetia could plunge the country into civil war .

Creating artificial support in fundamentally fractured valuations will only prolong the pain .
Better to get it all out of the way and then build from there .
The problem with this , rather simplistic view , is that in the chaos major industries can go to the wall merely to prove a point when saving them now would be less costly than rebuilding them in a few years time .
The trick is to identify which is worth saving and which is not !
Microsoft generated plenty of negative headlines in 2008 .
We watched as it struck out in its attempts to acquire Yahoo .
And Microsoft - haters grew smug when the confusing Seinfeld - Gates commercials were quickly pulled and replaced with the Im a PC campaign .
Microsofts attempts to out - market Apple and reverse the negative press of Windows Vista simply didnt work out .
Such debacles received the lions share of press .
But in reality the software giant had several successes .
Most every other iteration of Windows had a strong year , either with good execution ( Windows Server 2008 , Windows XP ) or good buzz ( Windows 7 , Windows Azure ) .
And from the ashes of the Yahoo failure emerged some smart hires for Microsoft that could boost the company 's search business and set the tone for a possible future deal with Yahoo .
Here are four areas where Microsoft executed well in 2008 , areas that will help set up the company for success in '09 .
Windows 7 Buzz
Microsoft did a good job of building anticipation for Windows 7 in 2008 , and did so without the overpromising and overhyping that weighed down Vista 's debut ( thanks to " The Wow Starts Now " campaign ) two years ago .
It 's clear the software giant has learned its lesson .
Microsoft has been forthright about Windows 7 , creating a blog that documents operating systems progress .
Microsoft also offered up demos and a pre-beta at PDC ( professional developers conference )
Developers who liked the pre-beta praised features such as the revamped task bar , Aero Peek GUI and touch - screen capability , while those more skeptical said it was just Vista with a prettier interface .
That debate will carry on in 2009 .
But despite the mounting pressure on Windows 7 , the campaign for it has been subtle so far — at least by Microsoft standards .
With all the news about Vista 's bad reputation and users downgrading to XP , Windows 7 has been pushed into the shadows a bit , which is probably fine with Microsoft as it quietly positions Windows 7 as a lean , customer - focused OS designed to handle any and all compatibility issues .
The OS is also being positioned — by pundits and the press more than Microsoft — as a savior for the ailing Vista , and many industry experts believe Windows 7 will ship in mid-2009 rather than the anticipated release of early 2010 .
It 's a lot to ask of an OS to be a panacea , but if Windows 7 is rock solid and ships in a timely fashion , it could smooth over a lot of negative perceptions about Vista&and Microsoft itself .
Hiring Yahoo Talent
If you can't buy 'em , hire 'em .
Microsoft 's failed attempts to buy all or part of Yahoo dragged on for most of 2008 .
Much of it was an embarrassment for both companies , but Microsoft 's recent hiring of Yahoo's top search talent is turning out to be a smart move .
It 's likely that the November departure of Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang opened the doors for Microsoft to start interviewing Yahoo-ites .
By early December , Microsoft had hired Yahoo search chief Qu Li to run its online services group and Yahoo search VP Sean Suchter to be the GM of Microsoft 's Silicon Valley Search Technology Center .
No two men , no matter how smart , will be able to pull Microsoft Live Search out of its distant third - place search ranking any time soon .
But losing top talent to the company trying to take you over will chip away at Yahoo 's already flimsy morale .
Also , having top search technologists like Li and Suchter on board will make for a smoother transition if Microsoft does indeed buy Yahoo's search business , an idea that Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer mentions seemingly every other week .
Windows Azure and the Move to the Cloud
Microsoft 's necessary transition to a cloud computing platform is Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie 's labor of love .
At PDC in October , Ozzie unveiled Windows Azure , an operating system that lets companies run Windows applications in the cloud and store files and data using Microsoft 's data centers .
According to Ozzie , this " Windows for the Web " will eventually facilitate all of Microsoft 's enterprise software into the cloud .
With Windows Azure , as well as Office Live and Live Mesh , Microsoft let the world know that it is building a Windows - branded Web - based environment and is not , in fact , a desktop dinosaur .
So Microsoft has stepped in the ring with cloud computing players Google ( Google App Engine ) , Amazon ( EC2 ) and IBM ( Blue Cloud utility computing platform ) , but it has n't thrown any punches yet .
Those companies have cloud computing platforms in operation with lots of customers .
So far , Microsoft has only announcements and demos .
Because Microsoft is so late to the cloud computing market , it will need to move quick in 2009 to turn Azure 's grand plan into action for enterprises .
Windows Server 2008 Gets Raves
While Windows Vista languished in 2008 , its server - side brethren Windows Server 2008 quietly flourished .
Microsoft 's server operating system , released in February , received accolades for performance , reliability and new features .
( It shares the same code base as Vista SP1 , which did much to improve Vista . )
The reviews for Windows Server 2008 were positive across the board .
In addition to having praised features such as unified scripting tool PowerShell , a Windows Firewall that enables by default and a new security technology called NAP ( Network Access Protection ) , Microsoft followed through on its promise with Windows Server 2008 to go greener with the release in June of its virtualization hypervisor , Hyper-V .
Hyper -V sets the stage for a server virtualization slugfest with VMware and Citrix in the coming year as more IT managers try to save money in a weak economy by consolidating data on fewer physical servers through virtualization .
At PDC in October , there was a pre-beta developer release of Windows Server 2008 release 2 , which will enhance the use of virtual machines , along with other features .
And for the first time since Windows 2000 , Microsoft is co-developing its Windows Server and Windows client products together .
So Windows Server 2008 R2 will be in lock step with Windows 7 .
Yep , Microsoft is getting organized , and it needs to because 2009 will be a pivotal year on all fronts for the software giant .
He said : " I do n't know how much damage it has done to other boats .
A lot of the owners are away at the moment , but it seems to have chosen my boat as its temporary home .

There are many useful Web development tools that integrate in your browser .
These in - browser tools are commonly known as add - ons or extensions .
Though add - ons and extensions are n’t just for Web development , many of them out there are designed specifically for Web developers .
In - browser tools vary greatly in the jobs they perform ; for example , some of them help you diagnose issues with CSS , HTML and JavaScript , while others evaluate the accessibility of your website .

In - browser tools vary greatly in the jobs they perform ; for example , some of them help you diagnose issues with CSS , HTML and JavaScript , while others evaluate the accessibility of your website .
In this article , we explore some of the most popular and useful in - browser Web development tools .
You ’ll find tools for popular Web browsers like Firefox and Internet Explorer .
Whether you need to debug and inspect your HTML , inspect HTTP headers , access FTP source files , evaluate accessibility or just figure out what color a Web page element is , you may find a variety of tools discussed here useful .
You might be interested in the following related posts :
Firebug
Firebug is an extension for the Mozilla Firefox browser that allows you to debug and inspect HTML , CSS , the Document Object Model ( DOM ) and JavaScript .
Though it has many strong features , it ’s most known for revolutionizing the way developers debug and profile JavaScript code .
For example , before Firebug , many developers would use the alert ( ) function to see what a variable contains or to find what line the code breaks .
With Firebug enabled , you ’re told specifically what the error is and which line it comes from .
Firebug is an excellent tool for AJAX application developers because it lets you explore and perform on - the - fly edits on the DOM to see what happens when you manipulate Web page elements after a user action .
Aside from its popular JavaScript and DOM functionalities , Firebug can also log network activity to allow you to see detailed results of HTTP connections , inspect and edit HTML on the fly and debug and visualize your CSS .

Web Developer
The Web Developer extension ( for the Firefox , Flock and SeaMonkey Web browsers ) is an add - on that adds a tool bar with a menu of options for debugging and inspecting Web pages .
It has a ton of features , my favorite being the View CSS Information option ( CSS >> View Style Information , or Control +
Shift + Y on Windows ) which makes a page element clickable and shows you CSS selectors that affect that particular page element .
It ’s helpful for exploring and understanding large CSS files and projects that you ’re unfamiliar with ( such as a new open - source content management system ) .
It has built - in options for syntax validation for popular Web services , such as W3 C ’s CSS Validator and HiSoftware ’s Web Content Accessibility Report , for your convenience .
It has many other useful features , such as disable options for CSS , JavaScript and images , to test for degradation and progressive enhancement ; a Forms menu with options for working with Web forms ; Display Div Order and Display Block
Size options to help you visualize the layout ; and so much more .
YSlow
YSlow is a Firefox extension created by Yahoo !
developers that integrates with Firebug ( therefore you need to have Firebug enabled for it to work ) .
YSlow analyzes a Web page for front - end performance and , in its simplest usage , gives you a letter grade ( A being the best and F being the poorest ) for each of the best practices for speeding up your website .
YSlow also allows you to inspect in detail things that are essential for a high - performance website .
For example , the Stats view gives you the total size of a Web page and a summary of items that are loaded when the Web page is requested ( i.e. style sheets , JavaScript files , Flash objects and images ) , so that you can hunt down the bottlenecks that cause a Web page to load slowly .
The Components view outlines every single component of a Web page in tabular format and allows you to inspect it to see attributes such as size , expiration date ( for cached files ) , whether it uses server - side compression ( Gzip ) and response time ( how long the component took to load ) .

Internet Explorer Web ( Edge ) Developer Toolbar
If you need similar functionality to that of Firebug and Web Developer for Firefox , but want to debug , inspect and tune your Web pages and applications on the Internet Explorer browser , check out the Internet Explorer Web Developer Toolbar .
The IE Web Developer Toolbar , when enabled , opens a toggle - able pane located at the bottom of the Web browser , giving you access to many helpful options for exploring Web page components .
For example , you can experiment to see how page elements work by editing the Web page ’s DOM and HTML directly in the browser , allowing you to quickly change and edit DOM elements to see what happens when you perform certain actions or modify certain parts of the code .
You can also debug , test and inspect JavaScript with the IE Web Developer Toolbar , giving you options for setting breakpoints , seeing the call stack and exploring variable attributes .
It has a ton of other helpful features , such as selectively disabling IE settings ( to see how your Web pages degrade in IE ) ; the ability to view the HTML and CSS source of any Web page with syntax - highlighting ; and an in - browser ruler to help you measure things on a Web page .
Fiddler Web Debugger
Fiddler is an Internet Explorer extension that analyzes and profiles a Web page ’s HTTP traffic .
If you ’ve ever wanted to know exactly what happens when a client requests a Web page , Fiddler is the tool that ’ll help you do the job .
The HTTP Statistics view exposes all components and files required to generate a particular page , giving you details such as the total number of HTTP requests , total page weight , HTTP response headers and cache expiration .
Fiddler permits you to set up breakpoints , allowing you to step through and edit HTTP traffic ( to see how it would affect your Web page ) , a useful feature for analyzing AJAX - based interaction and potential security flaws in a Web application .
Perhaps what makes Fiddler so powerful is its extensibility , allowing you to create your own scripts ( or import other developers ’ scripts ) to perform certain tasks or make interface modifications to the extension itself .

DebugBar
DebugBar is a debugging in - browser extension for the Internet Explorer browser .
It has many helpful features , such as the ability to send a Web page screenshot via email , a color picker , the ability to view both the original and interpreted code ( i.e. if you use JavaScript to manipulate the styles of a DOM object , then you can see the interpreted HTML source code of that manipulation ) and a Console API ( after installing Companion .
JS ) to help you gain information through a command - line interface about particular components of a Web page .
DebugBar is free for personal and educational use , but you are required to buy a license if you use it for commercial purposes .
HttpWatch
HttpWatch is another HTTP traffic viewer and debugger for Firefox and Internet Explorer that is similar to Fiddler .
It has many unique features and a more intuitive , less intimidating interface than Fiddler .
Some notable features are the ability to generate request - level time charts ( useful for documentation and presentation purposes ) ; decryption of HTTPS traffic to help you debug , inspect and tweak your secure SSL - based connections ; and the ability to export captured data to XML and CSV formats for importing into spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets .
HTTPWatch has a Basic edition , which is free , and a Professional edition , which has more options .
Check out the comparison table between the two editions to see the exact differences .
Live HTTP Headers
Live HTTP
Headers is a Firefox extension that allows you to inspect HTTP request and response headers .
Exploring HTTP headers allows you to debug Web applications , glean some information about the website ’s server and inspect cookies sent to the client requesting the page .
For example , the Server response header gives you a website ’s HTTP server type ( Apache , IIS , nginx , etc. ) , the HTTP server version and the operating system ( though server administrators can remove or limit the information you see for security purposes ) .
Web Accessibility Toolbar
The Web Accessibility Toolbar is a freeware extension for Internet Explorer and Opera that gives you a slew of options for quickly evaluating and analyzing your Web content ’s accessibility .
It has validation options for submitting your URL to content accessibility web services , a grayscale converter to simulate the user experience of individuals with color - blindness and poor eyesight , and a search function for particular page structures ( e.g. finding list objects and unordered lists ) .
Venkman is the codename for Mozilla ’s very own JavaScript debugging environment .
It is available as an add - on that can be used to extend browsers such as Firefox , Netscape , and SeaMonkey .
It is a robust environment for doing complex JavaScript debugging and troubleshooting .
The Console view gives you a command - line interface for interacting with the debugger .
It has an excellent Stack view feature that allows you to step through active functions when it reaches breakpoints .

ColorZilla
ColorZilla is an incredibly simple — but very useful — extension for Firefox .
If you ’ve ever wanted to determine what colors are used on a Web page , ColorZilla is the tool for the job .
It adds an eyedropper icon to the bottom - left corner of Firefox .
Clicking on the eyedropper icon makes objects on the Web page clickable , and upon clicking a particular section of a Web page , it outputs the hexadecimal , RGB and hue / saturation values of that area .
Before ColorZilla , you might have pasted a screen capture of a Web page into a graphics editor like Photoshop and then used the eyedropper tool in the editor to sample colors .
ColorZilla saves you time and streamlines color - sampling processes .
FireShot
FireShot is an in - browser tool for Firefox and Internet Explorer that allows you to take screenshots and then annotate , edit , organize and export them .
Screen - grabbing is a common activity for Web developers to document previews of Web application prototypes and share them with clients , and FireShot gives you a feature - packed in - browser option to manage and streamline your screenshot needs .
Web Inspector
Web Inspector is part of the Webkit open - source browser engine project .
It ’s an ultra -sleek tool for inspecting the DOM hierarchy in a separate , compact HUD - style window .
You can easily search the DOM , explore the DOM tree ( hierarchy ) and have a useful interface for isolating DOM sub - trees and nodes so that you can focus on particular sections of a Web page .
The Web Inspector also provides you with a Style pane to explore CSS rules applied to particular page elements .
FireFTP
FireFTP is a free , cross-platform Firefox extension for FTP ’ing files .
It offers several advantages to stand - alone FTP applications , such as its operating system - independent requirements .
What ’s exceptional about FireFTP is that even though it is an in - browser ( and free ! ) application , it has all the features you would expect from a standalone FTP application , such as support for secure ( SSL , TLS , SFTP ) protocols , a synchronization feature to sync up local and remote files , and directory comparison to help you see what files are missing or different between two directories and much more .
What ’s your favorite in - browser tool ?
There is an overwhelming amount of in - browser tools for Web development out there .
Some are specific to particular
Web technologies and set -ups ( such as FirePHP for PHP developers , SQLite Manager for developers using SQLite databases .
If your favorite tool is n’t on the list , let us know in the comments section why it ’s your favorite and why we should check it out .

Science reporter , BBC News
Jules Verne 's re-entry mass is about six tonnes lighter than at launch Europe 's biggest , most sophisticated spaceship is about to bring its six - month mission to an end by plunging into the Pacific in a ball of flames .
The " Jules Verne " freighter undocked from the space station three weeks ago packed with rubbish and will take its unwanted cargo into a destructive dive .
Most of the vehicle is expected to burn up in the atmosphere ; only fragments will make it down to the ocean water .
Two engine firings should bring the ship out of the sky on Monday .
Events will be overseen from the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) freighter control centre in Toulouse , France .
Mike Steinkopf , the mission director for re-entry , says a " safety zone " has been drawn in the south Pacific some 2,700 km long by 200 km wide .
We will see what appears to be a very bright meteor
Jason Hatton
Esa -Nasa re-entry observing team " We issue a notification to the air traffic and maritime authorities to make sure there are no planes or boats going through that zone during our re-entry time , " he told BBC News .
Astronauts on the overflying International Space Station ( ISS ) and scientists in two chase planes will take pictures as the disintegrating mass of metal streaks through the morning Pacific darkness .
" Visually , we will see what appears to be a very bright meteor , " explained Jason Hatton from the chase team set by Esa and the US space agency ( Nasa ) .
" It will start as a point of light with a trail , and then as it comes apart , we will see fragments . "
Jules Verne - also known by the generic name Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) - cost about 1.3bn euros to develop .
Although Esa has produced many complex scientific satellites , none match the scale of the freighter .
After launch , the space truck can work out where it needs to go in space , and then makes a fully automatic docking once it arrives at its destination .
JULES VERNE - THE FIRSTS
The ATV is the first completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the ISS The ATV is the largest and most powerful space tug going to the ISS over its mission life
It provides the largest refuelling and waste elimination capability for the space station
It is the only vehicle on the current timeline able to de-orbit the ISS when it is retired
Berlin unveils ' crewed spaceship '
Manned spaceship design unveiled Key moment for Europe
It was developed as part of Esa 's ISS membership agreement , to haul cargo , propellant , water and oxygen to the space station ; and also to provide propulsion capacity at the station .
But such has been the performance of Jules Verne that Esa officials and industry chiefs are already talking about upgrading the ship 's design - potentially to carry astronauts .
The first step , however , would be to develop technologies that enable the safe return of cargo to Earth .
European space ministers will discuss the issue at their meeting in The Hague in November .
Jules Verne is currently orbiting the Earth just below the space station at an altitude of about 330 km .
Taking the freighter out of the sky involves turning it to face the direction of flight so that its rear engines are then facing forward and can be fired to slow the ship 's velocity .
The first burn , which will be initiated at about 1000 GMT and last roughly six minutes , will put the 13.5 - tonne spacecraft on a sharp elliptical orbit .
Cost : Total bill was 1.3bn euros ( at least 4 more ATVs will be built )
Total cargo capacity : 7.6 tonnes , but first mission flew lighter Mass at launch : About 20 tonnes depending on cargo manifest Dimensions : 10.3 m long and 4.5 m wide - the size of a large bus Solar panels :
Once unfolded , the solar wings span 22.3 m
Engine power : 4 x 490 - Newton thrusters ; and 28 x 220N thrusters Mission timeline : Launch - 9 March ; Docking - 3 April ;
Undocking - 5 September ; De-orbit - 29 September
Mission Guide : Jules Verne
Approximately two hours later , the engines will be fired again , this time for some 15 minutes .
This should take the ATV on its final trajectory and a steep dive towards the Pacific .
The freighter is expected to be moving at some 7.6 km / s as it meets significant atmosphere at 120 km .
As the plunge continues and temperatures rise , Jules Verne will be torn part .
" We expect the solar panels to break just two - and - a - half - minutes after the entry into the atmosphere ; and then we will have fragmentation of the docking adaptor , protective shields and other structural elements , " explained Mr Steinkopf .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" Nevertheless , statistically speaking , there will be about 30 % of the overall vehicle that may reach the ocean , but only in bits and pieces . "
The final moments will be witnessed in the Pacific by two chase planes .
The jets , a Gulfstream - V and a DC8 , will carry an observation team equipped with a range of spectroscopic imagers and conventional video and stills cameras .
The team wants to establish in detail how the different components of Jules Verne , such as its fuel tanks , come apart .
The information will inform the computer models used by space agencies to plan the safe re-entries of future spacecraft .
" We expect to see signatures associated with the fuel in the wake of the vehicle because you have this trail behind it , " Mr Hatton told BBC News from the team 's campaign base in Tahiti .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" That 's where the spectroscopy comes in .
You have a range of different spectrographs all the way from the near - ultraviolet , through the visible to the near - infra-red .
In the different colours , we 'll probably see what materials are being released from the vehicle , maybe what some of the fragments are - aluminium , for example . "
Under the agreement Esa has with its international partners , at least four more ATVs will be flown to the space station in the coming years .
The next is due to launch in 2010 .
And , ultimately , it is likely that an ATV will be tasked with destroying the space station when the partners have decided the platform is beyond servicing , perhaps towards the end of the next decade .
A freighter will be commanded to drive the whole structure into a similar region of the south Pacific .

Pic - a - Pix Tutorial and Walkthroughs : A beginner ’s guide to solving picture logic puzzles
New to this website ?
If you enjoy playing brain games online , do n't forget to check our huge selection of free puzzles .
I came across my first Pic - a - Pix type puzzle in an annual of mixed puzzles .
A logic puzzle that formed images on completion was something very different and instantly appealing .
A search on the internet resulted in an abundance of puzzles to print out and solve , but it soon became apparent that I was n’t very good ; the pile of uncompleted puzzles got much larger than the completed pile .
I then discovered a monthly magazine devoted to these puzzles .
Some puzzles in it were huge , 25x25 and 30x30 - way beyond my skills .
Nevertheless , a few days later there were 15 back issues in my lap .
The puzzles in those magazines were Conceptis’ Pic - a - Pixs .
I visited the Conceptis website where there were tips and strategies , discovered the teachings of forum member and moderator of the Puzzle Support forum DaveHutch , the Pic - a - Pix Guru in my opinion , and have n’t looked back since .
As my skills improved , I moved on to larger puzzles .
The Laughing Cavalier , weighing in at a hefty 110x160 , is my first Mega Pic - a - Pix with Color and ultimate achievement to date .
The birth of the Tutorial
With a wealth of assistance available on the Conceptis site , why did I decide to create a tutorial ?
A better understanding of Pic - a - Pix drove the addiction to giddy heights and I wanted to introduce as many people as I could to them .
Numerous attempts to explain the puzzles to work colleagues and family were met with crossed eyes , rapid retreats , groans and fidgeting .
Those people were just being polite , however .
Only my closest friends could say things like “ You ca n’t explain your way out of a paper bag ” and “ Hey , I ’m falling asleep , here ” and “ Get to the point - you ’re rambling all round the houses ” .
I was mortified .
Said friends , taking pity on me , suggested I give them “ carefully thought out ” instructions in writing .
What an idea !
I put a few pages together , decided I was having fun , and tinkered around with it .
When it got to the stage where I thought it was OK to pass around , I began to fret that my written instructions might be as bad as my verbal inelegance .
I turned to the Conceptis forum for assistance .

Admit it — even if your desk could be the cover shot for Organized Worker Monthly , your data is all over the place .
Between desktop apps , online networks , and webapp tools , it 's easy to lose track of data and duplicate tasks , simply because it 's not all accessible , or it takes too much of your time to keep it all synced up and together .
Conduit , an in - development program for the Linux desktop , makes it simple to link your web data , desktop files , and other information all together , then synchronize them all with a single click .
Follow along as we check out how Conduit works , peek at its potential , and try out a few examples ( and solicit your own clever ideas ) .
Advertisement
Getting started
If your Linux system 's app - installing repository has a copy of Conduit that 's at least at version 0.3.12 , go ahead and install that .
Otherwise , follow the links at the Conduit project page to add Conduit 's PPA to your third - party sources , or grab a source package .
Advertisement
Conduit 's interface is meant to make data - syncing simple , and , for the most part , it does .
Simply drag and drop icons that represent your data in the " cloud " ( Flickr photos , YouTube Videos , Box. net backups , etc. ) or your actual , physical stuff ( files , folders , iPods , data apps ) into the " canvas , " and start making connections .
Add the " sources " of your data first , followed by all the points that will receive it .
Right - click on any item in your chain to configure it , whether that means pointing to specific folders or logging into your Flickr , Box.net , or Facebook accounts from pop -up windows .
Here 's a look at all the syncing tools you can play with in Conduit :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Once you 've put a few of those items together , right - click on the " group " itself ( the gray box surrounding the items ) to change the syncing options .
You can set up two - way sync between items that support it , a " slow sync " to free up your bandwidth , and a persistent " Always up to date " mode .
You can also pre-set ways to deal with files already found , deleted on one side but not the other , and whether it should even bother looking at file creation dates to determine what 's " new " ( good for those of us who have made a few less - than - successful backup attempts ) .

Not every point on your data chain is fully two - way , unfortunately .
I would 've really liked to have created a Mega - Omni-RSS Feed for all my social networking updates ; for now , I 'll have to stick with Gina 's Yahoo Pipes method .
There are three basic data types in Conduit , distinguished by the little blue arrows on their icons :
Advertisement
One - way sources :
You can only pull data from these items .
Includes RSS feeds and music / playlist data from the Rhythmbox and Banshee music managers .
Advertisement
One - way syncs :
You can drop data into these places .
Backpack Notes , Facebook , and ( disappointingly ) Google Documents included .
Advertisement
Two - way items :
The good stuff .
Most web apps ( Google Calendar & Contacts , Flickr , Box.net ) support this , and if you 're an Evolution user , your office gets a lot bigger .
Advertisement
The big drawback to Conduit , at the moment , is a lack of automatic , background synchronization .
The GUI version can keep an icon in the system tray with a " Synchronize now " option , but the real work - around is Conduit 's command line functionality .
Enter this into a console :
conduit - client -h
You 'll get a feel for the command line options you can plug into your preferred scheduling app , or you can just set Conduit to auto - start without showing its GUI .

Great uses for Conduit
Conduit is far from a finished product , but it already allows some pretty nifty and simple backup and synchronization hacks .
Here 's a few I was able to pull off fairly easily :
LSync Calendars , Contacts , and Notes with iPod / PDA
If a Linux system can detect and mount your iPod , Palm , or other data organizer , Conduit can sync up your calendars , contacts , and notes with it , wherever you have them stored — Google , Evolution , your Backpack notes , or even downloaded files .
Simply plug in your device and hook up its separate calendar / contact / note items with your data .
Advertisement
Share once , publish across sites
Conduit works exceedingly smoothly with online photo sites , and its " Always up to date " feature means you can create a " Magic Folder " — drop a photo in it , and it gets picked up and sent out to all the sites you 'd normally publish to .
Advertisement
YouTube / Podcast subscriptions made easy
Whatever you listen to your podcasts or watch videos with , Conduit can automatically grab the newest additions to a YouTube channel or podcast stream and drop them in a folder ( or your Box .
net space , your USB drive , iPod — you get the idea ) .
Advertisement
Simple folder sync / backup
The hardcore backup addicts will swear by using rsync to mirror files on any system , but Conduit makes what you 're doing understandable and simple .
Create a two - way sync to have any files on a USB drive auto - magically synced to a folder when plugged in .
Back up and restore your files to a Box .
net space , a web or FTP server , external hard drive , or anywhere else you can normally connect from your Linux system .

Your ideas
There 's a lot of tools sitting in Conduit 's left - hand pane , just waiting for you and your clever ideas to tweak into seriously cool uses .
With the prevalence of RSS feeds generated from web apps , there are bound to be at least a few great work - arounds , useful filters , and other connections to be made .
So , let 's hear it — What syncing ideas can you put into action with Conduit ?
What feature would you need to see installed for Total Data Awareness ?
Share it all in the comments — I 'll update the post with some of the best sync chains as they roll in .

Clinton , Republicans agree to deregulation of US financial system
By Martin McLaughlin
1 November 1999
An agreement between the Clinton administration and congressional Republicans , reached during all - night negotiations which concluded in the early hours of October 22 , sets the stage for passage of the most sweeping banking deregulation bill in American history , lifting virtually all restraints on the operation of the giant monopolies which dominate the financial system .
The proposed Financial Services Modernization
Act of 1999 would do away with restrictions on the integration of banking , insurance and stock trading imposed by the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 , one of the central pillars of Roosevelt 's New Deal .
Under the old law , banks , brokerages and insurance companies were effectively barred from entering each others ' industries , and investment banking and commercial banking were separated .
The certain result of repeal of Glass - Steagall will be a wave of mergers surpassing even the colossal combinations of the past several years .
The Wall Street Journal wrote , " With the stroke of the president 's pen , investment firms like Merrill Lynch & Co. and banks like Bank of America Corp. , are expected to be on the prowl for acquisitions . "
The financial press predicted that the most likely mergers would come from big banks acquiring insurance companies , with John Hancock , Prudential and The Hartford all expected to be targeted .
Kenneth Guenther , executive vice president of Independent Community Bankers of America , an association of small rural banks which opposed the bill , warned , " This is going to begin a wave of major mergers and acquisitions in the financial - services industry .
We 're moving to an oligopolistic situation . "
One such merger was already carried out well before the passage of the legislation , the $ 72 billion deal which brought together Citibank , the biggest New York bank , and Travelers Group Inc. , the huge insurance and financial services conglomerate , which owns Salomon Smith Barney , a major brokerage .
That merger was negotiated despite the fact that the merged company , Citigroup , was in violation of the Glass - Steagall Act , because billionaire Travelers boss Sanford Weill and Citibank CEO John Reed were confident of bipartisan support for repeal of the 60 - year - old law .
They had good reason , to be sure .
The banking , insurance and brokerage industry lobbyists have combined their forces over the last five years to mount the best - financed campaign of influence - buying ever seen in Washington .
In 1997 and 1998 alone , the three industries spent over $ 300 million on the effort : $ 58 million in campaign contributions to Democratic and Republican candidates , $ 87 million in " soft money " contributions to the Democratic and Republican parties , and $ 163 million on lobbying of elected officials .
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , Texas Republican Phil Gramm , himself collected more than $ 1.5 million in cash from the three industries during the last five years : $ 496,610 from the insurance industry , $ 760,404 from the securities industry and $ 407,956 from banks .
During the final hours of negotiations between the House - Senate conference committee and White House and Treasury officials , dozens of well - heeled lobbyists crowded the corridors outside the room where the final deal - making was going on .
Edward Yingling , chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association , told the New York Times , " If I had to guess , I would say it 's probably the most heavily lobbied , most expensive issue " in a generation .
While Democratic and Republican congressmen and industry lobbyists claimed that deregulation would spark competition and improve services to consumers , the same claims have proven bogus in the case of telecommunications , airlines and other industries freed from federal regulations .
Consumer groups noted that since the passage of a 1994 banking deregulation bill which permitted bank holding companies to operate in more than one state , both checking fees and ATM fees have risen sharply .
Differing versions of financial services deregulation passed the House and Senate earlier this year , and the conference committee was called to work out a consensus bill and avert a White House veto .
The principal bone of contention in the last few days before the agreement had nothing to do with the central thrust of the bill , on which there was near - unanimous bipartisan support .
The sticking point was the effort by Gramm to gut the Community Reinvestment Act , a 1977 anti-redlining law which requires that banks make a certain proportion of their loans in minority and poor neighborhoods .
Gramm blocked passage of a similar deregulation bill last year over demands to cripple the CRA , and bank lobbyists were in a panic , during the week before the deal was made , that the dispute would once again prevent any bill from being adopted .
Gramm and other extreme - right Republicans saw the opportunity to damage their political opponents among minority businessmen and community groups , who generally support the Democratic Party .
Gramm succeeded in inserting two provisions to weaken the CRA , one reducing the frequency of examinations for CRA compliance to once every five years for smaller banks , the other compelling public disclosure of loans made under the program .
The latter provision was particularly offensive to black and other minority business and community groups , who have used the CRA provisions as a lever by threatening to challenge mergers and other bank operations which require government approval .
In most such cases , the banks have offered loans to businessmen or outright grants to community groups in return for dropping their legal actions .
These petty - bourgeois elements have been able to posture as defenders of the black or Hispanic community , while pocketing what are essentially payoffs from finance capital and concealing from the public the details of this relationship .
The banks and other financial institutions did not themselves oppose continuation of the CRA , which they have treated as nothing more than a cost of doing a highly profitable business in minority areas .
Loans tied to the CRA average a 20 percent rate of return .
Financial industry lobbyists complained that they were being caught in a crossfire between the Republicans and Democrats which was unrelated to the main purpose of the bill .
The Clinton White House threatened to veto the bill if CRA provisions were substantially weakened , in response to heavy pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus and the Reverend Jesse Jackson , whose Operation PUSH has made extensive use of CRA in its campaigns to pressure corporations and banks for more opportunities for black businessmen .
But eventually the White House caved in to Gramm , accepting his amendments so long as the program remained formally in place .
The White House similarly retreated on pledges that consumer privacy would be protected in the legislation .
Consumer groups pointed to the potential for abuse of financial information once giant conglomerates were created which would handle loans , investments and insurance at the same time .
For example : a bank could refuse to give a 30 - year mortgage to a customer whose medical records , filed with the bank 's insurance subsidiary , revealed a fatal disease .
The final draft of the bill contains a consumer privacy protection clause , but it is extremely weak , applying only to the transfer of information outside of a financial conglomerate , not within it .
Thus Citigroup will be able to pass on financial information about its bank depositors to Travelers Insurance , but not to an outside company like Prudential .
Even that limitation would be breached if there was a contractual relationship with the outside company , as in the case of a telemarketer which did work for Citigroup and was given private information about Citigroup depositors to aid in its telephone solicitations .
The proposed deregulation will increase the degree of monopolization in finance and worsen the position of consumers in relation to creditors .
Even more significant is its impact on the overall stability of US and world capitalism .
The bill ties the banking system and the insurance industry even more directly to the volatile US stock market , virtually guaranteeing that any significant plunge on Wall Street will have an immediate and catastrophic impact throughout the US financial system .
The Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 , which the deregulation bill would repeal , was not adopted to protect consumers , although one of its most celebrated provisions was the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which guarantees bank deposits of up to $ 100,000 .
The law was enacted during the first 100 days of the Roosevelt administration to rescue a banking system which had collapsed , wiping out the life savings of millions of working people , and threatening to bring the profit system to a complete standstill .
As a recent history of that era notes : " The more than five thousand bank failures between the Crash and the New Deal 's rescue operation in March 1933 wiped out some $ 7 billion in depositors ' money .
Accelerating foreclosures on defaulted home mortgagesâ 150,000 homeowners lost their property in 1930 , 200,000 in 1931 , 250,000 in 1932â stripped millions of people of both shelter and life savings at a single stroke and menaced the balance sheets of thousands of surviving banks " ( David Kennedy , Freedom from Fear , Oxford University Press , 1999 , pp. 162-63 ) .
The separation of banking and the stock exchange was ordered in response to revelations of the gross corruption and manipulation of the market by giant banking houses , above all the House of Morgan , which organized huge corporate mergers for its own profit and awarded preferential access to share issues to favored politicians and businessmen .
Such insider trading played a major role in the speculative boom which preceded the 1929 crash .
Over the past 20 years the restrictions imposed by Glass - Steagall have been gradually relaxed under pressure from the banks , which sought more profitable outlets for their capital , especially in the booming stock market , and which complained that foreign competitors suffered no such limitations to their financial operations .
In 1990 the Federal Reserve Board first permitted a bank ( J.P. Morgan ) to sell stock through a subsidiary , although stock market operations were limited to 10 percent of the company 's total revenue .
In 1996 this ceiling was lifted to 25 percent .
Now it will be abolished .
The Wall Street Journal celebrated the agreement to end such restrictions with an editorial declaring that the banks had been unfairly scapegoated for the Great Depression .
The headline of one Journal article detailing the impact of the proposed law declared , " Finally , 1929 Begins to Fade . "
This comment underscores the greatest irony in the banking deregulation bill .
Legislation first adopted to save American capitalism from the consequences of the 1929 Wall Street Crash is being abolished just at the point where the conditions are emerging for an even greater speculative financial collapse .
The enormous volatility in the stock exchange in recent months has been accompanied by repeated warnings that stocks are grossly overvalued , with some computer and Internet stocks selling at prices 100 times earnings or even greater .
And there is a much more recent experience than 1929 to serve as a cautionary tale .
A financial deregulation bill was passed in the early 1980s under the Reagan administration , lifting many restrictions on the activities of savings and loan associations , which had previously been limited primarily to the home - loan market .
The result was an orgy of speculation , profiteering and outright plundering of assets , culminating in collapse and the biggest financial bailout in US history , costing the federal government more than $ 500 billion .
The repetition of such events in the much larger banking and securities markets would be beyond the scope of any federal bailout .

Agriculture yet to feel sting of bee decline
A decline in bees and other insect populations is yet to impact on global crop yields , according to an international study .
But in the latest edition of Current Biology , researchers warn an increasing reliance on crops that need pollination could lead to future problems .
Co-author Dr Saul Cunningham , of CSIRO Entomology , says the research was prompted by increasingly alarmist views about food availability in the face of declines in insect pollinator populations .
Research into the reliance on bee pollination for global crop production , estimates about one in three mouthfuls of food comes from insect - pollinated crops .
Cunningham says the loss of bees and other insect pollinators is due , among other things , to a combination of disease , reduction in native vegetation and use of insecticides .
In particular managed honeybees , which are used by farmers to pollinate large tracts of monocrops , have been decimated by disease in the form of the varroa mite and colony collapse disorder .
During the 2006 - 07 northern hemisphere winter , a quarter of US beekeepers lost more than half of their hives .
Cunningham says the research team , which included scientists in Australia , Argentina , Germany and the US , looked at global crop yields during the past 45 years to determine whether the loss of pollinators was affecting the global food supply .
Dependence rating
They rated crops on how much they depended on pollinators for maximum production .
This ranged from zero for crops such as wheat that are pollinated by the wind to 100 % for crops such as almond trees that will not produce nuts without pollination .
He says they were surprised to find crop yields in the 45 - year period had grown consistently by about 1.5 % a year due to improvements in agriculture .
More importantly however there was " little evidence of difference in relative yield between pollinator dependent and non-dependent crops " .
Cunningham says if global crop yields were being affected by the pollinator shortages they would have expected pollinator - dependent crops to show reduced yield during the past few years .
He says the study highlighted a surprising trend toward more reliance on pollination - dependent crops such as canola and soybean , particularly in developing countries .
In 1961 pollinator - dependent crops contributed 13.7 % to total agriculture production in the developing world , he says .
By 2006 the figure had risen to 22.6 % .
" This trend might be further exacerbated in the future as some fast - expanding , insect - pollinated crops , such as oil palm and canola , are candidates for large - scale biofuel production , " the paper says .
Cunningham says this suggests strategies need to be thought through to ensure a supply of pollinators to meet this demand .
" Let 's not panic ; we 're not going to starve .
Crop production is increasing and we are getting better and better at agriculture , " he says .
" At the same time we do n't want to assume there is no problem .
There is no decrease in yields yet but the increase in demand for pollinators sets up the possibility of shortages in the future . "
I ’ve been doing a little PHP work and enjoying it ; I like PHP 5.x much better than earlier versions .
My PHP development setup is based on Eclipse and the PHP Developer Tools project , or PDT , and one thing I noticed when I set this up is that it is awkward to use PDT with Eclipse 3.4 , or Ganymede .
I ran into problems again when I updated my Ganymede Eclipse to the latest releases , this time on Windows as it happens .
PDT stopped working , and I had to download a newer “ integration build ” of PDT as well as an update to the Eclipse Dynamic Languages Toolkit ( DLTK ) , using a manual download and import process instead of the built - in Eclipse online update .
I also had to remove the Ruby Development Tools as these relied on an earlier version of the DLTK ; there might be a way round this but my priority was to get PDT working .
I ’m getting this pain because I want to use PDT 2.0 and Eclipse3.4 , instead of the older PDT 1.0.3 which has an all - in - one download based on Eclipse 3.3 .
“ All - in - one ” means that you download a bundle which includes both Eclipse and PDT , and treat it as a separate standalone IDE .
The question though : why was n’t the PDT properly integrated with Ganymede , which brings together multiple Eclipse projects with the promise that they will all work together ?
I looked in the Eclipse PDT newsgroup and found some discussion on the subject .
Apparently the PDT team felt it was just too difficult to manage the dependencies .
More depressing is that apparently the team feels the same way about Galileo , the follow - up to Ganymede expected in June 2009 .
It means that the PDT stays outside the mainstream of Eclipse projects , reducing its visibility .
Conspiracy theorists might surmise that major PDT contributors like Zend , which has its own commercial IDE called Zend Studio which uses both Eclipse and PDT , might enjoy keeping the free version low - profile .
That ( or some other reason ) might also explain why Zend Studio uses a 1.x version of PDT along with Eclipse 3.4 , which is not meant to work .
It turns out that Zend Studio uses PDT 1.0.5 , whereas the latest public download ( unless you go directly to the source ) is 1.0.3 .
If 1.05 works fine with Eclipse 3.4 , why is n’t the public all - in - one based on this combination ?
I like the PDT , and my patched together Ganymede + PDT 2.x works very well .
Debugging seems more stable since I updated it .
Personally I ’d like to see PDT get more prominence within the Eclipse community , and for it to be packaged as part of Galileo rather than being left on the sidelines .
“ I 'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today ” .
— J. Wellington Wimpy
If you are old enough to remember the Popeye cartoons , you will remember Wimpy and his promise to pay at a later date for a hamburger today .
As Congress listens to the latest pleas for $ 25 billion from GM ( GM ) , Ford ( F ) , and Chrysler , I can't help but think of Wimpy 's promise .
The entire $ 700 billion bailout ( plus the $ 150 billion of pork used to buy votes ) is based on the Wimpy motto .
Give me what I want today and I 'll pay you at some future uncertain date .
This has become the motto of government , corporate America , and consumer America .
The most amusing part of CEOs begging Congressmen for $ 25 billion is the assumption that there is $ 25 billion to give .
The United States has no money .
We are broke .
There is no money – nada , zero , zilch .
We have already spent $ 10.6 trillion more than we have .
That is a lot of hamburgers .
Next Tuesday is almost here .
We have committed $ 1 trillion more than we have for the next year .
We have committed $ 53 trillion based on promises already in the pipeline .
Uncle Sam , the personification of America , may need to step aside for the new personification of America , Wimpy .
Citigroup has overshadowed the automaker 's “ miniscule ” request of $ 25 billion with today 's taxpayer bailout of over $ 300 billion .
Over the weekend , when the Fed & Treasury do their best work , Vikram “ Wimpy ” Pandit asked Ben “ Popeye ” Bernanke for $ 300 billion , and promised that his worthless derivatives would be worth something next Tuesday .
Somewhere , Charlie Prince is still dancing .
TARP – I Thought Turkeys Could Fly
“ As God is my witness , I thought turkeys could fly !!! ” — Arthur Carlson , WKRP in Cincinnati
It 's a helicopter , and it 's coming this way .
It 's flying something behind it , I can't quite make it out , it 's a large banner and it says , uh – Happy … Thaaaaanksss … giving ! …
From … W … K … R… P !!
No parachutes yet .
Ca n't be skydivers …
I can't tell just yet what they are , but – Oh my God , Johnny , they 're turkeys !!
Johnny , can you get this ?
Oh , they 're plunging to the earth right in front of our eyes !
One just went through the windshield of a parked car !
Oh , the humanity !
The turkeys are hitting the ground like sacks of wet cement !
Not since the Hindenburg tragedy has there been anything like this !
– Les Nessman , WKRP in Cincinnati
Arthur Carlson was the clueless moron station manager of WKRP in Cincinnati , a sitcom from the late 1970's .
His idea for a Thanksgiving promotion was based on his belief that turkeys could fly .
Hank Paulson is the Arthur Carlson of our generation .
Instead of dropping turkeys from a helicopter , he has dropped $ 179 billion .
It had the same impact .
The billions have hit the ground like sacks of wet cement .
The $ 179 billion has been distributed as detailed in the following chart .
The first $ 125 billion was forced on the nine largest financial institutions by Paulson on October 28 .
Since that forced feeding , 21 other financial institutions have applied for and received an additional $ 34 billion from the $ 700 billion trough .
AIG is a bottomless pit that has sucked $ 40 billion more into its vortex .
Every company in America is trying to figure out how to get a piece of the action .
American Express ( AXP ) and GMAC ( GMA ) are converting to banks so they can get bailed out by taxpayers for loaning money to people who could n't repay them .
GMAC generated all of GM 's false demand over the last 5 years by providing financing to anyone who could generate fog on a mirror and sign an X on a loan document .
By any reasonable assessment , the Troubled Asset Relief Program has been a miserable failure and a complete waste of taxpayer money .
The basis used to ram the bill through Congress was the purchase of the toxic assets off of bank 's books .
Not one dollar has been used for this purpose .
The main purpose for passing the $ 700 billion bailout was to restore confidence in the markets .
Let 's assess the success of this effort :
On October 3 when the TARP was signed into law , the S&P 500 was at 1,114 .
Today , it is 800 .
The 28 % decline in the markets in five weeks does n't show tremendous confidence in Paulson 's acts .
Paulson 's changing course every few days has shown the world that he is winging it .
He has floundered from buying toxic assets to jamming capital down the throats of banks to his current plan to support consumer debt .
Was Paulson lying to Congress about buying toxic assets all along ?
Do n't worry , he believes he is smarter than everyone in America because he ran Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and created the toxic instruments that are bringing down the financial system .
He has a Harvard MBA , you know .
Sugar Daddy Paulson has handed out $ 310 billion of the initial $ 350 billion tranche .
He would have to go back to Congress for the 2nd $ 350 billion tranche .
Congress was supposed to create a five - member congressional oversight panel , but has n't .
The White House was supposed to nominate , and the Senate was supposed to confirm , a special inspector general to audit and investigate where the funds are going .
After six weeks , President Bush has n't made a nomination .
It is only $ 310 billion of taxpayer money , what 's the hurry anyway .
I 'm sure these banks will use the money responsibly at exotic resorts , flying private jets , paying well deserved bonuses , and getting massages to relieve their stress .
Poorly run automakers ( GM , Ford , Chrysler ) , poorly run cities ( Atlanta , Philadelphia , Detroit , and Phoenix ) , and poorly run states ( California ) are begging for a piece of the taxpayer pie .
The banks who have received the $ 179 billion have not made any loans with the money .
Some are using the money to buy other banks .
Their goal is to become too big to fail .
Others , like Citigroup , have used the money to buy back bad assets from SIVs they created to mislead investors .
They were on the verge of bankruptcy and have sidled up for another $ 20 billion a week after their CEO proclaimed their strength .
Michael Lewis , author of the classic Liars Poker , in a letter to Hank Paulson last week captures the absurdity of the TARP .
As much as I admire all of your decisions I can't help but notice that the main qualification of the bankers to whom you have been giving money , so that they might make smart loans , is that they have gone almost bankrupt by making stupid loans .
As your mind is subtle , I can only assume that you secretly believe that the American economy right now needs not smart loans , but more stupid ones — and thus that you have targeted the bankers who have proven they can make them .
I , unfortunately , have not flirted with bankruptcy , or made any stupid loans .
But here 's my point : I have n't been given the chance !
Allow me to prove my financial ineptitude to you .
I swear to you that when I return for my second round of assistance I will have proven myself fully qualified to receive it .
By giving money to bankers who have made many stupid loans you have made life harder for bankers who have never made stupid loans .
By aiding the dumb banks you prevent the smart ones from replacing them .
It may be that just now smart bankers are the last thing we need — but one day they may come in handy , and so we should do what we can to keep them from getting discouraged .
Hank has indicated that he is done dropping turkeys from the helicopter .
He is counting the days until January 20 , so he can get out of town and relax with the $ 700 million fortune that has probably been invested in Treasury bills for the last 2 years .
At least he 'll enjoy a comfortable retirement – many Americans will not .
Federal Reserve Gone Wild – Helicopter Ben To The Rescue
As of May 15 , 2008 the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States had $ 881 billion of assets , $ 840 billion of liabilities , leaving $ 41 billion of capital .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has fired up the printing presses and helicopters since then .
Ben has created the Term Auction Facility , Term Securities Lending Facility , Primary Dealer Credit Facility , Commercial Paper Funding Facility , and Money Market Investor Funding Facility , among others in the last eight months .
He also started paying interest to banks on reserves .
The goal of unfreezing the system has been a wretched failure .
Banks are finding it easier and safer to borrow from the Federal Reserve , earn interest on their TARP capital , and not make any loans .
All of the facilities and programs are a crutch that encourages banks to do no business .
Why would a rational banker make loans to businesses and consumers as we are entering the deepest recession since the 1930's ?
This is where our country and government have become warped and dysfunctional .
The Government is now encouraging reckless lending as the solution to previous reckless lending .
In the space of two months , Ben Bernanke has doubled the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve .
He is accepting bubble gum wrappers , old shoes , and Dick Cheney 's defaced copy of the Constitution as collateral for loans from the Fed .
When Paulson and Bernanke were selling their rescue plan in front of Congress in September , they stressed transparency , oversight and openness .
The total lack of transparency and oversight were the reason that our financial system came to a grinding halt .
Without transparency , no bank trusts any other bank .
The black box aspects of derivatives have eliminated trust in the system .
So , what does Bernanke do but withhold the names of all financial institutions that have borrowed from the Fed and will not reveal the collateral that they have put up for those loans .
The Fed has lent $ 2.2 trillion to banks in the last few months .
The Fed has refused to reveal any information regarding these loans .
Bloomberg News has sued the Fed under the Freedom of Information Act to force them to reveal where $ 2.2 trillion of taxpayer money has gone .
The Bloomberg lawsuit argues that the collateral lists “ are central to understanding and assessing the government 's response to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the Great Depression . ''
Investment Manager Ted Forstmann was correct when he said , “ It 's your money ; it 's not the Fed 's money .
Of course there should be transparency . ”
Contrast openness and transparency with the words of Ben Bernanke and Barney ( does n't he look like Wimpy ? )
Frank .
Some have asked us to reveal the names of the banks that are borrowing , how much they are borrowing , what collateral they are posting .
We think that 's counterproductive .
First , the success of this depends on banks being willing to come and borrow when they need short - term cash .
There is a concern that if the name is put in the newspaper that such - and - such bank came to the Fed to borrow overnight for a perfectly good reason , that others might begin to worry is this bank creditworthy and that might create a stigma , a problem , and might cause banks to be unwilling to borrow , and that would be counterproductive .
– Ben Bernanke in front of House Financial Services Committee
My local paper lists the people who were arrested for DUI on a weekly basis .
The idea is that if you know that your neighbors will see this , you will not drink and drive .
Ben is encouraging banks to drink and drive .
“ I talked to Geithner and he was pretty sure that they 're OK …
If the risk is that the Fed takes a little bit of a haircut , well that 's regrettable . ''
Such losses would be acceptable , if the program helps revive the economy .
Frank said the Fed should n't reveal the assets it holds or how it values them because of “ delicacy with respect to pricing . ''
He said such disclosure would “ give people clues to what your pricing is and what they might be able to sell us and what your estimates are . ''
He would n't say why he thought that information would be problematic .
– Barney Frank , according to Bloomberg 11/21/08
How does complete secrecy restore confidence in the system ?
I sure feel secure with Barney Frank leading Congress on all financial issues .
I wonder what a Washington insider like Frank 's definition of “ a little bit of a haircut ” amounts to .
A 5 % haircut on $ 2 trillion would be a mere $ 100 billion .
Chump change in Washington .
Negative Wealth Affect
As the bureaucrats , professional lifetime politicians , corporate lobbyists , and media spin artists figure out how to waste our tax dollars , real people in America are suffering dramatic declines in their net worth .
The chart below shows consistent growth in American household net worth since 1945 , with only a slight drop during the Dot Com Crash .
The net worth of U.S. households peaked at $ 58.7 trillion in 2007 .
We are now in the midst of the greatest decline in the history of the United States .
The household balance sheet of American households tells an interesting story .
Americans experienced a dual boom in stocks and real estate between 2002 and 2007 .
Real estate assets grew by 51 % and financial assets by 55 % over this time period .
These increases gave rise to a positive wealth effect .
When people perceive themselves to be richer due to the increase in the value of their homes and actual increases in investments , they are more likely to spend .
This perception , along with a strong employment market , led Americans to make dreadful financial decisions .
Even though real estate rose by 51 % , mortgage debt rose by 75 % .
What Americans are learning is that real estate can decline , but the debt stays forever .
Much of that extra mortgage debt was used to buy TVs , cars , kitchens , bathrooms , and vacations .
None of these luxuries have the potential to appreciate .
Based on the decline in housing and the stock market , I have produced an estimate of the current national household net worth .
By my conservative estimation , household net worth has declined by over $ 10 trillion since the beginning of the year and is now back to 2003 levels .
By the time this recession is over , we will have eliminated all of the net worth created during the entire Bush reign .
It was all an illusion , created by humungous amounts of debt , fraud , manipulation and deceit .
Estimate Figures in $ trillions 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007
6/30/2008 11/24/2008 Real Estate Assets $ 14.9 $ 16.3 $ 18.2 $ 20.4 $ 21.8 $ 22.3 $ 21.8 $ 20.0 Financial Assets $ 29.7 $ 34.2 $ 37.3 $ 39.8 $ 43.5 $ 45.9 $ 44.3 $ 38.0 Other Assets $ 3.4 $ 3.6 $ 3.8 $ 3.9 $ 4.1 $ 4.3 $ 4.4 $ 4.5 Total Assets $ 48.0 $ 54.1 $ 59.3 $ 64.1 $ 69.4 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 $ 62.5 Mortgage Debt $ 6.0 $ 6.9 $ 7.8 $ 8.9 $ 9.9 $ 10.5 $ 10.6 $ 10.7 Consumer Credit Debt $ 2.0 $ 2.1 $ 2.2 $ 2.3 $ 2.4 $ 2.6 $ 2.6 $ 2.7 Other Liabilities $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 1.2 $ 0.7 $ 1.3 $ 1.3 Total Liabilities $ 8.8 $ 9.9 $ 11.0 $ 12.2 $ 13.5 $ 13.8 $ 14.5 $ 14.7 Household Net Worth $ 39.2 $ 44.2 $ 48.3 $ 51.9 $ 55.9 $ 58.7 $ 56.0 $ 47.8

American consumers are under intense stress .
Now that there is no equity left to borrow against their houses , Americans are doing what they know best .
They are whipping out one of their 30 credit cards .
The credit card write - offs will be the next tsunami that hits our banking system and will be subsidized by more taxpayer funds .
According to John Mauldin , credit card debt has exploded in the last few months :
Commercial Bank ' exposure ' via the total amount of Credit Card ' loans ' outstanding has risen MORE in the last ten WEEKS , than it did in the previous ten MONTHS COMBINED !!!
“ Moreover , the growth in the last ten - weeks , $ 32.3 billion , or about $ 600 million per ' shopping day ' since the beginning of August … represents nominal growth of + 9.3 % … or … + 48.3 % annualized over the last ten weeks . ”
According to American Express , delinquencies on credit payments rose to 4.1 % of all credit outstanding in the 3Q , up from 2.5 % in 3Q of 2007 , with Bank of America 's rate rising even more steeply , to 5.9 % in the quarter .
Moreover , the ' pool ' of loans deemed ' uncollectable ' rose to a high 6.7 % in the 3Q , soaring from 3.6 % last September .
What consumer spending there is has been fueled in part by credit card .
Greg notes this uncomfortable piece of data : the second largest “ merchant - vendor ” for credit card use is now McDonalds .
This suggests that many consumers are in serious distress when they need to get their $ 4 Big Mac and fries with a credit card .
The unemployment rate is currently 6.5 % , according to U - 3 government figures .
The broadest U - 6 measure , which includes discouraged and marginally attached workers , is 11.8 % .
If you are still discouraged and jobless after one year , the government ignores you in its calculation .
How convenient for the government bureaucrats .
If these workers are included , the unemployment rate is currently 16 % .
When someone tells you our current situation is n't close to the Great Depression because unemployment was 25 % in the 1930's , keep this chart in mind .
We have lost 1.2 million jobs in ten months .
The U - 3 rate will reach 9 % by late 2009 .
That would be another 3.6 million job losses .
These are the kind of numbers that could lead to social unrest .
Our social services system and food banks will be pushed to the breaking point .
The S&P 500 has declined by 44 % in 2008 .
It has provided an average annual return of - 2 % over the last 10 years .
It has provided an average annual return of 5.8 % over the last 15 years .
These are n't the returns that the Wall Street PR machine has been promising you .
They have convinced people that stocks always go up over the long run .
I guess it depends on your definition of long run .
Pension funds , endowment funds , and financial advisors use annual returns of 8 % to 10 % in their models and assumptions .
This shortfall in return will have devastating impacts on States , Counties , and Companies with traditional pension plans , along with the average 401k investor .
So far , 2008 is shaping up to be the worst year for the stock market in history .
The guys you see paraded daily on CNBC are shell shocked .
Most of these people are worth millions .
When someone had $ 10 million and now has $ 5 million , it 's a shame .
When a 64 year old guy who has worked hard his whole life , followed the rules , contributed to his 401k every week , listened to the stocks for the long run mantra , and accumulated $ 500,000 in his 401k , loses $ 250,000 months before his planned retirement , it is a tragedy .
People who thought they could retire will now have to work for many more years .
Millions are losing their jobs , while their home value declines and their mutual fund holdings are cut in half .
This is the negative wealth effect in full bloom .
People are scared to death and will not spend anywhere near the level they have spent over the last 20 years .
Forced frugality is here .
Embrace it .
Young people should be happy with the dramatic pullback in the stock market and housing market .
Many valuation and sentiment measures now point to solid long - term returns from this point onwards .

Creeping Corporate Fascism
For the last 2 weeks I 've heard the normal fear mongering rhetoric about imminent disaster if the incompetent leaders of U.S. automakers did n't get a bailout from taxpayers for their strategic blunders .
I have heard that if the 3 U.S. automakers were to fail , 1 in 10 workers in America would lose their jobs .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , there were 145 million employed workers in October 2008 .
According to their own information , the U.S. carmakers employ the following number of workers worldwide :
General Motors 266,000
Ford Motor 87,700
Chrysler 132,130
Total Workers 485,830
Approximately 377,000 of these jobs are in the U.S.
This is 1 in 385 jobs in the country .
The Center for Automotive Research , based in Ann Arbor , and surprisingly funded by the Big 3 , coincidentally issued a report , just before the Big 3 CEOs went before Congress , that 2.95 million direct and indirect jobs would be lost if the Big 3 ceased operation .
Even this exceedingly broad interpretation of lost jobs comes to only 1 in 49 jobs .
The 1 in 10 jobs that Democratic Congressmen have been spouting is a bold faced lie .
The bigger the lie , the more likely people will believe it .
You can be sure that some PR maggot came up with this slogan and instructed all Democratic Senators to repeat it at every opportunity .
While their PR machines were busy generating lies , the CEOs of GM , Ford and Chrysler were flying to Washington DC on private corporate jets to beg for $ 25 billion from U.S. taxpayers .
The General Motors corporate jet costs $ 36 million .
Rick Wagoner 's roundtrip cost $ 20,000 .
A coach roundtrip fare would have cost $ 600 .
This hubris by corporate executives who have made the strategic decisions that have ruined their industry is not surprising .
Most CEOs in the U.S. believe they are smarter and deserve to be treated as royalty .
Robert Nardelli , the man who ruined Home Depot ( HD ) while collecting $ 123 million in compensation and a $ 210 million severance package , is the epitome of a pompous elitist CEO .
He flies on a corporate jet after firing 28,000 Chrysler employees in the last two years .
Rick Wagoner has raked in $ 25 million in the last 5 years , while leading his company to a $ 72.6 billion loss since 2005 .
Alan Mulally , who became CEO of Ford in late 2006 , received $ 28 million of compensation for 4 months of work in 2006 .
He has been well worth the pay .
Ford has lost $ 24 billion since 2006 .

General Motors will burn through its remaining cash in less than two months .
Ford has a little longer .
The Democratic fear monger politicians that have been bought off by the UAW , warn of the imminent collapse of society if these automakers declare bankruptcy .
Again , the big lie is more likely to be believed by the masses .
The GM Board of Directors does not believe that a Chapter 11 filing is a viable option .
This is the same Board that thought the Hummer was viable line of vehicles .
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy will allow these companies to close unprofitable plants , close dealerships , rid itself of awful management , and renegotiate UAW contracts .
They will come out of bankruptcy with leaner cost structure that will allow them to compete with Honda ( HMC ) , Nissan ( NSANY ) , and Toyota ( TM ) .
If Congress bails them out with taxpayer funds , they will continue to pay workers $ 70 per hour versus the $ 42 per hour paid by the Japanese automakers .
We are heading down a path towards corporatism , where government merges with corporate interests .
It has already taken root with the Defense industry and Healthcare industry .
This corporate fascism is clearly taking hold , as no one knows where the Treasury and Federal Reserve will set the line that Government will not cross .
It is also taking place at the State government level .
In Pennsylvania , a horrifically run retailer , Boscov's , which uses 1960 's retail ideas and foolishly used leverage to buy a bunch of bad Strawbridge locations , should be liquidating and joining Montgomery Ward on the scrap heap of retail history .
Instead , Governor Ed Rendell is using taxpayer money to prop up this horrible retailer .
I 'm sure the $ 130,000 that Al Boscov contributed to Mr. Rendell 's political campaigns had nothing to do with Rendell 's actions .
It must be a coincidence .
No Easy Way Out
Gonna stand my ground , wo n't be turned around
And I 'll keep this world from draggin me down

Hey I will stand my ground

The incoming Obama administration is now floating the idea of a $ 500 billion to $ 700 billion stimulus package .
The story , which will be sold to the American public by his well oiled PR machine , is that we must do this to save the country .
Have we heard this story before ?
The country is going through a necessary de-leveraging that will take years to complete .
There is no stimulus package that will stop this de-leveraging process .
There is no easy way out .
Obama will convince the American public that once we save the country with the stimulus program , he 'll then address our long - term fiscal problems .
He 'll convince the Republicans to support the stimulus package by delaying the tax increases on the rich .
Democrats have never seen a spending plan they would n't support .
Republicans have never seen a tax that they did n't want to cut .
This is the kind of “ cooperation ” that will quickly lead to a $ 13 trillion national debt .
Tax cuts for the middle class sounds great , except that a tax cut today is just a tax increase on our grandchildren .
We will borrow this money , to cut taxes .
Former Comptroller of the U.S. David Walker describes this use of debt in our country :
Individuals go into debt , and when they pass away , the debts go with them .
But government debts stay , and they have to be assumed by our children and grandchildren .
That 's not only fiscally irresponsible ; it 's morally reprehensible .
It is time to take a stand .
Government is the problem , not the solution .
If the American public believes that another stimulus package will solve our problems , then they are more gullible than I give them credit for .
There will be no easy answer to a problem that built up over a 25 year period .
Americans will need to spend less , save more , and finally live within their means .
The next 25 years will not be as fun and carefree as the past 25 years .
Government must address the $ 53 trillion of unfunded liabilities , develop a cohesive realistic energy policy , enact a simpler tax policy , create a plan to repair our crumbling infrastructure , and encourage ideas that work for improving our educational system .
One ought never to turn one 's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it .
If you do that , you will double the danger .
But if you meet it promptly and without flinching , you will reduce the danger by half .
Never run away from anything .
Never !
– Winston Churchill
We have many problems and dangers before us .
We need to meet them promptly , without flinching , or our great American Republic will surely enter a period of long slow decline .
The choice is ours .
Next Tuesday has arrived .

China fears fast - rising unemployment could trigger social unrest Companies in two Chinese provinces , Shandong and Hubei , have been told they must seek official consent if they want to lay off more than 40 people .
The order highlights the Chinese authorities ' concern over mounting job losses .
As China 's main external markets plunge into recession and export orders shrink , layoffs have multiplied in the country 's big manufacturing regions .
In Shandong alone , nearly 700,000 people have lost their jobs this year .
In southern Guangdong , tens of thousands of firms have closed , sparking off reverse migration to the countryside by redundant workers .
China 's economic growth has slowed sharply this year to around 8 percent - high by world standards , but much less than the double - digit figures seen for years .
If the one - off boost from the Olympics is factored in , even that number may be further reduced .
Drastic wage cuts China 's manufacturing index contracted dramatically in October , indicating an abrupt slowdown .
It is kicking in at a time when the country 's factories normally rev up production to serve western markets in the run-up to Christmas .
If the government does n't agree to my layoff plans , what can I do ?
I can't afford to pay them all
Shandong factory manager
The Chinese authorities are keen to avoid social instability , seen as a source of labour and political unrest .
The human resources controls imposed in Shandong and Hubei are an attempt to put bureaucratic obstacles in the way of mass layoffs .
But it is unclear how effective they will be .
" The factories are not getting enough orders , so some workers have nothing to do , " Chinese media quote a Shandong factory manager as saying .
" I have been thinking of getting rid of some of them to cut costs .
But if the government does n't agree to my layoff plans , what can I do ?
I ca n't afford to pay them all . "
The alternative may be drastic wage cuts .
In one factory in Guangdong , salaries have been reduced by up to 75 % .
Although that is hardly a sustainable pay level for most workers , they may have to wait until the economic climate improves in China 's foreign markets .
The crisis has helped expose the extent to which the country has become dependent on the outside world - a far cry from the Mao-era slogan of self - reliance .

Comments come after Russia 's announcement last week of plans to deploy missiles in Eastern Europe
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , today urged the US and Russia to shelve their missile plans ahead of a European security conference next year .
Medvedev announced last week that Moscow would deploy missiles in its western outpost of Kaliningrad in response to US plans for an anti-missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic - hours after Barack Obama won the American presidential election .
Medvedev said the deployment was necessary to " neutralise " interceptor missiles and a radar station that the US wanted to put in Poland and the Czech Republic , although he has since scaled back the threat .
Sarkozy , speaking after an EU - Russia summit in Nice , said he voiced concerns about the Kremlin 's threat to deploy missiles in an enclave near Poland .
" I indicated to President Medvedev how concerned we were about this declaration and how there should be no deployment in any enclave until we have discussed new geopolitical conditions for pan-European security , " Sarkozy said .
The French leader also criticised the Bush administration .
" Between now and then , do n't talk about deployment of a missile shield , which does nothing to bring security and complicates things , " he said referring to US plans to deploy an anti-missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the EU , said he had proposed holding a conference in the middle of next year to " lay down the foundation for what could be the future of European security " .
The Nice summit came after EU states agreed on Monday to relaunch talks on a broad partnership pact frozen after Russia 's military incursion into Georgia .
The two sides still have still to set a date for this .
Sarkozy said Russia had largely complied with a French - brokered ceasefire in Georgia , but still needed to withdraw its troops from Georgia 's two breakaway provinces , South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Acknowledging reservations among some EU states about restarting talks with Russia , Sarkozy said it was in the mutual interest of Russia and Europe to talk to each other .
" We do not need extra conflicts ... more division , more wars , we need unity , " he said .
The EU has taken a pragmatic course in its relations with Russia as Moscow is a leading supplier of oil and gas to Europe .
Russia also has interest in mending ties with the EU as the global financial crisis has exposed its economic vulnerabilities .
Russia , which depends heavily on oil revenues , has been hit by the steep decline in oil prices
After the summit Sarkozy and Medvedev were to fly directly to Washington to join the G20 meeting of top economies on the global financial crisis .
Sarkozy said the Russian and EU positions on the international financial system were very close .
“ HaHa !
Yeah !
come on then , COME ON !
Chaz , gimmie one of those bottles , I ’m gonna light the fuckers on fire ! ”
Chaz looked at Barry “ Are you sure Baz ?
Is n’t that like , murder or something ? ”
Chaz grabbed the bottle from him , and started to stuff an old rag into the top “ Nah , they said it was OK on the news , they got no feeling or somethin .
Anyway , cops are too busy up at the stadium , who gives a rats eh ? ”
Facing the two shuffling undead Chaz lit the rag and hurled the flaming bottle at them .
It struck the first one directly in the face , shattering and engulfing them in flames .
“ Yeah , burn you freaks !
Burn ! ”
As the flames swirled around the two zombies , they continued their advance on the boys , arms outstretched jaws hanging open .
“ Shit , why do n’t they stop ? ” said Chaz , turning to Barry , who was no longer by his side .
Turning Chaz looked around the alley , “ Baz ?
Where you go mate ?
You ’re not scared are ya ? ” .
Reaching down he picked up his beer can and turned back to watch the bonfire .
As he turned the first zombie had closed the gap to less than ten feet .
Shocked , Chaz dropped his beer and turned to run , kicking into the gas can at his feet .
As he stumbled and the zombies bore down on him the gas fumes ignited around him .
The flames clung to his jacket and hair .
Screaming he dropped to the ground , trying to put the flames out .
As he rolled over he saw the first zombie , glass embedded face melting from the heat , reach out and grab his throat .
His shrill screams quickly stopped as the zombies tore into him .
Behind a trash can nearby Baz quietly wet himself and prayed they would n’t see him .

Two years ago , Microsoft and Novell inked a landmark deal on patents and Linux - to - Windows interoperability .
According to Microsoft and Novell , it 's a deal that has shown dramatic momentum in its second year , with a triple digit percentage increase in customers for a total tally of more than 200 customers .
As part of the deal , Microsoft resells Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscriptions to customers .
It 's a partnership that has raised some questions about the impact of the deal on the wider Linux ecosystem .
With its second anniversary in hand , Microsoft and Novell are out to try and prove that they now have solid customer momentum .
" I was surprised at the number of over 200 customers , so I actually went back and double checked it just to make sure , " Susan Heystee , General Manager for Global Strategic Alliances at Novell told InternetNews.com .
" That represents over 250 percent growth in terms of the number of customers that are part of the partnership which is really great .
A real positive surprise has been the great customer momentum . "
Heystee claimed that , including the customers from the first year of the partnership , there are now just over 270 companies in total that are customers of the joint Novell - Microsoft partnership .
The financial implications of the deal to both Novell and Microsoft are also substantial , though Microsoft is n't elaborating much .
" From a Microsoft we do n't discuss financial implications related to the agreement , " Sanjay Sidhu , director of marketing and business development at Microsoft told InternetNews.com .
" We can say from a product and customer perspective the collaboration has really helped in terms of meeting customer needs in mixed environments . "
The original partnership deal included a $ 240 million line item for Novell SUSE subscriptions that would be resold by Microsoft .
According to Novell 's Heystee , 80 percent ( or $ 192 million ) of the initial amount has already been invoiced .
In August of this year , Microsoft expanded the original deal with an option for up to $ 100 million more worth of Novell SUSE subscriptions .
" At this point we 're really not disclosing anything further on the incremental in terms of the $ 100 million , " Heystee said .
" We 're now in our quiet period for Q4 . "
Future moves
As Novell and Microsoft continue to grow their partnership into it third year of maturity they are also adding new tools to the mix .
One of them is a new Novell support offer for Red Hat Enterprise Linux users that was announced last week .
The new Red Hat offer includes up to two years of support for Red Hat while the customer migrates to a Novell Linux operating system .
It 's an offer that is also now being made available by way of the Microsoft partnership .
Both Microsoft and Novell however denied that the new support offer would result in a shift in their sales strategy .
" In terms of helping customers migrate from Red Hat , it would be based on our existing sales model of pro-actively reaching out to enterprise customers and educating them on the offering , " Microsoft 's Sidhu said .
Heystee reiterated Sidhu's point and noted that the Red Hat support offer will not result in a sales model shift and that it 's still business as usual .
" We 've gone to market for the last two years with a dedicated team and we 've been very focused in customers that want to leverage the interoperability , " Heystee stated .
" We 're addressing the interoperability between Linux and Windows , it 's not a competitive situation and we 've been really successful . "
A key part of the success has been the technical collaboration between Novell and Microsoft .
As part of the partnership , Linux support for Microsoft 's Silverlight is being developed in the Novell led Moonlight effort which is currently in development .
There has also been work done on expanding virtualization support for Linux on Windows .
Heterogeneous systems management has also been on the interoperability table .
Microsoft System Center Operations Manger 2007 can manage Linux servers .
One item that has not been on the interoperability roadmap to date though is network access control ( NAC ) between Microsoft NAP ( Network Access Protection ) and Linux .
Novell has its own NAC offering which currently is not interoperable with NAP .
" We dont have anything additional to announce today , " Microsoft 's Sidhu said .
" In the future if we expand our technical collaboration , we will provide details at that time . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Banks and a top investor this week said it is time to buy the very mortgage bonds that triggered the global credit crunch now that policy - makers are showing fresh resolve to stabilize housing .

Bullish outlooks on mortgage bonds , including much - derided subprime issues , from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Capital are notable since anyone suggesting the bonds were a good buy over the past year has been humbled as the crisis worsened .
Jeffrey Gundlach , chief investment officer at Los Angeles - based asset manager TCW , also on Wednesday reiterated a penchant for distressed mortgage bonds for his TCW Total Return Bond Fund .
Analysts said the timing is right to buy securities that wreaked havoc on investors and caused hundreds of billions of dollars of write - downs at banks after the Federal Reserve set policy aimed at lowering consumer mortgage rates , boosting incentives for refinancing and buying homes .
High - quality mortgages will draw the most tangible benefit , but a percentage of riskier borrowers will also be helped , they said .
“ We see substantial evidence that the policy environment has shifted in a meaningful way ” to stabilize home prices , JPMorgan analysts , led by New York - based Chris Flanagan , said in a report published on Wednesday .
The policy moves should stabilize “ AAA ” - rated subprime mortgage bonds , and set them up for a potential rally .
Many bonds backed by subprime and other risky mortgages are trading below 50 cents on the dollar as soaring delinquencies ramped up expectations of losses .
Frozen credit markets and forced sales of mortgage asset - backed securities ( ABS ) by investors reducing borrowings have further slammed the bonds , which many analysts argue promise double - digit returns even if the housing slump persists .
Ajay Rajadhyaksha , head of U.S. fixed income and securitized products research at Barclays Capital in New York , said low valuations may help spark a rally for “ AAA ” - rated ABS and commercial mortgage bonds next quarter .
Bond rallies may be led by investment - grade corporate bonds whose risk premiums to Treasuries are close to highs last seen during the Great Depression , Barclays analysts said in their 2009 outlook .
The Fed last month announced plans to purchase up to $ 600 billion in “ agency ” securities issued by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Ginnie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Bank system , all of which direct proceeds to the mortgage market .
By increasing demand for mortgage - backed securities and unsecured debt , the Fed is rapidly lowering rates lenders can offer consumers .
With agency MBS yields down nearly 1.5 percentage points since late November , the average 30 - year fixed mortgage rate this week fell to at least a 37 - year low of 5.19 percent , according to JPMorgan and Freddie Mac data .
On Tuesday , the Fed said it stood ready to expand the agency purchase program if needed , as it dropped its target interest rate near zero .
Treasury bill rates are already near zero , manifesting the Fed policy aimed at forcing investors into riskier assets that are conduits for consumer lending , Rod Olea , director of fixed - income at City National Bank in Beverly Hills , California , said during a recent panel discussion .
It appears the Fed will “ do whatever it takes , ” to bring rates down , ” Gundlach said on a Wednesday conference call .
There are still pitfalls to investing in a market where unexpected events have become the norm , he said .
Asset - backed securities rallied in the days after the Treasury announced its Troubled Asset Relief Plan ( TARP ) to soak up $ 700 billion in illiquid assets , such as ABS , and then crumbled as the program was redirected to make direct capital injections to banks .
The most severe global recession since at least the early 1980s also means 2009 will be a “ minefield for investors , ” said Larry Kantor , Barclays ’ head of research .
“ I dare not declare a bottom in this market but it looks like maybe we are getting a bottoming process , ” TCW ’s Gundlach said .
This should improve pricing in the “ non-agency ” mortgage bond market , which is made up of pools of loans that do not meet standard credit or documentation requirements .
Residential and commercial mortgage bond indexes have already gained since the Fed announced its plan in late November .
The top-rated ABX 07 - 1 subprime index has gained about 20 percent from its November low .
Lower mortgage rates will provide a “ huge ” boost to affordability measures , and slow annualized monthly home price depreciation to the single digits by spring , from 12 percent in October and 22 percent in March , according to JPMorgan .
JPMorgan ’s call is also based on hopes for greater modifications of risky loans , and the possibility of government buying of those loans that locked up in securities .
Subprime bonds valued at distressed levels could benefit as loans are bought out of pools , and as better borrowers refinance and prepay loans at face value , the firm said .
Rallies for such high - yielding bonds are likely “ in a world where yields are collapsing across many sectors , ” it said .

More At Risk Teens Engaging In Anal Sex - Study
A new study by researchers at the Bradley Hasbro Children 's Research Center suggests that the incidence of heterosexual anal sex is increasing among teens and young adults – particularly those who have recently had unprotected vaginal sex .
These findings mirror recent data that show anal sex rates among adults doubled between the years 1995 and 2004 .
The study , published online by the American Journal of Public Health , is among the first to report on the little - known factors associated with heterosexual anal intercourse among adolescents and young adults .
" The topic of anal intercourse is often considered taboo – especially when discussed in the context of youth relationships – even though we know that this behavior is a significant risk factor for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections .
It 's critical that we recognize that more and more young people are engaging in anal sex so we can open the lines of communications and help them protect their sexual health , " says lead author Celia Lescano , PhD , of the Bradley Hasbro Children 's Research Center ( BHCRC ) .
Researchers assessed the sexual behavior of 1,348 adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 and 21 who had unprotected sex in the previous three months .
They found that 16 percent had engaged in heterosexual anal intercourse within the timeframe , with condoms being used just 29 percent of the time .
Females who had heterosexual anal sex were more likely to be living with their partners , to have two or more sexual partners and to have previously experienced coerced intercourse .
Males who engaged in heterosexual anal intercourse were more likely to identify themselves as being homosexual , bisexual or undecided .
" These findings suggest that the factors associated with anal intercourse among females in the study relate to the context and power balance of sexual relationships , " says Lescano , who 's also an assistant professor of psychiatry ( research ) at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University .
" We must teach teen girls and young women how to be assertive in sexual relationships , such as refusing unwanted sexual acts and negotiating for safer sex , whether it 's anal or vaginal . "
However , there were several factors related to anal intercourse that were consistent in both genders .
In general , those who felt that using condoms decreased the pleasure of sex and those who used drugs at the time of intercourse engaged in riskier behaviors , suggesting that interventions should emphasize that sex can be both pleasurable and safe .
" An open dialogue between health care providers and their young patients about anal intercourse is becoming increasingly important , and clinicians should ask about anal sex during discussions about vaginal intercourse and protection – regardless of the patient 's gender or reported sexual orientation , " says Lescano .
Study participants in Atlanta , Miami and Providence completed a self - interview designed to measure sexual risk behaviors , relationships , sexual risk attitudes , substance use and mental health .
The majority of the group ( 92 percent ) defined themselves as being heterosexual .
Overall , 56 percent were female ; approximately half of the participants were African American , 24 percent were Hispanic and 20 percent were white .
Generally speaking , I like my boobs .
They have served me well .
They are on the small side and do not garner public attention , but in private they are appreciated .
Boys wanna touch them , girls wanna have them .
They are perky and little but have a well proportioned flesh to nipple ratio .
I can wear shirts with no bra and do not have to worry about old lady saggy boobs .
A perfect handful , a generous mouthful .
Some of my best girl friends have huge tits which torment them .
They are constantly sneered at and cat called .
Not to mention the back pain and industrial strength support bras needed which are basically granny panties for the boob region .
No thank you !
I have embraced my petite size and am quite comfortable being part of the small boobed babe brigade .
However , in the world of Hollywood , my breasts are viewed as tiny .
Wee little mosquito bites .
When I walk into auditions I am constantly blasted with fake titted actresses staring me in the face .
Ugh !
Yet again , I have forgotten to wear my wonder bra or chicken cutlets .
And for those of you unacquainted with chicken cutlets , they are little rubber things that look like chicken breasts that girls stuff into their bras to be socially accepted by the male species and therefore feel better about themselves .
Somehow , no matter how hard I try to make myself bow down to the man and stuff my bra , I always seem to forget .
On a personal level I am comfortable with my boobs but professionally I sometimes waiver .
I have often wondered if I have lost jobs to my bustier competition .
I am sure that I have .
Afterall , its a man ’s world and Hollywood is a big penis park .
I hate to admit it , but every once in a while I get down on myself and wonder if I am missing out on some awesome secret that only big chested girls get to experience .
And then one day my breast perspective changed .
I went to China and I suddenly had huge tits .
Seriously .
Compared to most Asian women , I may as well have been Dolly Parton .
At first I was oblivious .
I just thought that people were staring at me because I have red hair , am very pale and tall .
But then as I followed their gaze I realized that men of all ages were checking out my rack .
Unabashedly gawking at my boobs .
As in mouth open , drooling , head swiveling staring .
MY BOOBS ?!
Never before had I gotten that kind of attention .
It was hilarious .
I was not offended , I was amazed .
Wherever I went , teenagers to Grandpa ’s checked out my goods .
It took a few days for my brain to make the switch from being a small breasted lady to a voluptuous sex kitten , but then it felt kind of fun .
Like a costume .
A different persona .
I walked with a new swing in my step .
I felt like Marilyn Monroe , tits and ass galore .
But as with all things , there is an end .
I came back to Hollywood and have once again settled into my small breasted life .
But now when I have insecure days I can just remember my Chinese fan base and appreciate my boobs no matter what continent I am on .
So for all those small breasted babes out there , save yourself some money and pain , say no to the knife and consider a trip to the Far East .
With all that at stake , why would anyone appoint a creationist , let alone three , to such a committee ?
Oh , right : the chair of the board , Don McLeroy , is a confessed creationist , who offers folksy criticisms of evolution like , " Given all the time in the world , I do n't think I could make a spider out of a rock .
However , most of the books we are considering adopting , claim that Nothing made a spider out of a rock . "
The far - right faction on the state board of education , including McLeroy , presently holds seven of its fifteen seats .
I guess that Halloween came early to Texas , for the zombies are out in force .
Three creationists were just appointed to a six - member committee to review a draft set of Texas state biology standards , which determine what is taught in Texas 's public school science classrooms and the content of the biology textbooks approved for use in the state .
And since Texas is one of the largest textbook markets in the country , what happens to textbooks there is relevant to the content of textbooks everywhere .
When the distinguished philosopher Philip Kitcher recently addressed the creationist movement in his Living With Darwin , he judiciously assessed creationism in its latest incarnation as historically respectable but currently bankrupt , and proposed to describe it as " dead " science .
" In light of its shambling tenacity , " I replied , " ' zombie science ' is perhaps a preferable label . "
( I was writing in a scholarly journal , so I resisted the temptation to add a reference to " Romero 1968 " or " Wright 2004 " . )
Today 's post is from Glenn Branch , deputy director of the National Center for Science Education , a non-profit organization that defends the teaching of evolution in the public schools .
With NCSE 's executive director Eugenie C. Scott , he edited Not in Our Classrooms : Why Intelligent Design is Wrong for Our Schools .
Within sight of a majority , the creationists on the board are aiming to secure a pretext for undermining the treatment of evolution in the draft standards — and thus , down the line , in classrooms throughout Texas and in textbooks across the country .
Even though the remaining members of the review committee , talented scientists and educators all , are sure to perform their evaluations responsibly , the best outcome will be a deadlock , leaving the creationists on the board free to ignore their evaluations .
A central issue is that the new draft omits a reference to " strengths and weaknesses " of scientific theories .
Innocuous on its face , the " strengths and weaknesses " language was selectively applied only to evolution in 2003 by members of the board attempting to dilute the treatment of evolution in the biology textbooks then under consideration .
After a concerted effort by scientists , teachers , parents , and others to defend evolution , all eleven books were eventually adopted — but it was a long , hard , and unedifying ordeal .
In a 2005 talk at his church , McLeroy was candid about the connection between his religious beliefs and his abuse of the " strengths and weaknesses " language , saying : " It was only the four really conservative , orthodox Christians on the board [ who ] were willing to stand up to the textbooks and say they do n't present the weaknesses of evolution . "
( If you 're a Christian who accepts evolution , like the over 11,000 signatories of this open letter , you 're apparently not " orthodox " enough for him . )
Also under attack is the new draft 's explanation of the limits of science , which notes , " If ideas are based upon purported forces outside of nature , they can not be tested using scientific methods . "
McLeroy is digging in his heels here too , wanting to open the science classroom door to the supernatural — and not just the costumed trick - or - treating variety .
As he told The New York Times , he thinks there are two types of science : " a creationist system and a naturalist system . "
Supporters of the integrity of science education , including the Texas Freedom Network , Texas Citizens for Science , and the newly formed 21st Century Science Coalition , already numbering over 1300 Texas scientists in its ranks , have praised the treatment of evolution in the draft standards .
So have newspapers such as the Austin American - Statesman and the Waco Tribune , which noted that " strengths and weaknesses " is " code for those who want religion to have a foot in the door when Darwin comes up . "
But the creationists on the board are n't interested in heeding the advice of qualified experts , whether scientific ( such as the National Academy of Sciences or the Texas Academy of Science ) or educational ( such as the National Association of Biology Teachers or the Science Teachers Association of Texas ) , about the importance of teaching evolution properly .
They 're interested in wedging that foot in the door , and they 're apparently not too worried about looking silly while doing it .
According to a 2004 article by Josh Levin in Slate , which my colleague Josh Rosenau brought to my attention , " It was n't long ago that the cinematic undead obeyed the first law of corpse locomotion : A zombie might bleed on you , bite you , or rip out your ribcage , but would n't beat you in the 40 - yard dash . "
They 've adopted new tactics , apparently : with the remake of Dawn of the Dead , Levin complains , " the plague of the fast zombies is upon us .
Beware ! "
Well , it was n't long ago that creationists were trying to have intelligent design taught in the schools , and not so long ago that creationists were trying to have creation science taught in the schools , and really not all that long ago that creationists were trying to ban the teaching of evolution .
After a string of defeats in the courts , they 've adopted new tactics , trying to disguise their religious objections to evolution with a veneer of appealing secular language , like " strengths and weaknesses . "
So beware !

Exclusive : Obama Explains
Why His Campaign Will Wait for ' Toot ' Candidate tells ABC News why his presidential campaign will have to wait .
Oct. 24 , 2008  -- Barack Obama is home today in Hawaii with his ailing grandmother rather than on the campaign trail because he fears she wo n't make it to Election Day .
Obama , who polls show is the front - runner in the election to become the leader of the free world , is likely doing chores right now for the woman he affectionately calls Toot .
" I want to give her a kiss and a hug , " the Democratic presidential candidate told Robin Roberts in an exclusive interview for " Good Morning America " before heading for Hawaii to see his 85 - year - old grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , the woman who largely raised him .
" And then we 're going to find out what chores I can do , because I 'm sure there 's been some stuff that 's been left undone , " he said .
The Illinois senator took the unprecedented step of quitting the presidential campaign with less than two weeks to go so he could hurry home to the apartment he grew up in and see Dunhill .
He rejoins the campaign Saturday .
Toot , which is short for " tutu , " the Hawaiian word for grandparent , has been sick for a while and recently fell and broke her hip .
" Without going through the details too much , she 's gravely ill , " Obama told Roberts in an interview that aired today on " GMA . "
Besides the hip , Obama said , " She had some other problems that were getting worse .
You know , we were n't sure , and I 'm still not sure , whether she makes it to Election Day .
" We 're all praying and we hope she does , " he said .
His grandmother 's illness has turned Obama 's stretch run for the White House into a bittersweet moment .
He is leading John McCain , in most polls , yet also faces the possible loss of the most influential person in his life while he was growing up .
" One of the things I want to make sure of is that I had a chance to sit down with her and talk to her , " Obama told Roberts .
" She 's still alert and she 's still got all her faculties .
And I want to make sure that I do n't miss that opportunity right now . "
Obama has also said publicly that he regrets not returning to his mother 's bedside before she died of cancer , as he overestimated how much time she had to live , and he does n't want to make the same mistake twice .
Obama Mentions Grandmother in Health Care Policy
Obama 's grandmother was a high school graduate and a real - life " Rosie the Riveter " during World War II -- building airplanes and taking care of a newborn baby while Obama 's grandfather was a soldier in Gen. George Patton 's Army .
" She is a tough person .
She actually is where I think I get some of my strength and grit and determination , " Obama told Roberts .
After the war , Dunham joined a bank 's secretarial pool and rose to become a vice president .
She also took care of Obama after his Kenyan father abandoned the family and his mother was studying overseas .
" She really was the financial rock for our family , " Obama said .
" She 's a remarkable woman . "
He has also pointed out that his grandmother had traces of racism in her , a point Obama made earlier in the campaign when he tried to explain the caustic language used by his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Obama recalled how his beloved grandmother would sometimes make comments about black men on the street because she was afraid of them .
News of her illness has resulted in Dunham being " inundated " with phone calls , e-mails and flowers from " total strangers " who are wishing her well , Obama said .
" And so , maybe she is getting a sense of long - deserved recognition toward the end of her life , " Obama said .
Ever the presidential candidate , Obama invoked his grandmother when talking about issues in the campaign .
When asked by Roberts about his plans for health care , Obama said , " I think about my grandmother right now .
But , you know , there are a lot of younger people who , in her same circumstances , do n't end up having health insurance .
Sometimes their kids do n't have health insurance . "
He also dismissed McCain 's latest attack that Obama " will say anything to get elected . "
McCain was referring to Obama 's alleged shift in his plan for who would be eligible for tax cuts .
" I think it 's fair to say that if you look at the quality of our campaign and theirs , " he said , " who 's been more civil , who 's talked about the issues , as opposed to trying to attack peoples ' character , I think we get a pretty good grade . "
Grandma , at least , would approve .
I ’ve been on both sides of the remote worker relationship .
On the manager side , I ’ve managed some good - sized projects using an all - remote work force .
Indeed , I ’ve hired , managed , fired , and promoted workers without ever knowing what they look like .
On the worker side , I do most of my work remotely , and I have for some time now .
Judging by the amount of repeat business I get , I ’d say that I ’m more than acceptably productive working remotely .
In dealing with various clients , recruiters , prospective employers , business owners , and talking to friends who manage people for a living , I ’ve heard pretty much every excuse / reason there is for not wanting to deal with a remote work force .
I ’ve heard and experienced successes with remote workers as well , and they all have a few key things in common , which are missing from the stories of failure .
I ’ll talk about them in a minute .
I first want to just say that I ’m not some kind of fanboy who thinks remote workers are the answer to every problem .
There are valid reasons for not having remote workers .
For example , it ’d be hard to build cars with a remote work force .
Some things ( some ! ) just require a physical presence .
Whoever maintains the printers at your company really has to be around to change out ink cartridges and stuff like that .
There are certain classes of jobs , though , that are well - suited to working remotely .
There are even classes of jobs that are necessarily performed remotely to some degree ( field sales and support technicians for example ) , that could be made 100 % remote with the proper tools and processes in place .
So what makes a remote worker success story different from a story of failure ?
Always be prepared …
The number one difference I ’ve seen between success and failure in managing a remote work force is that successful managers spent the time to prepare the managers , the team , the department , the organization , and the remote workers themselves to work remotely .
If you do n’t prepare for a remote work force , you will fail miserably .
As a result , I ’m a big advocate of treating “ Let ’s go remote ! ” as an internal project with goals and milestones just like any other project .
Preparing an organization to manage a remote work force takes a good deal of forethought , with a focus on communication and collaboration tools , reporting , accountability , scheduling , etc .
In addition , you have to prepare the remote workers themselves , to insure they know what ’s expected of them in terms of reporting their status , scheduling , communication , etc .
They also need to know * about * , and * how to use * the tools they ’ll be expected to use from home .
You have to plan this .
You have to prepare , or you ’re going to be like the HR manager who told me their company no longer allows for remote workers because “ we tried it once and the guy made a complete mess of things ” .
When I asked the HR manager why he attributed that to the geographic location of the worker , he said “ good point , he could just as well have made a mess here in the office ” .
You need good workers no matter where they ’re going to work .
The workers need expectations and goals from the manager , and the manager needs feedback and communication ( and results ! ) from the worker .
Tools help to facilitate these things .
This is already a long post , so I ’ll probably make a tools list in another post .
Communicate , and set expectations
Before the tools come other higher - level decisions and communication .
For example , one problem I ’ve heard more than once about remote workers is “ we ca n’t hire a remote worker full - time , because then everyone will want to work from home ” .
As if they did n’t already all want to work from home !
Everyone would love to have the option !
Even if they did n’t take advantage of it , they ’d consider it a really cool perk !
They ’d tell all of their friends about it , because it would make them jealous , and guess who their friends will contact first when they start to look for other opportunities ?
You have to start somewhere , and you ca n’t just swing the barn doors open and let everyone go their own way on day 1 .
If you have an existing corporate structure in place with assets and services and regular meetings and the like , then you have to decide who can make the most benefit from a remote situation the soonest , make them the pilot group , and manage the expectations of the rest of the organization while the pilot group prepares to move to a remote workspace .
1 , 10 , 100 , 1000
A common software application rollout strategy is to make it accessible to 1 user , then 10 , then 100 , then 1000 , then … move up from there .
In preparing your organization or department , you might consider a similar strategy .
I work for a client right now where I ’m the “ 1 ” .
If I can work effectively with the rest of the team ( in the office ) , if I can produce results , remain accessible as - needed during working hours , manage the expectations of my team with regards to my presence ( appointments happen ) , and overall be an asset to the team , then the management may decide that it can work on some larger scale – even if ‘ larger ’ means 2 instead of 1 .
It might also be useful to do a ‘ remote rotation ’ so that glitches can be caught early before making a physical presence in the office optional .
Success , of course , means getting together with the team and figuring out what tools will be used to best emulate an office working environment .
We use IRC for 99 % of our communication , falling back to email when we need to cc managers , we have a wiki for documentation and status updates , we have a trouble ticket system , everyone has everyone else ’s phone number , blackberry PIN , or whatever .
We ’re a technical group doing system administration .
It ’s working wonderfully .
“ But if the sysadmins work from home , the developers will want to work from home ! ”
Maybe so .
That ’s where you have to manage expectations , and communicate with your workers to let them know that the company ’s ‘ office optional ’ project is in an early alpha stage , that it ’s being tested on the group most familiar with the technologies involved , and most capable of exploiting those technologies successfully to produce results .
Once the geeks work out the shortcomings , and management is able to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan , the tests will become more widespread .
Really , it ’s not a whole lot different from doing anything else that affects the whole company : changing payroll providers , healthcare options , software and desktop hardware upgrades and replacements … it just takes communication .
The process has to be managed , just like every other process .
There ’s more than one way to do it !
There ’s no one solution out there .
When I joined php|architect Magazine in 2003 , it was run by Marco Tabini , and I was a remote editor .
A couple of months after joining , I became editor in chief , and was in charge of remotely managing the magazine .
I did it differently from Marco , but he still remained involved and engaged through good communication .
Python Magazine was created and managed by me , and for the entire lifespan of the magazine , I have not seen anyone else involved in its production in person .
Ever . Design , production , web site admin , executive administration , tech editors , authors , accountants … time lines , budgets and planning documents … all remote , and mostly delegated .
I started the magazine with the thought that at some point someone more engaged in the community and with Python should take charge — I was just a “ temp ” to get the vision off the ground .
Sure enough , when I handed the magazine over to Doug Hellmann , he did things differently from me , and it ’s working out wonderfully for him as well !
Everyone has their own management style .
Do n’t think that just because your management style is a little unique you ca n’t handle remote workers .
Good managers are creative , and are n’t afraid to execute on creative solutions .

“ The U.S. government is prepared to lend more than $ 7.4 trillion on behalf of American taxpayers , or half the value of everything produced in the nation last year , to rescue the financial system since the credit markets seized up 15 months ago , ” reports Bloomberg .
“ The unprecedented pledge of funds includes $ 2.8 trillion already tapped by financial institutions in the biggest response to an economic emergency since the New Deal of the 1930s . ”
OTN covers the End the Fed demonstration outside the Dallas Federal Reserve building on November 22nd , 2008 .
It is not , however , a response to an economic emergency .
It is brazen grand larceny conducted in broad daylight .
It is financial terrorism and the bankster engineered TARP is the equivalent of the Patriot Act that allows the government and Wall Street to get away with the biggest heist in modern history .
Paulson and his co-conspirators rammed their bank robbery bill through Congress with threats of martial law and dire warnings of a financial crash .
Now they are cleaning out the till with precision as Congress and the American people stand dumbfounded on the sidelines .
“ When Congress approved the TARP on Oct. 3 , Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson acknowledged the need for transparency and oversight , ” Bloomberg continues .
“ Now , as regulators commit far more money while refusing to disclose loan recipients or reveal the collateral they are taking in return , some Congress members are calling for the Fed to be reined in . ”
It should be noted that the amount of money pledged is equivalent to $ 24,000 for every man , woman and child in the country .
It ’s nine times what the U.S. has spent so far on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to Congressional Budget Office figures .
It could pay off more than half the country ’s mortgages .
Simply reigning in the private Federal Reserve will not put an end to the bank robbery .
In fact , the criminal Federal Reserve is responsible for the current economic crisis .
The Federal Reserve Bank , through its inflation of the money supply and the distortion of free markets , engineered the crisis .
As Alex Jones told OTN on the weekend ( see video ) , the international banksters have cut off liquidity by design in order the bankrupt the country and implode the economy .
It is a bankster scheme engineered to consolidate wealth and buy up assets — banks , insurance companies , roads , infrastructure — for pennies on the dollar .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Last week we were told the in-coming Obama administration will nominate New York Fed boss Timothy Geithner for Treasury secretary .
Geithner currently manages the bankster bailout from his New York office , thus demonstrating that the looting will continue under the “ change ” and “ yes we can ” president .
Congress is finally coming around , albeit a day late and several billion dollars short , as usual .
“ The backlash has begun already .
Congress is taking a lot of hits from their constituents because they got snookered on the TARP big time .
There ’s a lot of supposedly smart people who look to be totally incompetent and it ’s all going to fall on the taxpayer , ” Bob Eisenbeis , chief monetary economist at Vineland , New Jersey - based Cumberland Advisors Inc. , told Bloomberg .
It appears Obama will further bankrupt the nation with an ill - conceived “ stimulus package , ” said to top $ 700 billion , although Obama ’s senior economic adviser , Austan Goolsbee , refused to reveal numbers .
In addition , Obama has promised to keep the bankster giveaway on track .
“ On Monday , Mr. Obama will likely offer for the first time an explicit pledge to honor all commitments already made by the Bush administration in the TARP program , without imposing new conditions even if there are changes are made to the program in the future .
Obama officials also say the president - elect will promise to find spending cuts to try to keep short - term stimulus spending from ballooning the budget deficit over the long term , ” reports the Wall Street Journal .
In other words , the austerity and sacrifice alluded to by Obama ’s wife during the election will commence in earnest after her husband ’s anointment in January .
Obama ’s spending cuts , of course , will not come out of the massive Pentagon budget , or the off - record intelligence black budget , but will instead come at the expense of the American people who are destined to live as serfs under the system planned by the banksters and the global elite .

UNITED NATIONS 
An unprecedented declaration seeking to decriminalize homosexuality won the support of 66 countries in the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday , but opponents criticized it as an attempt to legitimize pedophilia and other “ deplorable acts . ”
The United States refused to support the nonbinding measure , as did Russia , China , the Roman Catholic Church and members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
The Holy See ’s observer mission issued a statement saying that the declaration “ challenges existing human rights norms . ”
The declaration , sponsored by France with broad support in Europe and Latin America , condemned human rights violations based on homophobia , saying such measures run counter to the universal declaration of human rights .
“ How can we tolerate the fact that people are stoned , hanged , decapitated and tortured only because of their sexual orientation ? ” said Rama Yade , the French state secretary for human rights , noting that homosexuality is banned in nearly 80 countries and subject to the death penalty in at least six .
News in Science
Instant porridge 8000 years old
Breakfast 8000 years ago was n't that much different from what we enjoy today , according to a study that describes the world 's oldest known cooked cereal .
Dating from between 5920 to 5730 BC , the ancient cereal consisted of parboiled bulgur wheat that Early Neolithic Bulgarians could refresh in minutes with hot water .
" People boiled the grain , dried it , removed the bran and ground it into coarse particles , " lead author Soultana - Maria Valamoti says .
" In this form , the cereal grain can be stored throughout the year and consumed easily , even without boiling , by merely soaking in hot water , " Valamoti , an assistant professor of archaeology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece , says .
She and her colleagues studied the Bulgarian grain , excavated at a site called Kapitan Dimitrievo , as well as 4000 - year - old grains of barley and wheat from northern Greece .
Very high magnification by microscope revealed precise details about the individual cereal grains , including their composition .
The findings are published in the latest issue of the journal Vegetation History and Archaeobotany .
Starch modification
The analysis shows that starch within the Bulgarian grains was swollen , twisted and , at times , fused together .
Such starch modifications were more extreme toward the outer layers of the bulgur , consistent with grains that had been penetrated by boiling water .
The grains had also been charred , not in a way indicative of intentional toasting , but rather by a fire that appears to have burnt down the houses where the grain was stored .
The scientists also cooked and processed modern wheat and hulled barley , putting the results through the same analysis .
The fine details and internal structure of the modern boiled , dried and ground cereals matched what the researchers saw in the ancient Bulgarian grains .
" I think bulgur could have well been a staple ingredient of Mediterranean cultures in the past , " Valamoti says .
" It is very nutritious and easy to make a meal out of it throughout the year , once it is prepared . "
She says the early southeastern Europeans must have gathered it in the summer , when they could have dried it under the hot sun .
Such early , simple preparations passed down through the generations , leading to dishes still enjoyed in the region and other parts of the world today .
" Bulgur and trachanas ( preparations often consisting of ground grain mixed with milk or yogurt ) were staple foods of Greek people until very recently , " she says .
Dr Stefanie Jacomet , a leading archaeobotanist at Basel University 's Institute of Prehistory and Archaeological Science in Switzerland , says that " until now , simply almost nothing was known about this " , explaining that this latest study is the first to explore ancient cooked cereal in such detail .
Other researchers have , however , analysed early evidence for bread - making in the same regions .
The first - known bread predates the cereal , so it 's possible the ancients enjoyed some toast with their hot , cooked bulgur .
NSFW Dayglo and faintly squidgy – or looking as though it might turn up as weaponry in the hands of a hostile alien : the future of stimulation is techno - sexual , and it was on display this weekend at Erotica 2008 .
This was the third such event to be hosted at Kensington Olympia , opening its doors to punters with the plea that they " forget doom and gloom and credit crunch " and immerse themselves in " one full day and night of fabulous naughtiness " .
However , finger - wagging signs at the entrance warning visitors to behave and reminding them that nudity was forbidden may have set a limit to just how naughty they were expected to be .
A hint of politically correct sexism , too , as a fetish enthusiast claims that he was asked to desist from taking his female " puppy " for a walk on a leash around the show because it was " abusive " - while being informed that the same scene with gender reversed would be perfectly OK .
So what was there to see ?
And is £ 22 a head really justified for a day spent wandering aisles packed with artificial genitalia and interestingly - flavoured lubricant ?
El Reg went and looked , and our answer is a not terribly enthusiastic yes .
Erotica is about more than sex – intimacy , perhaps – and for those looking for a different experience on a wet Sunday afternoon in autumn , it provides it .
Stands include not just the obligatory travelling sex shops , but much more besides : corsetry and underwear , models , film - makers , swingers , jewellers , chocolatiers .
There was even an outpost selling dairy products , whose sole connection to eroticism appeared to be the proposition that they could sell you cream and , well , cream could play a part in love - making .
Those with a spare £ 10,000 could pick up a discount six - seater jacuzzi and whirlpool bath .
The less ambitious could purchase hand - crafted metal beds – a snip at £ 4,000 .
Meanwhile , for the truly perverted , two Welshmen ran a stand selling toffee - flavoured Welsh vodka .
Every half hour or so , a different act took to the stage to bump , grind and gyrate in a fervently erotic fashion .
On the sexual front , the motto seemed to be " if we can make it vibrate , we will " .
Gone are the days of harsh plastic vibrators , replaced now by cute vibrating rubber ducks , pink buzzing bunny rabbits and vibrating things that look like a Bird of Prey crossed with something out of Alien .
Then there is the we-vibe , voted Best Sex Toy 2008 , which can apparently stimulate clit and g - spot simultaneously , setting up “ an erotic carrier wave ” between the two .
One should expect nothing less from a product designed and beta - tested by a former senior engineer from Nortel .
SALT LAKE CITY - In June , leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints made a fateful decision .
They called on Mormons to donate their time and money to the campaign for California Proposition 8 , which would overturn a state Supreme Court ruling that permitted gay marriages .
That push helped the initiative win narrow passage on election day .
And it has made the Mormon church , which for years has striven to be seen as part of the American mainstream , a political target .
Protesters have massed outside Mormon temples nationwide .
For every donation to a fund to overturn Proposition 8 , a postcard is sent to the president of the Mormon Church .
Supporters of gay marriage have proposed a boycott of Utah businesses , and someone burned a Book of Mormon outside a temple near Denver .
" It 's disconcerting to Latter - day Saints that Mormonism is still the religious tradition that everybody loves to hate , " said Melissa Proctor , a professor at Harvard Divinity School .
As an indication of how seriously the Mormon leadership takes the recent criticism , the council that runs the church - the First Presidency - released a statement Friday decrying what it portrayed as a campaign not just against Mormons but all religious people who vote their conscience .
" People of faith have been intimidated for simply exercising their democratic rights , " the statement said .
" These are not actions that are worthy of the democratic ideals of our nation .
The end of a free and fair election should not be the beginning of a hostile response in America . "
Jim Key , a spokesman for the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center , said gay - marriage activists ' barbs are directed at church leadership , not individual Mormons .
" We 're making a statement that no one 's religious beliefs should be used to deny fundamental rights to others , " he said .
Proposition 8 opponents estimate that members of the Mormon church gave more than $ 20 million to the effort to pass the measure , although that is difficult to confirm , because records of campaign donations do not include religious affiliation .
For years , church leaders have tried to blunt the assertion that Mormonism is somehow out of the political and cultural mainstream .
The backlash over gay marriage carries both risks and rewards toward that goal .
To support Proposition 8 , the LDS church entered into a coalition with other religious organizations , including evangelical groups that have tended to view Mormons warily .
It was a Catholic bishop , Mormon officials said , who requested the LDS church bring its members into the fight .
Now those groups are rallying behind the embattled church .
" Being against gay marriage puts the church right in the mainstream of American religious behavior , " said Quinn Monson , a political - science professor at Brigham Young University .
But the outrage directed toward the church could hurt its efforts to continue to expand .
" The backlash is going on all over the country , " said Jan Shipps , a prominent scholar of modern Mormonism who is an emeritus professor at Indiana University and Purdue University - Indianapolis .
" There are people who had a lot of respect for the Mormons who now say , ' Well , they 're just like the Christian right . ' "
That 's ironic , said Shipps , given that the Mormon church has a more tolerant stance on homosexuality than some evangelical groups .
The LDS has pointedly declined to state that homosexuality is a choice .
And it has cautioned against programs that purport to " cure " same - sex attraction , even though Mormon theology holds that marriage is a divine relationship between men and women that continues into the afterlife .
Also , Shipps said , while the church had been riding high ever since the successful 2002 Winter Olympics here , the gay - marriage fight and other recent setbacks have forced the church to deal with skepticism over its faith and history .
First there was former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 's unsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination .
Mormons were shocked that Romney 's LDS faith was a source of discomfort for some voters .
" Latter - day Saints were just amazed to think there was such bigotry in the country , " church spokesman Michael Otterson said .
And a raid on a polygamous breakaway sect in Texas this spring was a reminder of the church 's use of multiple marriages in the 19th century , even though the LDS has long renounced polygamy .
" That whole story in Texas was probably much worse for the church 's image than Proposition 8 , " Monson said .
Why some are more likely to try out new , exciting experiences than others
Skydiving :
Those who enjoy new experiences have strong links between the memory hub and the area of the brain that produces pleasure
Whether you are the adventurous type or one of those who sticks to what you know is all down to how your brain is wired , say scientists .
They have found that the strength of links between two key parts of the brain affect how we respond to new experiences .
German researchers asked 20 young men and women to gauge their attitudes to change or ' novelty seeking ' .
Scans showed the easily bored on - the - go types had strong connections between the hippocampus ( the memory hub ) and another part of the brain called the ventral stratium .
It is thought that when the memory hub fails to recognise an experience it sends a message through the white matter - fibreladen tissue which carries messages - to the ventral stratium .
This releases chemicals which produce a feeling of pleasure .
And in those who constantly seek new experiences , the Bonn university team found the connections between the two areas were particularly good .

The intention here is to provide the basic data on how to make soap from the most basic materials .
There are many fancier soap recipes which make better soaps , as long as you have all the ingredients .
The first write - up assumes you can just go to a store and buy the ingredients .
The second only assumes you have some animals you will be butchering and that you have been burning wood fires and cleverly saved the ashes .
Basic Method [ A .
This first write - up is taken from Hulda Clarkís book , " The Cure for All Diseases , " pages 529-530 . ]
A small plastic dishpan , about 10 " x 12 "
A glass or enamel 2 - quart saucepan
1 can of lye ( sodium hydroxide ) , 12 ounces
3 pounds of lard
Plastic gloves [ really ; use eye - protection too ]
Water 1 .
Pour 3 cups of very cold water ( refrigerate water overnight first ) into the 2 - quart saucepan .
2. Slowly and carefully add the lye , a little bit at a time , stirring it with the a wooden or plastic utensil .
( Use plastic gloves for this ; test them for holes first . )
Do not breathe the vapor or lean over the container or have children nearby .
Above all _use no metal_ .
The mixture will get very hot .
In olden days , a sassafras branch was used to stir , imparting a fragrance and insect deterrent for mosquitoes , lice , fleas and ticks .
3 . Let cool at least one hour in a safe place .
Meanwhile , the unwrapped lard should be warming up to room temperature in the plastic dishpan .
4. Slowly and carefully , pour the lye solution into the dishpan with the lard .
The lard will melt .
Mix thoroughly , at least 15 minutes , until it looks like thick pudding .
5 . Let it set until the next morning , then cut it into bars .
It will get harder after a few days .
Then package .
If you wish to make soap based on olive oil , use about 48 ounces .
It may need to harden for a week .
Liquid soap
Make chips from your home - made soap cake .
Add enough hot water to dissolve .
Add citric acid to balance the pH ( 7 to 8 ) .
If you do not , this soap may be too harsh for your skin .
Basic Method When There Are No Stores !
[ This write - up was taken from one done by Marietta Ellis concerning the soap - making practices of colonial America , with the tense mainly changed from the past into the present . ]
Saponification is a very big chemical word for the rather complex but easy to create soap making reaction .
Saponification is what happens when a fatty acid meets an alkali .
When fats or oils , which contain fatty acids are mixed with a strong alkali , the alkali first splits the fats or oils into their two major parts fatty acids and glycerin .
After this splitting of the fats or oils , the sodium or potassium part of the alkali joins with the fatty acid part of the fat or oils .
This combination is then the potassium or sodium salt of the fatty acid .
As we said at the start , this is soap .
Soap Making Takes Three Basic Steps 1 .
Making of the wood ash lye .
2.Rendering or cleaning the fats .
3. Mixing the fats and lye solution together and boiling the mixture to make the soap .
First Let's Make
The Lye
In making soap the first ingredient required is a liquid solution of potash commonly called lye .
The lye solution was obtained by placing wood ashes in a bottomless barrel set on a stone slab with a groove and a lip carved in it .
The stone in turn rested on a pile of rocks .
To prevent the ashes from getting in the solution a layer of straw and small sticks was placed in the barrel then the ashes were put on top .
The lye was produced by slowly pouring water over the ashes until a brownish liquid oozed out the bottom of the barrel .
This solution of potash lye was collected by allowing it to flow into the groove around the stone slab and drip down into a clay vessel at the lip of the groove .
Some colonists used an ash hopper for the making of lye instead of the barrel method .
The ash hopper , was kept in a shed to protect the ashes from being leached unintentionally by a rain fall .
Ashes were added periodically and water was poured over at intervals to insure a continuous supply of lye .
The lye dripped into a collecting vessel located beneath the hopper .
[ Use whatever you have available or can make . ]
Now The Fats Are Prepared
The preparation of the fats or grease to be used in forming the soap is the next step .
This consists of cleaning the fats and grease of all other impurities contained in them .
The cleaning of fats is called rendering and is the smelliest part of the soap making operation .
Animal fat , when removed from the animals during butchering , must be rendered before soap of any satisfactory quality can be made from it .
This rendering removes all meat tissues that still remain in the fat sections .
Fat obtained from cattle is called tallow while fat obtained from pigs is called lard .
If soap is being made from grease saved from cooking fires , it is also rendered to remove all impurities that have collected in it .
The waste cooking grease being saved over a period of time without the benefits of refrigeration usually become rancid , so this cleaning step is very important to make the grease sweeter .
It will result in a better smelling soap .
The soap made from rancid fats or grease will work just as well as soap made from sweet and clean fats but not be as pleasant to have around and use .
To render , fats and waste cooking grease are placed in a large kettle and an equal amount of water is added .
Then the kettle is placed over the open fire outdoors .
Soap making is an outside activity .
The smell from rendering the fats is too strong to wish in anyone 's house .
The mixture of fats and water are boiled until all the fats have melted .
After a longer period of boiling to insure completion of melting the fats , the fire is stopped and into the kettle is placed another amount of water about equal to the first amount of water .
The solution is allowed to cool down and left over night .
By the next day the fats have solidified and floated to the top forming a layer of clean fat .
All the impurities being not as light as the fat remain in water underneath the fat .
You may have observed this in your own kitchen .
When a stew or casserole containing meat has been put in the refrigerator , you could see the next day the same fat layer .
Finally The Soap Making Can Begin
In another large kettle or pot the fat is placed with the amount of lye solution determined to be the correct amount .
This is easier said than done .
We will discuss it more later .
Then this pot is placed over a fire again outdoors and boiled .
This mixture is boiled until the soap is formed .
This is determined when the mixture boils up into a thick frothy mass , and a small amount placed on the tongue causes no noticeable " bite " .
This boiling process could take up to six to eight hours depending on the amount of the mixture and the strength of the lye .
Soft and Hard Soap Soap made with wood ash lye does not make a hard soap but only a soft soap .
When the fire is put out and the soap mixture allowed to cool , the next day reveals a brown jelly like substance that feels slippery to the touch , makes foam when mixed with water , and cleans .
This is the soft soap the colonists had done all their hard work to produce .
The soft soap is then poured into a wooden barrel and ladled out with a wooden dipper when needed .
To make hard soap , common salt is thrown in at the end of the boiling .
If this is done a hard cake of soap forms in a layer at the top of the pot .
As common salt may be expensive and hard to get , it is not usually wasted to make hard soap .
Common salt is more valuable to give to the livestock and the preserving of foods .
Soft soap works just as well as hard and for these reasons the colonists , making their own soap , did not make hard soap bars .
In towns and cities where there were soap makers making soap for sale , the soap could be converted to the hard soap by the addition of salt .
As hard bars it will be easier to store and transport .
Hard bars produced by the soap maker were often scented with oils such as lavender , wintergreen , or caraway and were sold as toilet soap to persons living in the cities or towns .
Hard soap is not cut into small bars and wrapped as has been familiar .
Soap made by the soap makers is poured into large wooden frames and removed when cooled and hard .
The amount of soap a customer wants can be cut from the large bar .
Soap is sold usually by the pound .
Small wrapped bars were not available until the middle of the 19th century [ nor maybe shortly after the end of the 20th ] .
Difficulties in Making Soap
The hardest part is in determining if the lye is of the correct strength , as we have said .
In order to learn this , the soap maker floats either a potato or an egg in the lye .
If the object floats with a specified amount of its surface above the lye solution , the lye is declared fit for soap making .
Most of the colonists felt that lye of the correct strength would float a potato or an egg with an area the size of a modern quarter above the surface .
To make a weak lye stronger , the solution can either be boiled down more or the lye solution can be poured through a new batch of ashes .
To make a solution weaker , water is added [ more data to be added here on how to determine the correct strength of lye ] .
A Pennsylvania Dutch recipe once carefully warned that a sassafras stick was the only kind of implement suitable for stirring the mixture [ see Hulda Clark comment above re sassafras ] and the stirring must be done always in the same direction [ ? ] .
Not Always Done Down On The Farm Soap making as a trade had grown in direct proportion with the growth of the colonies .
Even in the very early days there were tradesmen making and selling soap , who were called soapboilers .
Since tallow was the main ingredient for both soap and candles , many tradesmen were producers of both .
These tradesmen were called chandlers .
Potash and Pearlash Trade Soap making and the manufacture of potash and pearlashes were closely related trades of colonial America .
Pearlash , purified potash , because of its many industrial uses , was an important item of export for the colonies .
Pearlash , in addition to soap making , was used for making glass both in the colonies and in Europe ....
Potash is the residue remaining after all the water has been driven off from the lye solution obtained from the leaching of wood ashes .
Pearlash is then made from the potash by baking it in a kiln until all the carbon impurities were burned off .
The fine , white powder remaining was the Pearlash ....

You know how you watch these presidential and vice presidential debates on television , as a near record number of us did last Thursday with Sarah Palin and Joe Biden , and millions more will tomorrow night from Nashville with John McCain and Barack Obama ?
And then afterward the networks switch to what seems to be a palpably proliferating panoply of pundits who tell us all instantly and precisely who won , who scored and lost points and what it all means for America 's future ?
And they keep consulting open laptops for their perceptive notes and quotes ?
And sometimes you wonder who appointed them and what makes them think they know more than you ?
Well , maybe they do n't .
The brilliantly observant folks over at Gizmodo.com were watching CNN 's political palaverers , including here on the nearest end the big legal expert Jeffrey Toobin .
Here 's a photo of the panel during coverage of last Thursday night 's vice presidential debate :
But the clever Gizmodo.com folks did n't leave it there .
They examined the photo more closely .

At the Web Directions South conference last week , SitePoint ’s Kevin Yank had the opportunity to speak with Douglas Crockford , Yahoo architect and expert on all things JavaScript .
Douglas presented a talk entitled Web Forward ! ( formerly Ajax Security ) , in which he described the potential of – and problems with – JavaScript as a language , and how it would need to change for the Web to continue its evolution .
He focused heavily on how the current process for developing web standards is failing us , and how the looming browser war could provide the solution .
Hi , this is Kevin Yank from sitepoint.com , and I ’m here at Web Directions South , 2008 with Douglas Crockford from Yahoo .
Hi Doug .
Hi .
So , I ’ve heard you say several times just how much JavaScript sucks , and how many problems there are with it , and yet you seem to devote yourself to it with a lot of passion .
Why is that ?
I do n’t think you ’ve heard me say it sucks , because that ’s not my position , except occasionally when I ’m echoing the sentiment of the market .
Ah , that ’s fair enough .
I am very clear about its shortcomings .
But I believe that if you strip away its shortcomings , what you ’re left with is actually an elegant , beautiful little language .
And it ’s not only a beautiful little language , but it ’s also a powerful one , and one that is more widely deployed than any other language in the world .
Yeah .
And it ’s continually surprising to me just how capable a language it is , given where it came from .
I mean , one day in the 1990s , Netscape said , “ We need a little language to run in our browser . ”
And what we ended up with was very close to the JavaScript that we have today .
How did Netscape end up with it as a language , answering that need at the time ?
They were really lucky .
Given the process that created the language , we should have gotten something much , much worse , because they did n’t do a careful design of requirements .
They certainly did n’t give enough time for its design or its implementation .
They took a prototype , which was intended just as a proof of concept , and that ’s what they shipped .
And it had all the problems that you would expect such an implementation to have .
And it was partly on the basis of that implementation that the language got the terrible reputation that it had .
And a lot of those defects are still in the language .
But beyond all of that , there were a couple of extremely clever ideas that were also in there , which have since been revealed , which give the language amazing , expressive power .
But at the same time , it ’s extremely accessible for beginners .
And since , for most web developers , JavaScript is their first programming language , that ’s an extremely valuable feature to have .
A lot of JavaScript ’s critics want to go back in the other direction , and make it more Java - like , but I think that would be a bad thing because it would alienate most web developers .
So , I ’d rather go in the other direction and train our web developers how to be programmers , how to be computer scientists , because you can in this language .
It ’s possible to write good programs in this language , which is something we did n’t know before .
And beyond that , I ’m now insisting it ’s necessary to write good programs , because if the programs are not good , they ’re not going to scale , and they ’re not going to be secure .
The language is good enough to support that mission , so it works .
You recently wrote the book , JavaScript : The Good Parts , and I recently wrote a book about JavaScript myself .
And what I found a lot of the time as I was writing it was , as you say , you have to try to train people what not to use in JavaScript .
For me , the strength of the Web is its accessibility , not just for people reading it , but for those publishing new content .
I ’m interested , as JavaScript moves forward and we try to correct these problems with it , whether we ’ll be able to preserve that low barrier to entry that makes JavaScript something someone can pick up as their first language and feel confident with after a day or two ?
I think so , and I think we need to .
We would be making a tragic mistake if we did n’t retain the language ’s simplicity .
Most of the modifications I would like to make in the language would be to make it even simpler .
There ’s some cruft on it , and there are some attractive nuisances in it , which we do n’t need but which people become dependent on .
We ’d be better off without that .
Unfortunately with the Web , once something bad gets in it , it takes years to get rid of it .
Ajax did n’t happen until 2005 , but all of the technology that we needed for Ajax was in place and in the field in 2000 .
Most of that five years was spent removing old browsers from the marketplace until there was enough of an audience on IE6 , making Ajax a viable application platform .
I ’ve admired Yahoo ’s educational initiative – its pattern library and the Yahoo Developer Network .
How did that come about ?
Has it been a success for Yahoo ?
I think it has been a success .
You know , there are some brilliant people at Yahoo .
There always have been .
For years we kept that fact a secret .
We ’re not doing that so much anymore .
I ’m really happy to see that we ’re being more open now , and we ’re sharing what we know with the rest of the community .
It ’s clearly been a good thing , and there ’s been a lot of interest in what we ’ve released .
No doubt the infamous line from your talk today will be that we need another browser war .
What aspects of a browser war lead to progress and moving the Web forward ?
What do we want to see the browser vendors fighting over ?
Is it user market share , or is it developer mind share , or is it a bit of everything ?
It ’s going to be everything .
There will probably be fronts on the war , and it may be that different things are hot at different times .
But the problem that we have now is that we ’re stuck .
Our technology has n’t evolved at all since the Ajax set got put in place in 1999 , and the way we understand web applications today is radically different .
So we ’re now trying to go forward with the wrong technology , and it ’s inadequate .
We ’ve tried to go forward using the standards process at W3C and ECMA ; that process is not effective , so we need to find another way .
I ’m not really proposing a browser war – it ’s going to happen by itself .
I wish I had the power to say , “ This is what we must do . ”
The best I can do is recognize , “ This is what ’s going to happen , and we should figure out a way to take best advantage of it . ”
Yahoo is a relatively recent addition to the ECMAScript standards body ; you ’ve spoken about how you ’re hoping to lead a more conservative approach to that standardization , where the standards body follows behind the implementation , and documents what ’s really good , what ’s proven .
With that happening , how is JavaScript going to get better ?
Where are those conversations on the leading edge going to happen ?
They may still happen at ECMA .
I ’m starting a process at ECMA to look at creating a safe dialect of JavaScript , or a capability dialect of JavaScript .
That ’ll be happening at ECMA , involving ECMA members .
I ’m hoping I can open it up to some non-ECMA members as well .
Our initial motivation will not be to write a standard , but to come up with a language that we can test .
We ’ll try to get the language tested , see if we can get it deployed , see if it actually does what it needs to , and then we ’ll try to make a standard .
I think that ’s the proper sequence for everything , but in the last few years web standards – at least for the last ten years – web standards have lost focus .
They ’ve been more about invention than about codification , and I think that is unhealthy .
At best it ’s been unproductive , and at worst we ’ve seen bad standards come out of that .
For example , CSS2 was un-implementable , and eventually it had to be revised as CSS2.1 – an attempt to cut CSS2 down to what people were able to figure out how to implement .
That sequence was totally backwards – or it started backwards , but eventually they got it right .
Let ’s look at what can actually work and make a standard out of that , and then let everybody catch up with each other .
I think that ’s a proper role for standards .
What I see happening now with HTML5 is appalling .
There is some stuff there that I really like : I really like that they figured out what the rules of HTML parsing are .
Brilliant .
That ’s long overdue .
And you can look at any individual feature that they ’re doing and say , “ Yeah , that makes sense . ”
But there ’s just too much , and there ’s not a good set of trade - offs , there ’s not a complexity budget .
It ’s not motivated by real need , but by what ’s shiny in front of a committee .
So , I would like to find a way to inject more discipline into the process , and I think one way to do it is to change it to an evaluation and description process , where we ’ll observe what ’s going on out in the wild , and document the best of it .
And that documentation process is really hard – it ’s a lot of work .
Taking something as complex as a computer system and describing it in a way which is generally useful is difficult .
It ’s good that we have these organizations to do that work , but that should be their focus .
One of the projects you mentioned in your talk was AdSafe , a method of injecting ads into pages in a safe way , so that the ads do n’t have unfettered access to the rest of the site that ’s hosting them .
Speaking from the perspective of a site that runs ads and receives the most appalling code from our advertisers – which they expect us to inject into our site – how do we get the advertising industry to buy into that ?
We ’re going to have to do it all together .
At Yahoo we ’ve talked about going to the industry , and then we always back down because we do n’t want to be perceived as difficult to work with – we ’re already perceived as difficult to work with !
So , we need to approach them all at once and say , “ Look , we ca n’t accept these lousy ads anymore .
We need to have at least this level of technical quality if you want to get on our sites . ”
I think computer networks are the only place where there are no such quality standards .
If you want to show an ad on a television network , it ’s going to be exactly thirty seconds .
You do n’t get to go longer if you want – it ’s not an option .
It ’s got to be encoded properly , it ’s got to be on a standard tape format … all that stuff .
( Otherwise ) there ’s no play .
We do n’t have those sorts of limits on computer - based advertising , and we need to .
So , this is a remedial effort that we have to undergo .
So , consider it a slight spoiler for your book , but if you had fifteen minutes of attention from everyone who ’s writing JavaScript in the world today , what one thing would you teach them to do better – or not do – with the language , to improve JavaScript on the Web ?
The number one thing is , be aware that you can and must write good programs .
One of the principal measures of the quality of a program is its legibility .
We should be writing programs for other people to read .
And I recommend code reading as a standard process of all development activities , so a team would do weekly code readings at the least , whether you take time out to read each other ’s code … I think the benefits that come from that are tremendous .
Great .
Thanks very much !
Thank you .

Britons have a deep nostalgia for home - grown honey and its associations with an ordered rural lifestyle .
But here , too , the honey bee population is dwindling , and with winter under way faces a tough fight for survival .
Besides warnings the country will run out of English honey by Christmas , there is a threat to growers of fruits such as apples and pears .
A wet summer on top of changed sowings and increasingly intensive agriculture have limited opportunities to forage for nectar , risking starvation for bees .
Most colonies are also infested with a dangerous parasitic mite .
“ We are extremely aware of the enormous threat there is to honey bees and the huge reduction in population , ” said Adrian Barlow , chief executive of trade group English Apples and Pears .
“ It is something we are very concerned about . ”
To collect a pound of honey , a bee might have to fly a distance equivalent to twice around the world .
This is likely to involve 10,000 flower visits or perhaps 500 foraging trips , according to the British Beekeepers ’ Association ( BBKA ) .
Honey bees pollinate about 90 percent of apples in Britain and also have an important role for many other crops including runner beans , pears and raspberries .
Britain has about 250,000 hives , about 80 percent of them looked after by small - scale beekeepers who sell most of their honey to friends , colleagues and at farm shops .
The other 20 percent are kept by larger bee farmers who produce honey on a more commercial scale .
Richard Steel in the Cambridgeshire countryside has been keeping bees for 27 years .
He had about three dozen colonies but lost about two thirds of them , blaming heavy rains during the spring / summer mating season as a key factor .
“ What was happening ... with a lot of the colonies that failed was that the queens were running out of sperm and not being able to lay fertile eggs , ” he told Reuters by telephone .
“ I put this down to the fact that they possibly mated with fewer drones ( due to the wet weather ) . ”
The United States , France , Greece and many other countries have also suffered heavy losses in the bee population and researchers are still searching for answers .

British beekeepers have been demanding the annual state budget for bee health research be raised to 1.6 million pounds ( $ 2.37 million ) from 200,000 pounds now .
Hundreds of them delivered a petition to the prime minister in London earlier this month calling for more research spending .
“ The increased funding we are asking for is a drop in the ocean compared to the billions of pounds the government has found for bank bail - outs , ” BBKA President Tim Lovett said , referring to moves prompted by the global financial crisis .
MORE WHEAT , FEWER FLOWERS
The term Colony Collapse Disorder was first used in North America in 2006 , initially applied to a sharp rise in colony losses in that region .
But European beekeepers have also seen similar phenomena .
“ Collapse is a jargonistic term , ” said Francis Ratnieks , professor of apiculture at the University of Sussex in southern England .
“ The hive does n’t actually collapse .
The bees just go away .
It is basically hives dying in the winter . ”
Long - term changes in agriculture have not helped the honey bee .
A jump in wheat prices last year led to a 13 percent rise in plantings in Britain .
Wheat does not provide any nectar .
Sowings of oilseed rape -- a bees ’ favorite which does flower -- fell by 12 percent for this year ’s harvest , according to figures issued by Britain ’s farm ministry .
“ Oilseed rape is a magnet for honey bees , ” said Stuart Bailey , chairman of leading British brand Rowse Honey which has committed 100,000 pounds ( $ 157,000 ) to support research into bee health at the University of Sussex .
Sussex University ’s Ratnieks also pointed out that agriculture has become more intensive : “ In the old days a field of wheat would have more weeds in it , but farmers are not in the business of growing weeds . ”
Wet summers have also made it hard for bees to store up enough food to survive the long winter from end -October to mid-March when flowers are scarce .
“ We ’ve had a couple of years of very wet , cold windy summers that have caused a significant shortfall in terms of the food that the honey bee can stack up for the wintering period and it has caused heavier than normal losses , ” said Stephen Hunter , deputy director of plant and bee health at the British government ’s National Bee Unit .
Hive losses during last winter reached 30 percent , compared with about 10 percent during a normal year , estimated BBKA Chairman Martin Smith .
He said beekeepers were restricting the amount of honey they were taking from hives and many were providing additional food .
VARROA DESTRUCTOR
On top of this , one of the main threats to British honey bees is a parasitic mite called Varroa destructor .
Originally confined to Asian honey bees , it has spread across Europe and reached England in 1992 .
It now infests 95 percent of hives .
Strains of the mite have now developed which are resistant to treatments used against them .
Varroa mites feed on both adult bees and brood , as well as spreading harmful bee viruses .
In Ratnieks ’ view , Britain ’s bee declines can be largely attributed to the mites .
“ There is a hope that we can breed honey bees to be more resistant to the mite and other diseases -- if not fully resistant -- by making them less suitable hosts , ” he said .
Rowse Honey , which as market - leader for the home - produced market is sponsoring efforts to address the problem , has an alarming prognosis :
“ We are definitely going to be out of English honey by Christmas .
It has been a terrible year , ” said its chairman Bailey .
The threat to home - grown honey only represents a small opportunity for other producers .
The British eat about 30,000 tonnes of honey a year of which about 3,000 tonnes is home produced .
The biggest source of imports is Argentina and other important suppliers include Mexico , Hungary and India .
“ In this country honey is a niche product , ” said the National Bee Unit ’s Hunter .
“ It is mainly pollination we are worried about . ”
“ In China they are actually trying to dust fruit trees with long feather dusters to try and pollinate them , ” Bailey of Rowse Honey said .
“ How ludicrous is that ? ”
We have just got to look after the honey bee . ”
I had to take a bit of a break to move into my new apartment in the Castro , ( which has , incidentally , been a pretty exciting place to live this past week ) but now I ’m all settled down and ready to tell you about group actions .
The basic idea of a group action is to visualize a group as a set of permutations of some set , giving a homomorphism .
A basic example would be the cyclic group acting on an - gon by rotation .
But here are some more interesting and general group actions for a group :
acts on by left multiplication .
acts on by left multiplication .
acts on a normal subgroup of by conjugation .
acts on a normal subgroup of by conjugation .
acts on the set of subgroups of of a fixed order , by conjugation .
acts on the set of subgroups of of a fixed order , by conjugation .
If , acts on the set of left cosets of by left multiplication .
All of these can provide useful information through the existence of homomorphisms to some symmetric group .
For an example of this technique , let ’s consider this classic problem :
Problem :
Show that any simple group of order is isomorphic to .
( recall that a simple group is one with no nontrivial normal subgroups )
We make use of some basic Sylow theory .
Let be a simple group of order and let be the number of subgroups of that have order .
Sylow ’s theorems tell us that is a factor of and is congruent to , so .
If , then the group of order is normal , ( do you see why ? ) so .
Let act on the set of subgroups of of order , by conjugation .
This gives a homomorphism .
Because none of these subgroups can be normal ( or again appealing to Sylow theory ) it is easy to see that , so .
But is a normal subgroup of , so and is injective .
So we can imagine as a subgroup of .
In fact , , as the following lemma will tell us :
Lemma :
If is a simple group of order larger than , .
Proof :
Let be the sign homomorphism , so .
Then is a normal subgroup of .
But can not be injective , as , so , in other words .
Returning to our solution , we can now assume that .
Counting orders , we see that has index .
Let act on the set of left cosets of by left multiplication , giving a homomorphism .
Pausing for a moment to verify that , the fact that is simple tells us that is injective , and applying the lemma tells us easily that is an isomorphism .
What is the image of under this isomorphism ?
Well , let ’s think about the action again .
We have some cosets .
Multiplication on the left by elements of is certainly not guaranteed to fix the first five , but it will always fix the last one .
In other words , .
So .
Since , it follows that is an isomorphism carrying to , and we are done .
As we can see , group actions provide an excellent if somewhat magical way of reasoning about finite groups that are too big to be easily understood by hand .
Make them part of your group theory toolbox .

Lesson # 9 : Never assume .
Before opening the bakery , I taught culinary arts at our local community college .
So did one of my friends , who also helped me out in the bakery during the first year .
She taught a course called " Flavorings and Aromatics " ( or something like that ) .
The class met once per week and included a short lecture followed by a lab .
About 20 students .
One day they were making black bean and mango salsa ( and learning about the various flavorings and spices used in salsas ) .
She handed out the recipe and went over it , then made team assignments .
And they got to work .
As she floated in and out among the teams prepping vegetables she watched as one of the students opened a can of black beans and was about to empty it directly into a bowl of beautifully diced onions and mango .
Chef : " WHAT are you doing ?
You need to rinse those beans . "
Student ( looking over the recipe sheet ) : I" It does n't say to rinse the beans in the recipe . "
Chef ( incredulous ) : EVERYONE KNOWS you have to rinse beans before using them .
Well , apparently not .
That student , who always sat in the front row of the classroom , was stunned and embarrassed .
She retreated to her seat and did not participate in the lab the rest of the day .
You know what happens when you assume ...
There are some things I have never assumed .
Like most people have no idea what it means to temper chocolate .
Or that you need to bake cheesecake in a water bath or it will crack across the top .
Or you can kill yeast if you 're not careful .
There are however , several things I USED to assume .
So here is a random list of ten things I no longer assume in the bakery :
Everyone knows it 's wise to read the directions and make sure you have all the ingredients before starting a recipe .
Anyone who says they can cook knows there are 16 ounces in a pound , or 4 cups in a quart , or 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon .
And there is such a thing as a " standard measuring cup . "
Everyone knows that a " dozen " means 12 .
Everyone knows the " A.P. " in flour stands for " all purpose " ( and there is more than one type of flour ) .
Everyone knows that granulated sugar and confectioner 's sugar are not the same thing .
Everyone knows that baking powder and baking soda are not the same thing .
" Cooks " know that water boils at 212oF and freezes at 32o , and you should preheat an oven before using it .
Everyone knows that if you leave the water running in the sink it will eventually overflow ( and items left unattended in the oven will eventually burn ) .
Anyone who has been to culinary school knows the difference between " clean " and " sanitary . "
And surely nobody would ever leave a sharp knife in a sink full of water .
Today 's lesson ?
Tell your employees what 's important but never assume they are listening .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Bush administration on Tuesday unveiled a new program to modify mortgages and stabilize the battered real estate market , but the plan stops short of providing direct government financial help to at - risk homeowners .
The plan centers on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which between them own or back about 31 million mortgages worth a combined $ 5 trillion .
The federal government took over the firms in September due to mounting losses on their portfolios of mortgages .
Eligibility is determined by several factors : Homeowners must be 90 days or more late in their mortgage payments , owe at least 90 % of their home 's current value , live in the home on which the mortgage was taken and have not filed for bankruptcy .
Their mortgage payments would be adjusted through lower interest rates or longer repayment schedules with the goal of bringing payments below 38 % of monthly household income .
Interest rates could be lowered for five years and then raised to a predetermined level .
Loan terms could be lengthened to 40 years .
Officials said the standards for loan modifications should fast - track changes in payments .
The standards will be applied to loans owned and guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie , but officials said they hope they will also be adopted industrywide .
" We expect that it could significantly increase the number of modifications completed , " said James Lockhart , director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , the regulator that oversees Fannie and Freddie .
There was no estimate available of how many loans owned by Fannie or Freddie are eligible for help under this program .
Fannie reported this week that 1.7 % of its mortgages by value are delinquent by 90 or more days .
Fannie 's filings suggest that it has about 18 million mortgages on its books , which would work out to about 300,000 mortgages that could potentially be eligible .
Freddie has yet to release third - quarter results , but at the end of the second quarter it had 115,000 delinquent loans on its books , or about 1 % of its total .
That number is likely to be significantly higher when it reports third quarter results later this week .
' An important step forward '
Faith Schwartz , executive director of Hope Now , a coalition of lenders , loan servicers and not - for - profit housing groups , said setting standards for loan modifications is an important advance that she believes other banks and mortgage investors are likely to follow .
" It may not be across the whole industry , but it 's an important step forward , " she said .
" We think over time this is going to affect a couple hundred thousand homeowners . "
But even in cases where declining home prices have taken the value of a home to less than is owed on the mortgage , the balance of the loan will not be lowered under this program .
" This is not loan forgiveness ; the loans will be paid but at terms affordable for borrowers , " said Brian Montgomery , commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration .
The fact that mortgage balances will not be reduced for the so - called underwater mortgages -- those in which a homeowner owes more than the home is worth -- will limit the use and impact of the program , according to some experts .
" When they realize they owe $ 300,000 on a home worth $ 200,000 , many will decide it 's just not worth it , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , was quick to criticize the program for not going far enough .
He said too many of the loans wo n't be modified because the investors who own the loan will be able to block a new payment schedule .
" These voluntary plans sound nice , but they do n't do the job , " Schumer said .
Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , called the plan " a constructive step forward . "
But he called on the Bush administration to push ahead with a separate mortgage guarantee program under the $ 700 billion financial system bailout enacted last month .
" We are still awaiting agreement from the Treasury Department to move this program forward , " he said .
Private - sector efforts underway
While a number of major banks , including Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , have announced loan modifications programs in recent weeks , they hold only a fraction of those owned or guaranteed by Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) .
Most of the mortgage modification programs announced by banks so far cap the payments of homeowners at risk of losing their homes at a level they can afford -- typically about 34 % to 40 % of their income -- through lower interest rates , longer repayment schedules or reductions in loan balances .
But many of those loan modification programs include the option of reducing the balance of the loan , an option not included in this latest program .
Banks and mortgage finance firms have a strong interest in trying to halt foreclosures .
The market is already flooded with more homes for sale than there are buyers , and foreclosures will only further drive down home prices and lead to more foreclosures .
Moody's Economy.com forecasts that even with loan modification programs , 1.6 million Americans will lose their homes this year either in a foreclosure or a distressed sale , and another 1.9 million are projected to lose their homes in 2009 .
On Monday , Fannie reported a $ 29 billion loss in the third quarter .
The company also reported sharp increases in loan default rates and the amount it is setting aside for future loan losses .
With a collective net worth of $ 3.7 billion , most of Congress ’s 535 members have fewer financial concerns in a recession than their constituents .
McCain remains one of Senate ’s many millionaires , and Obama joins the club .
iabilities listed in Sen. Cardin ’s financial disclosure are not personal liabilities , but rather liabilities only affecting a limited liability partnership ( LLP ) in which he is invested .

WASHINGTON —
An economic recession is looking increasingly likely , but the personal finances of members of Congress suggest they will be able to withstand the slowdown far better than most Americans , according to a new analysis of lawmakers ’ latest personal financial reports by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
U.S. senators had a median net worth of approximately $ 1.7 million in 2007 , the most recent year for which their financial data is available , and 62 percent of the Senate ’s members could be considered millionaires .
In the House of Representatives , the median net worth was about $ 684,000 , with 39 percent of members having net worths estimated to be at least $ 1 million .
By contrast , only about 1 percent of all American adults can be considered millionaires .
Growth between 2006 and 2007 was still a healthy 13 percent , despite indications last year that the economy was headed south .
“ Worries about the economy that most members of Congress are feeling right now are likely coming from their constituents , who will head to the polls in less than three weeks , ” said Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ For the majority of lawmakers , the pressure they are feeling would n’t appear to be coming from their personal finances .
With a median net worth of $ 746,000 , most members of Congress have a comfortable financial cushion to ride out any recession . ”
Before the American economy showed signs in 2007 of slowing down , lawmakers had enjoyed an extraordinary run in their personal investments and other finances .
Members of Congress , who are now paid about $ 169,000 annually , saw their net worths soar 61 percent from 2004 to 2007 , on average .
One of the big gainers in 2007 was Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , who leaped from being the 70th richest senator in 2006 to the 31st in 2007 .
Obama ’s average net worth jumped from an estimated $ 800,000 in ’06 to $ 4.7 million last year , fueled largely by royalties from his two best - selling books .
Obama ’s presidential opponent , Republican nominee Sen. John McCain , dropped a couple of notches in 2007 , from 10th to 12th .
CRP estimated McCain ’s net worth in 2007 to be about $ 28.5 million , largely due to Cindy McCain ’s family fortune .
Like many members of Congress , most of Sen. McCain ’s wealth is derived from his spouse .
The figures on elected representatives ’ personal wealth come from the financial disclosure reports they were required to file most recently , covering 2007 , and from their reports for the preceding three years .
CRP ’s award - winning website , OpenSecrets.org , details the finances of members of Congress in a free , publicly available , searchable database , along with the finances of the president , vice president and selected executive branch officials .
As of this week , this two - year - old Web tool now contains data on officials ’ finances for 2004 through 2007 , allowing for easy comparisons of their wealth over the four - year period .
FULL OF STRUGGLING STOCKS , LAWMAKERS ’ PORTFOLIOS HAVE TAKEN A HIT
In many ways , the investment portfolios of members of Congress resemble the holdings of other American investors — blue - chip stocks , mutual funds and money market accounts .
Assuming lawmakers still hold the same stocks they held in 2007 , they , too , would appear to have lost money in companies such as Wachovia , AIG , Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and in the stock market as a whole .
For example , at the end of last year , Congressmembers ’ holdings in AIG were worth as much as $ 13.9 million .
As of Oct. 15 , their AIG stock was worth no more than $ 578,000 .
Lawmakers ’
Wachovia holdings have plummeted from a maximum value of $ 6.2 million at the end of 2007 to $ 981,000 now .
Members of Congress have millions of dollars invested in politically influential industries that they also regulate , including real estate ( at least $ 301.1 million , which includes property they own ) , commercial banking ( $ 34.1 million ) and the securities and investment ( $ 29.3 million ) and insurance ( $ 11.5 million ) industries .
Despite the overall increase in politicians ’ wealth , not all members of Congress are in sound financial shape , their own reports suggest .
Some would even appear to be bankrupt .
Sixteen members of the House in 2007 , plus three senators , had net worths that averaged in negative territory .
The wealthiest member of Congress in 2007 was again Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif. ) , whose net worth CRP estimated to be $ 397.4 million , up approximately 1.5 percent from 2006 .
Determining an official ’s precise net worth is impossible using the financial disclosure forms that Congress currently employs , unfortunately .
Assets and liabilities are disclosed in ranges , which are often very wide , preventing the public from determining their exact value .
In Harman ’s case , for example , she may be worth as much as $ 558.5 million or , by the most conservative measure , $ 236.3 million .
CRP developed a methodology that accounts for these ranges , factoring in the minimum and maximum potential value of an official ’s assets and liabilities and then calculating averages .
Without updated reports for 2008 , it is impossible to determine the current value of lawmakers ’ holdings , but unless they divested before the recent market downturn , their portfolios are almost certainly worth less now .
OPENSECRETS.ORG SHINES LIGHT FOR CITIZENS ON REPRESENTATIVES ’ HOLDINGS
After more than a decade of posting scanned images of lawmakers ’ financial reports on OpenSecrets.org , the Center for Responsive Politics created a searchable database in 2006 .
Previously , citizens , journalists and others could obtain these paper reports only at government offices in Washington or through Web sites that posted images .
Using the Center ’s database — the only one of its kind on the Internet — comparing the net worth of individual politicians , determining who owns stock in a particular industry and spotting potential conflicts of interest is simple , free and possible from anywhere in the world .
The Personal Financial Disclosures project on OpenSecrets.org is made possible by the Sunlight Foundation .
Sunlight also funds databases on OpenSecrets.org that track federal lobbying , Washington ’s “ revolving door ” and privately sponsored congressional travel .
CRP ’s database of personal financial disclosures relies on reports filed by the government officials themselves .
Sometimes filers leave out information in one year ’s report but include it in the prior or following year ’s form , which makes changes in their finances from year to year appear misleadingly dramatic .
Other valuable information is not required to be disclosed , such as the value of any of the official ’s residences ( unless those homes produce income ) .
“ Members of Congress do n’t make it easy for the public to keep tabs on their personal holdings and any conflicts of interest those holdings present , ” said Dan Auble , who manages CRP ’s database of lawmakers ’ financial information .
“ Especially in this uncertain economy , making this information publicly available is key to keeping lawmakers focused on representing their constituents and discouraging them from personally benefiting from inside information and legislative actions . ”
The next personal financial reports for Congress and the executive branch , covering 2008 , are due in May 2009 .
They will be incorporated into OpenSecrets.org ’s database after the data is made available to the public .
Improving on its transparency , the House of Representatives now posts images of members ’ personal financial disclosures online , beginning with the 2007 reports .
Senators have not announced any plans to give the public similar electronic access to their information .
California Atty . Gen. Jerry Brown asked the state Supreme Court on Friday to invalidate the voter - approved ban on gay marriage , declaring that “ the amendment process cannot be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification . ”
Brown ’s argument on Proposition 8 , contained in an 111 - page brief filed at the last possible moment before the court ’s deadline , surprised many legal experts .
The attorney general has a legal duty to uphold the state ’s laws as long as there are reasonable grounds to do so .
Last month , Brown said he planned to “ defend the proposition as enacted by the people of California . ”
But in his filing , Brown , who personally supports same - sex marriage , offered a novel legal theory to back his argument that the measure should be invalidated .
The California Constitution protects certain rights as “ inalienable , ” Brown wrote .
Those include a right to liberty and to privacy , which the courts have said includes a person ’s right to marry .

The issue before the court “ presents a conflict between the constitutional power of the voters to amend the Constitution , on the one hand , and the Constitution ’s Declaration of Rights , on the other , ” Brown wrote .
The issue “ is whether rights secured under the state Constitution ’s safeguard of liberty as an ‘ inalienable ’ right may intentionally be withdrawn from a class of persons by an initiative amendment . ”
Voters are allowed to amend other parts of the Constitution by majority vote , but to use the ballot box to take away an “ inalienable ” right would establish a “ tyranny of the majority , ” which the Constitution was designed , in part , to prevent , he wrote .
In an interview , Brown said he had developed his theory after weeks of consultation with the top lawyers in his office .
“ This analysis was not evident on the morning after the election , ” he said .

Opponents of gay marriage , who also filed arguments with the court Friday , offered a sharply differing view of the case .
The brief , filed by the Protect Marriage coalition , told the justices that they should uphold the proposition , which voters approved 52 % to 48 % on Nov. 4 after one of the most expensive and emotional campaigns in state history .
The law “ commands judges -- as servants of the people -- to bow to the will of those whom they serve -- even if the substantive result of what the people have wrought in constitution - amending is deemed unenlightened , ” they argued .
In an interview , Andy Pugno , the lawyer for Protect Marriage , called Brown ’s argument “ an astonishing theory . ”
He added that he was “ disappointed to see the attorney general fail to defend the will of the voters as the law instructs him to . ”

The two briefs also disagreed about the fate of the estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages performed before the election .
Brown argued that Proposition 8 was not written to be retroactive and that the marriages should remain valid .
Protect Marriage argued that no same - sex marriages should any longer be recognized .
The Supreme Court justices have indicated they will hear arguments in the case as early as March , with a ruling expected later in the spring .
Kenneth W. Starr , the former Whitewater prosecutor and U.S. solicitor general , plans to argue on behalf of Protect Marriage , the group said Friday .
Some opponents of gay marriage have said that if the court strikes down Proposition 8 , they expect to see an effort to recall justices who vote against the measure .

The issue could also have an impact on Brown ’s political future .
The attorney general , a former governor , has been exploring a run to return to that job in 2010 .
Among his potential opponents for the Democratic nomination are San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , who is a hero to many gay rights advocates for his decision to begin same - sex marriages in his city in 2004 .
The current legal chapter started because of those weddings .
In a landmark ruling in May , the California Supreme Court ruled 4 to 3 that the guarantee of equal protection in the state Constitution required that same - sex marriage be treated the same as heterosexual marriage .
In response , foes of gay marriage mounted a well - organized campaign to amend the Constitution in an effort to put the question out of reach of the judges .
Passage of the ballot measure ignited widespread protests by gay rights groups , including boycotts of supporters of the measure .

The day after the election , gay rights advocates and several city governments , including those of San Francisco and Los Angeles , filed legal challenges .
They argued that the proposition should be rejected because it was a wholesale revision of the Constitution instead of a more limited amendment .
A constitutional amendment can be passed by majority vote after being put on the ballot by a signature drive , but a revision can be placed on the ballot only by a two - thirds vote of the Legislature or a constitutional convention .
Brown then rejected the argument that Proposition 8 was a “ revision , ” saying the court had previously upheld initiatives that made similarly broad changes in the Constitution .
Supporters of Proposition 8 agreed with him on that point .
But they sharply denounced his chief argument .
Advertisement
Protect Marriage had earlier received permission from the court to intervene in the case on the side of Proposition 8 .
At the time , the group had argued that Brown could not be trusted to defend the measure .
Pugno said Friday night that he was glad he had asked to intervene .
Legal analysts had previously thought the majority of the court was leaning toward upholding Proposition 8 .
The argument that the proposition was an improper revision of the Constitution appeared to face a difficult path .
By introducing a new argument , Brown might find an opening for justices to maintain the right to same - sex marriage , they said .
Nonetheless , the attorney general ’s brief surprised some legal scholars .
Santa Clara University law professor Gerald Uelmen , an expert on the state high court , said Brown ’s argument “ turns constitutional law on its head . ”
Uelmen said he was unaware of any case law that supported Brown ’s theory .
Advertisement
He added that he expected the state Supreme Court to reject the argument .
“ I think it is much too radical for this court , ” he said .
Goodwin Liu , associate dean and professor of law at UC Berkeley ’s Boalt Hall School of Law , said it was “ extraordinary for the chief law enforcement officer of the state to decline to enforce a law -- even on the grounds that it is unconstitutional . ”
“ The chief law enforcement officer of the state is charged with enforcing laws , even laws with which he disagrees , ” Liu said .
“ Whether or not it will carry the day , ” he added , “ I have no idea . ”

The dollar is king of the hill again -- at least for now .
Amid the cascading credit crisis , the U.S. currency has reclaimed its status as the world 's haven in tumultuous times .
With investors rushing to sell everything and shove the proceeds into dollars , the greenback has gained more than 11 % against the euro in October alone .
Since the spring , when the mortgage crisis picked up speed , the dollar has gained some 22 % against the euro .
It has also strengthened against the British pound , the Swiss franc , the Australian dollar and others , though it 's weaker against the Japanese yen .
This reversal halts , at least temporarily , a longstanding bearish trend that had seen the greenback slide against major world currencies for much of this decade .
Today 's newfound strength has consequences for investors , consumers and travelers .
A more robust dollar weakens the benefit of investing abroad , yet makes imports , commodities and even an overseas vacation more affordable .
" All those things that had been hurting the consumer have now reversed , " because the stronger dollar is bringing down prices for oil and other commodities that had been pinching pocketbooks , says Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. Still , she notes , the dollar 's rise " is n't because we 're in a fabulous economy .
It 's for mechanical reasons , as so much money around the globe is rushing to safety . "
Indeed , the dollar could just as easily , and quickly , lose its current swagger .
The greenback 's underlying fundamentals were weak before the credit crisis began , what with elephantine budget and trade deficits and an inescapable date with looming Medicare and Social Security funding obligations .
Today 's crisis only amplifies the country 's fiscal challenges .

You probably do n’t know Marko Jarić .
He ’s a Serbian basketball player currently playing for the Memphis Grizzlies .
Originally selected by the Los Angeles Clippers , he ’s also played for the Minnesota Timberwolves , before his current stop in Memphis .
He ’s never made much of in impact in the NBA , and his best season was back in 2004 - 2005 .
So he ’s reached his peak and will slowly slide back into obscurity in a few years .
But do n’t feel sorry for Marko .
Besides the millions of dollars he makes playing basketball ( he ’s getting $ 6,575,000 this year alone ) , he ’s engaged to Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima .
Lima , born June 12 , 1981 , is best known as a Victoria ’s Secret Angel and a spokesmodel for Maybelline .
In addition to modeling , Lima has made a few acting appearances , most notably in episodes of How I Met Your Mother and Ugly Betty .
Here are a few pics of Miss Lima .
If you want to steal her away from Marko , you have until June of 2009 , when they plan to wed in Brazil .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Vatican said on Tuesday the theory of evolution was compatible with the Bible but planned no posthumous apology to Charles Darwin for the cold reception it gave him 150 years ago .

The Vatican said on Tuesday the theory of evolution was compatible with the Bible but planned no posthumous apology to Charles Darwin for the cold reception it gave him 150 years ago .
REUTERS / Handout
Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi , the Vatican ’s culture minister , was speaking at the announcement of a Rome conference of scientists , theologians and philosophers to be held next March marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin ’s “ The Origin of Species ” .
Christian churches were long hostile to Darwin because his theory conflicted with the literal biblical account of creation .
Earlier this week a leading Anglican churchman , Rev. Malcolm Brown , said the Church of England owed Darwin an apology for the way his ideas were received by Anglicans in Britain .
Pope Pius XII described evolution as a valid scientific approach to the development of humans in 1950 and Pope John Paul reiterated that in 1996 .
But Ravasi said the Vatican had no intention of apologizing for earlier negative views .
“ Maybe we should abandon the idea of issuing apologies as if history was a court eternally in session , ” he said , adding that Darwin ’s theories were “ never condemned by the Catholic Church nor was his book ever banned ” .
Creationism is the belief that God created the world in six days as described in the Bible .
The Catholic Church does not read the Genesis account of creation literally , saying it is an allegory for the way God created the world .
Some other Christians , mostly conservative Protestants in the United States , read Genesis literally and object to evolution being taught in biology class in public high schools .
Sarah Palin , the Republican candidate for the U.S. vice presidency , said in 2006 that she supported teaching both creationism and evolution in schools but has subsequently said creationism does not have to be part of curriculum .
THEISTIC EVOLUTION
The Catholic Church teaches “ theistic evolution , ” a stand that accepts evolution as a scientific theory and sees no reason why God could not have used a natural evolutionary process in the forming of the human species .
It objects to using evolution as the basis for an atheist philosophy that denies God ’s existence or any divine role in creation .
It also objects to using Genesis as a scientific text .
As Ravasi put it , creationism belongs to the “ strictly theological sphere ” and could not be used “ ideologically in science . ”
Professor Philip Sloan of Notre Dame University , which is jointly holding next year ’s conference with Rome ’s Pontifical Gregorian University , said the gathering would be an important contribution to explaining the Catholic stand on evolution .
“ In the United States , and now elsewhere , we have an ongoing public debate over evolution that has social , political and religious dimensions , ” he said .
“ Most of this debate has been taking place without a strong Catholic theological presence , and the discussion has suffered accordingly , ” he said .
Pope Benedict discussed these issues with his former doctoral students at their annual meeting in 2006 .
In a speech in Paris last week , he spoke out against biblical literalism .
Michelle Palmer and Vince Acors will be sent home Two Britons found guilty of having sex on a Dubai beach are to be deported without serving any jail sentence .
Michelle Palmer , 36 , of Oakham , Rutland , and Vince Acors , 34 , of Bromley , south - east London , had appealed against their convictions .
They were caught on Jumeirah Beach on 5 July and fined £ 170 and sentenced to three months in prison in October .
The pair were freed on bail during the appeals process and a court has now withdrawn their three - month jail terms .
Palmer and Acors were not in court for the verdicts , but speaking afterwards on her mobile phone , Palmer said : " It just proves our innocence after all the bad stuff that was written . "
Hassan Matter , who represented the couple in court , said : " The judge has cancelled the jail .
He refused the prosecution appeal [ for the sentences to be increased ] .
Sacked " They are free .
It 's wonderful .
The judge gave us a good hearing because he has a good heart and a good brain .
He understood everything . "
Palmer and Acors were found guilty of unmarried sex and public indecency at Dubai's Court of First Instance .
The pair were arrested on the beach hours after meeting at a champagne brunch .
Palmer was sacked from her job in Dubai as a publishing executive after her arrest .
Acors was visiting the emirate on holiday .
Prosecutors told Dubai's Court of Appeal the pair 's punishment was too " small " .
' Chuffed '
At the opening of their trial in August , Palmer denied having sex with Acors , saying they had simply been " kissing and hugging " .
Mr Matter has insisted the results of a medical test on Palmer just hours after they were arrested on 5 July showed " she had not engaged in recent sexual intercourse " .
He said the couple would be deported after they had been processed by the court .
Andrew Crossley , of London - based ACS Law , who has been representing Acors , said : " Vince says it has n't sunk in yet .
They are both chuffed .
Vince can't believe it . "

Advertisement Only 12 children orphaned by the earthquake that struck China 's Sichuan province six months ago have been formally adopted .
More than 600 children lost both parents in the magnitude - 8.0 earthquake that left about 88,000 people dead or missing .
But only a handful of these have completed official adoption procedures .
Six months after the devastating earthquake , people in Sichuan are still trying to rebuild their lives .
Quoting a senior official from Sichuan , the Beijing News said most of the orphans would be housed with relatives that were not killed in the quake .
The schools are the starting point because teachers need training to be able to deal with the children 's disturbed state
Francis Markus
Red Cross spokesman
Other children will be adopted by non-relatives or live in orphanages .
Each child will receive 600 yuan ( $ 88 ; £ 57 ) a month from the government until they are formally adopted or reach 18 , the newspaper said .
Finding permanent homes for the earthquake orphans is just one of many problems still unresolved in a region hit by China 's worst earthquake in 30 years .
Building blocks
Rebuilding work will take years , partly because much of the affected area lay in the remote mountains of northern Sichuan .
Much of the quake zone remains a rubble site Five million people were left homeless by the quake .
They will need new houses , as well as schools , health clinics and other basic services .
The government announced last week it will spend $ 146 b over the next three years in the devastated area .
Money will be used mostly for rebuilding work , including larger infrastructure projects , such as a railway from the provincial capital Chengdu to the affected area .
But in at least one place there will be no rebuilding .
Beichuan was so badly hit that the government is moving the entire town to a new location .
More than half the town 's 26,000 residents died in the earthquake and most of its buildings were completely destroyed .
The government has decided to leave the old town as it is and turn it into a national monument .
At the moment it is sealed off , surrounded by a tall , wire fence .
Trauma
It is not just physical rebuilding that requires work .
Traumatised people , many of them children , are still receiving counselling .
One organisation involved in this work is the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , which offers help in five schools .
" The schools are the starting point because teachers need training to be able to deal with the disturbed state of some of the children , " said organisation spokesman Francis Markus .
These children , and their parents , are still trying to come to terms with what happened six months ago .

9 Ways The Zombie Apocalypse Will Make Christmas Better

You�ve lost most of the people you care about and survival from this nightmare seems like an impossible dream .
But hey , it sure beats the hell out of facing the mall crowds at Christmas time .
Up Next : Chef Stephanie Izard drops some knowledge at Digestif
So , decorators are neat ( maybe check out a new tutorial on them ) .
Descriptors are neat but may seem hard ( though they hardly take a long time to describe ) .
Sometimes these two things intersect , and this post describes how .
Here ’s an example decorator where this comes up .
First , we want something that looks like a WSGI application :
def application ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( '200 OK ' , [ ( ' content - type ' , ' text / html ' ) ] ) return [ 'hi ! ' ]
But we want to use WebOb , like :
from webob import Request , Response def application ( environ , start_response ) : req = Request ( environ ) resp = Response ( 'hi !') return resp( environ , start_response )
( We do n’t use req in this example , but of course you probably would in a real WSGI application )
Now req = Request ( environ ) is boilerplate , and it ’d be nicer to just do return resp instead of return resp( environ , start_response ) .
So let ’s make a decorator to do that :
class wsgiapp ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , func ) : self.func = func def __call__( self , environ , start_response ) : resp = self.func( Request ( environ ) ) return resp( environ , start_response ) @wsgiapp def application ( req ) : return Response ( 'hi ! ' )
If you do n’t understand what happened there , go read up on decorators .
Now , what if you want to decorate a method ?
For instance :
class Application ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , text ) : self. text = text @wsgiapp def __call__( self , req ) : return Response( self.text ) application = Application ( 'hi ! ')
This wo n’t quite work , because @wsgiapp will call Application.__call__( req ) — with no self argument .
This is generally a problem with any decorator that changes the signature , because the signature for methods has this extra self argument .
Descriptors can handle this .
First we ’ll have the same wsgiapp definition as we had before , but we ’ll add the magic descriptor method __get__ :
class wsgiapp ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , func ) : self.func = func def __call__( self , environ , start_response ) : resp = self.func( Request ( environ ) ) return resp( environ , start_response ) def __get__ ( self , obj , type =None ) : if obj is None : return self new_func = self.func.__get__(obj , type ) return self.__class__(new_func )
So , to explain :
When you get an attribute from an instance , like Application ( ) .
__call__ , Python will check if the object that was fetched has a __get__ method .
If it does , it will call that method and use the result of that method .
This part :
if obj is None : return self
is what happens when you do Application .
__call__ — in other words , when get a class attribute .
In that case obj ( self ) will be None , and it will just return the descriptor ( it could do something else , like in this example , but usually it does n’t ) .
Functions already have a __get__ method .
You can try it yourself :
>>> def example ( * args ) : ... print ' got ' , args >>> example_bound = example.__get__(1 ) >>> example_bound ( ' test ' ) got ( 1 , 'test ' )

Traffic Pollution Sensors Getting a Trial Run in the UK
November 14th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Have you ever wondered how many pollutants you ’re breathing in while sitting in traffic sandwiched between two trucks ?
The Mobile Environmental Sensing System Across a Grid Environment ( MESSAGE ) can tell you .
The system , designed by researchers at Newcastle University , produces real - time data on traffic pollutants including carbon dioxide , nitrogen dioxide , and noise .
But you ca n’t keep a personal MESSAGE system in your car .
Instead , the sensors are placed at intervals along busy roads .
Curious commuters can monitor pollution levels in real - time using a Google map application .
MESSAGE sensors are going to get a trial run in Gateshead , UK , where they will be closely watched by interested parties around the world .
Researchers involved in the project speculate that tens of thousands of MESSAGE sensors could one day create an intelligent transport infrastructure .
Who knows — maybe one day we ’ll take certain routes to work depending on both traffic and pollution levels .

Aspidistra
Aspidistra was a World War II man - in - the - middle attack .
The vulnerability that made it possible was that German broadcast stations were mostly broadcasting the same content from a central source ; but during air raids , transmitters in the target area were switched off to prevent them being used for radio direction - finding of the target .
The exploit involved the very powerful ( 500KW ) Aspidistra transmitter , coupled to a directional antenna farm .
With that power , they could make it sound like a local station in the target area .
With a staff of fake announcers , a fake German band , and recordings of recent speeches from high - ranking Nazis , they would smoothly switch from merely relaying the German network to emulating it with their own staff .
They could then make modifications to news broadcasts , occasionally creating panic and confusion .
German transmitters were switched off during air raids , to prevent them from being used as navigational aids for bombers .
But many were connected into a network and broadcast the same content .
When a targeted transmitter switched off , Aspidistra began transmitting on their original frequency , initially retransmitting the German network broadcast as received from a still - active station .
As a deception , false content and pro-Allied propaganda would be inserted into the broadcast .
The first such “ intrusion ” was carried out on March 25 , 1945 , as shown in the operations order at the right .
On March 30 , 1945 , “ Aspidistra ” intruded into the Berlin and Hamburg frequencies warning that the Allies were trying to spread confusion by sending false telephone messages from occupied towns to unoccupied towns .
On April 8 , 1945 , “ Aspidistra ” intruded into the Hamburg and Leipzig channels to warn of forged banknotes in circulation .
On April 9 , 1945 , there were announcements encouraging people to evacuate to seven bomb - free zones in central and southern Germany .
All these announcements were false .
The German radio network tried announcing “ The enemy is broadcasting counterfeit instructions on our frequencies .
Do not be misled by them .
Here is an official announcement of the Reich authority . ”
The Aspidistra station made similar announcements , to cause confusion and make the official messages ineffective .

New Solar Cell is the Size of a Lowercase Letter
November 6th , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
The solar cells , about the size of a 12 - point font letter ‘ o , ’ are being tested to eventually power microscopic machines , such as those used to test chemical leaks in the air .
The researchers at the University of South Florida say these are some of the smallest solar cells ever , with twenty aligning to form one panel at just one inch .
Typical single cells are around two inches across on their own , and then form the large silicon panels we see on rooftops.[ social_buttons ]
A panel , made from a non-silicon organic polymer , is not quite powerful enough to run the tiny chemical sensor , which the researchers are using to test the device .
However , it can already can act as a 7.8 volt source , easily enough for many common hand - held devices like cell phones or iPods .
Lead researcher Xiaomei Jiang said the array will be optimized for higher voltage by the end of the year .
“ I think these materials have a lot more potential than traditional silicon , ” said Jiang regarding the use of organic polymers rather than traditional silicon .
“ They could be sprayed on any surface that is exposed to sunlight — a uniform , a car , a house . ”
The research was published today under as the “ Fabrication of organic solar array for applications in microelectromechanical systems , ” in the inaugural issue of The Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy .

The Do-Something Congress
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
It has not been a good week for the Republic .
It took quite a bit of trampling of the Constitution , but the bailout bill passed , as I suspected it would .
The bailout failed the first time it was brought to the House .
Undaunted , the Senate pressed on by attaching the bailout as an amendment to another House - passed bill that was pending in the Senate .
The new bailout version had new taxes , so according to the Constitution it should not have originated in the Senate .
The rallying cry heard all over the Hill the past two weeks was that Congress must act .
Our economy is facing a meltdown .
Would this bill fix it ?
Nobody could really explain how it would .
In fact , few demonstrated any real understanding of credit markets , of derivatives , of credit default swaps or mortgage - backed securities .
If they did , they would have known better than to vote for this bill .
All they knew was that this administration was saying some frightening things , and asking for a lot of money .
And when has Congress ever been able to come up with a better solution to a problem than to throw more of your money at it ?
So that is what Congress did , enacting a financial PATRIOT
Act in the process .
In its embarrassment at being called a " Do- Nothing Congress " the 110th Congress took decisive action and did SOMETHING .
No matter that it was the wrong thing .
In fact , it was n’t until the Senate had a chance to load it up with even MORE spending , when it was finally inflationary and horrible enough , at $ 850 billion instead of a mere $ 700 billion , that it passed — and with a comfortable margin , in spite of constituent calls still coming in overwhelmingly against it .
57 members switched their vote !
The market went down anyway .
Our nation is now just that much more in the hole .
You will pay your part of this mess through inflation , and very likely hyperinflation .
Sometimes doing nothing is much better than thrashing about aimlessly — when one is caught in quicksand , for example , or when one does n’t understand economics and finds oneself in the position Congress was in for the past two weeks , with decades of irresponsible monetary policy coming to a head .
Why should we trust the same people who said just a few months ago that the economy was perfectly sound ?
The same people who just knew there were weapons of mass destruction ?
The same people that crammed the PATRIOT
Act down our throats ?
Why not consult the people who had the foresight and understanding to see this coming ?
They would have recommended such logical actions as repealing the Community Reinvestment Act , which forces banks to make bad loans , or allowing the market to set interest rates instead of the Federal Reserve system .
How about abolishing the Federal Reserve altogether ?
There are many things that could have been done , but do n’t expect Congress take a course of action that comes from a place of understanding and competence when they could just spend money .
This bailout will be the legacy of the 110th " Do- Something " Congress , along with record - low approval ratings .
Here ’s hoping the 111th Congress will be a " Do the Right Thing " Congress , and will focus on repealing and abolishing what is wrong with government instead of reinforcing it .

Link of the day - Guesstimation : Solving the World ’s Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin
LONDON - Human evolution may be winding down as the forces that once drove it - older fathers , isolated populations and widespread child mortality - are disappearing , a geneticist at the University College London argues .
In a lecture this week titled " Human Evolution is Over , " genetics professor Steve Jones said the rate of genetic mutations found in humans is falling dramatically , something he believes is largely the result of lifestyle changes .
Powerful men who once fathered dozens or hundreds of children , often into their 60s and 70s , have given way in most developed parts of the world to younger fathers who tend to sire just a few children in their 20s and 30s .
Because older fathers are more likely to pass on genetic mutations , the rate of those mutations entering the population has declined , he argued .
Similarly , child survival rates , abysmal in antiquity , have dramatically improved in much of the world , cutting natural selection pressures .
And the world 's increasingly huge , mobile population has nearly eliminated the possibility of unusual genetic traits taking hold in isolated populations , he said .
That 's good news for those who like the human race just as it is , though perhaps bad news if humans need to evolve to meet some unexpected challenge down the road , the science - as yet not backed up by other research - suggests .
The other good ( or perhaps bad ) news ?
Genetic mutations caused by growing chemical and radiation exposure may take over where older fathers left off , Jones said .

TOLEDO , Ohio – Senator Barack Obama on Tuesday voiced his support for the administration ’s latest attempt to stabilize the financial markets by investing money into the American banking system , but said he was concerned the plan did not include provisions to limit the pay of business executives .
In his first comments on the historic government intervention , Mr. Obama said he believed the proposal offered a “ promising ” way to ease the credit crisis affecting Americans from all walks of life .
But he said new regulatory requirements needed to accompany the infusions of cash into banks .
“ If we ’re just giving them money , but we ’re not making sure that they are curbing some of the excessive risks that got us into the mess in the first place , ” Mr. Obama told reporters , “ then we are just continuing the same philosophy that has failed the American people so badly . ”
Mr. Obama , who was sequestered at a resort near Lake Erie for the second day of preparations for his final debate with Senator John McCain on Wednesday , said he had spoken to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. about the plan .
But he said he wanted to review the detailed proposal before rendering a final judgment .
He said the limits on the so - called golden parachutes for chief executives , which he pushed to be a part of the first government bailout plan , remain a key point .
“ I am concerned that the way that they structure this new mechanism that we are cracking down on excessive CEO pay –- that I think should be part of the deal , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ And I ’m also concerned that taxpayer shares -– that they are purchasing or they are receiving as a consequence of this injection of equity –- is a good deal for tax payers .
I think that if tax payers investing in Goldman Sachs , they should n’t get a worse deal than when Warren Buffet invests in Goldman Sachs . ”
Mr. Obama , one day after presenting new steps to address the economic crisis , offered a mix of tepid praise and criticism at the proposals that Mr. McCain announced Tuesday .
“ There are some ideas that Senator McCain has put forward in the last couple of weeks that are very bad ideas , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ The idea , for example , of purchasing homes at full price from banks , banks have no losses and tax payers automatically have losses , that ’s a bad idea . ”
He added , “ He ’s had some good ideas .
I think the idea of making sure that people are n’t forced to sell their 401 ( k ) or IRA accounts at the age of 70 when the market is in the tank , I think that makes sense and in fact I acknowledged that in my speech yesterday . ”
Mr. Obama said he was not sure that Mr. McCain ’s proposed reduction in the tax on long - term capital gains –- to 7.5 percent from 15 percent -– was particularly relevant because “ nobody really has capital gains right now . ”
“ That , ” he said , “ probably is not going to be particularly useful in solving the financial crisis . ”
Large Format primer : basics
By Q.- Tuan Luong for the Large Format Page
Summary :
This article explains what large format photography is about , and weights the advantages and disadvantages of using a large format camera .
It also provides references for further information .
What is a Large format camera ?
With a few notable exceptions , these cameras share the following characteristics :
Large image size : 4x5 inches ( 10x12 cm ) , the most popular format by far , up to 20x24 inches ( the Polaroid camera , which can be rented on - site for a reasonable fee ) .
The film comes in separate sheets rather than rolls , but see below .
Flexible bellows connecting the front and back : they allow the use of a range of focal lengths ( with different lenses .
there are no zooms in such formats ) and focussing distances , as well as providing for lateral adjustments and angular adjustments between film plane and lens plane .
Ground glass viewing : makes it possible to assess the image with great accuracy once you get used to the dimness and inversion .
Interchangeable lenses : you are not limited to a particular mount .
What are the main benefits of the large format camera ?
Larger image size .
Results are sharper , have a better tonality , and are grain - free .
A 4x5 has 13 times the area of a 35 mm frame .
A 5x7 has 25 times that area .
Contact printing gives an image whose delicacy cannot be matched by any enlargment , and allow a number of " alternative " processes .

Camera movements .
You have more control on the final geometry of the photographed objects and of the perspective as well as on the areas of sharpness .

Individual sheets of film .
You can use as many types of film as you like easily , easily , including Polaroid , and process each sheet of film individually for optimum results .
The latter point makes it possible to use Ansel Adams Zone System for black and white film .

The latter point makes it possible to use Ansel Adams Zone System for black and white film .
Contemplative approach .
You take your time for each image
This is the flip - side of the drawbacks : you spend so much time on a single exposure , and invest so much effort in it that you 're compelled to think it through carefully and do it right .
What are the main drawbacks of the large format camera ?
Everything is manual .
Most other cameras do some things automatically for us that we take for granted -- like preventing fogged film , double - exposures , non-exposures and so on .
You need to remember to do things that were never an issue even with the most manual 35 mm camera .
As a result , there are more ways to make mistakes than you could ever imagine .

Equipment and film : the equipment is bulky , heavy ( a good tripod is necessary ) and relatively expensive .
The cost per photograph is considerably higher than the same image in smaller format .
Think of it as being proportional to the film area .

Larger magnification : longer focals are needed for the same angle of view :
The equivalent of a 24 mm in 35 mm is a 75/90 lens in 4x5 , a 120 mm lens in 5x7 .
Depth of field is a serious problem .
The cameras movements become * necessary * to put everything in focus , and even though some subjects cannot be focussed entirely .
Start thinking f32 where you thought f5.6 !
As a result you often get very long exposures , so wind shake ( esp. with vegetation ) and reciprocity failure begin to take their toll .
Work which requires naturally a high degree of magnification , ie macro and tele - photo , is particularly impractical , the former because of the depth of field limitations , the second because lenses would have to be insanely long .

Everything takes a long time : loading / unloading your holders at home moving around your heavy backpack or case and tripod setting your camera composing , esp. in low light with slow / wide - angle lenses ( f8 max aperture is common ) focussing : tricks are necessary to overcome the depth of field problem exposing : long exposures are quite common .
It is impractical to photograph quick action or candids , and even in landscape you 'll end up missing optimal conditions .
Your productivity in terms of number of images ( but not necessarily in terms of number of great images ) will be very reduced .
Think a dozen shots or less when you thought a few rolls .
Even though your friends / spouse will complain about the waiting .

This is a photograph of my friend Charles attempting to use a darkcloth for focus and composition on a 8x10 .
40 mph winds were just a little to strong for the darkcloth .
He ended up using the viewfinder and foot scale with this 300 mm setup .

A vivid account by Michael Pollack
What is the real gain compared to other formats ?
The consensus seems to be that as far as enlargements are concerned , the difference between 4x5 and 35 mm is huge , but that the difference between 4x5 and 6x7 will show up only in big enlargements , 16x20 or larger .
At 16x20 modern LF lenses have a slight edge due to reduced granularity and high contrast , above that , modern 4x5 wins due to granularity .
However , you will see a bigger difference with format for B &W prints than with color prints .
On the other hand , a contact print has a special quality that some feel cannot be obtained by an enlargement .
Contact printing is also the only way to work with some alternative process such as paladium / platinium , carbon , etc ...
Will I have to sell the house ?
Large format photography is actually not that expensive , especially compared to medium format photography ( the prices for the 35 mm market are influenced by the fact that it is quite consumer - oriented ) , and a good large format system can be built for no more than a good modern medium format system .
There is also possibility to do large format on a budget .
A fairly good 4x5 can be bought used for less than $ 500 , and if you are willing to accept some limitations , you can get something which works for a couple hundred of dollars .
The latest lenses are indeed very expensive , on the other hand there are a number of older lenses which are really inexpensive , a couple of hundred dollars or less .
Most of the lenses will be totally appropriate for B &W work .
They do n't have to be as sharp as lenses for smaller formats .
Modern lenses , which will produce results virtually indistinguishable from the the latest designs , can be bought used for a rather reasonnable price .
Since LF systems are usually not submitted to an heavy use like smaller formats , gear which is decades old will usually work fine .
A great news is that as you have built a good set of lenses , when you upgrade to a better camera , you just keep them , and maybe change the lensboards .
At one point I was hesitating between the Pentax 67 ( one of the cheapest MF systems ) and 4x5 .
One of the reasons which got me decided for the 4x5 was that the price of the 4x5 system was a little lower .
Film looks expensive too , but you wo n't shoot as many images as you used to .
If you do color , you 'll probably have to have your film processed by a lab .
The total cost of a 4x5 Velvia ( film+processing ) is less than $ 4 , the cost of a 5x7 less than $ 8 .
On the other hand , B &W film home processed is quite cheap .
How to find more information ?
Journals :
There is only one journal devoted exclusively to large format : View Camera TM , published by Steve Simmons ( Largformat@aol.com ) .
The quality has been overall high compared to the mainstream magazines .
Over the past few years , the magazine has concentrated on interviews and portfolios , in which the emphasis is on vision and photographs , rather than technique .
Earlier in its history , the journal had more technical articles , but because it tries not to rehash topics which had been already published , the information really useful for LF beginners is limited in current issues .
You could order back issues , but if you 're after technical basic material , you 'd certainly be better served by books .
Although not exclusively devoted to LF , Photo Techniques ( USA ) regulary runs more detailed reviews of LF equipment written by actual users , as well as excellent how - to articles on LF techniques .
Web Discussion forums :
The LF Q&A forum associated on this site has proven to be the best place on the internet for discussion of LF related issues .
It is very focussed , yet has the most active participation of any LF bulletin boards on the web .
Other LF discussion forums on the web include : f32.net , photo.net , graflex.org , view camera , apug.org .
Usenet :
The newsgroup : rec.photo.equipment.large -format dedicated exclusively to LF photography is one of the best places on the internet to discuss .
This newsgroup is one of the most civil on Usenet , but still , it is unmoderated , so flame wars occur from time to time .
Mailing lists
There used to be a mailing list , the " Large Format Digest " , discontinued since the creation of the previously mentioned newsgroup .
Besides reading it from the web , you can subscribe to the LF Q&A forum to read it by email .
PS .
I started large format photography in 1993 .
There were a lot of things which were mysterious back then .
After shooting thousands sheets of film , some of them are still mysterious , but I have beneficiated from advice of really knowlegeable persons on the net .
I wrote this series in order to try and give back by answering the questions that I was myself asking a couple of years ago .
It is written with location and field photography in mind .
I have only very little knowledge about studio work .
In my tests some versions of IE7 did not handle display property correctly .
It would still show some parts of the drop - down menu even if it was closed at that moment .
I realize that some users might want to utilize display to dynamically manipulate drop - down menus .
In that case please use the following override code snippet in your theme :
ul.dropdown ul { display : none ; visibility : visible ; }
ul.dropdown li:hover > ul { display : block ; }
Now you will be able to manipulate your drop - downs with JavaScript ( use animations , etc. ) .
I will further investigate this issue and move this code to the base file as soon as I feel comfortable with the situation .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc AIG.N , the insurer getting a $ 152 billion federal bailout , in a regulatory filing late on Tuesday disclosed it would pay roughly $ 3 million to several executives under deferred compensation plans that are being terminated .
AIG said last week that it would terminate plans totaling $ 503 million in deferred compensation because it did not want to provide an incentive to employees to quit the company .
The additional disclosure follows New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s writing to the insurer on Tuesday to ask for information on any bonuses or salary raises for 2008 .
Executive pay at AIG and other financial institutions that have recorded large losses is coming under increasing scrutiny from investors , who have endured plummeting stock values , and lawmakers , who are bailing out the strapped firms .
AIG ’s shares have lost nearly all their value in recent months .
They closed at $ 1.95 on Tuesday , off a year - high of $ 62.29 .
AIG last week said the monies being paid under the deferred compensation were previously earned , and had no connection to the federal bailout .
AIG plans to pay the deferred funds , earned under the plans , in the first quarter of 2009 .
The funds will remain invested and accrue earnings until that time , according to the company ’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
Jay Wintrob , an executive in the company ’s life operations , has accrued about $ 1.9 million under the plan .
David Herzog , the company ’s newly appointed chief financial officer , is due about $ 371,000 , AIG said .
Five others , including investment executive Win Neuger , will together receive roughly $ 800,000 under the plans , AIG said .
Deferred compensation plans allow employees to postpone taking some of their pay .
This lets them defer taxes , sometimes until retirement , when their tax brackets might be lower .
AIG said it recently employed about 116,000 people .
AIG recorded more than $ 42 billion in net losses in the last year .
The losses stemmed largely from credit default swaps tied to the performance of risky mortgages .
AIG ’s bailout package was originally $ 85 billion , but ballooned to $ 152 billion when it became clear the lower amount would not be enough .
As part of the rescue , the government took a nearly 80 percent stake in the insurer .
6 : Screamers ( 1995 ) – Reds Intent : Stop the ambient radiation on the war - ravaged planet Sirius B from killing its inhabitants Side Effects :
You do n’t die ..
Notes :
The idea of cigarettes that prevent cancer is unique to Christian Duguay ’s interpretation of the Philip K . Dick short story , and an obvious kick in the rear to political correctness .
When a cloud of particularly dense radioactivity approaches the military base , a voice comes over the loud - speakers to order everyone to light up …
5 : Star Trek : TOS ‘ Mudd ’s Women ’ ( 1966 ) – The Venus Drug Intent :
Make the user irresistibly attractive by enhancing their own natural charms – women become more alluring and men more aggressive .
Side Effects :
Wolf - whistles ; unbidden sleazy saxophone solos .
Notes :
The lothario and entrepreneur Harcourt Mudd is dosing up his cargo of miners ’ wives with the illegal Venus drug to ensure his procurement fees , until he ends up stranded with the fabulously attractive women on Kirk ’s Enterprise .
Kirk later gives one of the women a placebo and it works anyway – so it was all in the mind …
4 : Scanners ( 1981 ) – Ephemerol Intent :
The relief of morning sickness in pregnant women .
Side effects : Rashes ; dizziness ; kids may end up with the ability to read other people ’s thoughts whether they want to or not , to set other people on fire or even blow other people ’s heads up in a nasty display of gore ; Now available in strawberry .
Notes : Ephemerol can also be used as inhibiting treatment for children whose mothers took the drug and who are now themselves ‘ scanners ’ ( telepaths ) .
3 : UFO ( UK TV 1970 ) – ‘ The Amnesia Drug ’ Intent :
To wipe the recent memory of unauthorised personnel who have discovered the existence of SHADO , a worldwide clandestine military organisation that is secretly protecting the human race from aliens who want to harvest human organs for their own dying species .
Side Effects :
Of what ?
Notes :
In the episode ‘ The Square Triangle ’ , SHADO Commander Ed Straker ( Ed Bishop ) was forced to wipe the memories of a man and a woman –lovers – who were conspiring to kill the woman ’s husband .
The illicit couple had encountered both aliens and SHADO , and once their memories of this were erased , they proceeded successfully with their murderous plot …as Straker well knew that they would .
The drug itself is never named in the series , is usually administered by syringe – or by spiking a complimentary cup of tea in the SHADO waiting - area – and predates the flashing memory - wipers of the Men In Black – who needed their ‘ neuraliser ’ device for exactly the same reason – by two decades .
2 : Brave New World – SomaIntent : Keep the people sweet , placid and a liiiittle bit hippy .
Side Effects : Hallucinations ; under excess , death due to failure of that part of the autonomous nervous system that controls breathing .
Notes :
There is a real - life muscle relaxant called carisoprodol which is also known as ‘ Soma ’ .
The intent of Huxley ’s fictional drug is to keep the citizens of his imagined utopia in perfect and blissful equilibrium , though it leaves them little prepared for the intrusion of a ‘ savage ’ from the world beyond the city limits ( this role was played by 2001 actor Keir Dullea in a widely criticised US TV mini-series in the early 1980s )
The popular rumour about Ridley Scott ’s new sci- fi project is that he will be taking on Huxley ’s classic – presumably and inevitably with Russell Crowe as the noble savage .
Actually , that sounds pretty good …
( CNN ) --
The mother of an 8 - year - old boy suspected in the shooting deaths of his father and another man said Monday that the youngster " loved his dad " and had a strong relationship with him .
" He 's a very good little boy , " Eryn Bloomfield said on ABC's " Good Morning America . "
" What happened to being innocent until proven guilty ? "
For legal reasons , Bloomfield -- who is identified in court papers as Eryn Thomas -- could not discuss details of the case .
She said she is not even allowed to discuss the case with her son .
Prosecutors in Apache County , Arizona , filed a motion Friday to dismiss one of the two murder charges against the boy -- the charge involving the death of his father .
The filing gave no explanation , saying only , " The state believes the interest of justice will be served by such a dismissal . "
Authorities last week released a videotape of the boy 's police interview in which he initially denied any involvement in the shootings , but later said he had shot his already - wounded father " because he was suffering . "
Watch the boy talk to police »
Legal questions surround the interview .
One of the boy 's defense attorneys said he was not read his rights and had no attorney or parent present .
Police have not responded publicly to those complaints .
Asked what she heard on the interview tape , Bloomfield responded , " A scared little boy , that 's what I hear -- someone who 's very afraid of what 's going on . "
" He had a very good relationship with his father .
He did a lot with him , " she said .
" They did everything together .
He loved his dad . "
She described her son as " very outgoing .
He loves animals .
He likes to ride his dirt bike , skateboarding , you know , outdoor things . "
Asked if he 's ever been in trouble at school , she replied , " No .
Not at all .
I mean , acting out as far as not raising your hand when he needs to speak -- you know , just normal stuff like that . "
The boy lived with his father , Vincent Romero , 29 , in St. Johns , Arizona .
Bloomfield lives in Mississippi .
The Apache County Superior Court clerk 's office said the latest legal agreement between the boy 's parents was from April 2006 .
The mother had weekly visitation rights and had the boy on some weekends and holidays , according to court documents .
Romero and Tim Romans , who rented a room in Romero 's home , were found dead inside the house November 5 .
Police said the next day that the boy had confessed to shooting the men with a . 22 - caliber weapon .
Watch why observers find the interrogation troubling »
The killings shook the town of about 4,000 residents near the New Mexico border .
Trying to hold back tears , Bloomfield told ABC that her son is scared and living alone at a juvenile detention center .
The other children were removed so that older juveniles could not influence him " in the wrong way , " she said .
" So he 's in there by himself , in his cell by himself , " she said .
Authorities have said the boy is attending school at the detention facility .
Apache County Court Administrator Betty Smith said earlier this month , " Every effort is being made to see that he 's comfortable . "
Bloomfield described heart - wrenching visits -- 30 minutes each day -- when she can speak to her son through a glass partition .
" I get two visits with him that are physical visits -- to where we sit in a room and he will come and sit in my lap pretty much the whole time and hold onto me , " she added .
She will be allowed 48 hours with him at home over the Thanksgiving holiday , she said .
" We 're going to watch movies , play games , try to keep things normal as possible , " she said , adding that the boy had picked out the movie " Kung Fu Panda . "
Officials from the juvenile detention center and a court - appointed guardian will be present during the visit , Smith said .
According to a report in The Arizona Republic , Judge Michael Roca warned the media not to contact the juvenile .
" The minor is off - limits , " he said , according to the newspaper .
" I think common decency should protect him , but , just in case , he is not to be contacted . "
Asked what she 'll say to him on Thanksgiving , Bloomfield answered , " I tell him every day that I love him , and I do n't know how much more I can express that , but I definitely plan on doing that -- just to let him know that I 'm here for him and how much I do love him . "
All About Murder and Homicide • Arizona
I am a physician who has covered the health of presidential candidates for 36 years .
Since 1980 , The Times has made it a practice to question nominees for president and other high political offices and , with their permission , their doctors about their health .
The Times has requested such interviews with Mr. Obama since last spring and with Mr. McCain and his doctors since March 2007 .
None were granted .
More recently , The Times sent letters to all four nominees requesting interviews about their health with them and their doctors .
None agreed .
The candidates ’ health has drawn little attention for most of this long campaign season despite the importance of the issue .
But since Mr. McCain selected Ms. Palin as his running mate in August , questions about his health have intensified .
In recent weeks , more than 2,700 physicians have signed a petition that ran as an advertisement demanding that Mr. McCain fully release his health records ; the petition is sponsored by Brave New Films , the company led by Robert Greenwald , a Hollywood filmmaker who has contributed $ 2,250 to Democratic candidates and has made a number of anti-McCain videos .
Beyond the advertisement , Mr. McCain ’s health has become the subject of both speculation and distortion on the Internet and other media .
The following is a summary of the publicly known medical information about all four nominees and the outstanding questions about each .
John McCain
Mr. McCain ’s difficulty raising his arms and his sometimes awkward gait are remnants of severe , untreated injuries he suffered in Vietnam .
Mr. McCain , a Navy pilot , broke both arms and his right knee when his jet was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967 .
He experienced additional wounds while being tortured during his five and a half years as a prisoner of war .
Mr. McCain may eventually need joint replacements , according to his doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , Ariz .
Mr. McCain has released more details about his health than the other three nominees , though he has done so in a phased way and has apparently not agreed to any extensive interviews about his health .
A handful of reporters were allowed to view his records during his bid for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination .
Another group of reporters were permitted to see newer records last May .
By not allowing reporters to interview him or his doctors extensively about his entire medical history , he has made it impossible to get a complete picture of his diagnoses and treatment .
In 1999 , early in his first run for the presidency , Mr. McCain allowed a small number of reporters , including me , to review an estimated 1,500 pages of his medical records without photocopying or recording the information .

We ca n’t quite call chocolate a health food , but if you are going to indulge do so mindfully with Antidote Chocolate , which will serve you a lot better than your run -of - the - mill Nestle .
The brand has a line consisting of low sugar milk chocolate bars and dark chocolate bars sprinkled with things like mango and ginger .

The type , shape and color of clouds can actually tell a great deal about what is going on within them , what time of day it is as well as what they portend for the near future of local weather systems .
From bright blue sunny skies and other amazing air phenomena and formations to multicolored thunderclouds and chilling airborne disasters and weather patterns , multiple - exposure HDR photography of the sky can capture many amazing sky colors and cloud formations that are otherwise difficult to shoot .

When it comes to air photography the most prominent interplay is between cloud and air .
While many shots show a beautiful range of whites and blues , what we think of as the traditional colors of the sky , some photographers have managed to capture the other colors in the rainbow – often when there is an intersection of weather systems and some kind of storm on the horizon .

This concludes week four of a four - week four - elements series , including amazing air phenomena and formations and chilling airborne disasters and weather patterns .
This morning in NYC international pranksters The Yes Men and The Anti-Advertising Agency printed and distributed thousands of copies of a fake version of the New York Times dated July 4 , 2009 with the headline “ Iraq War Ends ” .
They recruited volunteers through the website Because We Want It to distribute the fake paper .
Gawaker describes how the prank came together and here ’s the reaction from the New York Times .
There is also an online version of the fake paper , including a PDF .
UPDATE 1 : Noneck has a few copies of the fake NYT that he is selling on eBay .
UPDATE 2 : Here ’s a CNN interview with Andy Bichlbaum ( The Yes Men ) and Steve Lambert ( Anti-Advertising Agency ) .
UPDATE 3 : De Beers Threatens Legal Action Against Fake New York Times
If you ’re one of the millions of California voters who helped pass Proposition 2 on November 4 , chances are pretty good that your Thanksgiving meal will include some sort of free - range , hormone - free dead bird — or , if you fall into the veg camp , maybe a more benign Tofurky or Field Roast .
But for illegal poachers like Peter Ciraula of Gilroy , California , odds are good that the celebratory meal will include breast of snow goose , leg of endangered sandhill crane , or perhaps a pot-pie of protected swan .
[ social_buttons ]
“ [ Ciraula ] said he was going to eat some of them , ” said Department of Fish and Game warden Patrick Foy , “ But when we asked him why he had so many , he never really never offered up a very valid explanation . ”
Ciraula had more than 300 dead and wounded wild birds in his possession when he was busted by the Feds last January — approximately 289 more birds than the legal limit allows .
Ciraula pleaded no contest but was found guilty of poaching on November 14 and sentenced to two years probation .
He was also banned from hunting for one year .
The California Department of Fish and Game says they ’ve not seen bird poaching on this scale since the early 1900s , and Foy says it ’s a growing trend that can be chalked up to difficult economic times .
“ We will absolutely see more poachers in our numbers , ” he grimly prognosticated .
Perhaps those considering illegal poaching to sustain themselves through difficult financial times should instead seek out the local , legal , and a lot less messy Food Not Bombs dispensary .

It looks as though one of San Francisco ’s last public pansexual Sex Club and BDSM playspaces , The Power Exchange , is at risk .
The owner of the building is selling , and the future of the place is uncertain .
On those nights where the filthynastypiglut in you wants to be ogled and leered at and objectified by complete strangers who seem to often take a Mystery Science Theater 3000 approach to watching sex acts , there ’s no place like the Power Exchange .
This is one of my favourite scene memories from PE .
I had zero expectation that Sir would actually say “ Yes ” when I suggested we stop in at Power Exchange in the waning hours of the evening .
Dinner had been really great , and I expected to be dropped at my flat .
Turning onto
Otis , the red lights framing PE were gleaming at the end of the block .
I laughed after I suggested we stop …. we had no toys , and were not in any sort of fetish wear .
But there was a space right in front , and Sir was game … so in we went .
The price was right , as it turned out : couples were free .
The lounge area upstairs seemed to have been remodeled : vending machines had replaced the snack bar .
The usual lookyloos skirted the fringes , watching for something to watch .
We strolled through the mostly empty rooms … not too thrilled with the new chain - spider web now clogging up the perfectly good suspension beam .
Sir theorized it was an attempt to get people to actually use the equipment : probably not too many people doing suspensions from the beam .
Too sad , that !
Wandering downstairs , we toured the place ; almost totally empty , save for the quiet observers .
I was rather surprised at the way they moved … unobtrusive , and rather subtle , until there was some action .
Then they became voracious consumers , absorbing all they could of the energy of the sex happening near them .
A fascinating dynamic .
We paused in a room with an exam table and a rubber sheeted bed .
Somewhere , a hidden camera filmed the goings - on in this room .
We were alone at first , but within moments of Sir reaching into my shirt and pulling on my nipple , partly exposing my breast , the hungry watchers materialized to see .
Strolling through the main play area , surrounded by the fencing , we checked out all of the side rooms , peeked in on the wankers in the TV room , and wound up in the ‘ bullpen ’ area .
After securing a chain across the break in the fence , Sir turned to me , flipped me around and up against the cross .
I was giggling a bit , as I thought this would be light and easy .
We had no toys or the usual accoutrements of BDSM along for the ride : how far could it go ?
Pressed against the cross , my forehead against the cool wood , I felt his fingers fasten on to my breasts , the nipple trapped again between his fingers .
And he began pinching .
Several seconds went by as I realized the pressure he was applying was indeed becoming extremely painful …my head was swimming and tears blurred my eyes .
I wriggled , trying to escape .
That bought be several hard slaps to my ass and another shove against the cross .
More wriggling , more shoving .
Those hands , capable of inflicting a bruising pinch strayed not far from my breasts for some time .
Turning me around , he pulled my breasts away from my chest , stretching them painfully .
I panted , trying to breather more deeply .
He smiled .
How is it that a smile can warm and chill me simultaneously ?
Pulling me towards him by the tips of my breasts , he leaned down to kiss me , breath smoky and sweet from the Havana cigar and port he ’d consumed after dinner .
I was pushed roughly against the cross again , as he pondered what to do with me …. slapping the insides of my thighs was the next place he went .
Loud resounding slaps were followed by my yowls and moans .
The flesh was immediately sensitized , and it was all I could do to stand and take the next slap .
Soon , it was too much and my legs reflexively closed .
“ Spread your legs . ”
I shook my head and squeezed them even more tightly together .
Grabbing a handful of the hair on my labia , he pulled and twisted till I screamed .
“ Spread your legs . ”
He repeated , and I did so with alacrity .
Slapping my thighs again , I was heaving with the intensity of the stinging blows .
My legs shook , and his hand between them was not helping .
“ Look at you …your pussy is wet already . ”
Of course it was .
He turned me around even more roughly , and then something occurred to him
“ Oh … but I do have a toy . ” I heard metal strike metal , and a slipping sound , then a loud “ pop ” .
His belt : 2 ” wide and heavy , it makes a formidable toy indeed .
Quick strikes all over my ass convinced me that this was indeed to be taken seriously .
Even more so when he began to whip me with it .
If it can be cracked , he can crack it , and crack it he did .
The first whip - like crack lit up my nerves and skin instantaneously .
I whirled around , moaning .
“ Oh…that …HURT ! ! ”
“ Up against the cross . ” He said .
I complied .
Slowly .
Pop , Pop , Pop , three more cracks exploded against my skin , and I was unable to remain in position .
Pushing myself away from the cross I was immediately met with a hand on my head yanking me around .
I was stuttering ; a first indicator that I was slipping away .
“ N- n - no - no - no - no…pl-pl-please…sttttop … ”
Oh the luxury of being able to plead for mercy and knowing that there is none coming …
Facing him , I could watch the curve and arc of the belt as the looped end leaped from his hand and contacted my reddened thighs .
“ Please ! ” I wailed “ Sir … .. oh god … . ”
I instinctively threw up my hands to ward off further blows , my head shaking from side to side .
He was not to be deterred , the blows came faster ; legs , thighs , breasts , belly , arms , a hip exposed as I tried to turn away , all of these were targets for the terribly delicious belt .
From the corner of my eye I could see the denizens of the dark corners watching , sometimes there would be no one there , then the next moment a crowd of twenty would assemble , and then drift away like living fogbanks .
His black bandanna came from his back left pocket and blindfolded me , and he brutally shoved me against the cross I was while my back and ass were covered , inch by inch , with lashes from the belt .
The pain was fantastical , I was unable to speak coherently , and I was in heaven .
Through the haze I hear the jingling of metal … suddenly the jagged edges of house keys are biting my hot skin , the ends catching on fresh welts , the teeth leaving long scratches and I twist about , trying to escape the inescapable .
How long I gratefully reveled in the sweet agony he provided , I ca n’t say .
He reached around my body … pinching hard on my pussy ; I struggled again as the shimmery orgasm pillaged my thoughts , leaving me light and hot .
Slowly my breathing began to normalise , the shaking ebbing .
“ Did I tell you to stop coming ? ” He coldly inquired .
As though I had been plugged into a direct current , the enervating jolt sent me over the edge again and again … I was babbling and purring and crying all at once .
After many long minutes , he pulled back my head .
“ Good girl .
Now kiss my boots . ”
Sinking to the concrete floor , the floor that I would never , under normal circumstances , dream of sitting down on even fully dressed , but on which I now prostrated myself without hesitation , my lips caress the leather , warm to the touch and so wonderful .
He strokes my hair as I kneel up .
I could stay there at his feet all night .
Sounds began to filter back in ; the raucous music , the murmurs from another room , the squawk of the security guard who , we discover later , was there because some patrons had been a bit …concerned …by the woman screaming “ No! Stop ! ” in the downstairs .
He seemed to possess the good sense to know a solid scene when he saw one , and remained to keep an eye on things .
A hearty thank you to the PE security guy with the big old earlobes !
We stuck around a bit more , as I tried to reach coherency , and we replenished ourselves with water and juice .
It was well after midnight now ; we ’d been there for almost two hours …. where had the time gone ?
I was drained yet energized , tired and awake , exhausted but completely content .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman told NBC's Tom Brokaw that he regretted some of his statements attacking Barack Obama during the campaign but declined to offer an apology .
" I do regret as I said to the caucus and afterward publicly , there were some things I said in the heat of the campaign that I wish I had said more clearly .
Other things , frankly , I wish I had n't said at all , " said Lieberman .
" That happens to all of us in the heat of it campaign but nonetheless , I regret it and I want to move forward . "
Brokaw pressed Lieberman for an apology .
" I heard word ' regret ' but not the word ' apology . ' "
" You can take from the word regret what you will , " answered Lieberman .

It 's 11-2-2016 and as I sit here in the studio pondering life and the past year I am full of anticipation .
I anticipate the new year with renewed excitement and the new avenues it will present .
That 's the great thing about life ; every day is a new adventure .
As I approach my 13th year anniversary of business I am so thankful for the people that have been a part of my success .
First to my wife Susan and to my two blessings , Erin and Jacob .
They are the motivation for me to get out of bed each morning .
And part of why I do what I do .
My other motivation many would feel is money and they would be partly correct .
We all have to feed our families .
But for me that is only part of why I do what I do .
The fact is , I Love the Guitar !
But not just guitar , I love all aspects of the instrument .
I love playing music with my Church Choir .
I love sitting and brainstorming just how I can improve my muse and the instrument itself .
Yes , it 's hard work running a business .
Many are not aware but monteallums.com , LLC is not my main job .
My main job is being a father but I also work a full - time job as a Pre-Press Tech for a local printer .
So I get up at 4:30 am head to the studio check e-mail and fill a few orders and answer a few e-mails .
I then head off to my 40 hour plus day job where I work until 5 pm .
I come home work out for 30 minutes on my Treadmill , take a shower and head back to the studio where I spend the next few hours answering e-mail and filling orders , ordering parts , doing research , illustrating , digital photography and of late also editing video .
All this from a Apple Mac Pro .
When I started out 15 years ago I knew a good bit about guitar , having played since I was 11 years old .
I was also pretty good at recording and producing music on a Mac .
That was my passion along with playing with the choir at church .
At the time Susan and I had no children but we decided we wanted to start a family .
But we did not want to give our children over to the state to educate .
We decided Susan would quit her outside - the - home job and raise our children .
That meant there would be a big hole in our income .
So I decided that I would try and use my knowledge of the guitar to make up for the loss in income .
There was a piece of electronic equipment at my day job that would output printing proofs and as a waste hypobaric would leave these 30 " x 25 " metallic sheets of material .
Since the company would throw these away I thought why not repurpose them .
I got the idea one day of using them to cut out shielding to place on the back of pickguards .
I started placing them on eBay and selling them .
They sold so well that I eventually sold enough of them to become an eBay Powerseller .
Eventually I created a website and the rest is history .
While pickguard shields were eventually what got it all started , pedal mods is when business really took off .
I have no electronic engineering degree so I made a ton of rookie mistakes .
But what I lack in knowledge I make up in tenacity .
I am a pretty fast learner , okay I 'm a slow learner , ; - 0 and eventually learned to read schematics .
I have recently decided to start designing pickguards and I am currently in the process of having a few initial designs manufactured .
I am also in the initial stages of creating instructional videos .
The wheels are always turning .
I am always looking for new ways to enhance the playing experience for myself and for others .
I look toward 2017 , and the future , with a sense of renewed anticipation .
But most of all I want to say Thank You for all your support over the years .
May
God richly bless you and yours !

As a guitarist of some 50 plus years I am a devoted student of the instrument .
Always searching for ways to enhance the playing experience .
The eNut and my alternative tuning offsets are two of those enhancements .
If you have n't tried them please let me encourage you to .
For those that have an ear to hear , it is a revolutionary advancement in guitar tuning .
And the best part , it 's a paultry $ 20 .
It will be the best $ 20 you will ever spend on your guitar .
Tweaking the tone of inexpensive stomp boxes is an obsession of mine .
I started modding mainly because I refused to spend $ 200 to $ 300 or more to achieve great tone .
Most boutique pedals are clones of other inexpensive pedals anyway with the main difference being higher quality components .
By upgrading the signal path and changing a few component values here and there , cheap inexpensive pedals can be drastically improved .
Take for example the Boss DS - 1 .
You can buy them new for $ 40 .
I 've personally bought used DS - 1s off eBay for $ 25 .
Add one of my mod kits and for well under $ 100 and a little soldering time you 've got a pedal that will rival pedals costing five times as much .
Add to that the fact that YOU personally took a very bad sounding pedal and made it usable .
There 's a certain level of self - satisfaction that I get knowing that I added a personal touch to a piece of gear that I use .
Take my new Chip Adapter Mods .
You will not find these types of mods available from any other modder .
This is a major breakthrough for DIY .
The opamp is where the tone takes shape .
Upgrading the toneless inline chips with a more Hi-Fi Dual Opamp such as the Burr Brown OPA2134PA will transform the tone of my already popular mods into even better mods .
Add to that the ability to swap out different opamps and you 've got a very effective tone - shaping tool .

WARNING  I have seen aluminum pickguards on sale for cheap on eBay .
Aluminum will make your entire pickguard microphonic sending your pickups into feedback hell .
DO NOT USE ALUMINUM !
Non-Ferous
Steel that I use is the only metal material ( other than brass ) that will not interfere with your guitar 's pickups .
12-9-2016  I am being faced with a growing dilemma .
Many of the parts I use in my kits are no longer available here in the states .
Surface mount technology is now mostly being used by pedal manufacturers .
SMD components are very difficult to mod .
I find myself having to source parts in Asia .
Many manufacturers like Panasonic are no longer making the Capacitors I use .
Not to worry .
Even though when buying I have to order minimum order quantities in the thousands they are readily available .
So , happily , modding will continue for years to come .

9-11-2013  I was surfing a particular guitar forum yesterday when I came across a thread about a BD - 2 mod .
In the thread I was being ripped apart by a poster .
Further in the thread it became apparent that the guy ripping into me was actually offering mods for sale .
I understand that tone is subjective and my mods may not please everyone and I can deal with that .
But when another mod creator rips another that should be a red flag .
If someone has to toot their own horn then it usually means they are insecure about their own talents or have Ulterior motives .
In this particular case it was clear to me this guy was trying to sell his wares .
One thing I do n't do is trash other people mods on a forum .
In fact I have the utmost respect for Robert Keeley , etc .
It 's sad when someone feels they have to put someone else down to make themselves look better .

But this one came about in a very different way .
I use my computer and amp modeling software when rehearsing for choir .
This way I can use headphones and practice without disturbing anyone .
My favorite guitar modeling software is the Waves GTR3 Tool Rack .
I discovered the preset a few weeks ago and it quickly became my favorite amp sim .
I noticed a similarity in the gain structure between it and the BD - 2 .
The BD - 2 has the ability with a few tweaks to take on a very fuzz type gain .
So I decided to try and simulate the preset by creating a mod .
I 've been working on it for some time and I have gotten very close with this new mod .
I am still in the finalizing stage and making a few tweaks here and there but I am stoked about this new mod .
Very few mods have excited me the way this one has .
It is just very inspiring to play .
When I have finalized it I will make a video and demonstrate what it will do .
Keep an eye on the site for this very exciting mod .
Monte Allums 
I am extremely excited about a new mod I am currently working on for the Boss BD - 2 .
This will be my fourth mod for the BD - 2 .
This one came about in rather a strange way .
I usually model a mod after a particular tube amp or sometimes I just try and play to the strengths of a particular pedal and just improve on it .
But this one came about in a very different way .
I use my computer and amp modeling software when rehearsing for choir .
This way I can use headphones and practice without disturbing anyone .

Here is a screen shot of the actual preset for those that wave the software .

This is just a very cool mod !
It will work equally well for bass and guitar with no special tweaking .

I look forward to attending in the future !
I think I 'll have to write an app in Haskell first though , so I can understand more of the ICFP talks ;)

FORT CAMPBELL , KY– On Thursday , October 30 , a military family member reported two men pretending to be a casualty notification officer and chaplain visited her home and falsely notified her that her deployed Soldier had been killed .
The man impersonating the notification officer was wearing a Class A “ dress green ” uniform and the other was wearing civilian clergy attire .
There have been a few incidents of this nature in the past two months involving family members living off post , but Thursday ’s incident occurred on post .
The spouse did not allow the pair into her home and when they left contacted the Family Readiness Support Assistant and Rear Detachment Commander to confirm the information .
The command let her know her spouse is still alive and worked to put him in contact with her as soon as possible .
Military police were notified and a police report was taken at the scene .
Before Soldiers deploy , they and their families are offered a series of briefings to prepare for the separation .
One of those briefings is about the casualty notification process .
When a Soldier dies , a notification officer and military chaplain , both in Class A uniform , not civilian clergy attire , are sent to notify the next of kin in person .
Family members can confirm the information with the Soldier ’s unit .
Typically , the notification team will not leave the family member ’s home until a friend , another family member or arrives to assist .
Anyone with information about the false notification incidents are encouraged to contact Fort Campbell Police at ( 270 ) 798-2677 .
Anyone who believes they are being falsely notified should call 911 to alert local police immediately .

Tim Leuliette , the newly crowned CEO of auto supplier Dura Automotive Systems Inc. , is at it again .
Six years ago he scolded the auto makers for their terrible relationship with their suppliers .
Now , using a seminar given by the Center for Automotive Research as his platform , he wants them to know they 're all idiots for not preparing for life after $ 4 gas ( WSJ ) :
[ Tim Leuliette ] said in prepared remarks that " we had warning .
We knew gasoline prices would rise .
We watched as the emerging markets demanded more and more of the oil .
As a nation , we did nothing .
As an industry , we pretended that cheap oil would last forever . " ...
" We had no plan to quickly import fuel - efficient vehicles , " he said , according to prepared remarks .
" There was no plan to make up the lost profit loss caused by the rapid drop in SUV and truck sales . "
How refreshing .
As General Motors ( GM ) Rick Wagoner tells it , the oil price spike was a one - in - a- million act of God .
It was n't , of course .
But the auto industry 's biggest failure was n't a failure to see the future .
It was a failure to be ready no matter what .

According to the environmental group Panalipdan - Southern Mindanao Region ( SMR ) , one of their leaders — Fernando “ Dodong ” Sarmiento — has been brutally murdered .
[ social_buttons ]
Francis Morales , the spokesperson for Panalipdan - SMR , said that “ Dodong Sarmiento sustained 5 gun - shot wounds that resulted to his death . ”
Sarmiento is the first environmentalist killed after the formation of the aptly titled Investment Defense Force ( IDF ) started under the Arroyo administration .
“ We condemn in the strongest term the brutal killing of Dodong Sarmiento , who is known for leading the rural folks of New Bataan in calling for the stoppage of the operations of PhilCo Mining Corporation , the planned exploration of other mining corporations and mining - instigated militarization under the command of 10th Infantry Division , citing as reasons for their resistance on the destruction that large - scale mining operations brought on people ’s livelihoods and local ecosystems ” , Morales stressed .
Under the Arroyo regime , 24 environmentalists have been killed in opposition to mining projects based on the documentation of Kalikasan People ’s Network for the Environment .
“ This is a typical mode of operation of the military in implementing the Oplan Bantay Laya 2 in the rural areas of Compostela Valley wherein activist leaders were maligned and demonized first before being killed ” , Morales furthered .
“ The environmental group believes that Sarmiento was killed by military elements due to his advocacies .
Last 16 July 2008 , Sarmiento was interrogated by the elements of 28th Infantry Batallion , Philippine Army ( IBPA ) under Lt. Wendel Ariola for his active involvement in environmental campaigns and was accused as rebel supporter .
Then on 22 July 2008 , the military posted on its website falsely claiming that Sarmiento was a rebel surrenderee ” , Morales divulged .
Sarmiento , 39 , was Secretary General of Panalipdan - New Bataan and a anti-large scale mining activist .

The first of four House Select Committee on Hurricane Ike hearings kicked off this morning at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel .
Chaired by Rep. Sylvester Turner ( we like to call these the “ Ike - Turner ” hearings ) , the Committee ’s goal , as explained by Turner , “ is to come out of these hearings with specific recommendations for all levels of government , business and community organizations to put us in a better position to deal with another hurricane . ”
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , Port of Houston Chairman James Edmonds , and CenterPoint Energy President Tom Standish testified during the first half of the day , with more speakers scheduled throughout the day .
Unfortunately , one critical party rejected Turner ’s invitation – FEMA .
Turner said that FEMA declined on the grounds that , as a federal agency , it does n’t deal with state matters .
“ Arrogance will get you nowhere , ” Turner said .
“ I think we ’ll deal with that on down the road . ”
This left more time for Jackson Lee to talk about what she thought was a delayed reaction by insurance companies to process claims , and her belief that some companies were unfairly rejecting claims , saying certain damages were n’t caused directly by the hurricane .
She also emphasized the need for a “ Citizen Corps ” -- neighborhood - action groups that would communicate certain areas ’ needs to local and state officials .
The next meetings are scheduled for December 3 at the Johnnie Arolfo Civic Center in League City ; December 10 at Lamar State College in Orange ; and the fourth hearing site is still being scheduled .

Energizer to Release Portable Solar Battery Charger
December 19th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
GoodCleanTech reports that Energizer plans on debuting its portable solar - powered AA and AAA battery charger at January ’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
The slick - looking gadget is completely weatherproof and comes with a USB port to power electronics .
Energizer ’s device can also be charged from an AC outlet just in case the sun lets you down .
The company plans on releasing the charger this summer for $ 49.99 — not a bad price for freedom from wall outlets .

But you know what ?
Pixels are overrated .
Nobody will complain about the sharpness of the Pico ’s image , especially after you find just the right spot on its little Focus dial .
Over all , the Pico does surprisingly well .
So what can you watch on this thing ?
It comes with a special composite cable .
On one end , there ’s a special , tiny audio - video pin that goes into the projector .
On the other end , you ’ll find the familiar three - headed , red - white - yellow RCA cables .
These are female jacks , made to mate with the male composite cables that come with just about every DVD player , VCR , game console , digital camera and camcorder ever sold .
So in a pinch , the Pico projector could replace a TV set when you ’re using full - size gear like DVD players or game consoles .
But the true mission of the Pico ’s miraculous miniaturization is connecting to fellow micro-gadgets : digital cameras , cellphones , iPods or iPhones , for example .
The necessary adapter for the iPod or iPhone comes with the projector .
Old video iPods require only the short black cable , which goes into the iPod ’s headphone jack but carries both audio and video .
You also get a plastic nub that snaps onto the bottom of the iPhone or more recent iPods ; the short black cable connects the nub to the projector .
( The projector produces an image only when videos are playing .
It does n’t show , for example , the iPhone ’s Web browser , e-mail program or other applications -- a shame for instructors or anyone else who might like a way to demonstrate the iPhone ’s workings to more than one audience member at a time . )
To connect a digital camera , so you can show off your stills or your videos , or to connect your camcorder , you use the composite TV cable that came with it .
Optoma plans to make adapter cables available for other smartphones in the coming months , starting with a Nokia cable for $ 10 .
The Pico projector does so much so well with so little , it might sound ungrateful to bring up its one really embarrassing shortfall .
But somebody has to say it :
What about the sound ?

Security bloggers network releases a handy new tool to help you hunt down botnets on your network .
Belsec has put together a handy new tool to help you hunt down botnets that might be running on your network .
As far as cool tools go , downloading it and playing with it this morning was more fun than a person should be allowed to have .
Ramping it up on the corporate and the home networks gave out two very interesting pictures on what botnets are running on ( or not running on ) the computers that you own .
This is definitely a tool worth playing with and seeing if it can do something for you if you are worried about botnets .
This is also a great research tool , because you can tie this into other tools to come up with very interesting botnet maps .
The data output can be scrapped and dumped into Google earth via IP address .
The distros are : Unix Distribution v1.0.1 ( beta 2 ) – 21 October 2008 , Linux : tested on Fedora , Red Hat Enterprise Linux , Debian , and SuSE distributions , FreeBSD : tested on Product Release 7.0 , Mac OS X : tested on Tiger and Leopard , Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5 Coming Soon ( Sometime in October 2008 ) are : Windows XP Distribution v1.0.1 – TBD October 2008 , BotHunter - Win32-v1.0.1.exe , ( MD5 = Coming Soon – Halloween 2008 ) we will inform you , Windows XP : this self - installing Win32 executable will install all necessary supporting packages Live - CD Distribution v1.0.1 – TBD October 2008 , BotHunter -LiveCD.v1.0.1.ISO , ( MD5 = Coming Soon – Halloween 2008 ) , Live - CD : this is a self - booting ISO image of Bothunter operating on Ubuntu Linux
The live CD distro is probably going to be more fun as it can turn any computer into a botnet hunter without having to undo the original computer underneath it , but you will want a computer to take the data feed so that you can play around with the data output .
Worth checking out , and a fun new toy for Monday .

CANBERRA ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Inspired by a documentary about eating only McDonald ’s for 30 days , Jenna Norwood decided to go for the opposite and only eat raw , organic food for a month with the result sparking major lifestyle changes -- and a movie .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The 2004 film “ Super Size Me ” followed American filmmaker Morgan Spurlock for 30 days when he ate food only from McDonald ’s and supersized his meal every time he was asked -- and he put on 24.5 pounds and suffered mood swings and liver damage .
Florida - based Norwood said this got her thinking about what would happen if you only ate healthy food for a month so she decided to try it , keen to slim into a showgirl costume for Halloween , with a film crew following her during that time .
The result ?
A weight loss of 15 pounds , improved vision , higher energy levels , and a documentary called “ Supercharge Me! 30 Days Raw ” which has won several awards at independent films festivals with a wide release expected in January .
She decided to continue with her new regime after the 30 days and lost another 15 pounds , taking her down to about 122 pounds and with people starting to mistake her for younger than her 42 years .
“ Things happened beyond my expectations .
I had been a vegetarian for 26 years but I was an unhealthy vegetarian , eating a lot of junk and processed foods and always eating on the run , ” Norwood told Reuters in a telephone interview .
“ This led to an absolute , complete change for me . ”
Since her month on raw food three years ago , Norwood has left her job in public relations , completed her documentary , started a raw food group , and opened two raw food restaurants in Sarasota , Florida .
Norwood says she continues to eat mainly raw food and her restaurants will serve raw and dehydrated food , in which the water is removed from food by blowing warm air over it for hours .
“ Food exposed to a very low heat over a prolonged period of time can give very different textures and flavors , ” she said .
Norwood said eating raw did not have to be dull .
Wine is distilled not fermented so is raw and you can get raw chocolate .
“ If it were n’t for raw chocolate I do n’t know if I could do this .
We make raw chocolate brownies and truffles from which you can get all the satisfaction you need , ” she said .
STARBUCKS was blasted by environmental experts last night after The Sun discovered it pours millions of litres of precious water down the drain at its coffee shops .
The giant coffee chain has a policy of keeping a tap running non-stop at all its 10,000 outlets worldwide , wasting 23.4 MILLION litres a day .
That would provide enough daily water for the entire two million - strong population of drought - hit Namibia in Africa or fill an Olympic pool every 83 minutes .
Every Starbucks branch has a cold tap behind the counter providing water for a sink called a “ dipper well ” , used for washing spoons and utensils .
Staff are banned from turning the water off under bizarre health and safety rules — bosses claim a constant flow stops germs breeding in the taps .
Starbucks has built up a massive chain , popular with coffee drinkers from Hollywood stars to builders , and proudly boasts of its work for the environment .
But water companies accused the firm of HARMING the environment by frittering away a vital natural resource .
ClaimAnd the claim that running taps are needed for hygiene reasons was dismissed by experts as “ nonsense ” .
Starbucks has 698 branches in Britain , each open for 13 hours a day .
Even a slow flowing tap spurts out at least three litres of water a minute , meaning UK Starbucks are wasting an estimated 1.63 MILLION litres a day .
That is the daily water requirement for a town the size of Matlock , Derbyshire .
And water shortage is seen as one of the major problems facing the world .
A single Starbucks tap left running for just over three minutes wastes the amount of water one African needs to survive for a day in drought conditions .
The Sun investigated after a Starbucks executive revealed the policy in a letter to a couple who complained about a tap left running at their local branch .
Lisa Woolfe , 39 , of Cuffley , Herts , said : “ I noticed a small sink behind the counter had its tap running .
The assistant said the store was told to keep it running as it cleaned the pipes .
I could not believe it but when we contacted head office , they confirmed that the taps were left on and the water was not recycled .
“ It is an absolutely astonishing waste of water , especially for a company which prides itself on its green credentials .
” Our undercover team checked Starbucks outlets across the UK and around the world and found some baffled staff did not use the running tap and did not even know what it was for .
At Starbucks in Covent Garden , London , a worker shrugged and said : “ We ’ve got to keep it like that .
I do n’t know why .
” In Bristol a tap was seen running full on for 15 minutes .
Similar scenes were witnessed in Derby , Nottingham , Manchester , Birmingham and Bath .
On 52nd Street New York , a tap was running the whole time our investigators were there and nothing was cleaned under it .
It was the same in Los Angeles and in Sydney , Australia .
Australia is in the grip of a seven - year drought which is the worst for a century .
Staff at one of the 50 Starbucks in Beijing , China , threatened to call cops as we photographed a running tap .
A spokesman for UK Water , which represents water companies , was horrified by our findings .
He said : “ It is wasteful and unnecessary .
There is absolutely no need to keep taps running .
” Peter Robinson , of environmental charity Waste Watch , said : “ Leaving taps running all day is a shocking waste of precious water .
And to claim you are doing it for health and safety reasons is bonkers .
“ Tap water comes from rivers and groundwater and wasting it can cause great harm to the environment and wildlife .
Big companies should set an example .
” Jacob Tompkins , of independent water efficiency agency Water Wise , said : “ If they are doing all their basic cleaning procedures , I fail to see why they would need to do this .
“ There are a lot of other ways to stop a build - up of bacteria .
“ The chance of a build - up in the spout is extremely remote .
And if there is one they ’re not cleaning the tap properly .
” Ian Barker , head of water resources at the Environment Agency , added : “ We are already taking too much water from the environment and are seeing reduced river flows .
” In Vienna , Austria , Starbucks staff confirmed the tap was always left running .
In Cluj , Romania — also hit by a drought — a Starbucks worker said of the tap : “ We do n’t know what it is .
Nobody ever uses it . ”
In her much - acclaimed book , The End of America , Naomi Wolf describes a “ fascist shift ” along tried and true lines , including manufacturing external threats , arbitrary search , seizure and detention , secret prisons and torture , surveillance of ordinary citizens , infiltration of citizens ’ groups , targeting and labeling dissenters as traitors , restricting the press and , cutting across all of the foregoing , subverting the rule of law .
Ms. Wolf ’s new book , Give Me Liberty : A Handbook for American Revolutionaries , is a call for citizen action to restore the freedoms and rights we ’ve lost .
Give Me Liberty is more of a detailed procedures manual than a handbook , but both descriptors shortchange this book .
Its five - page table of contents outlines a well - structured case , beginning with discussions of “ fake ” patriotism and democracy and seven core American values that are being subverted ; and closing with a comprehensive and creative user ’s guide for individuals and groups who want them back .
Ms. Wolf makes frequent reference to the American constitution and Bill of Rights , whose designers wished above all to protect Americans from their own government .
She weaves together citizen duties to exercise their free speech and to protest against injustice and oppression .
She repeatedly reminds us that government by and for the people was always intended , that no ( wo ) man is above the law and that America established no god .
She blasts America ’s aggressive wars overseas , including with a telling Robert Kennedy quote : “ Over the years an understanding of what America really stands for is going to count far more than missiles , aircraft carriers and supersonic bombers . ”
After a few sections , the set - up is clear :
Here ’s what our founders intended about freedom of speech or religion or the right to privacy .
Here ’s what our greatest leaders have said about them over the centuries .
Here ’s what we ’ve got today .
It is eerie how many of our rights and freedoms have been rolled back so excessively ; and scary how we have come to accept and even expect them .
Fearsome enemies and perpetual wars on terror , crime and drugs will do that to a society .
Ms. Wolf is persuasive in exposing citizens ’ feelings of powerlessness and inaction as un-American activities .
Her user ’s guide provides the ideas and civic tools to take this country back .
Ms. Wolf 's guide is within the system .
Her call for peaceful ( but disruptive ) street protests is about as radical as she gets .
She runs the gamut of ways individuals and organizations can make a difference .
It is n’t easy getting heard in the corporate media ?
Here ’s how .
Yes , police and security agencies make it hard to publicly protest these days , but there are ways .
Petitioning in the Internet age .
Joining or starting movements .
Changing the laws .
Making peace and democratic reforms .
Each section ends with a list of “ additional resources . ”
The book itself ends with a wish list of other reforms for the future .
The fight for freedom either never ends , or things are just that bad .
There are no doubt readers of this review who will shake their heads , remaining convinced that there ’s nothing to worry about , it 's always been this way or nothing will ever change .
A whole lot of us are tuned out or simply do n’t care .
To which Ms. Wolf would reply :
It ’s your duty to care , as American patriots and for your kids .
Listen to Ben , who noted so famously over 200 years ago , that those who would ( sacrifice ) liberty for security deserve neither .
It ’s hard being a patriot dissenter these days .
Governments and corporations are indeed having their way with us .
But , as Ms. Wolf concludes , we ’ve got more votes .
We have the power .
I commend this book .
Inexpensive , too .

About author Richard Sharp has been a privacy and human rights manager , consultant and advocate for three decades .
Otzi , Italy ’s prehistoric “ iceman , ” probably does not have any modern - day descendants , according to a study published Thursday .
A team of Italian and British scientists who sequenced his mitochondrial DNA -- which is passed down through the mother ’s line -- found that Otzi belonged to a genetic lineage that is either extremely rare or has died out .
Otzi ’s 5,300 - year - old corpse was found frozen in the Tirolean Alps in 1991 .
“ Our research suggests that Otzi ’s lineage may indeed have become extinct , ” Martin Richards of Leeds University in Britain , who worked on the study , said in a statement .

The findings published in the journal Current Biology reverse research from 1994 on a small section of Otzi ’s DNA that suggested the iceman had relatives living in Europe .
Richards and colleagues said their analysis confirmed that Otzi belonged to a previously unidentified lineage that has not been seen to date in modern European populations .
Scientists were thrilled to find Otzi ’s mummified body had remained well preserved for more than 5,000 years .
Evidence shows he was probably a hunter .

DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM
April - June , 1938
[ This text includes about two thirds of the first chapter , and about one fifth of the first six sections of the second chapter of Mao's ' Pien - Cheng - fa wei -- wu- lun ( chiang - shou t'i - kang ) ' ( ' Dialectical materialism - notes of lectures ' ) , as published in K'ang - chan ta -hsueh , nos. 6 to 8 , April to June 1938 . ]
IDEALISM AND MATERIALISM
1. THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN TWO ARMIES IN PHILOSOPHY
The whole history of philosophy is the history of the struggle and the development of two mutually opposed schools of philosophy -- idealism and materialism .
All philosophical currents and schools are manifestations of these two fundamental schools .
All philosophical theories have been created by men belonging to a definite social class .
The ideas of these men have moreover been historically determined by a definite social existence .
All philosophical doctrines express the needs of a definite social class and reflect the level of development of the productive forces of society and the historical stage in men's comprehension of nature . . .
The social origins of idealism and materialism lie in a social structure marked by class contradictions .
The earliest appearance of idealism was the product of the ignorance and superstition of savage and primitive man .
Then , with the development of the productive forces , and the ensuing development of scientific knowledge , it stands to reason that idealism should decline and be replaced by materialism .
And yet , from ancient times to the present , idealism not only has not declined , but , on the contrary has developed and carried on a struggle for supremacy with materialism from which neither has emerged the victor .
The reason lies in the division of society into classes .
On the one hand , in its own interest , the oppressing class must develop and reinforce its idealist doctrines .
On the other hand , the oppressed classes , likewise in their own interest , must develop and reinforce their materialist doctrines .
Both idealism and materialism are weapons in the class struggle , and the struggle between idealism and materialism cannot disappear so long as classes continue to exist .
Idealism , in the process of its historical development , represents the ideology of the exploiting classes and serves reactionary purposes .
Materialism , on the other hand , is the world view of the revolutionary class ; in a class society , it grows and develops in the midst of an incessant struggle against the reactionary philosophy of idealism .
Consequently , the history of the struggle between idealism and materialism in philosophy reflects the struggle of interests between the reactionary class and the revolutionary class .
A given philosophical tendency is in the last analysis a manifestation in a particular guise of the policy of the social class to which the philosophers belong .
The distinguishing characteristic of Marxist philosophy -- i.e. , dialectical materialism -- is its effort to explain clearly the class nature of all social consciousness ( including philosophy ) .
It publicly declares a resolute struggle between its own proletarian nature and the idealist philosophy of the propertied class .
Moreover , it subordinates its own special and independent tasks to such general tasks as overthrowing capitalism , organizing and building a proletarian dictatorship , and edifying a socialist society .
2. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IDEALISM AND MATERIALISM .
Wherein lies the basic difference between idealism and materialism ?
It lies in the opposite answers given by the two to the fundamental question in philosophy , that of the relationship between spirit and matter ( that of the relationship between consciousness and existence ) .
Idealism considers spirit ( consciousness , concepts , the subject ) as the source of all that exists on earth , and matter ( nature and society , the object ) as secondary and subordinate , Materialism recognizes the independent existence of matter as detached from spirit and considers spirit as secondary and subordinate ..
3. THE SOURCE OF THE GROWTH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM .
Idealism see matter as the product of the spirit .
This is turning the real world upside down .
Where is the source of the growth and the development of such a philosophy ?
As mentioned above , the earliest manifestation of idealism was brought about by the superstition and ignorance of primitive , savage man .
But with the development of production , the separation between manual labour and intellectual labour was responsible for ranking idealism first among currents of philosophical thought .
With the development of the productive forces of society , the division of labour made its appearance ; the further development of the division of labour saw the emergence of persons devoting themselves entirely and exclusively to intellectual labour .
But when the productive forces are still weak , the division between the two does not reach the stage of complete separation .
Only after classes and private property appear and exploitation becomes the foundation of the existence of the ruling class do great changes occur .
Intellectual labour then becomes the exclusive privilege of the ruling class .
while manual labour becomes the fate of the oppressed classes .
The ruling class begins to examine the relationship between themselves and the oppressed classes in an upside - down fashion :
It is not the labourers who furnish them with means for existence , but rather they who supply the labourers with these means .
Hence , they despise manual labour and develop idealist conceptions .
To eliminate the distinction between manual labour and intellectual labour is one of the preconditions for eliminating idealist philosophy .
The social root that makes possible the development of idealist philosophy lies principally in the fact that this kind of philosophical consciousness is the manifestation of the interests of the exploiting class ...
The final decline of idealism will come with the elimination of classes , after the establishment of a communist society .
The source that enables idealism to develop and deepen and gives it the strength to struggle with materialism must be sought in the process of human knowing ..
When men think , they must use concepts .
This can easily cause our knowledge to be split into two aspects : reality , which is of an individual and particular character ; and concepts , which are of a general character ...
In the nature of things , the particular and the general are inseparably linked ; once separated , they depart from objective truth ...
To separate the general from the particular , and to view the general as objective reality and the particular merely as the form in which the general exists — this is the method adopted by all idealists .
All idealists put consciousness , spirit , or concepts in place of objective reality existing independently from human consciousness ...
They cannot point out the materialist truth according to which consciousness is limited by matter , but believe that only consciousness is active , whereas matter is only an inert composite entity .
Urged on moreover by their own class nature , the idealists then use every method to exaggerate the activity of consciousness , developing this aspect unilaterally ...
Idealism in economics exaggerates beyond measure a nonessential aspect of exchange , , raising the law of supply and demand to the status of the fundamental law of capitalism ...
Idealist historians regard heroes as the makers of history .
Idealist politicians regard politics as omnipotent .
Idealist military leaders practice the methods of desperate combat [ p' ing - ming - chu - i - ti tso- chan ] .
Idealist revolutionaries advocate Blanquism .
The diehards say that the only way to revive our nation is to restore the old morality .
All this results from exaggerating subjective factors beyond measure ...
Pre-Marxist materialism ( mechanistic materialism ) did not stress the thought process in the development of knowledge , but regarded thought merely as the object of action , as the mirror that reflects nature ...
Only dialectical materialism correctly shows the active role of thought , and at the same time points out the limitation imposed upon thought by matter .
It points out that thought arises from social practice and at the same time actively shapes practice .
Only this kind of dialectical theory of the unity of knowledge and action can thoroughly vanquish idealism .
4. THE ORIGIN OF THE INCEPTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIALISM
In the social existence of humanity , reciprocal relationships and influences arise between individuals .
In a class society there is moreover a class struggle .
The oppressed class considers the circumstances and estimates its strength , and then makes its plans .
When they succeed in the struggle , the members of this class are convinced that their views are not the product of fantasy , but the reflection of the objectively existing material world .
Because the oppressed class fails when it adopts the wrong plans and succeeds by correcting its plans it learns to understand that it can achieve its purpose only when its subjective plans rest upon the accurate understanding of the material nature of the objective world and the fact that the objective world is governed by laws .
The history of science furnishes man with proof of the material nature of the world and of the fact that it is governed by laws and helps man to see the futility of the illusions of religion and idealism and to arrive at materialist conclusions .
In sum , the history of man 's practice comprises the history of his struggle with nature , the history of the class struggle , the history of science .
Owing to the necessity to live and struggle , men have thought about the reality of matter and its laws , have proved the correctness of materialism , and have found the necessary intellectual tool for their struggle — materialist philosophy .
The higher the level to which social production develops , the greater the development of the class struggle , and the more scientific knowledge reveals the secretes of nature , the greater the development and consolidation of materialist philosophy .
Thus man can be delivered gradually from the dual and crushing oppression of nature and society . .
DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM
1. DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM IS THE REVOLUTIONARY ARM OF THE PROLETARIAT
The Chinese proletariat , having assumed at the present time the historical task of the bourgeois - democratic revolution , must make use of dialectical materialism as its mental - arm ...
The study of dialectical materialism is even more indispensable for the cadres who lead the revolutionary movement , because the two erroneous theories and methods of work of subjectivism and mechanism frequently subsist among the cadres , and as a result frequently cause the cadres to go against Marxism , and lead the revolutionary movement on to the wrong path .
If we wish to avoid or correct such deficiencies , the only solution lies in conscious study and understanding of dialectical materialism , in order to arm one 's brain anew .
2. THE RELATION BETWEEN THE OLD PHILOSOPHICAL HERITAGE AND DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM
After the May 4th Movement of 1919 , as a consequence of the conscious appearance of the Chinese proletariat on the political stage , and the rise in the scientific level of the country , a Marxist philosophical movement arose and developed in China .
In its first period , however , the level of understanding of materialist dialectics within the materialist current of thought was rather weak , and mechanistic materialism influenced by the bourgeoisie , as well as the subjectivism of Deborin , were its principal components .
Following the defeat of the revolution in 1927 the level of understanding of Marxism and Leninism progressed , and the thinking of materialist dialectics gradually developed .
Just recently , because of the severity of the national and social crisis , and also because of the influence of the movement for liquidating deviations in Soviet philosophy , a broad movement of materialist dialectics has developed in China 's intellectual circles .
Because of the backwardness of China 's social development the dialectical materialist philosophical currents developing in China today do not result from taking over and reforming our own philosophical heritage , but from the study of Marxism - Leninism .
However , if we wish to ensure that dialectical materialist thought shall penetrate profoundly in China and continue to develop , and shall moreover give firm direction to the Chinese revolution and lead it to final victory in the future , then we must struggle with all the old and rotten philosophical theories existing in China on the ideological front throughout the whole country , raise the flag of criticism and in this way liquidate the philosophical heritage of ancient China .
Only thus we can attain our goal .
3. THE UNITY OF WORLD VIEW AND METHODOLOGY IN DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM
Dialectical materialism is the world view of the proletariat .
At the same time it is the method of the proletariat for taking cognizance of the surrounding world , and the method of revolutionary action of the proletariat .
It is the unity of world view and methodology .
4. THE QUESTION OF THE OBJECT OF MATERIALIST DIALECTICS -- WHAT DO MATERIALIST DIALECTICS SERVE TO STUDY ?
Marx , Engels and Lenin all explained materialist dialectics as the theory of development ...
Under the heading of the object of philosophy we must still solve another problem , namely the problem of the unity of dialectics , logic and epistemology .
. .
Materialist dialectics is the only scientific epistemology , and it is also the only scientific logic .
Materialist dialectics studies the origin and development of our knowledge of the outside world .
It studies the transition from not knowing to knowing and from incomplete knowledge to more complete knowledge ; it studies how the laws of the development of nature and society are daily reflected more profoundly and more extensively in the mind of humanity .
This is precisely the unity of materialist dialectics with epistemology ...
The essence of the concept of development consists in regarding laws as the reflection in and transplanting to our minds ( moreover further elaborated in our minds ) of the manifestations of the movement of matter ...
Only by using materialism to arrive at a solution of the problem of the relations between existence and thought , only by taking one 's stand on the theory of the reflection , can one arrive at a thorough solution to the problems of dialectics , logic and epistemology .
5. ON MATTER
The very first condition for belonging to the materialist camp consists in recognizing the independent existence of the material world , separate from human consciousness -- the fact that it existed before the appearance of humanity , and continues to exist since the appearance of humanity , independently and outside of human consciousness .
To recognize this point is a fundamental premise of all scientific research .
How shall we demonstrate this ?
The proofs are extremely numerous .
Humanity is constantly in contact with the external world and must , moreover , struggle fiercely against the pressure and resistance of the outside world ( nature and society ) .
Moreover , we not only must , but can overcome this pressure and resistance .
All of these real circumstances of the social practice of humanity , as manifested in the historical development of human society , are the best proof [ of the existence of the material world ] .
China does not doubt the objective existence of Japanese imperialism which has invaded our country , nor of the Chinese people themselves .
The students of the Anti-Japanese Military - Political University also do not doubt the objective existence of this university and of the students themselves ...
If we consider this thing known as consciousness in the light of thoroughgoing materialism ( that is to say in the light of materialist - dialectics ) , then what we call consciousness is nothing else but a form of the movement of matter , a particular characteristic of the material brain of humanity ; it is that particular characteristic of the material brain which causes the material processes outside consciousness to be reflected in consciousness .
From this we see that when we distinguish matter from consciousness and when , moreover we oppose them one to another , this is only conditional that is to say , it has meaning only from the standpoint of epistemology .. .
In a word , matter is everything in the universe .
' All power belongs to Ssu - Ma - I . '
We say ,  All power belongs to matter . '
This is the source of the unity of the world .
6. ON MOVEMENT ( ON DEVELOPMENT )
The first fundamental principle of dialectical materialism lies in its view of matter ...
This principle of the unity of the world has already been explained above in discussing matter .
The second fundamental principle of dialectical materialism lies in its theory of movement ( or theory of development ) .
This means the recognition that movement is the form of the existence of matter , an inherent attribute of matter , a manifestation of the multiplicity of matter .
This is the principle of the development of the world .
The combination of the principle of the development of the world with the principle of the unity of the world , set forth above , constitutes the whole of the world view of dialectical materialism .
The world is nothing else but the material world in a process of unlimited development
Dialectical materialism 's theory of movement is in opposition first of all with philosophical idealism and with the theological concepts of religion .
The fundamental nature of all philosophical idealism and religious theology derives from their denial of the unity and material nature of the world ; and in imagining that the movement and development of the world takes place apart from matter , or took place at least in the beginning apart from matter , and is the result of the action of spirit , God , or divine forces , The German idealist philosopher , Hegel , held that the present world results from the development of the so - called ' world idea ' .
In China the philosophy of the Book of Changes , and the metaphysics of the Sung and Ming , all put forward idealist views of the development of the universe .
Christianity says that God created the world , Buddhism and all of China 's various fetishist religions attribute the movement and development of all the myriad phenomena ( Wan Wu ) of the universe to spiritual forces .
All of these doctrines which think about movement apart from matter are fundamentally incompatible with dialectical materialism ...
Dialectical materialism ... considers that rest or equilibrium are merely one element of movement , that they are merely one particular circumstance of movement ...
A sentence popular with the metaphysical thinkers of ancient China , ' Heaven does not change and the Way also does not change , ' corresponds to ... a theory of the immobility of the universe .
. .
In their view , the basic nature of the universe and of society was eternally unchanging .
The reason why they adopted this attitude is to be found primarily in their class limitations .
If the feudal landlord class had recognized that the basic nature of the universe and of society is subject to movement and development , then most certainly they would have been pronouncing in theory a death sentence on their own class .
The philosophies of all reactionary forces are theories of immobilism .
Revolutionary classes and the popular masses have all perceived the principle of the development of the world , and consequently advocate transforming society and the world ; their philosophy is dialectical materialism ..
The causes of the transformation of matter is to be found not without , but within .
It is not because of the impulsion of external mechanical forces , but because of the existence within the matter in question of two components different in their nature and mutually contradictory which struggle with one another , thus giving an impetus to the movement and development of the matter .
As a result of the discovery of the laws of such movement and transformation , dialectical materialism is capable of enlarging the principle of the material unity of the world , extending it to the history of nature and society .
Thus , not only it is possible to investigate the world considered as matter in perpetual movement , but the world can also be investigated as matter endlessly in movement from a lower form to a higher form .
That is to say , it is possible to investigate the world as development and process .
Dialectical materialism investigate the development of the world as a progressive movement from the inorganic to the organic , and from thence to the highest form of the movement of matter ( society ) .
What we have just discussed is the theory of the movement of the world , or the principle of the development of the world in accordance with dialectical materialism .
This doctrine is the essence of Marxist philosophy .
If the proletariat and all revolutionaries take up this consistently scientific arm , they will then be able to understand this world , and transform the world .

The problem with Chris Martin is n’t the fact that the Coldplay frontman writes lyrics that resemble something that might come from the diary of a seventh grader who sniffs magic markers ( snow , it turns out , is white after all ) .
No , it ’s the fact that he almost forces people to take him so goddamn seriously .
And the reason is simple : He is a a ) rock star ; b ) a celebrity ( or at least married to one ) ; and c ) a social activist .
People often compare Martin ’s motives to those of Bono , but that ’s not exactly an apt comparison .
Martin seems to be actively trying to dissociate himself from activists like Bono — Bono is a rock star who makes shitty music , but also a social activist who is trying to actually make social changes ( Third World debt , etc ) — while Martin is a pseudo - rock star who makes shitty music with designs on being perceived to be a social activist .
His political rhetoric is foggy - we all got a pamphlet from Oxfam upon entering Toyota Center , but who reads pamphlets ?
- just like his music .
It appeals to people who put value in clichés , and this has turned Martin into a critical punch line ( Chuck Klosterman writes extensively about this , most particularly the “ fake love ” Coldplay songs inevitably engender ) and more importantly , a genius .
Martin is over - abundantly aware of his own iconography ( he wants to be Radiohead ) , but seems to be entirely unaware that he is ruining for the rest of us every conceivable notion of what is or is not art .
Everyone , Aftermath included , has bought into Coldplay 's aesthetic for at least one year of their life , most likely the first year they “ get a boyfriend ” or the first time they “ kiss someone , ” and that year usually becomes seminal in the construction of what one believes to be real emotion .
And that ’s dangerous .
Dangerous because nothing Coldplay sings about has any relation to reality .
It ’s contrived bullshit for the sake of sentiment .
It ’s emotional pedantry masked as poetry .
And it ’s the continued Oprah - fication of culture that is turning art into a homogenized grayness ( think Danielle Steele trying to write Gravity ’s Rainbow ) .
Martin ’s genius is that he knows people use his music for their own emotional gain - we all see ourselves trying to “ fix ” someone who will no longer love us .
We ’ve all wanted “ go back to the start ” in a relationship that was n’t working .
So as long as Coldplay exists , Coldplay will prosper .
And prospering they are .
People go bananas for these guys .
Or maybe not bananas , so much as those plastic banana - shaped yellow cylinders that live in brown wicker baskets atop the kitchen tables in houses for sale in River Oaks .
That much was evident by the more than 15,000 people at Toyota Center Tuesday night .
But those people got something I do n’t know they expected - a sanitized nothingness , a rock show that looked and felt like a summer blockbuster ( probably starring Will Smith ) , void of context and connection .
Seeing Coldplay is a weird experience .
Martin and crew played all the favorites , of course , going from “ Violet Hill ” right into “ Clocks , ” which included a boringly opulent laser show where the red and green beams just sat there , beaming their beams onto the beamed .
It meant nothing , and felt like a futuristic hospital .
“ Speed of Sound ” was next , where Martin channeled his inner rock star , skipping around the stage like some Superball from a vending machine at a bowling alley .
I think this was supposed to be a sort of first - act highlight .
But the audience seemed full of only obligatory excitement .
Most of them screamed and screamed for the first 30 seconds and then either sat down or started texting and feigned interest - sort of like , " I ’m at a rock show , I should probably dance , right ? "
“ Fix You , ” Coldplay ’s most sing - alongable song , was pretty great , though , with the entire audience singing every single line .
It reminded me of
The OC
episode when that one dude died .
Probably the weirdest song of the night , though , was “ The Scientist , ” where Martin and his three bandmates waded their way through the stands until they finally reached their destination - where else but the cheap seats .
Sort of a taking the music to the streets kind of thing , like we really do care about you fans who only paid $ 50 for tickets .
So there they all stood , singing like a multimillionaire French revolutionary peasant - boy barbershop quartet .
What we did n’t get at all was Martin interacting with the crowd , except that one bit where he said , “ Hey , you ’re a four - year - old - this song was written before you were even born ! ”
And then to someone else , “ But you ’re like , 50 … Wow ! ”
The problem with this is that Martin misinterprets age difference as diversity , and the crowd at Toyota Center last night was the least diverse crowd I ’ve ever seen at a concert .
Coldplay appeals only to a certain group of people - those who are privileged enough to not have to make personal connections to art to help them define their position in the world ; those who , when looking into a mirror , see nothing but a face .
As the show was coming to a close , I kept asking myself , " I wonder if Chris Martin knows what color the stars are ? "
Oh , they ’re yellow , huh ?
Got it .

I 'm feeling a little low today , so let 's tap into a source of energy from a neighboring dimension as a quick upper .
Faith in pseudoscience is rampant .
Everywhere you turn , intelligent people fully accept the existence of anything from psychic phenomena , to angels , to new age healing techniques , to ancient health schemes based on mysterious energy fields not understood by science .
Most of these paranormal phenomena rely on " energy , " and when the performers are asked to explain , they 'll gladly lecture about the body 's energy fields , the universe 's energy fields , Chi , Prana , Orgone , negative energy , positive energy , and just about anything else that needs a familiar sounding word to explain and justify it .
Clearly , there are too many loose interpretations of the word energy , to the point where most people probably have no idea exactly what energy really is .
I believe that if more people had a clear understanding of energy — and it's not complicated — there would be less susceptibility to pseudoscience , and more attention paid to actual technologies and methods that are truly constructive and useful .
A friend told me of her ability to perform minor healings , and her best explanation was that she drew energy from another dimension .
She had recently rented What the Bleep Do We Know , so she was well prepared to explain that alternate dimensions and realities should be taken for granted , since science does n't really know anything , and thus those things cannot be disproven .
That 's fine , I 'll concede that she can make contact with another dimension : after all , the latest M theories posit that there are probably ten or eleven of them floating around , and I 'll just hope that my friend 's is not one of those that are collapsed into impossibly small spaces .
What I was really interested in was the nature of this vaguely defined energy that she could contact .
I asked what type of energy is it , and how is it stored ?
Is it heat ?
Is it a spinning flywheel ?
Is it an explosive compound ?
Is it food ?
These are examples of actual ways that energy can be stored .
In popular New Age culture , " energy " has somehow become a noun unto itself .
" Energy " is considered to be literally like a glowing , hovering , shimmering cloud , from which adepts can draw power , and feel rejuvenated .
Imagine a vaporous creature from the original Star Trek series , and you 'll have a good idea of what New Agers think energy is .
In fact , energy is not really a tangible " thing " at all .
Energy is a measurement of something 's ability to perform work .
Given this context , when spiritualists talk about your body 's energy fields , they 're really saying nothing that 's even remotely meaningful .
Yet this kind of talk has become so pervasive in our society that the vast majority of Americans accept that energy exists as a self - contained force , floating around in glowing clouds , and can be commanded by spiritualist adepts to do just about anything .
There is well known authority for the simple , concrete , scientific definition of energy .
Take Einstein 's equation , E=mc2 , that every schoolchild knows but so few spend the 30 seconds it takes to understand .
Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared .
Speed is a function of distance and time , so energy can be expressed in mass , distance , and time .
That 's how we define work that can be done : actual , physical work .
Energy is a measurement of work .
If I lift a rock , I 'm inputting enough potential energy to dent the surface of the table one centimeter when I drop it .
The calories of chemical potential energy that my bloodstream absorbs when I eat a Power Bar charge up my muscles enough to dig 100 kg of dirt in my garden .
Nowhere did Einstein discuss hovering glowing clouds , or fields of mystical power generated by human spirits .
When spiritualists discuss energy , do n't blindly accept what they 're saying simply because energy is a word you 're familiar with , and that sounds scientific .
In many cases , their usage of the word is meaningless .
When you hear the word energy casually used to explain a mystical force or capability , require clarification .
Require that the energy be defined .
Is it heat ?
Is it a spinning flywheel ?
Here 's a good test .
When you hear the word energy used in a spiritual or paranormal sense , substitute the phrase " measurable work capability . "
Does the usage still make sense ?
Are you actually being given any information that supports the claim being made ?
Remember , energy itself is not the thing being measured : energy is the measurement of work performed or of potential .
Take the following claim of Kundalini Yoga as an example :
The release and ascent of the dormant spiritual energy enables the aspirant to transcend the effects of the elements and achieve consciousness .
This would be a great thing if energy was indeed that shimmering cloud that can go wherever it 's needed and perform miracles .
But it 's not , so in this case , we substitute the phrase " measurable work capability " and find that the sentence is not attempting to measure or quantify anything other than the word energy itself .
We have a " dormant spiritual measurable work capability , " and no further information .
That 's pretty vague , is n't it ?
For this claim to have any merit , they must at least describe how this energy is being stored or manifested .
Is it potential energy stored in the chemistry of fat cells ?
Is it heat that can spread through the body ?
Is it a measurable amount of electromagnetism , and if so , where 's the magnet ?
In any event , it must be measurable and precisely quantifiable , or it can't be called energy , by definition .
There 's a good reason why you do n't hear medical doctors or pharmacists talking about energy fields : it 's meaningless .
I think it 's generally good policy to remain open minded and be ready to hear claims that involve energy , but approach them skeptically , and scientifically .
The next time you hear such a claim , substitute the phrase " measurable work capability " and you 'll be well equipped to separate the silly from the solid .

As cities around the United States start to scramble for a share of the $ 700 billion federal bailout package , San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed said Friday that he ’s working with leaders of other large California cities to make sure they ’re not left behind .
The stimulus package Congress passed last month was n’t designed to dole out money to governments , so it ’s far from clear whether San Jose will get a piece .
But with $ 1.6 billion in unfunded retiree health care obligations , plus $ 500 million worth of local and regional road work to be done and $ 750 million in federal help sought to bring BART to the South Bay , Reed noted the city has a full slate of needs .
After meeting Friday with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the mayors of California ’s largest cities to discuss budget issues , Reed said California mayors plan to present their own bailout wish list through the governor soon , after Schwarzenegger finishes dealing with the state budget meltdown .
Reed created a minor furor Friday when he told an Associated Press reporter he would seek 2 percent of the bailout , or $ 14 billion , for San Jose — an eye - popping figure , given that the city ’s entire annual budget is $ 3.3 billion .
Reed later told the Mercury News that his remark was “ off the cuff , ” and based on the fact that the city contributes more than 2 percent of the nation ’s gross domestic product .
“ It ’s just a number I can do in my head , ” he added .
But he was n’t entirely kidding , either .
Especially after the city manager reported Friday that , thanks to the sinking stock market , San Jose ’s pension funds are down $ 950 million since June 30 , when they were valued at about $ 4.3 billion .
Without a market turnaround in coming months , that would increase the city ’s costs to cover pension benefits .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson noted earlier this week that the bailout was intended “ to stabilize financial institutions and strengthen the financial system ” rather than prop up local governments .
But that has n’t stopped elected leaders from lining up .
On Friday , the mayors of Phoenix , Atlanta and Philadelphia sent Paulson a letter asking for a combined $ 50 billion or more in loans to cover pension costs or investment in infrastructure .
They also asked for one - year loans to cities unable to borrow cash because of the tight credit markets .
Reed later clarified that while he was n’t currently planning to ask for a piece of the $ 700 billion , he would “ work to ensure that San Jose is allotted its fair share ” if federal money does become available to cities .
He also noted that the U.S. Conference of Mayors is planning to submit its own list of ways the stimulus could help them .
Aside from the bailout , groups representing the nation ’s mayors and governors Thursday asked Congress to jump - start the economy by increasing food - stamp payments , extending unemployment insurance and raising funding for Medicaid .
President - elect Barack Obama has called for unspecified aid to state and local governments to keep them from having to raise taxes or cut jobs while the federal government tries to revive the economy .
Reed says details on what San Jose will request , and when that request would be submitted , have yet to be worked out .
But he ’s setting his sights high .
“ I do believe that an investment of 2 percent of such a stimulus package in San Jose , the nation ’s 10th - largest city and innovation capital , would not only be fair but pragmatic , ” he said in a statement late Friday .
And in an interview with the Mercury News , Reed added : “ With my limited experience dealing with the federal government , they do n’t usually deliver as much as you hoped for . ”

American helicopters flying from Iraq landed inside Syria yesterday and dropped special forces who killed eight people , the Damascus government said last night , as Washington admitted it had targeted " foreign fighters . "
Syria warned that it held the US " wholly responsible for this act of aggression and all its repercussions " .
It described the dead as Syrian civilians , five of them members of the same family .
Syrian state television reported that the attack was against a farm near Abu Kamal , five miles from the Iraqi border .
Doctors in nearby al - Sukkariya said another seven people were taken to hospital with bullet wounds .
The incident threatened to unleash a new wave of anti-American feeling in Syria and across the Middle East at a time when President Bashar al - Assad , already being courted by Europe , is looking forward to improved relations with Washington after the November 4 presidential election .
News of the attack led bulletins across the Arab world last night - suggesting it will have wide resonance .
Syria summoned the US charge d'affaires in Damascus to explain the incident .
It also called on the Iraqi government to prevent its airspace being used in this way in future .
Eyewitness accounts said eight US soldiers landed in two helicopters and that the dead were building workers .
A senior Syrian source quoted by the official Sana news agency , said four helicopters violated Syrian airspace and described the target as a " civilian building under construction " .
In Washington an unnamed military official told the Associated Press the raid had targeted elements of a " foreign fighter logistics network " , and that , due to Syrian inaction , the US was " taking matters into our own hands " .
It was the first known American attack on Syrian soil .
Intriguingly , Farhan al - Mahalawi , mayor of the nearby Iraqi border town of Qaim , told the Reuters news agency that the targeted village had been surrounded by Syrian troops .
In Israel , a security official said Israel was not involved .
Last year Israel destroyed an alleged nuclear site in northern Syria .
Qaim has been a significant crossing point for foreign fighters , weapons and money entering Iraq to fuel the Sunni insurgency .
Only last Thursday , the commander of US forces in western Iraq told reporters American troops were redoubling efforts to secure the Syrian border .
Major General John Kelly said Iraq 's western borders with Saudi Arabia and Jordan were fairly tight as a result of good policing by security forces in those countries , but that Syria was a " different story " .
Thabet Salem , a political analyst , told al - Jazeera TV that the US appeared to have mistaken building workers for infiltrators .
" It will raise questions as to why this is happening towards the end of the current US administration , " he said .
Late last year the then US commander , General David Petraeus , praised Syria 's cooperation in reducing violence in Iraq .
But Syria has since refused to restart intelligence sharing with the US until Washington recognises its assistance by returning an ambassador to Damascus .
Joshua Landis , an American expert on Syria , commented last night : " The Bush administration must assume that an Obama victory will force Syria to behave nicely in order to win favour with the new administration .
Thus White House analysts may assume that it can have a " freebee " - taking a bit of personal revenge on Syria without the US paying a price . "
The attack comes as Syria takes another step in from the cold today when its foreign minister , Walid al - Mualim , visits London to hear praise for its newly conciliatory policies in Lebanon - and to be urged to distance itself from Iran .
In recent months Syria has established diplomatic relations with Lebanon and held several rounds of indirect talks with Israel , with Turkey acting as broker .
In July , President Assad was invited to an EU summit in Paris .
Michael Mukasey collapsed while giving a speech to the Federalist Society in Washington .
Attorney general collapses
Attorney General Michael Mukasey collapsed Thursday night while giving a speech to the Federalist Society in Washington , according to three senior administration officials .
Justice Department Spokeswoman Gina Talamona said Mukasey suffered a “ fainting spell ” and was expected to be released from George Washington University Hospital later Friday .
The attorney general had no signs of a stroke or a heart problem , a justice official told reporters at the hospital .

Talamona said Mukasey was eager to return to work and remained under medical care while doctor ’s waited for test results .
Further details about Mukasey 's condition were not immediately available .
Audience members said they began praying , fearing a stroke .
Mukasey is a former federal prosecutor from New York City who succeeded former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
At 10:30 p.m. Eastern , medical officials were still working on him on the stage , administration witnesses said .
The Justice Department said in a statement : “ At the conclusion of his remarks before the Federalist Society Annual Dinner in Washington , D.C. , Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey collapsed .
“ Upon his collapse , emergency first aid was rendered by the attorney general 's security detail and a doctor who was on the scene .
“ The attorney general arrived at George Washington University Hospital shortly thereafter .
“ The attorney general is conscious , conversant and alert .
His vital statistics are strong , and he is in good spirits .
He is receiving excellent care and appreciates all of the good wishes and prayers he has received . ”
“ We will update the public when we have additional information . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Housing prices have plummeted , but property tax bills probably wo n't budge .
This January , local tax authorities will begin to send out property assessments for 2009 , telling homeowners what their property is valued at , and how much their tax bill is .
But many assessments wo n't reflect any of the steep home price declines that have been making headlines for the last year or so .
And even if property assessments do drop , property tax bills wo n't necessarily be any lower .
" I think you 're going to see a lot more taxpayer protest this year , " said Bruce Hahn , president of the American Homeowners foundation , a non-partisan consumer advocacy group .
A huge runup slows
Property taxes climbed relentlessly earlier this decade as home prices rose , according to Pete Sepp , spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union .
This year Americans will pay more than $ 400 billion in property taxes , up about 25 % from levels in 2004 and double what they paid ten years ago .
At best , says Sepp , those steep increases may start to level off .
Nevertheless , homeowners are already pressing assessors for lower tax assessments .
" For my first 25 years [ as an assessor ] , nobody ever asked me to lower the assessment based on a home selling for less down the street .
There are many such inquiries this year , " said Ken Wilkinson , the tax assessor for Lee County Fla. , which includes Cape Coral and Ft. Myers .
He estimates that 80 % of county residents have seen the value of their homes decline .
The median price of existing homes fell more than 25 % in the 12 months ending June 30 , according to the Housing Opportunity Index compiled by Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) for the National Association of Home Builders .
Home prices in Moreno Valley , Calif .
a city of 187,000 , have fallen by more than a third over the past two years , according to the same index .
And that has many more homeowners clamoring for reassessments , according to Barry Foster , the city 's economic development director .
But even if local prices are way down , taxpayers may not win a lower assessment , because there can be a big lag time between when the home sales used to calculate them take place and when the assessment is actually issued .
To calculate 2009 assessments , for example , assessors will use home sale prices from 2008 or even earlier , according to Sepp .
Usually this works to taxpayers 's advantage , since price increases take a while before they are fully reflected in assessments .
That 's why it 's typical for most homes to be under- valued , according to Bruce Hahn of the American Homeowners foundation .
But that 's also why many homeowners are n't likely to see their assessments shrink immediately .
Lower values , same bill
There 's another reason why homeowners are unlikely to see any decrease in property tax bills .
In some states , such as California , Washington State , Massachusetts and Idaho , taxes are based on the last resale price of the house .
Even a home worth $ 500,000 in California may be taxed based on the sale price when it was bought 10 years earlier for $ 200,000 .
" Because the assessment is based on acquisition value , it 's difficult to get that re-evaluated , " said Sepp .
That 's why the market value of most homes in these states exceeds the assessed tax values .
The owners with best case for a reassessment are the ones who bought at the top of the market and have seen their values drop by a third or more , like many of Moreno Valley 's residents .
Even if citizens do receive a lower assessment - and this year Wilkinson expects to lower assessments for most taxpayers in Lee county , Fla. , by 20 % or more - their property tax bill may not shrink at all .
Tax collectors often raise tax rates to offset lower assessments to meet their budgets , which will be very strained this year .
Assessments go down but rates go up so that the tax collections stay roughly the same .
" State and local governments depend very heavily on real estate taxes and they are reeling from a loss of revenues from sales taxes and other sources , " said Bruce Hahn .
Once homeowners get their bills , they 'll have several weeks to contest their assessments , according to Hahn .
He suggested they go online to real estate evaluation sites such as Zillow.com to determine how far property values have fallen in their communities .
They can also cite comparable home sales for similar properties to make their cases .
" Some tax assessors have been very reasonable , " said Hahn , " but others are under great pressure to keep revenues up . "
Due to court order , absentee ballots will continue to be accepted after election day .
Some counties may wait to load results until all absentees are in .

TV - B- Gone : Not Your Average Open Source Success Story
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 04 , 2008

There is an interesting story regarding open source hardware making the rounds today .
Have you ever heard of TV - B - Gone ?
I had n't , until today .
It 's an invention from Mitch Altman that works like a universal remote , except that it has only one purpose : turning off any TV that is on anywhere , especially in public places .
Admittedly , this device could easily get its owner killed during the fourth quarter of a football game in any number of watering holes , but there is a notable open source twist to the story .
As Mitch Altman himself reports at the Make site , after he initially invented the TV - B - Gone device , he joined forces with his brother , a patent attorney , and applied for a patent .
He also reports that within weeks the TV - B - Gone device was a hot seller , and got covered in many media outlets .
Soon after this , he decided to open source everything from the board layout to the firmware source code , giving rise to a huge number of hacked and tweaked TV - B - Gone devices and kits .
Altman explains :
" I knew about open source , of course , but never considered it viable for hardware until going to my first hacker convention .
There I met people who are very critical of patents and other forms of intellectual property law .
They see these laws as obsolete and obnoxious .
Individuals who want to hack cool ideas to improve upon them and share their results are often preyed upon and silenced by corporate lawyers protecting their clients ’ patents .
Paradoxically , this stifles the creativity that patents were supposed to encourage .
This point of view was an eye - opener for me . "
So what were Altman 's open source results ?
" Hacks increased the product ’s popularity , resulting in more sales and more people around the world experiencing the satisfaction of turning off TVs , " he says .
" Also , since there was an army of TV - B - Goners who emailed me with ideas on how to improve upon my initial design , the next versions of TV - B - Gone remotes were considerably better than the original . "
Who says hardware can't benefit from the open source model ?
Altman 's story is an interesting example of how many unusual things can benefit from community contributions .
I 'm not so sure about his next project , though : The Brain Machine .
Sounds like a good way to induce a seizure .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
The Supreme Court kicks off its new term on Monday , smack in the middle of a hotly contested presidential election in which the court itself is not just a campaign issue , but the subject of TV attack ads against both candidates for the first time anyone can remember .
Perhaps in a sign that the justices have a sense of humor , they ’ve scheduled oral arguments in FCC v. Fox Television for Election Day — a case that ’s all about the F - word .
That case , you may recall , got its start during the live broadcasts of the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards , when Cher and Nicole Richie landed the network in hot water for a few fleeting expletives .
( Richie : “ Have you ever tried to get cow shit out of a Prada purse ?
It ’s not so fucking simple . ”
And the always entertaining Cher , who , upon receiving her “ artistic achievement award , ” said of her many critics , “ So fuck ’em .
I still have a job and they do n’t . ” )
As the FCC squares off against Fox , whose lawyer launched his argument in the lower court with his own string of profanity , oral arguments promise to be entertaining .
The FCC is hoping the high court will restore some of its power to regulate the F - word during prime - time TV .
The rest of the cases in this term ’s lineup are more consequential .
None , however , is expected to land with the punch of Heller v. DC , the Second Amendment case from last term that undid 100 years of gun control law .
Nonetheless , there ’s plenty of substance to look forward to — or fear .
The tobacco company Altria / Philip Morris has two cases on the calendar .
One , involving the limits of a state court ’s power , is making its third appearance before the court from the state of Oregon , where the state ’s highest court has essentially taken Cher ’s attitude toward John Roberts and his brethren by refusing to overturn a multimillion dollar punitive damage award against the tobacco giant .
The other involves lawsuits over whether the company ’s marketing of light cigarettes constituted fraud that could be challenged in state court .
The court will also hear an important case involving retaliation in employment litigation and another involving pregnancy discrimination , which court watchers have dubbed “ Ledbetter II , ” in reference to the case last year in which the court severely restricted womens ’ ability to sue for pay discrimination .
And the court will hear its third major case in the past year involving the arcane but important issue of federal preemption .
In this case , the court will decide whether regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration can prevent injured citizens from suing drug companies for damages in state court .
As it stands the court has n’t taken on any major cases of the culture wars this term — no abortion cases or gay marriage challenges .
But there is one free speech case that will be argued by a major culture warrior , Jay Sekulow .
A veteran of religious freedom litigation , Sekulow represents the city of Pleasant Grove , Utah , which has been sued by a fringe religious group known as the Summum .
The city denied the Summum the right to install a monument in a city park that outlines the group ’s “ Seven Aphorisms , ” which it claims were inscribed by God on the first set of stone tablets given to Moses .
The Ten Commandments are inscribed on another monument in this very park .
The Summum argue that the city has violated their right to free speech by allowing one religious monument but not another , and a lower court sided with them .
You ’d think that Sekulow might be representing the Summum here , given his interest in religious free expression .
He ’s working for the city out of concern that a decision in favor of the Summum would require governments around the country to remove all existing religious monuments , fearing that they otherwise would have to grant the Aphorisms ( or other unusual religious monuments ) equal space .
One area of the Supreme Court docket that is significantly different from last term is environmental litigation .
Last year , the court did n’t hear a single environmental case , but this term , there are four set for oral argument so far .
Two of them will be argued on the first day of the term ; lawyers jokingly refer to them as the “ summer and winter cases . ”
Winter v. Natural Resource Defense Council arose over the Navy ’s use of sonar in training exercises off the coast of California in 2007 .
The NRDC sued the Navy to stop the exercises , alleging that the sonar use violated a host of environmental laws because it imperiled marine life , particularly the endangered beak whales .
On its face the case is about environmental regulations , but at its heart , this is a serious challenge to the Bush administration ’s assertion of executive power .
That ’s because after the NRDC won a preliminary injunction that halted the Navy ’s unchecked use of sonar , the White House , through its Council on Environmental Quality , declared the injunction a national emergency and essentially told the Navy to ignore the court .
The president then unilaterally exempted the Navy from having to comply with the relevant law , the Coastal Zone Management Act , arguing that protecting the whales would pose a threat to national security .
The case will pose an interesting test for the new justices Roberts and Alito , who have shown a great deal of deference to the Bush administration .
In Summers v. Earth Island Institute , the environmental group sued to overturn Forest Service regulations that allowed the agency to log on public land without getting public comment or allowing for an appeals process .
Former Clinton - era Solicitor General Seth Waxman said at a briefing last month that Summers may be the sleeper case of the term because its outcome could have a potentially big impact on the “ regulated community , ” i.e. , big businesses .
That ’s because this case is what ’s known as a facial challenge , which is a legal challenge filed to prevent harm or the loss of fundamental rights before any of those rights have actually been lost .
Business groups and the Bush administration hate these type of cases ( though presumably business groups will discover a new love for them if the Democrats take back the White House and the new administration starts issuing regulations they do n’t like ) .
Waxman suggested that the case fits into one of the few trends so far discerned about the Roberts court .
The court dismissed a facial challenge last term in a lawsuit over voting rights .
That case was filed before any elections had actually taken place , so the plaintiffs could n’t point to any single person who had lost his or her right to vote for lack of an ID , a point the court honed in on in its decision .
But facial challenges are important to preserving rights that , once lost , ca n’t be recovered , such as the right to cast a ballot in an election .
Should the court continue to rein in this type of litigation , it will seriously undermine the work of civil rights and environmental groups to act preemptively to protect natural resources and fundamental rights .
Three of the environmental cases also come from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , in California , the federal judiciary ’s last bastion of liberalism and environmentalists ’ favorite legal venue .
Waxman speculated that the Roberts court may have taken up the environmental cases to send a signal to the circuit that the California judges are giving environmental groups too easy a ride .
It ’s unlikely that the court will hand down many decisions in these cases before the election .
Nothing on the early argument calendar looks like an election turner , anyway .
It ’s too bad that the FCC case wo n’t be resolved by Election Day , when there will no doubt be plenty of people of one political persuasion or the other striving to keep themselves from uttering the F - word on TV .

" Are you another fucking Mexican ? " the Sergeant asks the recruit to the Denver Police Department .
" Jesus fucking Christ , is there any white people in this class ? "
Westword has obtained a police - training video from 1979 that shows a group of new recruits being berated with racial slurs and taunts like these .
See the video for yourself after the jump .
Note :
The video opens on a black screen and starts slowly .
Please be patient .
Denver is at the cusp of a historical moment as the staging ground for the first time an African - American has received a major party 's nomination for president at the most diverse Democratic National Convention ever .
Municipal leaders hope the event will be brand the Mile High City to the world as forward - thinking and tolerant .
But an old police training video uncovered by Westword shows that it was n’t always that way .
In the 1979 video , a group of new police recruits , many of them in their early 20s , stands in a circle while a commanding officer , identified as Sergeant Arthur Hutchinson calls them “ niggers ” , “ beaners ” , “ greasers ” and “ homos . ”
Hutchinson accuses male recruit of being gay , demands any Jewish recruits identify themselves , and questions female recruits on their sexual promiscuity .
" Is the real reason you came on here is because you just wanted to have access to 1,400 guys to fuck ? " he says to one young female .
" You would n’t ?
Why not ?
All the other police women do .
That ’s the only goddamn thing these women think about is fucking all the time . "
He orders several African - American recruits to sing " Camptown Races " while doing a tap dance .
" All you fucking niggers tap dance , " he says .
One of the recruits in the video , who is now a veteran DPD officer , tells Westword that the giggling in the video was mostly nervous laughter .
" We did n't know what was going on , " says the officer .
Hutchinson goes on to call another African American " a chimpanzee , " " the missing link , " and orders a white recruit to " hold his leash . "
" You look like you just fell out of a goddamn cotton field , " Hutchinson says to the African American recruit .
Hutchinson joined the DPD in 1964 and retired from the Department as a Captain in 1991 after directing the Gang Unit .
He served for one year as the Chief of the Eagle Police Department and , from 1996 to 2005 , was the Chief of the Blackhawk Police Department .
Former colleages say he now lives outside Colorado .
He could not be reached for comment .
The faces and names of the recruits in the video have been obscured since many of them are still officers with the DPD .
Some of them are parties in a class - action lawsuit by the National Latino Peace Officers Association alleging that patterns of discriminatory conduct and policies continue at the department .
Denver Police spokesman Sonny Jackson referred all questions about the lawsuit to the City Attorney ’s office .
Jackson points out that the video is nearly thirty years old and that racist castigations are in no way part of current training practices .
He said he would offer an official department statement after reviewing the video , but as of the time of this posting no such statement has been received .
-- Jared Jacang Maher
UPDATE : DPD spokesman called back with this comment : “ That was 1979 , ” he says .
“ It was a different time .
These tactics are no longer used .
We train in a much different way now . ”
But Genet & Martinez attorney Daniel Genet , who is representing several Latino officers at the DPD in the suit , says the type of training captured in the video still affects the department today .
“ The reason it matters now is a lot of the recruits were indoctrinated and trained in this way , ” he says .
“ It was an atmosphere that was ingrained by the DPD .
Some of the people involve in that class are now supervisors .
So if you ’re a person with a problem or complaint these are the guys you go to . ”
Long before the √-button on calculators , and the now - antique slide rules and logarithm tables , people actually had to calculate square roots by hand .
Like so many other pre-Computer
Age tasks , square root calculation is n’t really complicated , it ’s just tedious .
The simplest – and , as it happens , the oldest – technique for this the Babylonian method : guess the square root of a number and then continually refine the result by taking the arithmetic mean of the result and the quotient of the number and the result , until you ’re satisfied with the precision .
In other words :
< script type =" text / JavaScript " > var numbr = 5 , guess = 2 ; do { guess = 0.5 * ( guess + numbr / guess ) ; } while ( confirm ( ' Refine Further ? ' + guess ) ) ; </ script > run script
There are several other methods for approximating square roots , but they all work in a similar manner : start with a seed number , run it through a formula or two , and keep going until you ’re satisfied with the result .
This approach is known as iterative approximation , and is not used all that often in software development .
Engineers , on the other hand , tend to solve problems with physical matter and other analog things , and consequently find iterative methods invaluable .
As a structural engineer , Gabe is very familiar with the iterative methods used in his field to solve common problems such as tensile - stress variance and lateral - torsion resistance .
Like the square root example , most of these calculations are simple arithmetic .
The complexity , however , comes in the variables that are adjusted in each iteration , which can be anything from peak wind velocity to project cost to the metallurgic makeup of building materials .
Fortunately for Gabe ’s firm , the advent of GWBASIC meant that these common problems could be solved in seconds rather than hours with simple programs that any of the engineers could hack together .
By the time the 1990 ’s came around , the firm had developed an impressive collection of GWBASIC programs that solved many of their specific problems .
The programs did n’t change a whole lot over the next two decades .
Some were upgraded to QBasic , others were created in Visual Basic 3 , a handful were VB6 - based , and at least one was developed in VisualBasic .
NET .
With lots of hacky code stored on a network drive with no version control , it was the kind of environment that would make a software developer scream W - T - F ! .
But for the engineers , it was n’t all that bad .
It was n’t all that good either , which was why they were very receptive when a software vendor approached them with a “ comprehensive suite of engineering tools . ”
The Pitch
“ Our software has become a de- facto industry standard , ” the sales rep proudly declared in his presentation , “ in fact , city building departments come to us for help in developing codes and standards for the computer age . ”
“ A few other firms have gone the same , ‘ in - house tools ’ route that you have , ” the presenter continued , advancing to a slide with a picture of a demolished building , “ but remember that engineers are n’t programmers , do n’t want to be programmers , and do n’t particularly like programming .
When your competition uses software built by programmers and has their staff focus on engineering , they ’ll leave you in the dust . ”
The engineers certainly did n’t disagree .
Program maintenance always took longer than it should , and the prospect of having programs that worked better and were easier to use was certainly enticing .
“ And just to make decision even easier , we ’re offering a free , three - day trial ” he cheerfully added , winking “ but I suspect you ’ll make your mind up after the first day !
I think it ’s finally time to join 2008 and wave goodbye to your old GWBASIC programs ! ”
With nothing to lose , the engineers agreed to give the software a shot .
The Swing
As it turned out , Gabe was in the middle of a project that needed some serious help from software .
He was tasked with figuring out what type of steel beams to use on a bridge they were designing .
It ’s always a challenge to determine what steel beams should be used in a structure .
Even the basics like load and torsion can be a pain to calculate .
The more load that ’s needed , the heavier the beam needs to be , which means the greater the load becomes , which means an heavier beam may be needed , which means it may not support the overall structure ’s torsion requirements .
And , with a range of only sixty or so widths of beams to choose from , switching from one size to another can change things dramatically .
Many years back , someone at the firm had written a simple GWBASIC program to help with this problem .
Given an input of about twenty different variables , the program would try every beam size available , calculating and recalculating with each iteration , and eventually spit out a small list of suitable beams .
The engineer would then make his choice based other considerations such as cost .
When Gabe fired up the new software , he was quite impressed with its interface .
Instead of non-validating input prompts and obscure codes that the GWBASIC program utilized , the new application allowed such luxuries as tabbing between fields and dropdown boxes .
Gabe spent about five minutes filling out various variables and then pressed “ FIND BEAMS . ”
The Miss
Instead of seeing a small number of beam types come up , the application presented him with a monstrous dropdown list of beam choices and a label that read : please select the beam that you ’d like to use .
Gabe was n’t quite sure what the program meant , so he picked W10x22 and then clicked submit .
After a few seconds of a flashy “ calculating ” animation , the program popped - up another message : Calculation Complete !
The beam you selected ( W10x22 ) will not be suitable for the specified conditions .
After closing the pop-up , the program then returned to the main menu .
Figuring that he miss - keyed something , Gabe went back into the Beam Selector screen and spent another five minutes entering data .
He hit submit , was prompted to select a beam , and then told that the beam he picked did n’t work .
He tried once again , only to have to - reenter data , re-select , and then learn his selection was incorrect .
“ I guess I do n’t really understand the problem , ” the vendor said in response to Gabe ’s inquiry , “ the method for designing beams calls for the engineer to guess a beam size and then run it through the appropriate calculations .
That ’s what we ’re doing , only we ’ve made it much easier . ”
Gabe explained that their twenty - year - old GWBASIC program did n’t require the engineer to guess different beam sizes , and that it simply output the beams that were appropriate .
“ That just does n’t make sense , ” the vendor responded , “ the reason you guess first is so that all of those calculations on all of the different beams do n’t have to be run .
Why bother calculating all that for something – like , say , a W4x10 against a 100 K – when you know it ’ll always fail .
That ’s just a waste to calculate . ”
In the end , the vendor was right on one thing .
Within a day , Gabe ’s company made their decision : they stuck with their old , wasteful , GWBASIC programs .

10 .
We get to invade Iran , and as a result , undoubtedly learn to properly pronounce " Ahmadinejad . "
9 . We wo n't have four years of frothing conservative commentators on the news with protruding veins in their foreheads .
8 . With gas prices approaching $ 14 / gallon , you 'll get much - needed exercise because the only way you can afford to get to work is via bicycle .
7. North Korea will gain favored trade status while France will be subject to sanctions , resulting in cheaper Kimchi and cigarette prices .
6 . So many children will " not be left behind " that they 'll actually lap the ones " left behind " and end up ahead !
5 . Waterboarding will now be covered under your health care plan with NO DEDUCTIBLE !
4. Abandoned drilling rig across the street from your house makes excellent monkey bars for your children to play on .
3. NSA will offer a 1 - 800 number you can call to check your messages , phone , e-mail , or credit card receipts , and whereabouts of spouse or friends .
2. Polar Bear turns out to be a lot warmer and more comfortable than leather or denim .
... and the number one reason to vote for John McCain ...
1 . No impeachment proceeding against Obama for removing the tag off the mattress in the Lincoln bedroom .
As an extra bonus ... here 's the kind of family you 'd have in the white house :

Ha Ha , I love this .
Can I copy it ?

The complex patterns of the natural world often turn out to be governed by relatively simple mathematical relationships .
A seashell grows at a rate proportional to its size , resulting in a delicate spiral .
The gossamer network of galaxies results from the simple interplay between cosmic expansion and the force of gravity over a wide range of scales .
As our catalogue of natural phenomena has grown more complete , more and more scientists have begun to look for interesting patterns in human society .
The nature of war is a question of great interest to everyone , especially as the era of large - scale conflicts recedes into the past .
The wars of today tend to be lopsided affairs , where guerilla forces , insurgent groups , and terrorists oppose incumbent governments .
Instead of a few large - scale battles , this situation leads to an apparently random series of small - scale attacks against vulnerable targets of opportunity .
While affected governments collect records of past attacks , the random nature of such wars means that these data are of limited use in predicting future attacks .
When classified according to their frequency and intensity , however , the events of any insurgent war appear to follow a power law .
It should come as no surprise that weaker attacks are more common than stronger attacks , but a power law distribution makes a much more specific prediction .
It turns out that if individual conflicts ( for example , a terrorist attack or a guerilla raid ) are classified according to the resulting number of fatalities n , then the number of such conflicts occurring in any given year is proportional to n raised to a constant power .
Let ’s look at a specific example .
In the case of the Iraq war , we might ask how many conflicts causing ten casualties are expected to occur over a one - year period .
According to the data , the answer is the average number of events per year times 10 – 2.3 , or 0.005 .
If we instead ask how many events will cause twenty casualties , the answer is proportional to 20 – 2.3 .
Taking into account the entire history of any given war , one finds that the frequency of events on all scales can be predicted by exactly the same exponent .
Professor Neil Johnson of Oxford University has come up with a remarkable result regarding these power laws : for several different wars , the exponent has about the same value .
Johnson studied the long - standing conflict in Colombia , the war in Iraq , the global rate of terrorist attacks in non-G7 countries , and the war in Afghanistan .
In each case , the power law exponent that predicted the distribution of conflicts was close to the value – 2.5 .
What ’s more , in the case of Colombia and Iraq he was able to show that the exponent seemed to be evolving towards that value ; Colombia from above , and Iraq from below .
Does this hint at a simple underlying pattern driving the behavior of modern wars ?
Johnson thinks so , and has even developed a model that predicts a power law distribution of casualties with the correct exponent .
In his model , the insurgent force consists of a fixed number of attack units ( a general term which may include equipment or even information , as well as people ) which may group together to form larger units .
Each unit on its own is assigned a ‘ strength ’ of one , meaning that a conflict involving that unit will result in one death .
Coalitions of units pool their strength , and cause proportionally more deaths .
The key ingredient in this model is the evolution of groups over time .
Terrorist organizations , for example , typically function in relatively small units .
When an opportunity comes up that demands more resources , they may band together .
When the authorities grow too close for comfort , on the other hand , they may split up .
In time these competing pressures can create a stable arrangement of groups , with a fixed distribution of different sizes .
Johnson ’s model adopts a very simple dynamic to model this evolution .
In any given time step , one group of attack units is randomly chosen .
Each group 's chance to be chosen is proportional to its size , but the many small groups still see much more activity than the few large groups .
The group selected is given a small probability ( 1 % ) of disbanding into individual units ; if it does n’t disband , then it joins up with another randomly chosen group .
These are the only rules of the model , and they turn out to work just fine .
After the population is allowed to evolve for a long time , the result is a power law distribution of group sizes with an exponent of exactly – 5 / 2 .
Since group size is proportional to attack strength , this distribution also predicts the frequency of attacks causing a given number of fatalities .
It is also interesting that the result of this model depends only on the probability of fragmentation .
As long as this probability is reasonably small , the distribution of attacking groups will settle into a steady state with a power law distribution .
Is this new ‘ Law of Terrorism ’ really universal ?
“ Power law patterns will emerge within any modern asymmetric war being fought by loosely organized insurgent groups . ”
Johnson speculates , “ Although future wars will provide the ultimate test . ”
Johnson ’s research continues with the analysis of data from other conflicts , such as Senegal , Indonesia , Israel , and Northern Ireland .
