Do Ethicists Steal More Books ?
Philosophical Psychology , 22 ( 2009 ) , 711-725
If explicit cognition about morality promotes moral behavior then one might expect ethics professors to behave particularly well .
However , professional ethicists  behavior has never been empirically studied .
The present research examined the rates at which ethics books are missing from leading academic libraries , compared to other philosophy books similar in age and popularity .
Study 1 found that relatively obscure , contemporary ethics books of the sort likely to be borrowed mainly by professors and advanced students of philosophy were actually about 50 % more likely to be missing than non-ethics books .
Study 2 found that classic ( pre-1900 ) ethics books were about twice as likely to be missing .

Falling in love with flightless fowl
Tux Droid
Developer : Kysoh
Platform : Linux
Price : $ 99
Linus Torvalds , the creator of the open - source Linux kernel , was once mauled by a very small penguin while on a trip in Australia .
The experience had a lasting impact on him and later inspired him to make a penguin the official Linux mascot .
Developer Larry Ewing created the first graphical rendering of the Linux penguin , which countless Linux users around the world know today as Tux .
An electronics company called Kysoh aims to bring the Linux mascot to life with a unique programmable toy .
The Kysoh Tux Droid is a robot that wirelessly connects to a Linux computer ( no Windows or Mac OS X support yet ) and performs actions in response to preprogrammed events .
It can flap its wings , turn around in circles , blink , detect light levels , record audio , and even speak .
The Tux Droid also comes with an IR remote that can be used to make it do your bidding ... until the grim day when it achieves complete autonomy and throws off the shackles of human subjugation , conspiring with the devious Roomba collective in an insidious plot to overthrow humanity .
Tux swims out of the box
The Tux Droid comes with a USB cable , an IR remote , a white firmware update cable , a power adapter , a concise instruction manual , and a 2.4
Ghz wireless dongle shaped like a fish that plugs into a standard USB port on the host computer and facilitates communication between the computer and the robot .
After extricating it from the packaging , a close examination reveals that soft fuzz covers most of its exterior , except for the plastic beak , feet , and eyes ; it 's approximately eight inches tall and rests steadily on three wheels that come out of the bottom .
The build quality is pretty solid , but I do n't think it would survive a fall from a high shelf onto a hard floor .
The overall appearance is good — it is an unmistakable likeness of Ewing 's original Tux rendering , and in person , any Linux enthusiast would recognize it as Tux at a glance .
Setting up Tux
The initial setup process is relatively straightforward .
I started by plugging in the Tux Droid and turning it on .
It has an internal rechargeable battery and can function on power from a regular wall socket while charging .
When the droid activates , it says hello and flaps its wings .
Next , I plugged the fish dongle into the USB port on my keyboard .
A blue LED will blink slowly behind its eyes to indicate that it is receiving power and attempting to establish a connection .
When the fish finishes connecting with the Tux Droid ( this typically does n't take very long ) , the LED inside the fish will blink more rapidly and the LEDs behind Tux 's eyes will turn solid blue .
The last setup step is installing the software so that Tux can be controlled from the computer .
This control software is n't included in the box with the droid , so it has to be downloaded from the Internet ... and that 's where I ran into my first problem .
The Kysoh web site is a bit disorganized , and it took me a few minutes to figure out that the required software is actually available for download from the Tux Droid community site rather than Kysoh 's official web site as the instruction manual had indicated .
In addition to the software itself , the community site also has a wiki page with more complete installation instructions .
The software is available in a Debian package or a tarball .
I chose the Debian package , which can be installed on Ubuntu and other Debian - based Linux distributions by double - clicking the package file in a file manager or by using the dpkg command at the command line .
I also had to install the text - to - speech voice package in order to get Tux to talk .
The voice files are also distributed in both deb and tarball formats , and are available in 11 different languages .
The most recent version of the Tux Droid software is 1.2.2 , which was released in January .
The control software itself consists of several daemons ( one for text - to - speech support and one for enabling interaction with the robot ) , a few graphical control utilities , and various custom behavior programs called gadgets .
After installing the packages , I had to reboot my computer to get the Tux software daemons to start .
Governor tells Pentagon to return Guard gear Wars ' needs have left California at risk , he tells White House
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger meets with the San Francisco Editorial Board , Monday January 28 , 2008 , in San Francisco , Ca. ( Lacy Atkins San Francisco Chronicle ) California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger meets with the San Francisco Editorial Board , Monday January 28 , 2008 , in San Francisco , Ca. ( Lacy Atkins San Francisco Chronicle ) Photo : Lacy Atkins Photo : Lacy Atkins Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Governor tells Pentagon to return Guard gear 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger told Bush administration officials Monday that he is tired of the Pentagon treating the California National Guard like a stepchild by using its equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan without returning or replacing it .
The Republican governor , in a visit to Washington for the annual meeting of the National Governors ' Association , said the California National Guard is missing about half of its equipment - from humvees to radios .
That could leave California at risk in an earthquake , fire or other emergency , Schwarzenegger said .
" It 's not fair to the states for the federal government to go into a war and then to take from us the equipment , " he said after meetings Monday with President Bush and Cabinet officials .
" Every time our National Guard leaves , they take with them equipment but they do n't bring it back . "
Other governors have also complained about the drain of equipment .
Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , a Democrat , said last May that her state 's response to a tornado in the town of Greensburg was limited because 15 of the Kansas National Guard 's 19 Black Hawk helicopters were overseas , along with trucks , bulldozers and other equipment .
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told Schwarzenegger and other governors that the Pentagon plans to pay to replace some of the equipment that is damaged or destroyed , but the compensation could take several years because of budget constraints .
Schwarzenegger said states also face budget shortfalls and can't shoulder the burden indefinitely .
During the Southern California fires in October , some local officials complained about a lack of air support to contain the blazes , while state and federal officials criticized the U.S. military for failing to deploy some of its C - 130 planes immediately after the fires broke out .
A few weeks later , when high winds threatened to worsen fires in Southern California , four of the planes were sent after state officials asked for help .
About 2,500 of the state 's National Guardsmen are overseas out of a force of more than 20,000 .
The state estimates that $ 1 billion worth of equipment is being used , from diesel generators to trucks to GPS devices .
The California National Guard is also stretched thin because about 1,400 guardsmen are helping the federal government to secure the border with Mexico .
" There 's only so long you can do that , " the governor said .
" We now are missing 50 percent of the equipment - the equipment also ( used ) to train the National Guard . "
Schwarzenegger used his trip to press several other key issues with federal officials - although he left Washington with few firm commitments .
In a meeting with Bush and a small group of border governors from the United States and Mexico , he asked for more federal help in stopping drug smuggling , human trafficking and money laundering .
He also pushed the president and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to open more traffic lanes at the border to ease congestion and boost trade with Mexico , California 's biggest trading partner .
He met with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson to discuss mortgage issues .
The recently approved stimulus package raised federal mortgage limits in high - cost areas from $ 419,000 to $ 729,000 , but the provision expires at the end of the year .
Schwarzenegger wants to see the new limits become permanent , which would help many Bay Area homeowners .
Any such package would require congressional action .
The governor is also leading a new effort to lobby the federal government to increase spending on infrastructure .
The White House has been cool to the idea , although Democrats in the Senate are talking about a new stimulus package that would add more money for rebuilding highways , bridges and water systems .
" It does n't need to be part of the stimulus package , it can be separate , " Schwarzenegger said , suggesting the money could be inserted into appropriations bills .
The governor said he was too busy this trip to lobby the administration to reconsider its denial of California 's waiver to implement its first - in - the - nation greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks .
The state has sued to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency 's decision to reject the state 's rules .
Schwarzenegger took a few political questions Monday .
Asked if he had any advice for Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , he did not urge him to quit the race , but he did suggest the race for the GOP nomination was over .
" The people have made their decision , " he said .
Schwarzenegger , who endorsed Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain before the Feb .
5 California primary , also downplayed the idea that he would spend much time campaigning for McCain before November .
" There will be a time he will ask me for my help , " he said .
" He also knows and makes it clear that I am busy and my No. 1 priority is the people of California . "
Schwarzenegger took his mother - in - law , Eunice Kennedy Shriver , to a dinner with Bush and other governors at the White House Sunday .
He also found time for two fundraisers for his political action committee , the California Dream Team , that were expected to raise about $ 250,000 .
Hurrah !
At last some good news for threatened Pacific tuna .
Eight Pacific Island nations have signed an agreement to stop foreign fishing fleets taking their tuna .
Our ship the Esperanza has been in the Pacific for the last seven weeks confronting unscrupulous foreign fleets that take 90 per cent of the fish , and even more of the profit .
For years fishing fleets from distant countries have plundered the Pacific 's tuna , riding roughshod over the legitimate concerns of the islanders .
Bigeye and yellowfin tuna are in crisis , and the economies of many Pacific islands have been devastated by the continuing plunder of their waters .
Last December some of the worst offenders - Japan , Taiwan and Korea - joined forces to block proposed conservation measures .
But now a new agreement between Micronesia , Kiribati , Marshall Islands , Nauru , Palau , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Tuvalu is set to redress the balance .
Foreign fishing vessels licensed to fish in the waters of eight Pacific island countries will be banned from operating in two regions of the Pacific Commons adjacent to these countries .
Since most Pacific tuna stocks - valued at US $ 3 billion a year - come from the waters of these countries , this will be a major contribution towards the protection of Pacific tuna .
It also represents a giant stride towards making these areas into marine reserves - exactly what we have been pushing for since 2005 .
Even better , the foreign boats will also be required to retain their full catches .
In practice this will limit the time they spend at sea and the amount of tuna they can catch , because at present they can dump non-tuna species to make room in their holds for the more valuable catch .
They 'll also be required to carry fisheries observers on board at all times , and be banned from using fish aggregating devices ( used to attract juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna ) for at least three months of every year .
These conservation measures will take effect on 15 June 2008 , and are another sign of progress for our global tuna campaign .
Will we see similar protection of other tuna fisheries ?
We 're working on it .
Right now another Greenpeace ship , the Arctic Sunrise , is in the Med also saving tuna .
And at the other end of the supply chain our activists recently shut down the stalls of the five major tuna suppliers at the world 's biggest seafood fair in Brussels .
The brains of Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) patients are riddled with plaques of amyloid - beta ( Aß ) protein — but what causes the accumulation of the plaques ?
One candidate is mitochondrial dysfunction , which can result in high levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and also rob the cell of energy it needs for maintenance of homeostasis .
Hauptmann et al. report that in an AD mouse model , mitochondrial dysfunction can be observed very early in the progression of the disease : Indeed , mitochondria begin to exhibit respiratory - chain defects well before extracellular plaques can be observed :
Mitochondrial dysfunction :
An early event in Alzheimer pathology accumulates with age in AD transgenic mice Recent evidence suggests mitochondrial dysfunction as a common early pathomechanism in Alzheimer ’s disease integrating genetic factors related to enhanced amyloid - beta ( Aß ) production and tau - hyperphosphorylation with aging , as the most relevant sporadic risk factor .
To further clarify the synergistic effects of aging and Aß pathology , we used isolated mitochondria of double Swedish and London mutant APP transgenic mice and of non-tg littermates .
Pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction in adult
Thy - 1 APP mice , such as a drop of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced ATP - levels already appeared at 3 months when elevated intracellular but not extracellular Aß deposits are present .
Mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with higher levels of reactive oxygen species , an altered Bcl - xL / Bax ratio and reduction of COX IV activity .
We observed significant decreases in state 3 respiration and FCCP - uncoupled respiration in non-tg mice after treatment with extracellular Aß. Similar deficits were seen only in aged Thy - 1 APP mice , probably due to compensation within the respiratory chain in young animals .
We conclude that Aß dependent mitochondrial dysfunction starts already at 3 months in this AD model before extracellular deposition of Aß and progression accelerates substantially with aging .
To the extent that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to pathology , it could partially explain why AD is a disease of old age , since mitochondria deteriorate over the course of aging .
Granted , these mice are APP mutants and already primed to develop AD .
In a wildtype animal , could mitochondrial dysfunction somehow interfere with protein folding , secretion or clearance machinery and thereby jump - start the process of Aß aggregation ?
Peter Thompson is a Berkshire - based researcher and science writer .
He edits The Lay Scientist , a website giving an overview of science , pseudoscience and evidence - based politics .
Peter Thompson graduated from the University of Chicago where he was under the tutelage of Lars Peter Hansen ( The David Rockefeller Distinguished Service Professor in Economics and Research Director of the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics ) ; Arnold C. Harberger ( The Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in Economics ) and James J. Heckman ( Henry Schultz Distinguished Service Professor in Economics ) and many more lecturers and as of late partner and editor at the popular Forex trading site forexbrokersreviews.com .
His passion for science
Peter Thompson ’s passion for science began in his early teenage years .
He wanted to understand his own and others ’ places in society and where they could be , not just locally but globally .
Since then has followed current affairs with interest .
This led him exploring further the causes and effects of human interactions through the study of economics and politics .
His participation in the financial planing for expansion of one of Internet ’s biggest online portals – www.bestcasino.org played a significant role in developing his economic theories .
The explanations and predictions , as well as more universal theories that underlie human behaviour , offered insight into the validity of the various competing political choices .
His overviews are published in The Lay Scientist .
How did he become researcher and science writer ?
At college Peter Thompson was keen to delve deeper and studied up to PhD level with research into developing business angel investment in the US .
Economic research in the UK had already shown stimulating business angel investment was worth millions of dollars in the UK , ensuring government support for this key source of entrepreneurial finance .
Science writers , like all other journalists , have an insatiable appetite for reading and Peter Thompson has been endowed with a memory like a filing cabinet which helps .
To that is added a child - like curiosity about the world around him and how it works .
A self - taught writer , Thompson has always liked science writing and the ability to write science overviews in a way that the general public can understand .
This lead to the first edition of The Lay Scientist .

The simple answer is ‘ both ’ .
Finance whether for business or study has strong roots in the science of mathematics and statistics and a lot of modern financial theories resemble scientific language .
Yet the financial industry is affected by the decisions made from human emotions in many ways , giving it an element of being an art as well as a science .
For many people , finance = math where it is all about numbers and science and proven identities and historical performance .
For others , finance is about psychology , emotion , and the endless possibilities on offer from which to make a choice or plan .
Finance as science
In the financial world there are incontrovertible mathematical realities .
If your outgoings consistently surpass your income , you will end up in debt is a simple example .
Use of the laws of statistics and mathematics found in science are found in modern financial theories .
The Black Scholes model , a model of price variation over time , for stocks as an example , would not exist without these scientific laws .
Theoretical constructs such as the capital asset pricing model ( CAPM ) and the efficient market hypothesis ( EMH ) attempt to logically explain the behaviour of the stock market in an emotionless , completely rational manner , entirely ignoring elements such as market sentiment and investor emotions .

While Avinash Arora was capturing Star Wars stills in order to make his 6 - foot - long photomosaic of Luke 's Last Supper , Devorah Sperber spooled together an exhibit of similar artwork devoted to Star Trek .
Mirror Universe , Sperber 's show that opens March 20 at Caren Golden Fine Art in New York , consists of crafty
Trek imagery pieced together out of beads and spools of thread .
The show 's title is an allusion to the 1967 Trek episode " Mirror , Mirror , " in which the Enterprise
crew is swapped with evil doppelgängers , but it also refers to the way viewers are supposed to look at the exhibit 's art – via reflective materials .
" The concept and title for this exhibition gelled when I realized every Star Trek
series had at least one episode based on the concept of a mirror or parallel universe , which fit in with my ongoing interest in the link between art and science , human perception and subjective reality , " Sperber says .
For some of the pieces , Sperber used spools of thread to create photomosaics of Trek characters .
A 47 x 37.5 x 60 - inch portrait of Spock took 1,200 spools to make ; a stainless steel ball is required to see the piece right side up .
Sperber also threaded together TNG's Holodeck ( using 9,600 spools ) and the Enterprise bridge ( 5,822 spools ) .
To re-create the look of being beamed up , Sperber used semi-translucent beads to thread the standing characters into shape .
The image of Captain Kirk ( pictured ) uses 25,000 plastic beads strung onto monofilament .
" The beaded figures are the most time - consuming works I have done to date , " Sperber reveals .
" In addition to laying out the beads in the correct order and stringing them onto monofilament , aligning the beads and attaching them to a hanging apparatus took weeks and weeks for each figure . "
Sperber also re-created
Trek scenes using chenille stems , creating a needlepointlike pixelated snapshot from the show .
What inspired Sperber to tackle the Trek project ?
" Although I am not a Trekkie , I have a vague recollection of watching reruns of the original Star Trek series in the 1970s with my father , " says Sperber .
" I also watched Star Trek : The Next Generation
for a while in the late 1980s , but I was never a fanatic until 2002 , when for a few months , I began scheduling my days so I could watch reruns ... every afternoon on Spike TV .
I remember wondering why I was so intrigued .
" Eventually , I realized the series offered an escape from the tumultuous post - 9/11 world by presenting a utopian perspective of humanity at its best , " she explains .
" The mission of the TNG Enterprise
was exploration and , with the exception of the Borg ( you may recall their defining motto was ' resistance is futile ' ) , the crew 's confrontations with alien life forms were mostly based on misunderstandings and cultural differences vs. battles between good and evil . "
Sperber 's exhibit runs through April 26 at the Caren Golden Fine Art gallery in New York .

The madness was constant and still , sitting there , like a place on a map .
The women in the beautifully brutal film 12 Years A Slave were mangled and maliciously intertwined .
It was where they lived , where they were from , born and bred into mundane inescapable crazy .
The twisted relationship dynamics between the two lead female characters Patsey and Mistress Epps in 12 Years A Slave are a horror .
A painfully vivid illustration of the dank gnarly negotiations women had to make with each other to survive the demonic conditions of American slavery .
The film fearlessly exposes a suppurating historic wound between Black and White women so wicked and utterly honest , it is both repulsive and liberating to witness .
We see the dark and sweet Patsey , doubly enslaved by virtue of her race and beauty , sway for a moment , let go like a girl , do a slow twirl .
She is loose trying to lose herself , and she slips , for a moment , into a trance induced by the sound of her only friend Solomon ’s sad singing violin .
His is almost music .
She is almost dancing .
It is all almost a human moment .
All of a sudden she goes limp , drops , knocked back into the terror of her life , by a heavy crystal decanter hurled at her head by Mistress Epps .
All of a sudden , she is once again a battered pile of dirty black woman parts wrapped in rags down on the floor .
Mistress Epps is hate , full , guided and preserved by it .
Patsey , the object , the affliction .
She is , in Mistress Epps molested mind , literally the mistress .
Her husband Edwin Epps is addicted to Patsey , a deadly habit he will not kick , not for his wife , not for her dignity nor her sanity .

She too was in hell and Black enslaved women where the only ones in the chambers bellow her .
So she sent her rage down and with her hot hate burned what was left of the bitches .
And the black women scorched beyond human recognition were left in pieces scattered and buried somewhere beneath hell .

The second plane , as no one needs to be told , was the one that hit the World Trade Center ’s second tower .
And it was the one which , as Martin Amis found himself writing within a few days of the event , utterly annihilated the hope that what was happening that September morning might have been nothing more than a terrible , tragic accident : “ That was the defining moment .
Until then , America thought she was witnessing nothing more serious than the worst aviation disaster in history ; now she had a sense of the fantastic vehemence ranged against her . …
That second plane looked eagerly alive , and galvanized with malice , and wholly alien .
For those thousands in the South Tower , the second plane meant the end of everything .
For us , its glint was the worldflash of a coming future . ”
The Second Plane : September 11 : Terror and Boredom By Martin Amis Knopf , 224 pages
Amis , of course , is best known as the author of such novels as “ The Information , ” “ Money ” and “ London Fields . ”
His most frequent fictional mode is a species of carefully observed , somewhat brutal and frequently hilarious social satire .
But his new book , “ The Second Plane : September 11 : Terror and Boredom , ” is a pure product of the “ coming future ” he speaks of here , a book fully shaped by the single event that many take to have defined our era .
“ The Second Plane ” collects 14 of Amis ’ recent short works : essays , reviews , a pair of short stories .
Granted its unifying theme , the book is still something of a hodgepodge ; it was clearly not conceived as a cohesive work .
But the pieces ’ very lack of unity feels somehow appropriate to the subject .
Here are 14 attempts , each one almost self - confessedly a failure , to respond in an adequate way to what cannot adequately be responded to .
“ The Second Plane ” affords an interesting opportunity : to watch an intelligent person trying , over time , to think through the unthinkable turn his reality has taken .
“ I have cut nothing , ” Amis remarks in his author ’s note , “ briefly tempting though it was , at times , to cover my tracks . ”
These tracks , and the evolution of the author ’s desires to cover them , are perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book .
Amis ’ views on some matters remain fairly constant :
He is reliably critical both of the Bush presidency and of the Iraq war , for example .
But his thoughts on the book ’s deepest question — what are the obligations that violence , and in particular mass slaughter , thrusts upon us as inhabitants of the world in which it occurs ? — undergo a quite noticeable transformation over the six years the book ’s writings represent .
The opening piece , “ The Second Plane , ” was published a mere week after September 11 .
Here we find Amis shocked and bewildered , but interestingly open - minded and up to the challenge of thinking about the terrorist act in all its aspects and implications , up to and including a consideration of why the terrorists did it :
“ It will also be horribly difficult and painful for Americans to absorb the fact that they are hated , and hated intelligibly .
How many of them know , for example , that their government has destroyed at least 5 percent of the Iraqi population ?
How many of them then transfer that figure to America ( and come up with fourteen million ) ?
Various national characteristics — self - reliance , a fiercer patriotism than any in Western Europe , an assiduous geographical incuriosity — have created a deficit of empathy for the sufferings of people far away .
…
Unless Pakistan can actually deliver bin Laden , the American retaliation is almost sure to become elephantine .
Then terror from above will replenish the source of all terror from below : unhealed wounds . ”
Of all the possible cuts that must have tempted Amis , the one that was most difficult to resist was surely that word intelligibly .
For the idea that America was intelligibly hated — the idea that any aspect of the terrorists ’ sentiments and actions could be considered even minimally intelligible or rational or comprehensible — is precisely what he would come to want to deny .
This is nowhere more evident than in the author ’s note :
“ The first piece — published on September 18 , 2001 — has a slightly hallucinatory quality ( it is fevered by shock and by rumor ) , and also indulges in what Paul Berman , the author of Terror and Liberalism , has called ‘ rationalist naïveté ’ — a reflexive search for the morally intelligible , which always leads to the chimera of ‘ moral equivalence . ’ ”
By Sept. 18 many people , particularly in the United States , had decided that understanding the terrorists ’ motives , not to mention the American foreign policy decisions that had helped form the background for the attacks , was precisely the last thing they wanted to do .
( Amis , apparently , took somewhat longer to come around to this point of view , but eventually he did . )
This refusal to reflect , to investigate , to learn , still seems regrettable , but the reaction is perhaps not impossible to understand .
In the shadow of an atrocity of this magnitude , any attempt at explanation might be seen as amounting to the suggestion that the victims “ had it coming . ”
One wants to retort that this worry is ungrounded :
It is acknowledged by all reasonable parties that no one could possibly have had this coming , whatever damage American foreign policy might have done .
Still , the worry persists , particularly in light of the knowledge that not all of the concerned parties are reasonable , that there are those who will take any proffered explanation of the terrorists ’ actions as amounting to a justification .
The temptation , in the light of this , is to insist on regarding the attacks as an incomprehensible event , something so alien to our sense of morality that any attempt to penetrate its baffling surface is doomed to failure , and indeed risks pulling us into the moral void that lies at its core .
The perpetrators are not to be regarded as rational agents , and certainly not as political actors , but as the exact opposite , members of a “ death cult ” that rejects reason altogether : “ Thanatism derives its real energy , its fever and its magic , from something far more radical .
And here we approach a pathology that may in the end be unassimilable to the non-believing mind .
I mean the rejection of reason — the rejection of the sequitur , of cause and effect , of two plus two .
…
To transcend reason is of course to transcend the confines of moral law ; it is to enter the illimitable world of insanity and death . ”
It should probably be acknowledged that in at least some cases , the “ death cult ” description rings reasonably true .
Still , one ca n’t help but think that there remains something we ought rationally to try to understand , and that is the surprising and distressing level of identification with the perpetrators of 9/11 among moderate Muslims who cannot be written off as being brainwashed by a death cult , who in fact seem to have values rather similar to those values Westerners claim as their own .
Moreover , one must take seriously the fact that , against the background of the religious claims the members of the “ death cult ” accept , even they can be viewed as displaying a kind of disturbing , perverse rationality — so long as one manages to forget how irrational one needs to be to accept such beliefs to begin with .
What of “ the chimera of ‘ moral equivalence ’ “ ?
Here , too , one might feel considerable sympathy for Amis ’ position while nonetheless hesitating to completely endorse his stance .
The trouble is that “ moral equivalence ” can mean two very different things .
First , the phrase can stand for the idea that what the terrorists have done is no worse , from a moral point of view , than what our governments have done .
Let us suppose that Amis is right to reject it in this sense .
( I will return to this question . )
Still , there is a second sense of moral equivalence that needs to be distinguished : the idea that everyone , including the radical Islamists and including ourselves , should be held to the same moral standards .
In this sense , “ moral equivalence ” amounts to a claim of moral universalism .
And this , too , is an idea that many would deny .
Indeed it seems to constitute a kind of moral common sense among a significant number of Americans that American actions are not subject to evaluation by the same standards as are the actions of others — a fact about which Amis , early in the book , displays an admirable awareness : “ Most crucially , and again most painfully , being right and being good support the American self to an almost tautological degree : Americans are good and right by virtue of being American .
Saul Bellow ’s word for this habit is ‘ angelization . ’ ”
Amis is correct here to draw a link between this odious form of American exceptionalism , according to which we can do no wrong ( the sort of thinking that justifies our belief in the legitimacy of our possessing weapons of mass destruction while being morally affronted at the thought that any other nation might want to possess them ) , and the lack of concern in this country for the suffering of others .
The American media pay vastly more attention to the American body count in Iraq than to the much larger number of Iraqi civilian deaths ; relatively few Americans seem troubled by the latter figure , or have cited it as a compelling objection to the Iraq war .
American right - wing thinkers have tended to encourage this “ angelization ” by reacting with overstated outrage to any suggestion that residents of the Western world be treated as inhabiting the same moral universe as the terrorists ( or , in all too many cases , as Muslims or Arabs in general ) .
Against this background , Amis needs to work somewhat harder to separate himself from this position , to close off the possibility that his somewhat vitriolic denunciations of the idea of moral equivalence might be read as the claim that nothing we do could possibly be as bad as what the terrorists have done — when what he seems to want to say is that as a matter of substantive fact , and as measured by moral standards applying to all , what the terrorists have done does indeed turn out to be worse than anything we have done .
Moreover , the substantive issue is not quite as straightforwardly obvious as Amis would appear to think .
One needs at least to acknowledge that both the U.S. and Britain have engaged in the intentional mass killing of civilians : the indiscriminate bombings of German and Japanese cities in World War II .
This is not to equate the two cases from a moral point of view .
The bombings of German and Japanese civilians were strategic , and seen as means to an end — means , indeed , toward the end , that is , the end of the war .
The architects of September 11 , by contrast , killed as an expressive act , in which what was expressed was a passionate and genocidal rage , expecting nothing to come of it but death , destruction and terror .
They killed to increase killing , indeed to inspire it , not to end it .
So Amis is right that the more correct comparison is with what the Nazis did , and not with what the Americans and British did , in World War II .
Still , he ought to have mentioned the latter , as ought all who treat with contempt the idea that there is any sort of moral equivalence to be found here .
The bombing of German and Japanese cities was not morally equivalent to September 11 , but there is an important commonality :
They both involve the intentional mass killing of civilians , which is never permissible or justifiable .
We can emphasize this while still insisting that the existence of the earlier case does absolutely nothing to justify the latter , and that the comparison of the two cases does not at all decrease the gravity of the September 11 attacks , let alone somehow render them excusable .
In fact its effect should be the opposite : to remind us of how serious , and how unforgivable , are some of the things that have been done in our name .
There is a certain tendency to treat jihadists as if they have simply pulled out of thin air the idea that parts of the Quran seem to advocate violence against non-Muslims .
It would be considerably more pleasant , of course , if there were no such passages to be found .
But there are , and so moderates find themselves needing some way of trying to render them palatable .
These days , the attempt is frequently based on a “ partners in crime ” approach .
When one of the participants in a public discussion points out that the Quran does , in fact , contain passages which at least apparently condone violence against non-Muslims and other barbarities , it is almost certain that someone will respond with , “ Ah , but so does the Bible . ”
So a passage in which Allah calls for the mass slaughter of non-Muslims is juxtaposed with , say , Deuteronomy 20:17 .
( “ But thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee . ” )
It is thus supposed to be established that we , as members of a culture shaped by Christianity , are in no position to criticize the Quran for whatever injunctions to violence it might contain .
The popularity of this strategy is both perplexing and appalling .
Why is the comparison supposed to carry any weight at all ?
Why , that is , are we to assume that when someone is criticizing the Quran , he or she is doing it from a Biblical perspective ?
Why ca n’t we reject both ?
Amis would reply that we can , and should — indeed , we can and should — reject them all : “ Since it is no longer permissible to disparage any single faith or creed , let us start disparaging all of them .
To be clear : an ideology is a belief system with an inadequate basis in reality ; a religion is a belief system with no basis in reality whatever .
Religious belief is without reason and without dignity , and its record is near - universally dreadful .
It is straightforward — and never mind , for now , about plagues and famines : if God existed , and if he cared for humankind , he would never have given us religion . ”
This hostility toward religion will displease both moderates and extremists .
Amis might seem more tolerant elsewhere , when he draws the distinction between fear of Islam , and fear of Islamism : “ I was once asked : ‘ Are you an Islamophobe ? ’
And the answer is no .
What I am is an Islamismophobe , or better say an anti-Islamist , because a phobia is an irrational fear , and it is not irrational to fear something that says it wants to kill you . ”
But this need not — and , in Amis ’ case , does not — imply a tolerance toward moderate religion in the philosophical or emotional sense .
To say that we should not fear moderate religion is not to say that we should admire or embrace it .
Nor does either amount to a claim about whether moderate faith should be legally or politically tolerated .
Nowhere in “ The Second Plane ” is it suggested that anyone ought to be denied the right to believe and practice Islam , or any other faith .
It is perfectly consistent to claim that “ [ t ] oday , in the West , there are no good excuses for religious belief — unless we think that ignorance , reaction , and sentimentality are good excuses , ” while allowing that people have the right to act in ways for which they have no good excuse , so long as they do not infringe other people ’s rights in the process .
Amis is , moreover , perfectly on target when he decries the current tendency to identify moderate religion as the mainstream , and to treat skepticism and , in particular , atheism as kinds of extremism — mirror images , as it were , of religious fundamentalism :
“ In this general view , fundamentalists are on one wing , atheists are on the other , and the supposed center is occupied by moderate believers and a few laconic agnostics .
Secular fanaticism , secular hatred — these equivalencies are fictions . …
The key point , of course , is that secularism contains no warrant for action .
One can afford to be crude about this .
When Islamists crash passenger planes into buildings , or hack off the heads of hostages , they shout , ‘ God is great ! ’
When secularists do that kind of thing , what do they shout ? ”
This is , indeed , somewhat crude , but it is , perhaps , refreshingly crude :
There is a truth here that is too infrequently expressed .
( One ca n’t help but wish , though , that Amis had mentioned the second key difference , which is that the standard skeptic , unlike the typical religious believer , is able to say what evidence it would take to make her change her beliefs . )
Amis ’ comments in a 2006 interview with The Times of London were cruder still , and less defensibly so .
There , he seemed to suggest open discrimination against Muslims and “ people who look like they ’re from the Middle East or from Pakistan ” — measures including travel restrictions and , potentially , deportation — in order to encourage the community to crack down on its more violent members .
Amis has since distanced himself from these remarks , claiming that he was not making a serious policy suggestion but simply “ conversationally describing an urge — an urge that soon wore off . ”
One might well hesitate to let him off quite so easily :
The remarks really were not only , as he himself now admits , “ stupid , ” but deeply offensive .
( Such overtly discriminatory policies have something important in common with terrorism :
They violate the rule that the innocent are not to be punished for the crimes of others . )
On the other hand , the price of engaging in moral thought in a serious way — rather than simply standing on the sidelines and muttering platitudes about the goodness of peace and tolerance — is that one will on occasion give offense , including legitimate offense ; and the only way to guarantee that one never hits the wrong target is to avoid taking any sort of stand at all .
This is clearly a price Martin Amis is not willing to pay .
In response , his intellectual opponents have attempted to dismiss his criticisms of militant Islamism as nothing more than intolerant expressions of right - wing prejudice .
But this charge is badly overinflated .
If Amis ’ writings are intolerant , then it is intolerance of an admirable sort — the attitude that refuses to tolerate the oppression of , and the infliction of violence on , women , nonbelievers and others .
Jihadism , as Amis recently told Rachel Donadio of The New York Times , is “ racist , homophobic , totalitarian , genocidal , inquisitorial and imperialistic .
Surely there should be no difficulty in announcing one ’s hostility to that , but there is . ”

Print This Email This MSNBC's Joe Scarborough talked with Nation editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel about the Elliot Spitzer scandal .
Vanden Heuvel , a classmate of the New York governor 's at Princeton , expressed concern that Spitzer was targeted unfairly , while the MSNBC host called the probe a waste of resources .
Speculating that Spitzer was " targeted " by the right , the Nation editor said , " I think we need to look hard at what was going on in that IRS office and what was going on in the attorney general . "
Scarborough , a former GOP congressman , agreed , saying that " it just does n't add up .
We 're in a war on terror , for god 's sake , and you 're wiretapping hookers ? "
" Does anyone really believe you can buy Eliot Spitzer for $ 10,000 , $ 20,000 ? "
Scarborough rhetorically asked .
" He 's a multimillionaire living on Fifth Avenue . "
This video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast March 12 , 2008 .
Transcript via closed captions :: katrina vanden heuvel , thank you for being with us . :: hi , katrina . :: hi. :: i know you went to school with eliot spitzer and y'all are very tight . :: no . i want to say two things . :: in defense of eliot spitzer , he went after some people that needed to go after . :: we were talking before , joe , he was my classmate at princeton , i hung with a fast crowd , he was the student president .
it 's a tragedy .
i saw lost in your cover this morning , was do n't forget , and the tragedy for the team , is this man took on corporate greed , corporate criminals and did a lot for consumers in this country and set a paradigm for andrew quo moe as attorney general .
i hope that is not tarnished with all that has happened . :: and there are a lot of people that will say that he went too far .
the grasso stories . :: there was a cruelty , there was an excess . :: there was an excess .
people said that also about rudy giuliani .
rudy giuliani cleaned up the mob , did a lot of good things , but there was excess with him .
but the interesting thing about his legacy is , it 's not people in new york he helped the most .
there are a lot of investors , mom and pop investors who worked their entire life .
and people do n't know this and they need to listen .
they need to listen .
the system is rigged .
when you go after stock brokerage things that did very bad things in 19 9 9 and 2000 and he went after the most powerful interests in america .
i'm not a huge fan of his , but he did it , and who got helped the most , the mom and pop people across america that spent their entire life working to invest in a wall street firm and lose it all in a year . :: absolutely .
joe , i have to say , and i do not engage lightly in these kind of things , but i think there is a question that needs to be investigated about whether eliot spitzer was targeted , because of the powers he took on on wall street . :: absolutely .
i think that 's a huge question .
:: john edwards , in my mind , to go to the presidential for a moment , raised the central question in our democracy today , when controls this government ?
the people or corporate power ?
eliot spitzer took on much of that .
we 've got to look at targeting -- and by the way , how much money , it 's terribly hypocrite hypocriteical of him .
in this country today , legally and illegally , do you know how much money is laundered , going after this kind of money -- it 's because he 's eliot spitzer . :: and we can't just blame wall street , because everybody hates eliot spitzer . :: i know democrats in new york -- :: democrats hate him , republicans hate him , it 's not a conspiracy if everybody hates him . :: no , no , it 's not a conspiracy .
eric schneider wrote a piece for the nation a few weeks ago .
there 's not a lot of love lost between democrats who just want a great state senate seat up in new york , one seat away from taking over albany and look what 's going on .
this is a distraction . :: i have a question , though .
this is all early , but he may have been -- mr. spitzer may have been doing this for six years .
he may have been using public money inappropriately .
even if he 's targeted , why set yourself up for that ?
for six years , it 's another thing if someone is trying to prove that someone had a problem that they do n't have , which mr. spitzer tried to do , i believe . :: he did some very bad things . :: why set yourself up ?
if you 're a guy who 's like , do whatever you want , live the way you want , you 've got a little bit of pot in your car , big deal . :: i think this guy lived on the edge , i do n't want to put him on the couch .
why do we see this happen around the country .
every year someone cracks .
someone 's been living a private life , a secret life .
what he was doing is pretty tawdry .
but it 's like -- does it impinge -- this seems to impinge on public because of the that we should be taking off the book .
we should have cracked down on trafficking .
on the money piece of it , i think we need to look hard at what was going on in that irs office and what was going on in the attorney general . :: it just does n't add up .
are they really going to -- we 're in a war on terror , for god 's sake , and you 're wiretapping hookers ?
i' sorry . :: what happened is because people thought he was moving money .
i did n't start with the hookers . :: that 's b.s. too .
here you got a guy who is a multi , multimillionaire .
he lives on fifth avenue -- hold on , he lives on fifth avenue .
if you 're a prosecutor , you look , what do you look at ?
you 're say , for instance , back during the cold war , they would target gays , why would they target gays , they would target gays because they knew they were more likely to break .
and somebody whispers , we 're going to tell your wife your gay unless you give the soviet union secrets .
does any really believe you can buy eliot spitzer for $ 10,000 , $ 20,000 .
he 's a multimillionaire living on fifth avenue . :: what joe said about squandered resource , where are our resources going if they 're wiretapping hookers . :: i thought we did n't have money to fight the war on terror . :: and we do n't have money to help veterans .
can we get some money into a public investment agenda to protect our ports , all this kind of things .
instead we 're fueling a new arms race in the world and we 're wiretapping hookers .
something 's wrong with our national priorities . :: the missiles and the weapons of war , i'm against hookers being wiretapped .
Brooklyn kickball team Los Pirates Mechanicos ( pictured ) are down one man as of yesterday ; Lawrence Jackson ( better known as Lance ) was arrested for carrying around a rusty pirate sword ( also pictured ) in Macy's .
Unsurprisingly , the NYPD took it for a weapon , not a recreational sports prop .
While the " Free Lance ! " comments come in on the team 's MySpace profile , the NY Post tosses around labels like " bonehead , " " rabblerouser " and " kook " amongst their descriptives of the Greenpoint kickballer .
Jackson was allegedly at Macy 's shopping for eyeglasses with his 8 - months pregnant girlfriend Teresa .
The couple , who were planning to go to McCarren Park for a game post - Macy 's , did n't expect any problems from carrying around the giant metal sword ( surprisingly , no one had reacted to it on the subway system earlier that day ) .
Teresa told the paper , " It 's metal , but it 's a fake sword .
It 's not like he was going to hurt anyone . "
Meanwhile , the cops noted that the couple " did n't think there was anything wrong with it .
He thought it was a toy .
But it 's not a toy .
It 's sharp . "
Reportedly Jackson frightened some shoppers , and the sword was heavy enough to make a loud noise when he dropped it .
As if being arrested for carrying around a sword meant for a kickball game was n't enough , Jackson was also busted for marijuana possession and he has an outstanding pot warrant already !
The Pirates have been known to smoke up while they play , something that 's even alluded to in photos online .
Kickballers take note , the Brooklyn Kickball page warns : " the pot you smoke could get ya busted .
or Trouble . "
UPDATE : The captain of the kickball team wrote in with the following comment .
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Anna Loginova was , for many Russians , a feminine icon -- bridging the glamorous world of modeling and the murky depths of Russian crime .
Anna Loginova is photographed in one of her last shoots for the Russian edition of Maxim magazine .
But this week , the stunning Loginova became a victim of the criminals she made sure could not get to her millionaire clients .
She was killed trying to stop a thief stealing her own car on a busy Moscow street .
As a glamour model , 29 - year - old Loginova often appeared on the covers of Russian magazines , scantily clad .
She fronted advertisements for high - profile brands in Russia , like the German carmaker BMW .
But behind the glossy images , Loginova had another profession :
She was an experienced bodyguard , trained in martial arts , commanding high prices to protect Russia 's wealthy elite .
One notable client was Russian boxer Kostya Tszyu .
Watch editor describe how she never had fear »
Having a female bodyguard is more than just a status symbol in Russia .
Industry insiders say women bodyguards are not recognizable and , thus , allowed to sit at tables with their clients during dinners and other events -- unlike their male peers who are usually forced to wait in the lobby .
Those who knew Loginova say she was passionate about her double life , saying she saw no contradiction between her femininity and her dangerous job as a bodyguard .
" She was kind and sweet , not like a terminator , not like Sigourney Weaver in ' Aliens , ' " said Igor Cherski , editor of Maxim magazine 's Russian edition , which commissioned her last glamour shoot .
" But I feel that she was not afraid of anything .
There was no fear in her eyes , " he added .
Do n't Miss Eye on Russia
It seems that fearlessness may have gotten her killed .
On a busy street in southeastern Moscow on Sunday night , police say they recovered her battered body after she tried to prevent her Porsche Cayenne from being stolen -- clinging on to the high - end SUV as it sped away .
The vehicle was later found abandoned .
" According to eyewitnesses , an intruder just threw her out of the car , " explains Oleg Pavlov , a special police investigator in charge of the investigation .
" She grabbed the door handle , but when the car took off and picked up speed , she let go . "
No one has been arrested in connection with the killing .
Russian media have been giving the killing prominent coverage , with witnesses expressing their shock that this kind of crime could happen .
But luxury car theft in Moscow is not uncommon , and Loginova herself was no stranger to it .
In her last magazine interview , she described how she foiled another carjacking just four months ago as she parked her car outside a flashy Moscow fashion boutique .
" So while I was closing my car , a guy of 30 years old or slightly older jumped on me , " Loginova said .
" So I did a jujitsu move -- I bent his hand that grabbed mine , and struck him in the face with my elbow .
It was a total surprise for him .
" As he was leaning back covering his face , I pulled a pistol from my bag and aimed it at him .
He obviously realized that was no joke , " she said .
" Then a car immediately pulled up nearby , something like a Honda , a dark car , and he jumped into it .
And I still stood there with my pistol .
I was actually spooked too . "
That experience apparently emboldened Loginova to defend her car for a second time .
But she was overwhelmed .
Even the formidable skills of Russia 's most famous -- and glamorous -- bodyguard could n't save her .

Al Qaeda does not exist and never has
The basic truth is that Al Qaeda does not exist and never has .
Al Qaeda is a manufactured enemy who was created by the Bush Administration in order to have an excuse to wage a war for the control of the world ’s oil resources .
Did an American even hear the words “ Al Qaeda ” before 9 - 11 ?
Or were we told that its alleged leader Osama Bin Laden has family who themselves have personal business relationships with George W. Bush ’s family and that both families had financially profited considerably from the “ War on Terror ” ?
If “ Al Qaeda ” was such an organized group terrorists as we are being told then why were n’t we the people notified of this evil threat when the US Cole was bombed a few months before 9 - 11 ?
“ Al Qaeda ” is nothing more than a broad euphemistic umbrella classification used to group any Middle Eastern fighter under the Sun as an enemy .
The most diabolical aspect of this public relations stunt is that it enables the current Administration to label any group it feels necessary to attack to appear to be related to an unprovable organized enemy while at the same time actually increasing its approval ratings by exploiting the basic primal fears of the American public .
Furthermore when one realizes the questionable motivations that this Administration has used previously to attack an enemy , as what is now surfacing about the Iraq War , one begins to get the strange feeling that this Orwellian double - speak is nothing more than a smoke and mirror illusion whose true intentions would of made Goebbels himself jealous .
Think about it :
How could a bunch of technologically unadvanced group of people from third - world nations such as “ Al Qaeda ” ever have any real central organization structure ?
If they had any real organization they would have most certainly attacked us again after September eleventh .
Where are all the terrorist cells in this country ?
Contrary to what has been implicitly presented in the media there HAS NEVER been a single domestic terror cell caught since Bush has been in office !
The majority of suspects that have been arrested and detained in the immediate aftermath of 9 - 11 with the exception of a handful have not been charged with crimes in anyway associated with terrorism .
All of their crimes are minor and for the most part are !
related to immigration violations of some sort .
There is some ambiguity in all of this though because to this day the Ashcroft Justice Department has been less than forthcoming with the specifics of these arrests .
Why would this be the case if the justifications for these arrests were really legitimate ?
We have been bombarded by the media with every indignity from the duck - tape chronicles to the crop dusting threat .
You would think that with all this seeming sensitivity by our government about informing the general populace about possible terror threats , especially when some of their sources came from “ unnamed and confidential secondary sources ” , that the Ashcroft Justice Department would have gone out of it ’s way to mention to the public any terrorist connections that the people detained after 9 - 11 had and would of sworn by it on a stack of Bibles .
To date the only really suspicious activity of people detained after 9 - 11 were a group of Israelis who were caught in Jersey City , New Jersey filming themselves in the foreground of the burning World Trade Center with “ looks of jubilation on their faces ” .
It was later confirmed that two of the gentlemen detained had known Mossad ties .
While they were detained it is of no matter now as they were subsequently released from jail a few !
weeks later and were allowed to go back to Israel with no questions asked by the direct authorization of the Justice Department .
I guess they were just dropping off a box of cigars to Governor McGreevy ?
What is even more illuminating about all of this is that to this day nobody has taken responsibility for the attacks of 9 - 11 , including “ Al Qaeda ” .
The only thing to link these attacks to anyone is the video tape of Osama Bin Laden that was conveniently found in a cave in Afghanistan that had him talking about the physical structure of the World Trade Center and the plane strike .
The audio quality of this tape is so poor that any objective Arab - speaking analyst who was asked to give their opinion was unable to do so !
as they claimed that just about all the words on it were inaudible .
I believe an objective investigation into this original tape ’s authenticity could verify if this admission is in fact genuine and could shed some light on the truth of the existence of “ Al Qaeda ” .
But even if this tape is genuine what would this really prove ?
As I have already mentioned it is common knowledge that Osama Bin Laden is connected to George W. Bush ’s family by a minimum of two degrees of separation .
So in the grand scheme of things what does this really matter ?
That the Cobra Commander said he did it ?
In summary , “ Al Qaeda ” does not exist nor has it ever .
If it really existed to anywhere near the extent that we have been told then there would have been an attack on our homeland .
Of course this proof of a negative is used by the Administration to justify themselves to the American public that they are doing their jobs , but when one realizes that “ Al Qaeda ” is really nothing more than an artificially manufactured enemy then what job are they really doing other than capitalizing off of people ’s fears ?
What other issue does the present Administration have to offer the average working - class citizen other than security ?
And if security is really only a Red Herring platform issue , then of what use are they to begin with ?
In addition , ! if there were any degree of truth in the strength of “ Al Qaeda ” or even of their very existence then there would have been a much larger resistance in Afghanistan and especially in Iraq .
If an organization structure existed within “ Al Qaeda ” then you would have seen the Iraqi resistance be a much more conventional !
one .
They would have had the communication capability and weapons arsenal to mount a more traditional counter - offensive against our troops and they would have been successful doing it because our force ’s numbers are so minimal .
This would have been a prime opportunity to defeat “ the great satan ” in front of the entire world .
Their motivation to do so would have been so strong that in order for them to of not of done this one must make the quantum leap and conclude that “ Al Qaeda ” is much to do about nothing and always has been .
The emperor is naked and running through the courtyard with a great big barrel of oil .

Acid3 : Opera hits 98/100
It is probably no surprise that we were working on Acid3 given the latest weekly snapshot .
However , what might be a surprise is that our post - Kestrel builds are at 98/100 .
It ’s unlikely we ’ll get that far with the official Kestrel release , but to keep some level of competition in passing the latest Acid test we wanted to share this .
I ’m told a public “ alpha ” build to demonstrate this is imminent .
Among the interesting new features are hsla ( ) / rgba( ) and Web fonts ( @font - face ) .

Most Arabs feel Iraqis would be able to bridge their differences if US troops left Eight out of 10 people in the Arab world have a negative view of the US , according to a new poll .
By extension , governments supported by the US are unpopular , found the survey , which was released in Washington .
A recent BBC World Service survey found views of the US had started to improve by 4 % globally , although they remained negative in the Arab world .
Only 6 % of Arabs believe the US troop surge in Iraq has worked , according to the latest poll .
It was carried out by the University of Maryland and Zogby International .
A majority of Arabs believe that if US troops withdraw from Iraq , Iraqis would be able to bridge their differences , the survey found .
In contrast , an ABC / BBC poll conducted in Iraq and released in March , appeared to show a 20 % increase in the number of Iraqis who felt the surge was succeeding and described the security situation as good .
Nasrallah 's popularity
While the Western - backed Lebanese government has reasonable appeal in its own country , the latest survey indicates it has barely any support in the Arab world .
While Sunni rulers in the region worry about Shia Iran 's growing influence , ordinary Arabs do n't seem to view Iran as a threat
Some 30 % of Arabs sympathise with the Lebanese opposition , led by Hezbollah , which is backed by Syria and Iran .
Across the Arab world , Hezbollah 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , is also the most popular leader , followed by Syrian President Bashar al - Assad and Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The three leaders are seen as the only ones standing up against US influence in the region .
And while Sunni rulers in the region worry about Shia Iran 's growing influence , ordinary Arabs do n't seem to view Iran as a threat .
Almost half of Arabs believe that if Tehran acquires nuclear weapons the outcome for the region would be more positive than negative .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) 
Women who stop smoking can enjoy major health benefits within five years , but it can take decades to correct respiratory damage and shed the added risk of lung cancer , researchers reported on Tuesday .
Those who stopped had a 13 percent reduction in the risk of death from all causes , including heart and vascular problems , within the first five years , the study found .
After 20 years , the risk of death from any cause was the same for those who quit as for those who had never smoked .
For deaths due specifically to respiratory diseases , there was an 18 percent reduction within 5 to 10 years of quitting , reaching the level found in nonsmokers after 20 years .

But while there was a 21 percent reduction in the risk of lung cancer death within five years , it took 30 years for that excess risk to disappear .
At this point , any news of Jericho 's demise should be considered exaggerated .
Once a show proves that it can rise from the ashes based on fan support – it becomes a unique commodity in television .
While Jericho 's audience might not be CSI - sized – they are far from the regular casual viewers .
They are dedicated , and they 'll follow the series wherever it goes .
Exploiting the value of such an audience is just good business – and it looks like others are starting to figure that out .
Possibly taking a page from the book used by Friday Night Lights , CBS Paramount is – allegedly – looking into a deal with cable provider Comcast .
According to a report in the New York Times , discussions have already been underway involving a possible deal to revive Jericho .
This certainly seems to go along with what Jericho producer Carol Barbee said , when she referred to such talks .
Comcast , which serves roughly 24 million subscribers , would likely get an exclusive window on broadcasting the series – though at the moment it 's not sure where the show would end up following that window .
In the cast of the Friday Night Lights deal , those episodes will ultimately air on NBC after the exclusive window with DirecTV .
While the Comcast / Jericho deal is unofficial , and sounds far from certain – questions remain as to whether the series will continue in some form on CBS – or will there be more movement as the deal changes ?
One thing is for sure , the show is interesting to many parties – and not just the fans .
There is money to be made from this audience , who has proven itself extraordinarily loyal and supportive – and one thing the television business knows how to do is find the money .
While Jericho fans will surely be following this news closely ( as will we ) – it'll also be interesting to watch if this sets a precedent for shows that develop an audience on network TV but cannot sustain network expectations .
In this month ’s Toronto Life , Phillip Preville pens a fascinating article Toronto ’s congestion problems , including an interview with Metrolinx chairman Rob MacIsaac .
The piece is ostensibly about congestion , but quickly leaps to the means of reducing it : road pricing .
One of the more interesting methods being considered by Metrolinx goes well beyond traditional road tolls or congestion pricing .
A Toronto company called Skymeter Corporation has developed wireless satellite systems that make it possible to record a vehicle ’s every move , including its parking times and locations , making both toll booths and parking meters obsolete .
Skymeter ’s system will soon be tested in the Netherlands , which plans to ditch standard road taxes and replace them with a nationwide per kilometre tax by 2016 .
The system is infinitely tweakable for every conceivable detail .
Different roads can be charged at different rates , and rates can vary by time of day .
Fuel - efficient cars could be charged a lower rate than gas guzzlers .
But perhaps the most practical appli­cation of the technology — and one being contemplated by MacIsaac — is a parking tax , which would help push cars off the road , since people will be less inclined to drive somewhere they ca n’t afford to park .
A parking tax is also easier to administer , and Skymeter claims it has the potential to generate more revenue than road pricing ever will .
The catch is that all cars would need transponders .
While Preville considers the idea to be politically unfeasible , the technology has generated interest in policy circles .
Still , planners and policy wonks like the idea of pricing the entire grid because they could charge people for all the car trips they should never make : the ones within three kilometres of their home , which they could comfortably walk or cycle .
In other words , it would increase the cost of grocery runs or picking the kids up from school .
It would also make things like pizza delivery radically more expensive .

Malware researchers at Prevx have highlighted what they are calling a ‘ massive growth ’ in the number of PCs harboring rootkit infections .
More than 725,000 PCs were scanned using the Prevx CSI malware scanner over a two - month period .
Of the around 291,000 users who scanned their PCs during October 2007 , some form of spyware or malware was found on one in six .
Significantly , although rootkits were detected on 15.6 % of PCs during October 2007 , that figure had risen to 22 % by early December .
Rootkits are often ‘ dropped ’ or buried by other infections .
They then modify a PC ’s operating system to hide themselves from both the user and any security products installed on the computer .
By so doing rootkits can allow criminals to remotely monitor , record , modify , steal and transfer data from the victim ’s PC .
Some rootkits are undetectable by conventional antivirus and antispyware applications .
A tech - savvy user may believe his or her computer is ‘ clean ’ , and unwittingly pass on increasingly valuable personal and financial data .
Since 1 December 2007 , 114,891 new users have run Prevx CSI with rootkit - detection features enabled .
Of those PCs , 1,678 had what Prevx describes as ‘ significant rootkit infections ’ .
That equates to 1.46 % or approximately one in 70 systems , which is almost 15 times higher than the one in 1,000 rootkit - infected PCs previously estimated by industry experts .
These botnets counting hundreds of thousands PCs have to work with something , right ?

NASA staffs its organization with engineers who are completely humorless on the subject of electronics workmanship .
They ’re responsible for some of the most complicated machines humanity has ever produced , costing billions of dollars , brimming with high explosives , and carrying human lives .
So I suspect their standards are more than sufficient for a DIY car audio installation .
Fortunately , NASA offers its Workmanship Standards Pictorial Reference for free to anyone who wants to know .
The reference offers a wide array of illustrations , from the correct use of a spade connector to high - end fiber - optic terminations .
The guide shows simple examples of preferred , acceptable , and unacceptable ways of connecting electronics .
You can get every series of examples as PDFs or web pages .
While some of the material is way out of most people ’s league , you ca n’t beat it as a reference for the more common electrical connections that come up in a Toolmonger ’s life .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
Sex education in school may encourage teenagers to put off having sexual intercourse , the results of a U.S. government study suggests .
The study , published Wednesday in the Journal of Adolescent Health , did not whether the type of program matters -- that is , abstinence - only versus more - comprehensive programs .
However , the findings do suggest that having some form of sex education helps delay teen sex , according to the researchers , from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Atlanta .
In a national survey of more than 2,000 adolescents between 15 and 19 years old , the researchers found that teens who had sex ed in school were more likely to put off sex until at least age 15 .
Furthermore , boys who received sex ed were less likely to have started having sex at all .
“ Sex education seems to be working , ” lead researcher Dr. Trisha E. Mueller , an epidemiologist with the CDC , said in a statement .
In particular , she noted , some of the greatest benefits were seen in the teens who may need them the most -- urban , African - American girls .
In this group of girls , those who ’d received sex education were 91 - percent less likely to have had sex before age 15 years .
Overall , male study participants who ’d received sex education were 71 percent less likely to have had sex before age 15 than those who ’d had no formal sex ed .
Among female participants , sex ed reduced those odds by 59 percent .
Male respondents who’d had sex education were more likely to say they would used birth control the first time they had sex .
No similar effect was seen among girls .
There were certain groups of teens who did not seem to benefit from sex education .
Girls from rural areas were more likely to have ever had sex when they ’d received sex education ; and among white and Hispanic girls who eventually dropped out of high school , those who received sex ed were less likely to delay having sex .
The reasons are unclear , according to Mueller ’s team , and the findings may be due to chance because the numbers of study participants in these groups were small .
“ Sex education , ” they conclude , “ provides youth with the knowledge and skills to make healthy and informed decisions about sex , and this study indicates that sex education is making a difference in the sexual behaviors of American youth . ”

When I was in Tokyo this past fall speaking at the Shibuya .
JS user group I had the opportunity to see a number of interesting JavaScript projects that have yet to make it outside of Japan .
One project , in particular , really caught my eye .
It ’s called Orto [ PDF , Japanese ] and is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) in JavaScript .
This means that you can take an existing Java application , compile it to bytecode , run it through Orto ( which produces the JavaScript , and embed it in a web page .
While it does n’t provide the full capabilities of most Java code it does provide enough to make for some interesting demos .
The one demo that was presented was that of a real - time , interactive , Tetris game :
If you take a peak at the generated source code you can see some interesting tidbits ( obviously all of the code is meant to be ‘ machine readable ’ – being just converted bytecode ) :
" java/lang / Thread 1316742099 " : function ( ) {var orto333=orto245 [0 ] ; var orto336=orto350( orto333 ) ; if ( orto336.orto340!=orto310 ) {orto223 (" java/lang/IllegalThreadStateException " , null ) ; return ; }
case 117:orto246[orto247-2] ={high :( ~orto246[orto247-2].high ) &0 xffffffff , low :( ~orto246[orto247-2].low+1) &0 xffffffff} ; if ( orto246[orto247-2].low==0 ) {orto246[orto247-2].high ++ ; orto246[orto247-2].high&=0xffffffff ; orto246[orto247-2].low=0 ; }break ;
case " CHECKBOX " :orto171=orto188 [ " orto/ui/CheckBox " ] ; break ; case " IMAGE " :orto171=orto188 [ " orto/ui/ImageButton " ] ; break ; case " RADIO " :orto171=orto188 [ " orto/ui/RadioButton " ] ; break ;
Unfortunately , the information on the subject is a little scarce ( considering that both orto.accelart.jp and orto.jp seem to be missing any relevant information ) .
There are a couple of things that are apparent , however :
The result is able to handle threaded application code ( translating the threads into a series of yields with setTimeout ( mentioned in the presentation and demonstrated in the Tetris example ) .
The application can use regular Java conventions for designing and constructing the UI ( as shown here , as well ) .
User Interface components are translated to , similar , HTML ones .
It ’s not apparent to what extent functionality is implemented , but it is to a certain degree .
Keyboard interactions are able to be handled and translated to normal Java callbacks .
I was especially pleased with the resulting performance of the demo application .
I was n’t expecting a game ( translated multiple layers deep ) to still be as playable as it is .
Obviously the culmination of JavaScript optimization and increases in browser performance have served these types of endeavors well .
There has been lots of news about commercial real estate in the past week .
None of it is any good .
Let 's take a look .
U.S. mall vacancy rates rise as economy slides
The vacancy rate at U.S. strip malls rose to the highest level since 1996 in the first quarter of 2008 , while that for big malls reached levels unseen since 2002 , research firm Reis said on Friday .
The amount of space occupied by retailers fell for the first time since Reis began tracking the sector in 1980 .
" Retailers are grappling with the implications of the housing and job market downturns for consumer activity , with the result that retail sector fundamentals -- occupancy and rent levels -- are being strained by anemic demand for space , " Reis chief economist Sam Chandan said in statement .
Strip mall vacancies rose 0.2 percentage points from the preceding quarter to 7.7 percent .
By the end of the year , the rate likely will reach or surpass 8 percent , Reis said .
The vacancy rate for big regional malls was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2002 , the report said .
Subprime Losses Concentrated At Large Banks , CRE At Smaller Banks
With the exception of some states , notably Texas , a pattern of distinct regional credit issues is emerging that is reminiscent of the real estate crisis in the mid-1980s .
When disregarding the largest 200 banks , commercial real estate risk is the leading contributing factor to overall credit risk for mid-size and small banks .
A new report released Monday by credit rating agency A.M
Best , however , found that credit risk may quickly be beating a path to the door of smaller regional and community banks .
In particular , with the exception of some states — notably Texas — the agency warned that “ a pattern of distinct regional credit issues is emerging that is reminiscent of the real estate crisis in the mid-1980s . ”
For the smaller banks below the top 200 institutions , high nonperforming asset rates are concentrated in the Midwestern , Central , Southeastern and West Coast regions ; Alaska , Arizona and Arkansas rank as the worst three states on overall asset quality .
Credit and debit card delinquencies rose to 4.38 percent from the third quarter 's 4.18 percent , following four straight quarterly declines .
Housing was n't spared .
Delinquencies on home equity loans rose to a 2 - 1/2 - year high of 2.39 percent , and on home equity lines of credit rose to 0.96 percent , matching a level last seen in the fourth quarter of 1997 .
The ABA study covers more than 300 banks that extend a majority of outstanding consumer loans .
Its study covers direct auto , indirect auto , home equity , home improvement , marine , mobile home , personal and recreational vehicle loans .
Losses tied to mortgages , credit cards and other consumer loans are expected to hurt quarterly results at large lenders such as Citigroup Inc ( C ) , Bank of America Corp ( BAC ) and Wachovia Corp ( WB ) , and at more specialized lenders such as GMAC LLC , the auto finance and mortgage company .
Consumer Blues
Linens 'n Things Inc. , a home - furnishings retailer caught by an increasing debt load and shrinking housing market , is expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - court protection by Tuesday , several people familiar with the matter said .
A Linens 'n Things filing would mark one of the first major retailers to seek bankruptcy protection in this economic downturn .
The New Jersey retailer , which sells home products like towels , bath rugs and kitchen appliances , has about 590 stores ...[ rest by subscription only ]

3. Home Improvement - Jill Taylor ( Patricia Richardson )
As wife of Tim " The Tool Man " Taylor ( played by comedian Tim Allen ) , Jill Taylor had quite an impression on those who tuned in to watch the very popular ABC sitcom Home Improvement during the 90's .
When she was n't keeping her accident - prone husband in check , she had her hands full with their three boys Brad , Randy , and Mark .
While she excelled at taking care of the men in the house , she was notorious for lack of skill in the kitchen .

4. Cosby Show - Clair Huxtable ( Phylicia Rashad )
For 8 years , no one taught us as many mother lessons as Clair Huxtable did on NBC's hit comedy The Cosby Show .
As Heacliff " Cliff " Huxtable 's lovely wife , and mother to their children Sondra , Denise , Theo , Vanessa and Rudy .
The classy Clair managed to hold a very esteemed career as an attorney , in addition to teaching her children good moral values and education ( and putting up with her comical husband in the process ) .
One of the busiest and classiest women on our list is Clair Huxtable .
Successful attorney , mother of five , and wife to Cliff which is a full - time job in itself , Clair managed to bring us humor and good moral values each week .
Her assertive no - nonsense nature allowed her children to grow up happy and healthy and even have their own spin- off .

Clair : " Go to sleep , Cliff ...' cause you 're gonna need a helmet if you keep talking . "
5. Married With Children - Peggy Bundy ( Katey Sagal )
Margaret " Peggy " Bundy is easily one of the most remembered moms of comedy , spending time as the wife of shoe salesman Al Bundy ( Ed O' Neill ) for 11 Seasons on the hit Fox show Married With Children .
Peggy , while not the best role - model of a mom ( she refused to cook or clean for the family , even though she did n't have a job ) , always provided her love to her husband and their two trouble making teens Kelly & Bud .
Peggy Bundy is one of the most memorable TV moms in history with her name synonymous for high heels , big hair and tight pants .
Whether she is feeding her neighbor Marcy a cigarette butt or trying to get Al to have sex with her or not feeding her children , she is always good for a few laughs .
Although few would recommend Peggy ’s style of mothering , she does love her kids and her husband .

Oprah 's doing a show about Mothers who do n't pay attention to their sons .
6. Leave It To Beaver - June Cleaver ( Barbara Billingsley )
If they 're were to be a " quintessential " mother on this list , the award would have to be bestowed upon June Cleaver .
Perhaps the same can be said about the entire cast of Leave It To Beaver , the famous comedy that became popular in the 1950's .
While the series ' star " Beaver " Clever discovers the wonders of the world he grows up in , June is there to make sure he 's staying out of trouble and has his lunch packed properly for school .
June definitely set the standard in her day of being the sweetest mother on the block .
Our Favorite Quotes :
June Cleaver : " Wally , where are you going ? "
Wally Cleaver : " I 'm going over to slug Eddie . "
June Cleaver : " That 's no way to talk , this is Sunday . "
Wally Cleaver : " You 're right , I 'll wait ' til tomorrow and slug him in the cafeteria . "
7. Simpsons - Marge Simpson ( Julie Kavner )
No mother has had to endure more than Marge Simpson .
The fictional wife of uber - dufus Homer has been dealing with the constant ridiculousness of her husband 's antics week after week for almost 20 years .
Add her trouble - making son Bart , over - achieving daughter Lisa and toddler Maggie to the mix and you have a mother that manages to keep her cool ( most of the time ) and still provide a warm hug at the end of the day .
Definitely the mom with the best hair , Marge Simpson is a happy housewife , proud mother of three , and one of three tight nit sisters .
Constantly dealing with her donut eating husbands shenanigans , Bart ’s trouble making and Lisa just being Lisa , Marge has her work cut out for her , but she manages to add humor and a sense of pride into every episode .
Our Favorite Quotes :
" The way I see it , if you can raise three kids who can knock out and hogtie a perfect stranger , you must be doing something right . "
Marge : it was pretty exciting .
But celery 's pretty exciting too .
Marge : History 's like an amusement park .
Except instead of rides you have dates to memorize .
Marge :
You know , when I was a girl , I always dreamed of being in a Broadway audience .
Marge :
Now if you 'll excuse me I have some dust that needs busting .
8. Family Guy - Lois Griffin ( Alex Borstein )
Speaking on animated moms , Lois Griffin could give Marge a run for her money .
If The Simpson 's are known for the crazy antics of the male leads ( Homer and Bart ) , then the Family Guy is known for the even - zanier antics of Lois 's husband Peter and their three kids Meg , Chris , and the ever diabolical Stewie .
Without their mother , these the family would probably never get out of their constantly ( albeit hilarious ) awkward situations .
Lois Griffin has one of the most difficult TV jobs as the wife of Peter , someone who traded a boat for a mystery box and mother of Meg , Chris and Stewie , baby genius planning to take over the world .
To top it off , she has a talking dog who is probably the only sane one of the bunch .
I doubt any mother would want to be Lois , but she sure is fun to watch
Our Favorite Quotes :
Lois : " I 'm gonna go get some oranges Stewie .
Here , hold the rest of these bags for mommy . "
Stewie : " Oh , what brilliant parenting Lois .
Leave a tiny infant with a plastic bag .
You know I might asphyxiate myself just to teach you a lesson .
Here I go .
Just like that boy from INXS . "
( Stewie tries to put bag over top of his head . )
Stewie : " I 'm going to do it !
" ( Tries to put bag over left side of his head then climbs into it and tries pulling it over his head . )
Stewie : " BLAST !
Good Lord Lois , either I was a c- section , or you 're Wonder Woman ! "
Lois : I care about the size of your penis as much as you care about the size of my breasts .
Peter : Oh my God ! ( runs off crying )
Lois : I 've seen that crappy Julia Roberts movie forty - seven times .
Have you seen the lips on that woman ?
Like a baboon 's ass on her face .
9. I Love Lucy - Lucy Ricardo ( Lucille Ball )
Lucy Ricardo is probably our funniest mom on the list .
She is both naïve and ambitious , always trying to trick her husband Ricky into letting her perform in the show .
From stomping grapes , to packing chocolates to selling vitamins Lucy has had several strange side jobs .
She had also managed to raise a musical genius for a son , little Ricky , and be great friends with her neighbors Fred and Ethel .
Lucy is creative , entertaining and a favorite mom
10 . Mama's Family - Thelma Crowley Harper ( Vicki Lawrence )
A TV mother 's list just would n't be complete with out a mention of Mama 's Family .
Thelma
Harper , the blue haired outspoken widow ( the " mama " ) , was in charge of keeping her son Vinton and his two children Sonja and Buxx , along with her sister Fran rounding out the household .
While originally cancelled after one season , the show would continue to evolve through syndication and be a constant throughout the 1980's .
Thelma Mae Haper was raised a small town farm girl with a healthy dose of attitude .
She reminds us of everyone 's favorite grumpy aunt or grandmother .
Despite her propensity to start arguements , give attitude , and be a all - around general pain in the rear , Mama loved her family and looked out for him with her sharp tongued smart mouth .
She was crude , wisecracking , and was n't afraid to slap her children silly .
Mama was n't always the greatest mom , but she always made us laugh with her over the top antics .
Our Favorite Quotes :
" I tell ya , a guy selling brains could clean up in this family "
Thelma ' Mama ' Harper : Good lord , Vinton , what in the hell do you think you 're doing ?
Vinton Harper : Well Mama ...
I 'm trying to guess your weight ...
Thelma ' Mama ' Harper : I 've got a better idea Vinton ... how about you guess which hand I 'm gonna smack you upside the head with .
11 . Everyone Loves Raymond - Debra Barone ( Patricia Heaton )
Debra Barone proved to be the tough - as - nails wife of Ray Barone , played by comedian Ray Romano , which the comedy Everyone Loves Raymond is loosely based on .
When not arguing with her husband , or arguing with Ray 's parents who frequent the house , Debra plays mother to the couple 's identical twins Michael and Geoffrey and daughter Ally .
Debra would prove to be one of the most popular sitcom mothers in recent memory .
If you think your in - laws are bad , you have nothing on Debra Barone .
Having 3 kids and Ray as a husband is difficult , but with the in - laws living next door , Debra rarely has any privacy .
With that said she is one of the toughest mom ’s around and has paved the way for the non-nonsense TV house wife .
She does n’t bite her tongue and manages to teach her kids respect and that being a great cook is n’t necessary in being a great mom .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Debra : [ to Robert ]
" It 's your life .
You do what you want to do . "
Ray : " Until you 're married ... then you do what SHE wants you to do . "
12 . Who 's the Boss ? - Angela Bower ( Judith Light )
There 's a good reason why this ht 80's sitcom was entitled Who 's the Boss .
The show featured star Tony Danza as Tony Micelli , who moves into the Bower residence as a live - in housekeeper with his daughter Samantha .
While Tony tends to the house during the day , Angela is the one out working the corporate life to support her son Jonathan .
The role - reversal proved to be not only popular with the shows fans , but offered a different glimpse of family life ( compared to the tried - and true " stay at home " mom approach of many comedies .
Angela Bower helped to show the world that there is more than one way to be a great mom .
She is a high powered advertising executive with a live in male housekeeper .
Although she does n’t cook or do any of the cleaning , she adores her son and will do anything for him .
The gender reversal on this show proved to be a hit with ratings and working moms
Our Favorite Quotes :
Tony : " I'm Tony Micelli .
I 'm here about the job . "
Angela : " Oh , I 'm sorry .
There must be a mistake .
This job is for a housekeeper . "
Tony : " That 's me , Mr. Goodmop ! "
Angela : " Well , my mother 's screening everyone .
Did you meet her ? "
Tony : " Yeah yesterday .
She gave me the once over , kicked me in the tires , put me up on the rack ... "
Angela : " Well , she should 've checked under your hood , ' cause you 're the wrong sex "
Tony : " Oh , wait a minute ; she said that would n't be any problem . "
Angela : " My mother did n't think World War II was a problem . "
13 . Good Times - Florida Evans ( Esther Rolle )
Who could forget the smile of Florida Evans , mom to JJ , Thelma , and youngest son Michael on the hit 70's sitcom Good Times .
A spin -off of the show Maude , the show portrayed the life of a family living in an urban slum .
The show was one of the first to offer realistic depictions of concepts like racial discrimination , street crime , low income life , and other scenarios not seen in many shows of its day .
Luckily for the kids ( and us ) , we had Florida to let us know everything was going to be okay at the end of every episode .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Florida : " Well if parents would take the time to educate their kids about sex , they would n't have to cheapen it in the backseat of a bus . "
Willona : " What parents ?
They teach sex in school now . "
Michael : " They do ?
I 'm going back for my extra credit . "
Florida : " Michael ! "
Michael : " Just jiving , ma , just jiving . "
Florida : ( to Willona )
It 's still the parents ' responsibility
14 . Growing Pains - Maggie Malone Seaver ( Joanna Kerns )
Another very popular ht 80's sitcom , Growing Pains , taught us , well , about the pains that endure growing up .
Luckily , those pains were often temporary ( figure 30 minutes , minus some commercial air time ) , and were often made better from the warm motherly love from Maggie Seaver .
Like Who 's
The Boss , the show tackled the issue of a working mothers and stay - at - home father figure , where Maggie 's husband Jason helped raise their kids Mike , Carol , Ben , and Chrissy .
The show probably did a lot for helping the concept of a working mother become more commonplace .
Maggie Malone Seaver was the quintessential working mom of the 80s .
She has a high pressure job that occasionally kept her our late , while her husband worked from home and cooked .
She showed us that the Marion Cunnigham style of motherhood was n’t the only way to raise happy kids .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Maggie : " Carol , how dare you disobey us ! "
Jason : " I never thought I would ever say that but Carol Ann Seaver , you 're grounded . "
Carol : " Wait ... "
Maggie : " No explanations .
You are not getting a nose job . "
Carol : " I know . "
Jason : " What ? "
Carol : " I 'm not getting a nose job . "
Jason : " Do n't confuse us by agreeing with us , Carol . "
15 . South Park - Sharon Marsh ( Eliza Schneider )
In the absolutely naive and gullible world of the animated South Park , there 's very few adults who have a voice of reason for the boys Stan , Kyle , Kenny and the trouble making Eric Cartman .
Stan 's mother Sharon is often this voice , often pointing the necessary knowledge the boys are looking for and in most cases , providing her husband Randy with the same guidance ; however , as with most characters from the show , her personality can at times be obviously " out there " .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Randy : " Sharon , have you seen dad ? "
Sharon : " He 's not here hun , he 's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center . "
Randy : " Ohh ... wait a minute .
If all the seniors are in town at a meeting , that means that when the meeting gets out ... "
Sharon : " Every senior in town will be driving home ... "
Randy : " At the same time !
OH MY GOD ! "
16 . Full House - Rebecca " Becky " Katsopolis ( Lori Loughlin )
A very , very successful staple of ABC 's popular TGIF sitcom block during the '90s , Full House told the tale of a single dad Danny Tanner ( Bob Sagat ) and his life raising his three daughters D.J. , Stephanie ( famous for her " How Rude ! " comments ) , and Michelle ( portrayed famously by twin sisters Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen ) .
With no mother figure at first , the girls often turned to Becky , Danny 's co-worker , who would eventually marry Danny 's brother - in - law Jesse .
She would eventually take on the role of mother officially after giving birth to twins .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Michelle : " Is it almost time for my party ? "
Becky : " You have two and a half hours still . "
Michelle : " How long is that ? "
Jesse : " A Sesame Street and a Mister Rogers . "
Michelle : " Wow .
Turning five is going to take forever . "
17 . The Facts of Life - Edna Garrett ( Charlotte Rae )
While Edna Garrett did indeed have two sons of her own , it was n't her guidance of them that made this list .
Rather , it was her mentorship as the " den mother " of Eastland Academy that got her on this list .
As housekeeper to the Drummond family on Diff 'rent Strokes , Edna followed Kimberly to school in the spin - off The Facts of Life , which ran from 1978 to 1986 .

28 . Boy Meets World - Amy Matthews ( Betsy Randle )
From 1993 to 2000 , the world watched a young man named Corey Matthews gop through the trials and tribulations of being a teenage boy in Boy Meets World .
And there to guide him through the good and the bad was his mother Amy .
Whether it 's dealing with the the siblings ( Cory 's older and often times idiotic brother Eric , or their younger sister Morgan ) , Amy Mathews eschewed the kind of personality that proved constant through many 90's sitcoms - always there to put the kids in their place and at the same time provide them with the extra bit of love at the beginning ( and end ) of the day .
om 1993 to 2000 , the world watched a young man named Corey Matthews go through the trials and tribulations of being a teenage boy in Boy Meets World .
The woman behind it all was Amy Matthews .

29 . Seinfeld - Helen Seinfeld ( Liz Sheridan )
Our final two mothers hail from the same sitcom , and rightfully so - Seinfeld has been considered many times as the greatest comedy of all time .
Based on the often times odd daily observations of writer Larry David and star Jerry Seinfeld , the show provided a glimpse at life in Manhattan of four single thirty - something 's .
Helen Seinfeld provided the mom duties whenever Jerry needed some motherly advice , usually via telephone as she lived in a Florida retirement community with Jerry 's father Morty .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Cosmo : " Hey , buddy .
When did you get in ? "
[ Kramer goes straight to the refrigerator ]

Helen : " Mr. Cornstein died , and it's a beautiful apartment . "
Cosmo : " Yeah , your folks said it was for rent , so I jumped on it . "

This is where people come to die . "
[ Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld look up in horror ]
Jerry : " Not you .
* Older* people . "
30 . Seinfeld - Estelle Costanza ( Estelle Harris )
With Helen only making occasional appearances on Seinfeld , another mother would end up taking a little more of the spotlight - done rightfully so by George Costanza 's mom Estelle .
The bickering between Estelle and husband Frank ( Jerry Stiller ) .
While always with good intentions , she often spends her time yelling back and forth with her son and husband , or inadvertently humiliating them both , inducing us all into constant laughter .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Estelle : " Well , I 'm out there . "
George : " No , you 're not . "
Estelle : " Yes I am . "

One thing Kate Tanner can hold over every mom on this list ?
She does n't have to take care of a wise - mouthed alien from the planet Melmac named ALF , in addition to children Lynn , Brian , and cat Lucky ( whom Alf constantly tries to make a meal out of ) .
With the constant hi jinks that Alf gets himself into ( begin an alien who lives with a middle class family in suburbia is an obvious recipe for comedy ) , it 's a wonder how Kate ever slept at night .
Our Favorite Quotes :
Kate : " Do n't break that remote . "
ALF : " Kate , have I ever broken anything ? "
[ Kate stares at him ]
ALF : " Well , lately ? "
[ pause ]
ALF : " This week ? "
[ pause ]
ALF : " Today ? "
[ pause ]

ALF : It was a rhetorical question .
ALF : Justice will not rest .
Kate :
What if I gave justice a cookie ?
ALF : Justice will think about it .

Nell Carter - " Gimme a Break "
Sandy - " The Hogan Family "
Kate Summers Stratton - " Silver Spoons "
Norma Arnold - " The Wonder Years "
After 50 plus years of television , we have quite a history of family life to watch and entertain us .
Through the years , we 've had some wonderful mothers take care of us in all the ways we love ( packing our lunches , patching us up after that bike accident , and good ole ' fashioned hugs and kisses ) and in ways we 'd rather forget ( the scolding after the bad report card or the humiliation in front of the rest of the class ) .
And through it all we realized just how tough it can be to be a great mother .
It 's great to know that our fictional television mother 's will always be there to remind us in case we every forget !
This story is set in the same universe as the novel Incandescence , some 300,000 years before Rakesh ’s journey to the bulge .
It is not a part of the novel itself .

In their ten - thousand , three hundred and ninth year of marriage , Leila and Jasim began contemplating death .
They had known love , raised children , and witnessed the flourishing generations of their offspring .
They had travelled to a dozen worlds and lived among a thousand cultures .
They had educated themselves many times over , proved theorems , and acquired and abandoned artistic sensibilities and skills .
They had not lived in every conceivable manner , far from it , but what room would there be for the multitude if each individual tried to exhaust the permutations of existence ?
There were some experiences , they agreed , that everyone should try , and others that only a handful of people in all of time need bother with .
They had no wish to give up their idiosyncrasies , no wish to uproot their personalities from the niches they had settled in long ago , let alone start cranking mechanically through some tedious enumeration of all the other people they might have been .
They had been themselves , and for that they had done , more or less , enough .
Before dying , though , they wanted to attempt something grand and audacious .
It was not that their lives were incomplete , in need of some final flourish of affirmation .
If some unlikely calamity had robbed them of the chance to orchestrate this finale , the closest of their friends would never have remarked upon , let alone mourned , its absence .
There was no aesthetic compulsion to be satisfied , no aching existential void to be filled .
Nevertheless , it was what they both wanted , and once they had acknowledged this to each other their hearts were set on it .
Choosing the project was not a great burden ; that task required nothing but patience .
They knew they ’d recognise it when it came to them .
Every night before sleeping , Jasim would ask Leila , “ Did you see it yet ? ” “ No . Did you ? ” “ Not yet . ”
Sometimes Leila would dream that she ’d found it in her dreams , but the transcripts proved otherwise .
Sometimes Jasim felt sure that it was lurking just below the surface of his thoughts , but when he dived down to check it was nothing but a trick of the light .
Years passed .
They occupied themselves with simple pleasures : gardening , swimming in the surf , talking with their friends , catching up with their descendants .
They had grown skilled at finding pastimes that could bear repetition .
Still , were it not for the nameless adventure that awaited them they would have thrown a pair of dice each evening and agreed that two sixes would end it all .
One night , Leila stood alone in the garden , watching the sky .
From their home world , Najib , they had travelled only to the nearest stars with inhabited worlds , each time losing just a few decades to the journey .
They had chosen those limits so as not to alienate themselves from friends and family , and it had never felt like much of a constraint .
True , the civilisation of the Amalgam wrapped the galaxy , and a committed traveller could spend two hundred thousand years circling back home , but what was to be gained by such an overblown odyssey ?
The dozen worlds of their neighbourhood held enough variety for any traveller , and whether more distant realms were filled with fresh novelties or endless repetition hardly seemed to matter .
To have a goal , a destination , would be one thing , but to drown in the sheer plenitude of worlds for its own sake seemed utterly pointless .
A destination ?
Leila overlaid the sky with information , most of it by necessity millennia out of date .
There were worlds with spectacular views of nebulas and star clusters , views that could be guaranteed still to be in existence if they travelled to see them , but would taking in such sights firsthand be so much better than immersion in the flawless images already available in Najib ’s library ?
To blink away ten thousand years just to wake beneath a cloud of green and violet gas , however lovely , seemed like a terrible anticlimax .
The stars tingled with self - aggrandisement , plaintively tugging at her attention .
The architecture here , the rivers , the festivals !
Even if these tourist attractions could survive the millennia , even if some were literally unique , there was nothing that struck her as a fitting prelude to death .
If she and Jasim had formed some whimsical attachment , centuries before , to a world on the other side of the galaxy rumoured to hold great beauty or interest , and if they had talked long enough about chasing it down when they had nothing better to do , then keeping that promise might have been worth it , even if the journey led them to a world in ruins .
They had no such cherished destination , though , and it was too late to cultivate one now .
Leila ’s gaze followed a thinning in the advertising , taking her to the bulge of stars surrounding the galaxy ’s centre .
The disk of the Milky Way belonged to the Amalgam , whose various ancestral species had effectively merged into a single civilisation , but the central bulge was inhabited by beings who had declined to do so much as communicate with those around them .
All attempts to send probes into the bulge — let alone the kind of engineering spores needed to create the infrastructure for travel — had been gently but firmly rebuffed , with the intruders swatted straight back out again .
The Aloof had maintained their silence and isolation since before the Amalgam itself had even existed .
The latest news on this subject was twenty thousand years old , but the status quo had held for close to a million years .
If she and Jasim travelled to the innermost edge of the Amalgam ’s domain , the chances were exceptionally good that the Aloof would not have changed their ways in the meantime .
In fact , it would be no disappointment at all if the Aloof had suddenly thrown open their borders : that unheralded thaw would itself be an extraordinary thing to witness .
If the challenge remained , though , all the better .
She called Jasim to the garden and pointed out the richness of stars , unadorned with potted histories .
“ We go where ? ” he asked .
“ As close to the Aloof as we ’re able . ” “ And do what ? ” “ Try to observe them , ” she said .
“ Try to learn something about them .
Try to make contact , in whatever way we can . ”
“ You do n’t think that ’s been tried before ? ” “ A million times .
Not so much lately , though .
Maybe while the interest on our side has ebbed , they ’ve been changing , growing more receptive . ”
“ Or maybe not . ” Jasim smiled .
He had appeared a little stunned by her proposal at first , but the idea seemed to be growing on him .
“ It ’s a hard , hard problem to throw ourselves against .
But it ’s not futile .
Not quite . ”
He wrapped her hands in his .
“ Let ’s see how we feel in the morning . ”
In the morning , they were both convinced .
They would camp at the gates of these elusive strangers , and try to rouse them from their indifference .
They summoned the family from every corner of Najib .
There were some grandchildren and more distant descendants who had settled in other star systems , decades away at lightspeed , but they chose not to wait to call them home for this final farewell .
Two hundred people crowded the physical house and garden , while two hundred more confined themselves to the virtual wing .
There was talk and food and music , like any other celebration , and Leila tried to undercut any edge of solemnity that she felt creeping in .
As the night wore on , though , each time she kissed a child or grandchild , each time she embraced an old friend , she thought : this could be the last time , ever .
There had to be a last time , she could n’t face ten thousand more years , but a part of her spat and struggled like a cornered animal at the thought of each warm touch fading to nothing .
As dawn approached , the party shifted entirely into the acorporeal .
People took on fancy dress from myth or xenology , or just joked and played with their illusory bodies .
It was all very calm and gentle , nothing like the surreal excesses she remembered from her youth , but Leila still felt a tinge of vertigo .
When her son Khalid made his ears grow and spin , this amiable silliness carried a hard message : the machinery of the house had ripped her mind from her body , as seamlessly as ever , but this time she would never be returning to the same flesh .
Sunrise brought the first of the goodbyes .
Leila forced herself to release each proffered hand , to unwrap her arms from around each non-existent body .
She whispered to Jasim , “ Are you going mad , too ? ” “ Of course . ” Gradually the crowd thinned out .
The wing grew quiet .
Leila found herself pacing from room to room , as if she might yet chance upon someone who ’d stayed behind , then she remembered urging the last of them to go , her children and friends tearfully retreating down the hall .
She skirted inconsolable sadness , then lifted herself above it and went looking for Jasim .
He was waiting for her outside their room .
“ Are you ready to sleep ? ” he asked her gently .
She said , “ For an eon . ”
2
Leila woke in the same bed as she ’d lain down in .
Jasim was still sleeping beside her .
The window showed dawn , but it was not the usual view of the cliffs and the ocean .
Leila had the house brief her .
After twenty thousand years — travelling more or less at lightspeed , pausing only for a microsecond or two at various way - stations to be cleaned up and amplified — the package of information bearing the two of them had arrived safely at Nazdeek - be - Beegane .
This world was not crowded , and it had been tweaked to render it compatible with a range of metabolic styles .
The house had negotiated a site where they could live embodied in comfort if they wished .
Jasim stirred and opened his eyes .
“ Good morning .
How are you feeling ? ” “ Older . ” “ Really ? ” Leila paused to consider this seriously .
“ No .
Not even slightly .
How about you ? ”
“ I ’m fine .
I ’m just wondering what ’s out there . ”
He raised himself up to peer through the window .
The house had been instantiated on a wide , empty plain , covered with low stalks of green and yellow vegetation .
They could eat these plants , and the house had already started a spice garden while they slept .
He stretched his shoulders .
“ Let ’s go and make breakfast . ”
They went downstairs , stepping into freshly minted bodies , then out into the garden .
The air was still , the sun already warm .
The house had tools prepared to help them with the harvest .
It was the nature of travel that they had come empty - handed , and they had no relatives here , no fifteenth cousins , no friends of friends .
It was the nature of the Amalgam that they were welcome nonetheless , and the machines that supervised this world on behalf of its inhabitants had done their best to provide for them .
“ So this is the afterlife , ” Jasim mused , scything the yellow stalks .
“ Very rustic . ”
“ Speak for yourself , ” Leila retorted .
“ I ’m not dead yet . ”
She put down her own scythe and bent to pluck one of the plants out by its roots .
The meal they made was filling but bland .
Leila resisted the urge to tweak her perceptions of it ; she preferred to face the challenge of working out decent recipes , which would make a useful counterpoint to the more daunting task they ’d come here to attempt .
They spent the rest of the day just tramping around , exploring their immediate surroundings .
The house had tapped into a nearby stream for water , and sunlight , stored , would provide all the power they needed .
From some hills about an hour ’s walk away they could see into a field with another building , but they decided to wait a little longer before introducing themselves to their neighbours .
The air had a slightly odd smell , due to the range of components needed to support other metabolic styles , but it was n’t too intrusive .
The onset of night took them by surprise .
Even before the sun had set a smattering of stars began appearing in the east , and for a moment Leila thought that these white specks against the fading blue were some kind of exotic atmospheric phenomenon , perhaps small clouds forming in the stratosphere as the temperature dropped .
When it became clear what was happening , she beckoned to Jasim to sit beside her on the bank of the stream and watch the stars of the bulge come out .
They ’d come at a time when Nazdeek lay between its sun and the galactic centre .
At dusk one half of the Aloof ’s dazzling territory stretched from the eastern horizon to the zenith , with the stars ’ slow march westward against a darkening sky only revealing more of their splendour .
“ You think that was to die for ? ” Jasim joked as they walked back to the house .
“ We could end this now , if you ’re feeling unambitious . ”
He squeezed her hand .
“ If this takes ten thousand years , I ’m ready . ”
It was a mild night , they could have slept outdoors , but the spectacle was too distracting .
They stayed downstairs , in the physical wing .
Leila watched the strange thicket of shadows cast by the furniture sliding across the walls .
These neighbours never sleep , she thought .
When we come knocking , they ’ll ask what took us so long .
3
Hundreds of observatories circled Nazdeek , built then abandoned by others who ’d come on the same quest .
When Leila saw the band of pristine space junk mapped out before her — orbits scrupulously maintained and swept clean by robot sentinels for eons — she felt as if she ’d found the graves of their predecessors , stretching out in the field behind the house as far as the eye could see .
Nazdeek was prepared to offer them the resources to loft another package of instruments into the vacuum if they wished , but many of the abandoned observatories were perfectly functional , and most had been left in a compliant state , willing to take instructions from anyone .
Leila and Jasim sat in their living room and woke machine after machine from millennia of hibernation .
Some , it turned out , had not been sleeping at all , but had been carrying on systematic observations , accumulating data long after their owners had lost interest .
In the crowded stellar precincts of the bulge , disruptive gravitational effects made planet formation rarer than it was in the disk , and orbits less stable .
Nevertheless , planets had been found .
A few thousand could be tracked from Nazdeek , and one observatory had been monitoring their atmospheric spectra for the last twelve millennia .
In all of those worlds for all of those years , there were no signs of atmospheric composition departing from plausible , purely geochemical models .
That meant no wild life , and no crude industries .
It did n’t prove that these worlds were uninhabited , but it suggested either that the Aloof went to great lengths to avoid leaving chemical fingerprints , or they lived in an entirely different fashion to any of the civilisations that had formed the Amalgam .
Of the eleven forms of biochemistry that had been found scattered around the galactic disk , all had given rise eventually to hundreds of species with general intelligence .
Of the multitude of civilisations that had emerged from those roots , all contained cultures that had granted themselves the flexibility of living as software , but they also all contained cultures that persisted with corporeal existence .
Leila would never have willingly given up either mode , herself , but while it was easy to imagine a subculture doing so , for a whole species it seemed extraordinary .
In a sense , the intertwined civilisation of the Amalgam owed its existence to the fact that there was as much cultural variation within every species as there was between one species and another .
In that explosion of diversity , overlapping interests were inevitable .
If the Aloof were the exception , and their material culture had shrunk to nothing but a few discreet processors — each with the energy needs of a gnat , scattered throughout a trillion cubic light years of dust and blazing stars — then finding them would be impossible .
Of course , that worst - case scenario could n’t quite be true .
The sole reason the Aloof were assumed to exist at all was the fact that some component of their material culture was tossing back every probe that was sent into the bulge .
However discreet that machinery was , it certainly could n’t be sparse : given that it had managed to track , intercept and reverse the trajectories of billions of individual probes that had been sent in along thousands of different routes , relativistic constraints on the information flow implied that the Aloof had some kind of presence at more or less every star at the edge of the bulge .
Leila and Jasim had Nazdeek brief them on the most recent attempts to enter the bulge , but even after forty thousand years the basic facts had n’t changed .
There was no crisply delineated barrier marking the Aloof ’s territory , but at some point within a border region about fifty light years wide , every single probe that was sent in ceased to function .
The signals from those carrying in - flight beacons or transmitters went dead without warning .
A century or so later , they would appear again at almost the same point , travelling in the opposite direction : back to where they ’d come from .
Those that were retrieved and examined were found to be unharmed , but their data logs contained nothing from the missing decades .
Jasim said , “ The Aloof could be dead and gone .
They built the perfect fence , but now it ’s outlasted them .
It ’s just guarding their ruins . ”
Leila rejected this emphatically .
“ No civilisation that ’s spread to more than one star system has ever vanished completely .
Sometimes they ’ve changed beyond recognition , but not one has ever died without descendants . ”
“ That ’s a fact of history , but it ’s not a universal law , ” Jasim persisted .
“ If we ’re going to argue from the Amalgam all the time , we ’ll get nowhere .
If the Aloof were n’t exceptional , we would n’t be here . ”
“ That ’s true .
But I wo n’t accept that they ’re dead until I see some evidence . ”
“ What would count as evidence ?
Apart from a million years of silence ? ”
Leila said , “ Silence could mean anything .
If they ’re really dead , we ’ll find something more , something definite . ”
“ Such as ? ” “ If we see it , we ’ll know . ”
They began the project in earnest , reviewing data from the ancient observatories , stopping only to gather food , eat and sleep .
They had resisted making detailed plans back on Najib , reasoning that any approach they mapped out in advance was likely to be rendered obsolete once they learned about the latest investigations .
Now that they ’d arrived and found the state of play utterly unchanged , Leila wished that they ’d come armed with some clear options for dealing with the one situation they could have prepared for before they ’d left .
In fact , though they might have felt like out - of - touch amateurs back on Najib , now that the Aloof had become their entire raison d’être it was far harder to relax and indulge in the kind of speculation that might actually bear fruit , given that every systematic approach had failed .
Having come twenty thousand light years for this , they could n’t spend their time day - dreaming , turning the problem over in the backs of their minds while they surrendered to the rhythms of Nazdeek ’s rural idyll .
So they studied everything that had been tried before , searching methodically for a new approach , hoping to see the old ideas with fresh eyes , hoping that — by chance if for no other reason — they might lack some crucial blind spot that had afflicted all of their predecessors .
After seven months without results or inspiration , it was Jasim who finally dragged them out of the rut .
“ We ’re getting nowhere , ” he said .
“ It ’s time to accept that , put all this aside , and go visit the neighbours . ”
Leila stared at him as if he ’d lost his mind .
“ Go visit them ?
How ?
What makes you think that they ’re suddenly going to let us in ? ”
He said , “ The neighbours .
Remember ?
Over the hill .
The ones who might actually want to talk to us . ”

Their neighbours had published a précis stating that they welcomed social contact in principle , but might take a while to respond .
Jasim sent them an invitation , asking if they ’d like to join them in their house , and waited .
After just three days , a reply came back .
The neighbours did not want to put them to the trouble of altering their own house physically , and preferred not to become acorporeal at present .
Given the less stringent requirements of Leila and Jasim ’s own species when embodied , might they wish to come instead to the neighbours ’ house ?
Leila said , “ Why not ? ”
They set a date and time .
The neighbours ’ précis included all the biological and sociological details needed to prepare for the encounter .
Their biochemistry was carbon - based and oxygen - breathing , but employed a different replicator to Leila and Jasim ’s DNA .
Their ancestral phenotype resembled a large furred snake , and when embodied they generally lived in nests of a hundred or so .
The minds of the individuals were perfectly autonomous , but solitude was an alien and unsettling concept for them .
Leila and Jasim set out late in the morning , in order to arrive early in the afternoon .
There were some low , heavy clouds in the sky , but it was not completely overcast , and Leila noticed that when the sun passed behind the clouds , she could discern some of the brightest stars from the edge of the bulge .
Jasim admonished her sternly , “ Stop looking .
This is our day off . ”
The Snakes ’ building was a large squat cylinder resembling a water tank , which turned out to be packed with something mossy and pungent .
When they arrived at the entrance , three of their hosts were waiting to greet them , coiled on the ground near the mouth of a large tunnel emerging from the moss .
Their bodies were almost as wide as their guests ’ , and some eight or ten metres long .
Their heads bore two front - facing eyes , but their other sense organs were not prominent .
Leila could make out their mouths , and knew from the briefing how many rows of teeth lay behind them , but the wide pink gashes stayed closed , almost lost in the grey fur .
The Snakes communicated with a low - frequency thumping , and their system of nomenclature was complex , so Leila just mentally tagged the three of them with randomly chosen , slightly exotic names —
Tim , John and Sarah — and tweaked her translator so she ’d recognise intuitively who was who , who was addressing her , and the significance of their gestures .
“ Welcome to our home , ” said Tim enthusiastically .
“ Thank you for inviting us , ” Jasim replied .
“ We ’ve had no visitors for quite some time , ” explained Sarah .
“ So we really are delighted to meet you . ”
“ How long has it been ? ” Leila asked .
“ Twenty years , ” said Sarah .
“ But we came here for the quiet life , ” John added .
“ So we expected it would be a while . ”
Leila pondered the idea of a clan of a hundred ever finding a quiet life , but then , perhaps unwelcome intrusions from outsiders were of a different nature to family dramas .
“ Will you come into the nest ? ” Tim asked .
“ If you do n’t wish to enter we wo n’t take offence , but everyone would like to see you , and some of us are n’t comfortable coming out into the open . ”
Leila glanced at Jasim .
He said privately , “ We can push our vision to IR .
And tweak ourselves to tolerate the smell . ”
Leila agreed .
“ Okay , ” Jasim told Tim .
Tim slithered into the tunnel and vanished in a quick , elegant motion , then John motioned with his head for the guests to follow .
Leila went first , propelling herself up the gentle slope with her knees and elbows .
The plant the Snakes cultivated for the nest formed a cool , dry , resilient surface .
She could see Tim ten metres or so ahead , like a giant glow - worm shining with body heat , slowing down now to let her catch up .
She glanced back at Jasim , who looked even weirder than the Snakes now , his face and arms blotched with strange bands of radiance from the exertion .
After a few minutes , they came to a large chamber .
The air was humid , but after the confines of the tunnel it felt cool and fresh .
Tim led them towards the centre , where about a dozen other Snakes were already waiting to greet them .
They circled the guests excitedly , thumping out a delighted welcome .
Leila felt a surge of adrenaline ; she knew that she and Jasim were in no danger , but the sheer size and energy of the creatures was overwhelming .
“ Can you tell us why you ’ve come to Nazdeek ? ” asked Sarah .
“ Of course . ”
For a second or two Leila tried to maintain eye contact with her , but like all the other Snakes she kept moving restlessly , a gesture that Leila ’s translator imbued with a sense of warmth and enthusiasm .
As for lack of eye contact , the Snakes ’ own translators would understand perfectly that some aspects of ordinary , polite human behaviour became impractical under the circumstances , and would not mislabel her actions .
“ We ’re here to learn about the Aloof , ” she said .
“ The Aloof ? ” At first Sarah just seemed perplexed , then Leila ’s translator hinted at a touch of irony .
“ But they offer us nothing . ” Leila was tongue - tied for a moment .
The implication was subtle but unmistakable .
Citizens of the Amalgam had a protocol for dealing with each other ’s curiosity : they published a précis , which spelled out clearly any information that they wished people in general to know about them , and also specified what , if any , further inquiries would be welcome .
However , a citizen was perfectly entitled to publish no précis at all and have that decision respected .
When no information was published , and no invitation offered , you simply had no choice but to mind your own business .
“ They offer us nothing as far as we can tell , ” she said , “ but that might be a misunderstanding , a failure to communicate . ”
“ They send back all the probes , ” Tim replied .
“ Do you really think we ’ve misunderstood what that means ? ” Jasim said , “ It means that they do n’t want us physically intruding on their territory , putting our machines right next to their homes , but I ’m not convinced that it proves that they have no desire to communicate whatsoever . ”
“ We should leave them in peace , ” Tim insisted .
“ They ’ve seen the probes , so they know we ’re here .
If they want to make contact , they ’ll do it in their own time . ”
“ Leave them in peace , ” echoed another Snake .
A chorus of affirmation followed from others in the chamber .
Leila stood her ground .
“ We have no idea how many different species and cultures might be living in the bulge .
One of them sends back the probes , but for all we know there could be a thousand others who do n’t yet even know that the Amalgam has tried to make contact . ”
This suggestion set off a series of arguments , some between guests and hosts , some between the Snakes themselves .
All the while , the Snakes kept circling excitedly , while new ones entered the chamber to witness the novel sight of these strangers .
When the clamour about the Aloof had quietened down enough for her to change the subject , Leila asked Sarah , “ Why have you come to Nazdeek yourself ? ”
“ It ’s out of the way , off the main routes .
We can think things over here , undisturbed . ”
“ But you could have the same amount of privacy anywhere .
It ’s all a matter of what you put in your précis . ”
Sarah ’s response was imbued with a tinge of amusement .
“ For us , it would be unimaginably rude to cut off all contact explicitly , by decree .
Especially with others from our own ancestral species .
To live a quiet life , we had to reduce the likelihood of encountering anyone who would seek us out .
We had to make the effort of rendering ourselves physically remote , in order to reap the benefits . ”
“ Yet you ’ve made Jasim and myself very welcome . ”
“ Of course .
But that will be enough for the next twenty years . ”
So much for resurrecting their social life .
“ What exactly is it that you ’re pondering in this state of solitude ? ” “ The nature of reality .
The uses of existence .
The reasons to live , and the reasons not to . ”
Leila felt the skin on her forearms tingle .
She ’d almost forgotten that she ’d made an appointment with death , however uncertain the timing .
She explained how she and Jasim had made their decision to embark on a grand project before dying .
“ That ’s an interesting approach , ” Sarah said .
“ I ’ll have to give it some thought . ”
She paused , then added , “ Though I ’m not sure that you ’ve solved the problem . ”
“ What do you mean ? ” “ Will it really be easier now to choose the right moment to give up your life ?
Have n’t you merely replaced one delicate judgement with an even more difficult one : deciding when you ’ve exhausted the possibilities for contacting the Aloof ? ”
“ You make it sound as if we have no chance of succeeding . ”
Leila was not afraid of the prospect of failure , but the suggestion that it was inevitable was something else entirely .
Sarah said , “ We ’ve been here on Nazdeek for fifteen thousand years .
We do n’t pay much attention to the world outside the nest , but even from this cloistered state we ’ve seen many people break their backs against this rock . ”
“ So when will you accept that your own project is finished ? ” Leila countered .
“ If you still do n’t have what you ’re looking for after fifteen thousand years , when will you admit defeat ? ”
“ I have no idea , ” Sarah confessed .
“ I have no idea , any more than you do . ”

When the way forward first appeared , there was nothing to set it apart from a thousand false alarms that had come before it .
It was their seventeenth year on Nazdeek .
They had launched their own observatory — armed with the latest refinements culled from around the galaxy — fifteen years before , and it had been confirming the null results of its predecessors ever since .
They had settled into an unhurried routine , systematically exploring the possibilities that observation had n’t yet ruled out .
Between the scenarios that were obviously stone cold dead — the presence of an energy - rich , risk - taking , extroverted civilisation in the bulge actively seeking contact by every means at its disposal — and the infinite number of possibilities that could never be distinguished at this distance from the absence of all life , and the absence of all machinery save one dumb but efficient gatekeeper , tantalising clues would bubble up out of the data now and then , only to fade into statistical insignificance in the face of continued scrutiny .
Tens of billions of stars lying within the Aloof ’s territory could be discerned from Nazdeek , some of them evolving or violently interacting on a time scale of years or months .
Black holes were flaying and swallowing their companions .
Neutron stars and white dwarfs were stealing fresh fuel and flaring into novas .
Star clusters were colliding and tearing each other apart .
If you gathered data on this whole menagerie for long enough , you could expect to see almost anything .
Leila would not have been surprised to wander into the garden at night and find a great welcome sign spelled out in the sky , before the fortuitous pattern of novas faded and the message dissolved into randomness again .
When their gamma ray telescope caught a glimmer of something odd — the nuclei of a certain isotope of fluorine decaying from an excited state , when there was no nearby source of the kind of radiation that could have put the nuclei into that state in the first place — it might have been just another random , unexplained fact to add to a vast pile .
When the same glimmer was seen again , not far away , Leila reasoned that if a gas cloud enriched with fluorine could be affected at one location by an unseen radiation source , it should not be surprising if the same thing happened elsewhere in the same cloud .
It happened again .
The three events lined up in space and time in a manner suggesting a short pulse of gamma rays in the form of a tightly focused beam , striking three different points in the gas cloud .
Still , in the mountains of data they had acquired from their predecessors , coincidences far more compelling than this had occurred hundreds of thousands of times .
With the fourth flash , the balance of the numbers began to tip .
The secondary gamma rays reaching Nazdeek gave only a weak and distorted impression of the original radiation , but all four flashes were consistent with a single , narrow beam .
There were thousands of known gamma ray sources in the bulge , but the frequency of the radiation , the direction of the beam , and the time profile of the pulse did not fit with any of them .
The archives revealed a few dozen occasions when the same kind of emissions had been seen from fluorine nuclei under similar conditions .
There had never been more than three connected events before , but one sequence had occurred along a path not far from the present one .
Leila sat by the stream and modelled the possibilities .
If the beam was linking two objects in powered flight , prediction was impossible .
If receiver and transmitter were mostly in free - fall , though , and only made corrections occasionally , the past and present data combined gave her a plausible forecast for the beam ’s future orientation .
Jasim looked into her simulation , a thought - bubble of stars and equations hovering above the water .
“ The whole path will lie out of bounds , ” he said .
“ No kidding . ” The Aloof ’s territory was more or less spherical , which made it a convex set : you could n’t get between any two points that lay inside it without entering the territory itself .
“ But look how much the beam spreads out .
From the fluorine data , I ’d say it could be tens of kilometres wide by the time it reaches the receiver . ”
“ So they might not catch it all ?
They might let some of the beam escape into the disk ? ”
He sounded unpersuaded .
Leila said , “ Look , if they really were doing everything possible to hide this , we would never have seen these blips in the first place . ”
“ Gas clouds with this much fluorine are extremely rare .
They obviously picked a frequency that would n’t be scattered under ordinary circumstances . ”
“ Yes , but that ’s just a matter of getting the signal through the local environment .
We choose frequencies ourselves that wo n’t interact with any substance that ’s likely to be present along the route , but no choice is perfect , and we just live with that .
It seems to me that they ’ve done the same thing .
If they were fanatical purists , they ’d communicate by completely different methods . ”
“ All right . ” Jasim reached into the model .
“ So where can we go that ’s in the line of sight ? ”
The short answer was : nowhere .
If the beam was not blocked completely by its intended target it would spread out considerably as it made its way through the galactic disk , but it would not grow so wide that it would sweep across a single point where the Amalgam had any kind of outpost .
Leila said , “ This is too good to miss .
We need to get a decent observatory into its path . ”
Jasim agreed .
“ And we need to do it before these nodes decide they ’ve drifted too close to something dangerous , and switch on their engines for a course correction . ”
They crunched through the possibilities .
Wherever the Amalgam had an established presence , the infrastructure already on the ground could convert data into any kind of material object .
Transmitting yourself to such a place , along with whatever you needed , was simplicity itself : lightspeed was the only real constraint .
Excessive demands on the local resources might be denied , but modest requests were rarely rejected .
Far more difficult was building something new at a site with raw materials but no existing receiver ; in that case , instead of pure data , you needed to send an engineering spore of some kind .
If you were in a hurry , not only did you need to spend energy boosting the spore to relativistic velocities — a cost that snowballed due to the mass of protective shielding — you then had to waste much of the time you gained on a lengthy braking phase , or the spore would hit its target with enough energy to turn it into plasma .
Interactions with the interstellar medium could be used to slow down the spore , avoiding the need to carry yet more mass to act as a propellant for braking , but the whole business was disgustingly inefficient .
Harder still was getting anything substantial to a given point in the vast empty space between the stars .
With no raw materials to hand at the destination , everything had to be moved from somewhere else .
The best starting point was usually to send an engineering spore into a cometary cloud , loosely bound gravitationally to its associated star , but not every such cloud was open to plunder , and everything took time , and obscene amounts of energy .
To arrange for an observatory to be delivered to the most accessible point along the beam ’s line of sight , travelling at the correct velocity , would take about fifteen thousand years all told .
That assumed that the local cultures who owned the nearest facilities , and who had a right to veto the use of the raw materials , acceded immediately to their request .
“ How long between course corrections ? ” Leila wondered .
If the builders of this hypothetical network were efficient , the nodes could drift for a while in interstellar space without any problems , but in the bulge everything happened faster than in the disk , and the need to counter gravitational effects would come much sooner .
There was no way to make a firm prediction , but they could easily have as little as eight or ten thousand years .
Leila struggled to reconcile herself to the reality .
“ We ’ll try at this location , and if we ’re lucky we might still catch something .
If not , we ’ll try again after the beam shifts . ”
Sending the first observatory chasing after the beam would be futile ; even with the present free - fall motion of the nodes , the observation point would be moving at a substantial fraction of lightspeed relative to the local stars .
Magnified by the enormous distances involved , a small change in direction down in the bulge could see the beam lurch thousands of light years sideways by the time it reached the disk .
Jasim said , “ Wait . ”
He magnified the region around the projected path of the beam .
“ What are you looking for ? ”
He asked the map , “ Are there two outposts of the Amalgam lying on a straight line that intersects the beam ? ”
The map replied in a tone of mild incredulity .
“ No . ” “ That was too much to hope for .
Are there three lying on a plane that intersects the beam ? ”
The map said , “ There are about ten - to - the - eighteen triples that meet that condition . ”
Leila suddenly realised what it was he had in mind .
She laughed and squeezed his arm .
“ You are completely insane ! ” Jasim said , “ Let me get the numbers right first , then you can mock me . ”
He rephrased his question to the map .
“ For how many of those triples would the beam pass between them , intersecting the triangle whose vertices they lie on ? ” “ About ten - to - the - sixth . ” “ How close to us is the closest point of intersection of the beam with any of those triangles — if the distance in each case is measured via the worst of the three outposts , the one that makes the total path longest . ”
“ Seven thousand four hundred and twenty - six light years . ”
Leila said , “ Collision braking .
With three components ? ”
“ Do you have a better idea ? ” Better than twice as fast as the fastest conventional method ?
“ Nothing comes to mind .
Let me think about it . ”
Braking against the flimsy interstellar medium was a slow process .
If you wanted to deliver a payload rapidly to a point that fortuitously lay somewhere on a straight line between two existing outposts , you could fire two separate packages from the two locations and let them “ collide ” when they met — or rather , let them brake against each other magnetically .
If you arranged for the packages to have equal and opposite momenta , they would come to a halt without any need to throw away reaction mass or clutch at passing molecules , and some of their kinetic energy could be recovered as electricity and stored for later use .
The aim and the timing had to be perfect .
Relativistic packages did not make in - flight course corrections , and the data available at each launch site about the other ’s precise location was always a potentially imperfect prediction , not a rock - solid statement of fact .
Even with the Amalgam ’s prodigious astrometric and computing resources , achieving millimetre alignments at thousand - light - year distances could not be guaranteed .
Now Jasim wanted to make three of these bullets meet , perform an elaborate electromagnetic dance , and end up with just the right velocity needed to keep tracking the moving target of the beam .
In the evening , back in the house , they sat together working through simulations .
It was easy to find designs that would work if everything went perfectly , but they kept hunting for the most robust variation , the one that was most tolerant of small misalignments .
With standard two - body collision braking , the usual solution was to have the first package , shaped like a cylinder , pass right through a hole in the second package .
As it emerged from the other side and the two moved apart again , the magnetic fields were switched from repulsive to attractive .
Several “ bounces ” followed , and in the process as much of the kinetic energy as possible was gradually converted into superconducting currents for storage , while the rest was dissipated as electromagnetic radiation .
Having three objects meeting at an angle would not only make the timing and positioning more critical , it would destroy the simple , axial symmetry and introduce a greater risk of instability .
It was dawn before they settled on the optimal design , which effectively split the problem in two .
First , package one , a sphere , would meet package two , a torus , threading the gap in the middle , then bouncing back and forth through it seventeen times .
The plane of the torus would lie at an angle to its direction of flight , allowing the sphere to approach it head - on .
When the two finally came to rest with respect to each other , they would still have a component of their velocity carrying them straight towards package three , a cylinder with an axial borehole .
Because the electromagnetic interactions were the same as the two - body case — self - centring , intrinsically stable — a small amount of misalignment at each of these encounters would not be fatal .
The usual two - body case , though , did n’t require the combined package , after all the bouncing and energy dissipation was completed , to be moving on a path so precisely determined that it could pass through yet another narrow hoop .
There were no guarantees , and in the end the result would be in other people ’s hands .
They could send requests to the three outposts , asking for these objects to be launched at the necessary times on the necessary trajectories .
The energy needs hovered on the edge of politeness , though , and it was possible that one or more of the requests would simply be refused .
Jasim waved the models away , and they stretched out on the carpet , side by side .
He said , “ I never thought we ’d get this far .
Even if this is only a mirage , I never thought we ’d find one worth chasing . ”
Leila said , “ I do n’t know what I expected .
Some kind of great folly : some long , exhausting , exhilarating struggle that felt like wandering through a jungle for years and ending up utterly lost . ”
“ And then what ? ” “ Surrender . ” Jasim was silent for a while .
Leila could sense that he was brooding over something , but she did n’t press him .
He said , “ Should we travel to this observatory ourselves , or wait here for the results ? ”
“ We should go .
Definitely !
I do n’t want to hang around here for fifteen thousand years , waiting .
We can leave the Nazdeek observatories hunting for more beam fluorescence and broadcasting the results , so we ’ll hear about them wherever we end up . ”
“ That makes sense . ”
Jasim hesitated , then added , “ When we go , I do n’t want to leave a back - up . ” “ Ah . ” They ’d travelled from Najib leaving nothing of themselves behind : if their transmission had somehow failed to make it to Nazdeek , no stored copy of the data would ever have woken to resume their truncated lives .
Travel within the Amalgam ’s established network carried negligible risks , though .
If they flung themselves towards the hypothetical location of this yet - to - be- assembled station in the middle of nowhere , it was entirely possible that they ’d sail off to infinity without ever being instantiated again .
Leila said , “ Are you tired of what we ’re doing ?
Of what we ’ve become ? ”
“ It ’s not that . ”
“ This one chance is n’t the be-all and end - all .
Now that we know how to hunt for the beams , I ’m sure we ’ll find this one again after its shifts .
We could find a thousand others , if we ’re persistent . ”
“ I know that , ” he said .
“ I do n’t want to stop , I do n’t want to end this .
But I want to risk ending it .
Just once .
While that still means something . ”
Leila sat up and rested her head on her knees .
She could understand what he was feeling , but it still disturbed her .
Jasim said , “ We ’ve already achieved something extraordinary .
No one ’s found a clue like this in a million years .
If we leave that to posterity , it will be pursued to the end , we can be sure of that .
But I desperately want to pursue it myself .
With you . ”
“ And because you want that so badly , you need to face the chance of losing it ? ” “ Yes . ”
It was one thing they had never tried .
In their youth , they would never have knowingly risked death .
They ’d been too much in love , too eager for the life they ’d yet to live ; the stakes would have been unbearably high .
In the twilight years , back on Najib , it would have been an easy thing to do , but an utterly insipid pleasure .
Jasim sat up and took her hand .
“ Have I hurt you with this ? ” “ No , no . ”
She shook her head pensively , trying to gather her thoughts .
She did n’t want to hide her feelings , but she wanted to express them precisely , not blurt them out in a confusing rush .
“ I always thought we ’d reach the end together , though .
We ’d come to some point in the jungle , look around , exchange a glance , and know that we ’d arrived .
Without even needing to say it aloud . ”
Jasim drew her to him and held her .
“ All right , I ’m sorry .
Forget everything I said . ”
Leila pushed him away , annoyed .
“ This is n’t something you can take back .
If it ’s the truth , it ’s the truth .
Just give me some time to decide what I want . ”
They put it aside , and buried themselves in work : polishing the design for the new observatory , preparing the requests to send to the three outposts .
One of the planets they would be petitioning belonged to the Snakes , so Leila and Jasim went to visit the nest for a second time , to seek advice on the best way to beg for this favour .
Their neighbours seemed more excited just to see them again than they were at the news that a tiny rent had appeared in the Aloof ’s million - year - old cloak of discretion .
When Leila gently pushed her on this point , Sarah said , “ You ’re here , here and now , our guests in flesh and blood .
I ’m sure I ’ll be dead long before the Aloof are willing to do the same . ”
Leila thought :
What kind of strange greed is it that I ’m suffering from ?
I can be feted by creatures who rose up from the dust through a completely different molecule than my own ancestors .
I can sit among them and discuss the philosophy of life and death .
The Amalgam has already joined every willing participant in the galaxy into one vast conversation .
And I want to go and eavesdrop on the Aloof ?
Just because they ’ve played hard - to - get for a million years ?
They dispatched requests for the three modules to be built and launched by their three as - yet unwitting collaborators , specifying the final countdown to the nanosecond but providing a ten - year period for the project to be debated .
Leila felt optimistic ; however blasé the Nazdeek nest had been , she suspected that no space - faring culture really could resist the chance to peek behind the veil .
They had thirty - six years to wait before they followed in the wake of their petitions ; on top of the ten - year delay , the new observatory ’s modules would be travelling at a fraction of a percent below lightspeed , so they needed a head start .
No more tell - tale gamma ray flashes appeared from the bulge , but Leila had n’t expected any so soon .
They had sent the news of their discovery to other worlds close to the Aloof ’s territory , so eventually a thousand other groups with different vantage points would be searching for the same kind of evidence and finding their own ways to interpret and exploit it .
It hurt a little , scattering their hard - won revelation to the wind for anyone to use — perhaps even to beat them to some far greater prize — but they ’d relied on the generosity of their predecessors from the moment they ’d arrived on Nazdeek , and the sheer scale of the overall problem made it utterly perverse to cling selfishly to their own small triumph .
As the day of their departure finally arrived , Leila came to a decision .
She understood Jasim ’s need to put everything at risk , and in a sense she shared it .
If she had always imagined the two of them ending this together — struggling on , side by side , until the way forward was lost and the undergrowth closed in on them — then that was what she ’d risk .
She would take the flip side to his own wager .
When the house took their minds apart and sent them off to chase the beam , Leila left a copy of herself frozen on Nazdeek .
If no word of their safe arrival reached it by the expected time , it would wake and carry on the search .
Alone .

“ Welcome to Trident .
We ’re honoured by the presence of our most distinguished guest . ”
Jasim stood beside the bed , waving a triangular flag .
Red , green and blue in the corners merged to white in the centre .
“ How long have you been up ? ” “ About an hour , ” he said .
Leila frowned , and he added apologetically , “ You were sleeping very deeply , I did n’t want to disturb you . ”
“ I should be the one giving the welcome , ” she said .
“ You ’re the one who might never have woken . ”
The bedroom window looked out into a dazzling field of stars .
It was not a view facing the bulge — by now Leila could recognise the distinctive spectra of the region ’s stars with ease — but even these disk stars were so crisp and bright that this was like no sky she had ever seen .
“ Have you been downstairs ? ” she said .
“ Not yet .
I wanted us to decide on that together . ”
The house had no physical wing here ; the tiny observatory had no spare mass for such frivolities as embodying them , let alone constructing architectural follies in the middle of interstellar space .
“ Downstairs ” would be nothing but a scape that they were free to design at will .
“ Everything worked , ” she said , not quite believing it .
Jasim spread his arms .
“ We ’re here , are n’t we ? ” They watched a reconstruction of the first two modules coming together .
The timing and the trajectories were as near to perfect as they could have hoped for , and the superconducting magnets had been constructed to a standard of purity and homogeneity that made the magnetic embrace look like an idealised simulation .
By the time the two had locked together , the third module was just minutes away .
Some untraceable discrepancy between reality and prediction in the transfer of momentum to radiation had the composite moving at a tiny angle away from its expected course , but when it met the third module the magnetic fields still meshed in a stable configuration , and there was energy to spare to nudge the final assembly precisely into step with the predicted swinging of the Aloof ’s beam .
The Amalgam had lived up to its promise : three worlds full of beings they had never met , who owed them nothing , who did not even share their molecular ancestry , had each diverted enough energy to light up all their cities for a decade , and followed the instructions of strangers down to the atom , down to the nanosecond , in order to make this work .
What happened now was entirely in the hands of the Aloof .
Trident had been functioning for about a month before its designers had arrived to take up occupancy .
So far , it had not yet observed any gamma ray signals spilling out of the bulge .
The particular pulse that Leila and Jasim had seen triggering fluorescence would be long gone , of course , but the usefulness of their present location was predicated on three assumptions : the Aloof would use the same route for many other bursts of data ; some of the radiation carrying that data would slip past the intended receiver ; and the two nodes of the network would have continued in free fall long enough for the spilt data to be arriving here still , along the same predictable path .
Without those three extra components , delivered by their least reliable partners , Trident would be worthless .
“ Downstairs , ” Leila said .
“ Maybe a kind of porch with glass walls ? ” “ Sounds fine to me . ”
She conjured up a plan of the house and sketched some ideas , then they went down to try them out at full scale .
They had been into orbit around Najib , and they had travelled embodied to its three beautiful , barren sibling worlds , but they had never been in interstellar space before .
Or at least , they had never been conscious of it .
They were still not truly embodied , but you did n’t need flesh and blood to feel the vacuum around you ; to be awake and plugged - in to an honest depiction of your surroundings was enough .
The nearest of Trident ’s contributor worlds was six hundred light years away .
The distance to Najib was unthinkable .
Leila paced around the porch , looking out at the stars , vertiginous in her virtual body , unsteady in the phoney gravity .
It had been twenty - eight thousand years since they ’d left Najib .
All her children and grandchildren had almost certainly chosen death , long ago .
No messages had been sent after them to Nazdeek ; Leila had asked for that silence , fearing that it would be unbearably painful to hear news , day after day , to which she could give no meaningful reply , about events in which she could never participate .
Now she regretted that .
She wanted to read the lives of her grandchildren , as she might the biography of an ancestor .
She wanted to know how things had ended up , like the time traveller she was .
A second month of observation passed , with nothing .
A data feed reaching them from Nazdeek was equally silent .
For any new hint of the beam ’s location to reach Nazdeek , and then the report of that to reach Trident , would take thousands of years longer than the direct passage of the beam itself , so if Nazdeek saw evidence that the beam was “ still ” on course , that would be old news about a pulse they had not been here to intercept .
However , if Nazdeek reported that the beam had shifted , at least that would put them out of their misery immediately , and tell them that Trident had been built too late .
Jasim made a vegetable garden on the porch and grew exotic food in the starlight .
Leila played along , and ate beside him ; it was a harmless game .
They could have painted anything at all around the house : any planet they ’d visited , drawn from their memories , any imaginary world .
If this small pretence was enough to keep them sane and anchored to reality , so be it .
Now and then , Leila felt the strangest of the many pangs of isolation Trident induced : here , the knowledge of the galaxy was no longer at her fingertips .
Their descriptions as travellers had encoded their vast personal memories , declarative and episodic , and their luggage had included prodigious libraries , but she was used to having so much more .
Every civilised planet held a storehouse of information that was simply too bulky to fit into Trident , along with a constant feed of exabytes of news flooding in from other worlds .
Wherever you were in the galaxy , some news was old news , some cherished theories long discredited , some facts hopelessly out of date .
Here , though , Leila knew , there were billions of rigourously established truths — the results of hundreds of millennia of thought , experiment , and observation — that had slipped out of her reach .
Questions that any other child of the Amalgam could expect to have answered instantly would take twelve hundred years to receive a reply .
No such questions actually came into her mind , but there were still moments when the mere fact of it was enough to make her feel unbearably rootless , cut adrift not only from her past and her people , but from civilisation itself .
Trident shouted : “ Data ! ” Leila was half - way through recording a postcard to the Nazdeek Snakes .
Jasim was on the porch watering his plants .
Leila turned to see him walking through the wall , commanding the bricks to part like a gauze curtain .
They stood side by side , watching the analysis emerge .
A pulse of gamma rays of the expected frequency , from precisely the right location , had just washed over Trident .
The beam was greatly attenuated by distance , not to mention having had most of its energy intercepted by its rightful owner , but more than enough had slipped past and reached them for Trident to make sense of the nature of the pulse .
It was , unmistakably , modulated with information .
There were precisely repeated phase shifts in the radiation that were unimaginable in any natural gamma ray source , and which would have been pointless in any artificial beam produced for any purpose besides communication .
The pulse had been three seconds long , carrying about ten - to - the - twenty - fourth bits of data .
The bulk of this appeared to be random , but that did not rule out meaningful content , it simply implied efficient encryption .
The Amalgam ’s network sent encrypted data via robust classical channels like this , while sending the keys needed to decode it by a second , quantum channel .
Leila had never expected to get hold of unencrypted data , laying bare the secrets of the Aloof in an instant .
To have clear evidence that someone in the bulge was talking to someone else , and to have pinned down part of the pathway connecting them , was vindication enough .
There was more , though .
Between the messages themselves , Trident had identified brief , orderly , unencrypted sequences .
Everything was guesswork to a degree , but with such a huge slab of data statistical measures were powerful indicators .
Part of the data looked like routing information , addresses for the messages as they were carried through the network .
Another part looked like information about the nodes ’ current and future trajectories .
If Trident really had cracked that , they could work out where to position its successor .
In fact , if they placed the successor close enough to the bulge , they could probably keep that one observatory constantly inside the spill from the beam .
Jasim could n’t resist playing devil ’s advocate .
“ You know , this could just be one part of whatever throws the probes back in our faces , talking to another part .
The Aloof themselves could still be dead , while their security system keeps humming with paranoid gossip . ”
Leila said blithely , “ Hypothesise away .
I ’m not taking the bait . ”
She turned to embrace him , and they kissed .
She said , “ I ’ve forgotten how to celebrate .
What happens now ? ”
He moved his fingertips gently along her arm .
Leila opened up the scape , creating a fourth spatial dimension .
She took his hand , kissed it , and placed it against her beating heart .
Their bodies reconfigured , nerve - endings crowding every surface , inside and out .
Jasim climbed inside her , and she inside him , the topology of the scape changing to wrap them together in a mutual embrace .
Everything vanished from their lives but pleasure , triumph , and each other ’s presence , as close as it could ever be .

“ Are you here for the Listening Party ? ”
The chitinous heptapod , who ’d been wandering the crowded street with a food cart dispensing largesse at random , offered Leila a plate of snacks tailored to her and Jasim ’s preferences .
She accepted it , then paused to let Tassef , the planet they ’d just set foot on , brief her as to the meaning of this phrase .
People , Tassef explained , had travelled to this world from throughout the region in order to witness a special event .
Some fifteen thousand years before , a burst of data from the Aloof ’s network had been picked up by a nearby observatory .
In isolation , these bursts meant very little ; however , the locals were hopeful that at least one of several proposed observatories near Massa , on the opposite side of the bulge , would have seen spillage including many of the same data packets , forty thousand years before .
If any such observations had in fact taken place , news of their precise contents should now , finally , be about to reach Tassef by the longer , disk - based routes of the Amalgam ’s own network .
Once the two observations could be compared , it would become clear which messages from the earlier Eavesdropping session had made their way to the part of the Aloof ’s network that could be sampled from Tassef .
The comparison would advance the project of mapping all the symbolic addresses seen in the data onto actual physical locations .
Leila said , “ That ’s not why we came , but now we know , we ’re even more pleased to be here . ”
The heptapod emitted a chirp that Leila understood as a gracious welcome , then pushed its way back into the throng .
Jasim said , “ Remember when you told me that everyone would get bored with the Aloof while we were still in transit ? ”
“ I said that would happen eventually .
If not this trip , the next one . ”
“ Yes , but you said it five journeys ago . ”
Leila scowled , preparing to correct him , but then she checked and he was right .
They had n’t expected Tassef to be so crowded when they ’d chosen it as their destination , some ten thousand years before .
The planet had given them a small room in this city , Shalouf , and imposed a thousand - year limit on their presence if they wished to remain embodied without adopting local citizenship .
More than a billion visitors had arrived over the last fifty years , anticipating the news of the observations from Massa , but unable to predict the precise time it would reach Tassef because the details of the observatories ’ trajectories had still been in transit .
She confessed , “ I never thought a billion people would arrange their travel plans around this jigsaw puzzle . ”
“ Travel plans ? ” Jasim laughed .
“ We chose to have our own deaths revolve around the very same thing . ”
“ Yes , but we ’re just weird . ”
Jasim gestured at the crowded street .
“ I do n’t think we can compete on that score . ”
They wandered through the city , drinking in the decades - long - carnival atmosphere .
There were people of every phenotype Leila had encountered before , and more : bipeds , quadrupeds , hexapods , heptapods , walking , shuffling , crawling , scuttling , or soaring high above the street on feathered , scaled or membranous wings .
Some were encased in their preferred atmospheres ; others , like Leila and Jasim , had chosen instead to be embodied in ersatz flesh that did n’t follow every ancestral chemical dictate .
Physics and geometry tied evolution ’s hands , and many attempts to solve the same problems had converged on similar answers , but the galaxy ’s different replicators still managed their idiosyncratic twists .
When Leila let her translator sample the cacophony of voices and signals at random , she felt as if the whole disk , the whole Amalgam , had converged on this tiny metropolis .
In fact , most of the travellers had come just a few hundred light years to be here .
She and Jasim had chosen to keep their role in the history of Eavesdropping out of their précis , and Leila caught herself with a rather smug sense of walking among the crowd like some unacknowledged sage , bemused by the late - blooming , and no doubt superficial , interest of the masses .
On reflection , though , any sense of superior knowledge was hard to justify , when most of these people would have grown up steeped in developments that she was only belatedly catching up with .
A new generation of observatories had been designed while she and Jasim were in transit , based on “ strong bullets ” : specially designed femtomachines , clusters of protons and neutrons stable only for trillionths of a second , launched at ultra-relativistic speeds so great that time dilation enabled them to survive long enough to collide with other components and merge into tiny , short - lived gamma-ray observatories .
The basic trick that had built Trident had gone from a one - off gamble into a miniaturised , mass - produced phenomenon , with literally billions of strong bullets being fired continuously from thousands of planets around the inner disk .
Femtomachines themselves were old hat , but it had taken the technical challenges of Eavesdropping to motivate someone into squeezing a few more tricks out of them .
Historians had always understood that in the long run , technological progress was a horizontal asymptote : once people had more or less everything they wanted that was physically possible , every incremental change would take exponentially longer to achieve , with diminishing returns and ever less reason to bother .
The Amalgam would probably spend an eon inching its way closer to the flatline , but this was proof that shifts of circumstance alone could still trigger a modest renaissance or two , without the need for any radical scientific discovery or even a genuinely new technology .
They stopped to rest in a square , beside a small fountain gushing aromatic hydrocarbons .
The Tassef locals , quadrupeds with slick , rubbery hides , played in the sticky black spray then licked each other clean .
Jasim shaded his eyes from the sun .
He said , “ We ’ve had our autumn child , and we ’ve seen its grandchildren prosper .
I ’m not sure what ’s left . ”
“ No . ” Leila was in no rush to die , but they ’d sampled fifty thousand years of their discovery ’s consequences .
They ’d followed in the wake of the news of the gamma ray signals as it circled the inner disk , spending less than a century conscious as they sped from world to world .
At first they ’d been hunting for some vital new role to play , but they ’d slowly come to accept that the avalanche they ’d triggered had out - raced them .
Physical and logical maps of the Aloof ’s network were being constructed , as fast as the laws of physics allowed .
Billions of people on thousands of planets , scattered around the inner rim of the Amalgam ’s territory , were sharing their observations to help piece together the living skeleton of their elusive neighbours .
When that project was complete it would not be the end of anything , but it could mark the start of a long hiatus .
The encrypted , classical data would never yield anything more than traffic routes ; no amount of ingenuity could extract its content .
The quantum keys that could unlock it , assuming the Aloof even used such things , would be absolutely immune to theft , duplication , or surreptitious sampling .
One day , there would be another breakthrough , and everything would change again , but did they want to wait a hundred thousand years , a million , just to see what came next ?
The solicitous heptapods — not locals , but visitors from a world thirty light years away who had nonetheless taken on some kind of innate duty of hospitality — seemed to show up whenever anyone was hungry .
Leila tried to draw this second one into conversation , but it politely excused itself to rush off and feed someone else .
Leila said , “ Maybe this is it .
We ’ll wait for the news from Massa , then celebrate for a while , then finish it . ”
Jasim took her hand .
“ That feels right to me .
I ’m not certain , but I do n’t think I ’ll ever be . ”
“ Are you tired ? ” she said .
“ Bored ? ” “ Not at all , ” he replied .
“ I feel satisfied .
With what we ’ve done , what we ’ve seen .
And I do n’t want to dilute that .
I do n’t want to hang around forever , watching it fade , until we start to feel the way we did on Najib all over again . ”
“ No . ” They sat in the square until dusk , and watched the stars of the bulge come out .
They ’d seen this dazzling jewelled hub from every possible angle now , but Leila never grew tired of the sight .
Jasim gave an amused , exasperated sigh .
“ That beautiful , maddening , unreachable place .
I think the whole Amalgam will be dead and gone without anyone setting foot inside it . ”
Leila felt a sudden surge of irritation , which deepened into a sense of revulsion .
“ It ’s a place , like any other place !
Stars , gas , dust , planets .
It ’s not some metaphysical realm .
It ’s not even far away .
Our own home world is twenty times more distant . ”
“ Our own home world does n’t have an impregnable fence around it .
If we really wanted to , we could go back there . ” Leila was defiant .
“ If we really wanted to , we could enter the bulge . ” Jasim laughed .
“ Have you read something in those messages that you did n’t tell me about ?
How to say ‘ open sesame ’ to the gatekeepers ? ” Leila stood , and summoned a map of the Aloof ’s network to superimpose across their vision , criss - crossing the sky with slender cones of violet light .
One cone appeared head - on , as a tiny circle : the beam whose spillage came close to Tassef .
She put her hand on Jasim ’s shoulder , and zoomed in on that circle .
It opened up before them like a beckoning tunnel .
She said , “ We know where this beam is coming from .
We do n’t know for certain that the traffic between these particular nodes runs in both directions , but we ’ve found plenty of examples where it does .
If we aim a signal from here , back along the path of the spillage , and we make it wide enough , then we wo n’t just hit the sending node .
We ’ll hit the receiver as well . ”
Jasim was silent .
“ We know the data format , ” she continued .
“ We know the routing information .
We can address the data packets to a node on the other side of the bulge , one where the spillage comes out at Massa . ”
Jasim said , “ What makes you think they ’ll accept the packets ? ”
“ There ’s nothing in the format we do n’t understand , nothing we ca n’t write for ourselves . ”
“ Nothing in the unencrypted part .
If there ’s an authorisation , even a checksum , in the encrypted part , then any packet without that will be tossed away as noise . ”
“ That ’s true , ” she conceded .
“ Do you really want to do this ? ” he said .
Her hand was still on his shoulder , she could feel his body growing tense .
“ Absolutely . ”
“ We mail ourselves from here to Massa , as unencrypted , classical data that anyone can read , anyone can copy , anyone can alter or corrupt ? ”
“ A moment ago you said they ’d throw us away as noise . ”
“ That ’s the least of our worries . ” “ Maybe . ” Jasim shuddered , his body almost convulsing .
He let out a string of obscenities , then made a choking sound .
“ What ’s wrong with you ?
Is this some kind of test ?
If I call your bluff , will you admit that you ’re joking ? ” Leila shook her head .
“ And no , it ’s not revenge for what you did on the way to Trident .
This is our chance .
This is what we were waiting to do — not the Eavesdropping , that ’s nothing !
The bulge is right here in front of us .
The Aloof are in there , somewhere .
We ca n’t force them to engage with us , but we can get closer to them than anyone has ever been before . ”
“ If we go in this way , they could do anything to us . ”
“ They ’re not barbarians .
They have n’t made war on us .
Even the engineering spores come back unharmed . ”
“ If we infest their network , that ’s worse than an engineering spore . ” “ ‘ Infest ’ !
None of these routes are crowded .
A few exabytes passing through is nothing . ”
“ You have no idea how they ’ll react . ”
“ No , ” she confessed .
“ I do n’t .
But I ’m ready to find out . ”
Jasim stood .
“ We could send a test message first .
Then go to Massa and see if it arrived safely . ”
“ We could do that , ” Leila conceded .
“ That would be a sensible plan . ” “ So you agree ? ” Jasim gave her a wary , frozen smile .
“ We ’ll send a test message .
Send an encyclopedia .
Send greetings in some universal language . ”
“ Fine .
We ’ll send all of those things first .
But I ’m not waiting more than one day after that .
I ’m not going to Massa the long way .
I ’m taking the short - cut , I ’m going through the bulge . ”

The Amalgam had been so generous to Leila , and local interest in the Aloof so intense , that she had almost forgotten that she was not , in fact , entitled to a limitless and unconditional flow of resources , to be employed to any end that involved her obsession .
When she asked Tassef for the means to build a high - powered gamma - ray transmitter to aim into the bulge , it interrogated her for an hour , then replied that the matter would require a prolonged and extensive consultation .
It was , she realised , no use protesting that compared to hosting a billion guests for a couple of centuries , the cost of this was nothing .
The sticking point was not the energy use , or any other equally microscopic consequence for the comfort and amenity of the Tassef locals .
The issue was whether her proposed actions might be seen as unwelcome and offensive by the Aloof , and whether that affront might in turn provoke some kind of retribution .
Countless probes and spores had been gently and patiently returned from the bulge unharmed , but they ’d come blundering in at less than lightspeed .
A flash of gamma rays could not be intercepted and returned before it struck its chosen target .
Though it seemed to Leila that it would be a trivial matter for the network to choose to reject the data , it was not unreasonable to suppose that the Aloof ’s sensibilities might differ on this point from her own .
Jasim had left Shalouf for a city on the other side of the planet .
Leila ’s feelings about this were mixed ; it was always painful when they separated , but the reminder that they were not irrevocably welded together also brought an undeniable sense of space and freedom .
She loved him beyond measure , but that was not the final word on every question .
She was not certain that she would not relent in the end , and die quietly beside him when the news came through from Massa ; there were moments when it seemed utterly perverse , masochistic and self - aggrandising to flee from that calm , dignified end for the sake of trying to cap their modest revolution with a new and spectacularly dangerous folly .
Nor though , was she certain that Jasim would not change his own mind , and take her hand while they plunged off this cliff together .
When the months dragged on with no decision on her request , no news from Massa and no overtures from her husband , Leila became an orator , travelling from city to city promoting her scheme to blaze a trail through the heart of the bulge .
Her words and image were conveyed into virtual fora , but her physical presence was a way to draw attention to her cause , and Listening Party pilgrims and Tassefi alike packed the meeting places when she came .
She mastered the locals ’ language and style , but left it inflected with some suitably alien mannerisms .
The fact that a rumour had arisen that she was one of the First Eavesdroppers did no harm to her attendance figures .
When she reached the city of Jasim ’s self - imposed exile , she searched the audience for him in vain .
As she walked out into the night a sense of panic gripped her .
She felt no fear for herself , but the thought of him dying here alone was unbearable .
She sat in the street , weeping .
How had it come to this ?
They had been prepared for a glorious failure , prepared to be broken by the Aloof ’s unyielding silence , and instead the fruits of their labour had swept through the disk , reinvigorating a thousand cultures .
How could the taste of success be so bitter ?
Leila imagined calling out to Jasim , finding him , holding him again , repairing their wounds .
A splinter of steel remained inside her , though .
She looked up into the blazing sky .
The Aloof were there , waiting , daring her to stand before them .
To come this far , then step back from the edge for the comfort of a familiar embrace , would diminish her .
She would not retreat .
The news arrived from Massa : forty thousand years before , the spillage from the far side of the bulge had been caught in time .
Vast swathes of the data matched the observations that Tassef had been holding in anticipation of this moment , for the last fifteen thousand years .
There was more : reports of other correlations from other observatories followed within minutes .
As the message from Massa had been relayed around the inner disk , a cascade of similar matches with other stores of data had been found .
By seeing where packets dropped out of the stream , their abstract addresses became concrete , physical locations within the bulge .
As Leila stood in Shalouf ’s main square in the dusk , absorbing the reports , the Aloof ’s network was growing more solid , less ethereal , by the minute .
The streets around her were erupting with signs of elation : polyglot shouts , chirps and buzzes , celebratory scents and vivid pigmentation changes .
Bursts of luminescence spread across the square .
Even the relentlessly sober heptapods had abandoned their food carts to lie on their backs , spinning with delight .
Leila wheeled around , drinking it in , commanding her translator to punch the meaning of every disparate gesture and sound deep into her brain , unifying the kaleidoscope into a single emotional charge .
As the stars of the bulge came out , Tassef offered an overlay for everyone to share , with the newly mapped routes shining like golden highways .
From all around her , Leila picked up the signals of those who were joining the view : people of every civilisation , every species , every replicator were seeing the Aloof ’s secret roads painted across the sky .
Leila walked through the streets of Shalouf , feeling Jasim ’s absence sharply , but too familiar with that pain to be overcome by it .
If the joy of this moment was muted , every celebration would be blighted in the same way , now .
She could not expect anything else .
She would grow inured to it .
Tassef spoke to her .
“ The citizens have reached a decision .
They will grant your request . ”
“ I ’m grateful . ” “ There is a condition .
The transmitter must be built at least twenty light - years away , either in interstellar space , or in the circumstellar region of an uninhabited system . ”
“ I understand . ”
This way , in the event that the Aloof felt threatened to the point of provoking destructive retribution , Tassef would survive an act of violence , at least on a stellar scale , directed against the transmitter itself .
“ We advise you to prepare your final plans for the hardware , and submit them when you ’re sure they will fulfil your purpose . ”
“ Of course . ” Leila went back to her room , and reviewed the plans she had already drafted .
She had anticipated the Tassefi wanting a considerable safety margin , so she had worked out the energy budgets for detailed scenarios involving engineering spores and forty - seven different cometary clouds that fell within Tassef ’s jurisdiction .
It took just seconds to identify the best one that met the required conditions , and she lodged it without hesitation .
Out on the streets , the Listening Party continued .
For the billion pilgrims , this was enough : they would go home , return to their grandchildren , and die happy in the knowledge that they had finally seen something new in the world .
Leila envied them ; there ’d been a time when that would have been enough for her , too .
She left her room and rejoined the celebration , talking , laughing , dancing with strangers , letting herself grow giddy with the moment .
When the sun came up , she made her way home , stepping lightly over the sleeping bodies that filled the street .
The engineering spores were the latest generation : strong bullets launched at close to lightspeed that shed their momentum by diving through the heart of a star , and then rebuilding themselves at atomic density as they decayed in the stellar atmosphere .
In effect , the dying femtomachines constructed nanomachines bearing the same blueprints as they ’d carried within themselves at nuclear densities , and which then continued out to the cometary cloud to replicate and commence the real work of mining raw materials and building the gamma ray transmitter .
Leila contemplated following in their wake , sending herself as a signal to be picked up by the as - yet - unbuilt transmitter .
It would not have been as big a gamble as Jasim ’s with Trident ; the strong bullets had already been used successfully this way in hundreds of similar stars .
In the end , she chose to wait on Tassef for a signal that the transmitter had been successfully constructed , and had tested , aligned and calibrated itself .
If she was going to march blindly into the bulge , it would be absurd to stumble and fall prematurely , before she even reached the precipice .
When the day came , some ten thousand people gathered in the centre of Shalouf to bid the traveller a safe journey .
Leila would have preferred to slip away quietly , but after all her lobbying she had surrendered her privacy , and the Tassefi seemed to feel that she owed them this last splash of colour and ceremony .
Forty - six years after the Listening Party , most of the pilgrims had returned to their homes , but of the few hundred who had lingered in Shalouf nearly all had showed up for this curious footnote to the main event .
Leila was n’t sure that anyone here believed the Aloof ’s network would do more than bounce her straight back into the disk , but the affection these well - wishers expressed seemed genuine .
Someone had even gone to the trouble of digging up a phrase in the oldest known surviving language of her ancestral species : safar bekheyr , may your journey be blessed .
They had written it across the sky in an ancient script that she ’d last seen eighty thousand years before , and it had been spread among the crowd phonetically so that everyone she met could offer her this hopeful farewell as she passed .
Tassef , the insentient delegate of all the planet ’s citizens , addressed the crowd with some sombre ceremonial blather .
Leila ’s mind wandered , settling on the observation that she was probably partaking in a public execution .
No matter .
She had said goodbye to her friends and family long ago .
When she stepped through the ceremonial gate , which had been smeared with a tarry mess that the Tassefi considered the height of beauty , she would close her eyes and recall her last night on Najib , letting the intervening millennia collapse into a dream .
Everyone chose death in the end , and no one ’s exit was perfect .
Better to rely on your own flawed judgements , better to make your own ungainly mess of it , than live in the days when nature would simply take you at random .
As Tassef fell silent , a familiar voice rose up from the crowd .
“ Are you still resolved to do this foolish thing ? ” Leila glared down at her husband .
“ Yes , I am . ” “ You wo n’t reconsider ? ” “ No . ” “ Then I ’m coming with you . ”
Jasim pushed his way through the startled audience , and climbed onto the stage .
Leila spoke to him privately .
“ You ’re embarrassing us both . ”
He replied the same way .
“ Do n’t be petty .
I know I ’ve hurt you , but the blame lies with both of us . ”
“ Why are you doing this ?
You ’ve made your own wishes very plain . ”
“ Do you think I can watch you walk into danger , and not walk beside you ? ”
“ You were ready to die if Trident failed .
You were ready to leave me behind then . ”
“ Once I spoke my mind on that you gave me no choice .
You insisted . ”
He took her hand .
“ You know I only stayed away from you all this time because I hoped it would dissuade you .
I failed .
So now I ’m here . ”
Leila ’s heart softened .
“ You ’re serious ?
You ’ll come with me ? ”
Jasim said , “ Whatever they do to you , let them do it to us both . ”
Leila had no argument to make against this , no residue of anger , no false solicitousness .
She had always wanted him beside her at the end , and she would not refuse him now .
She spoke to Tassef .
“ One more passenger .
Is that acceptable ? ”
The energy budget allowed for a thousand years of test transmissions to follow in her wake ; Jasim would just be a minor blip of extra data .
“ It ’s acceptable . ”
Tassef proceeded to explain the change to the assembled crowd , and to the onlookers scattered across the planet .
Jasim said , “ We ’ll interweave the data from both of us into a single packet .
I do n’t want to end up at Massa and find they ’ve sent you to Jahnom by mistake . ”
“ All right . ” Leila arranged the necessary changes .
None of the Eavesdroppers yet knew that they were coming , and no message sent the long way could warn them in time , but the data they sent into the bulge would be prefaced by instructions that anyone in the Amalgam would find clear and unambiguous , asking that their descriptions only be embodied if they were picked up at Massa .
If they were found in other spillage along the way , they did n’t want to be embodied multiple times .
And if they did not emerge at Massa at all , so be it .
Tassef ’s second speech came to an end .
Leila looked down at the crowd one last time , and let her irritation with the whole bombastic ceremony dissipate into amusement .
If she had been among the sane , she might easily have turned up herself to watch a couple of ancient fools try to step onto the imaginary road in the sky , and wish them safar bekheyr .
She squeezed Jasim ’s hand , and they walked towards the gate .

Leila ’s fingers came together , her hand empty .
She felt as if she was falling , but nothing in sight appeared to be moving .
Then again , all she could see was a distant backdrop , its scale and proximity impossible to judge : thousands of fierce blue stars against the blackness of space .
She looked around for Jasim , but she was utterly alone .
She could see no vehicle or other machine that might have disgorged her into this emptiness .
There was not even a planet below her , or a single brightest star to which she might be bound .
Absurdly , she was breathing .
Every other cue told her that she was drifting through vacuum , probably through interstellar space .
Her lungs kept filling and emptying , though .
The air , and her skin , felt neither hot nor cold .
Someone or something had embodied her , or was running her as software .
She was not on Massa , she was sure of that ; she had never visited that world , but nowhere in the Amalgam would a guest be treated like this .
Not even one who arrived unannounced in data spilling out from the bulge .
Leila said , “ Are you listening to me ?
Do you understand me ? ”
She could hear her own voice , flat and without resonance .
The acoustics made perfect sense in a vast , empty , windless place , if not an airless one .
Anywhere in the Amalgam , you knew whether you were embodied or not ; it was the nature of all bodies , real or virtual , that declarative knowledge of every detail was there for the asking .
Here , when Leila tried to summon the same information , her mind remained blank .
It was like the strange absence she ’d felt on Trident , when she ’d been cut off from the repositories of civilisation , but here the amputation had reached all the way inside her .
She inhaled deeply , but there was no noticeable scent at all , not even the whiff of her own body odour that she would have expected , whether she was wearing her ancestral phenotype or any of the forms of ersatz flesh that she adopted when the environment demanded it .
She pinched the skin of her forearm ; it felt more like her original skin than any of the substitutes she ’d ever worn .
They might have fashioned this body out of something both remarkably lifelike and chemically inert , and placed her in a vast , transparent container of air , but she was beginning to pick up a strong stench of ersatz physics .
Air and skin alike , she suspected , were made of bits , not atoms .
So where was Jasim ?
Were they running him too , in a separate scape ?
She called out his name , trying not to make the exploratory cry sound plaintive .
She understood all too well now why he ’d tried so hard to keep her from this place , and why he ’d been unable to face staying behind : the thought that the Aloof might be doing something unspeakable to his defenceless consciousness , in some place she could n’t hope to reach or see , was like a white hot blade pressed to her heart .
All she could do was try to shut off the panic and talk down the possibility .
All right , he ’s alone here , but so am I , and it ’s not that bad .
She would put her faith in symmetry ; if they had not abused her , why would they have harmed Jasim ?
She forced herself to be calm .
The Aloof had taken the trouble to grant her consciousness , but she could n’t expect the level of amenity she was accustomed to .
For a start , it would be perfectly reasonable if her hosts were unable or unwilling to plug her into any data source equivalent to the Amalgam ’s libraries , and perhaps the absence of somatic knowledge was not much different .
Rather than deliberately fooling her about her body , maybe they had looked at the relevant data channels and decided that anything they fed into them would be misleading .
Understanding her transmitted description well enough to bring her to consciousness was one thing , but it did n’t guarantee that they knew how to translate the technical details of their instantiation of her into her own language .
And if this ignorance - plus - honesty excuse was too sanguine to swallow , it was n’t hard to think of the Aloof as being pathologically secretive without actually being malicious .
If they wanted to keep quiet about the way they ’d brought her to life lest it reveal something about themselves , that too was understandable .
They need not be doing it for the sake of tormenting her .
Leila surveyed the sky around her , and felt a jolt of recognition .
She ’d memorised the positions of the nearest stars to the target node where her transmission would first be sent , and now a matching pattern stood out against the background in a collection of distinctive constellations .
She was being shown the sky from that node .
This did n’t prove anything about her actual location , but the simplest explanation was that the Aloof had instantiated her here , rather than sending her on through the network .
The stars were in the positions she ’d predicted for her time of arrival , so if this was the reality , there had been little delay in choosing how to deal with the intruder .
No thousand - year - long deliberations , no passing of the news to a distant decision - maker .
Either the Aloof themselves were present here , or the machinery of the node was so sophisticated that they might as well have been .
She could not have been woken by accident ; it had to have been a deliberate act .
It made her wonder if the Aloof had been expecting something like this for millennia .
“ What now ? ” she asked .
Her hosts remained silent .
“ Toss me back to Tassef ? ”
The probes with their reversed trajectories bore no record of their experience ; perhaps the Aloof would n’t incorporate these new memories into her description before returning her .
She spread her arms imploringly .
“ If you ’re going to erase this memory , why not speak to me first ?
I ’m in your hands completely , you can send me to the grave with your secrets .
Why wake me at all , if you do n’t want to talk ? ”
In the silence that followed , Leila had no trouble imagining one answer : to study her .
It was a mathematical certainty that some questions about her behaviour could never be answered simply by examining her static description ; the only reliable way to predict what she ’d do in any given scenario was to wake her and confront her with it .
They might , of course , have chosen to wake her any number of times before , without granting her memories of the previous instantiations .
She experienced a moment of sheer existential vertigo : this could be the thousandth , the billionth , in a vast series of experiments , as her captors permuted dozens of variables to catalogue her responses .
The vertigo passed .
Anything was possible , but she preferred to entertain more pleasant hypotheses .
“ I came here to talk , ” she said .
“ I understand that you do n’t want us sending in machinery , but there must be something we can discuss , something we can learn from each other .
In the disk , every time two space - faring civilisations met , they found they had something in common .
Some mutual interests , some mutual benefits . ”
At the sound of her own earnest speech dissipating into the virtual air around her , Leila started laughing .
The arguments she ’d been putting for centuries to Jasim , to her friends on Najib , to the Snakes on Nazdeek , seemed ridiculous now , embarrassing .
How could she face the Aloof and claim that she had anything to offer them that they had not considered , and rejected , hundreds of thousands of years before ?
The Amalgam had never tried to keep its nature hidden .
The Aloof would have watched them , studied them from afar , and consciously chosen isolation .
To come here and list the advantages of contact as if they ’d never crossed her hosts ’ minds was simply insulting .
Leila fell silent .
If she had lost faith in her role as cultural envoy , at least she ’d proved to her own satisfaction that there was something in here smarter than the sling - shot fence the probes had encountered .
The Aloof had not embraced her , but the whole endeavour had not been in vain .
To wake in the bulge , even to silence , was far more than she ’d ever had the right to hope for .
She said , “ Please , just bring me my husband now , then we ’ll leave you in peace . ”
This entreaty was met in the same way as all the others .
Leila resisted speculating again about experimental variables .
She did not believe that a million - year - old civilisation was interested in testing her tolerance to isolation , robbing her of her companion and seeing how long she took to attempt suicide .
The Aloof did not take orders from her ; fine .
If she was neither an experimental subject to be robbed of her sanity , nor a valued guest whose every wish was granted , there had to be some other relationship between them that she had yet to fathom .
She had to be conscious for a reason .
She searched the sky for a hint of the node itself , or any other feature she might have missed , but she might as well have been living inside a star map , albeit one shorn of the usual annotations .
The Milky Way , the plane of stars that bisected the sky , was hidden by the thicker clouds of gas and dust here , but Leila had her bearings ; she knew which way led deeper into the bulge , and which way led back out to the disk .
She contemplated Tassef ’s distant sun with mixed emotions , as a sailor might look back on the last sight of land .
As the yearning for that familiar place welled up , a cylinder of violet light appeared around her , encircling the direction of her gaze .
For the first time , Leila felt her weightlessness interrupted : a gentle acceleration was carrying her forward along the imaginary beam .
“ No ! Wait ! ”
She closed her eyes and curled into a ball .
The acceleration halted , and when she opened her eyes the tunnel of light was gone .
She let herself float limply , paying no attention to anything in the sky , waiting to see what happened if she kept her mind free of any desire for travel .
After an hour like this , the phenomenon had not recurred .
Leila turned her gaze in the opposite direction , into the bulge .
She cleared her mind of all timidity and nostalgia , and imagined the thrill of rushing deeper into this violent , spectacular , alien territory .
At first there was no response from the scape , but then she focused her attention sharply in the direction of a second node , the one she ’d hoped her transmission would be forwarded to from the first , on its way through the galactic core .
The same violet light , the same motion .
This time , Leila waited a few heartbeats longer before she broke the spell .
Unless this was some pointlessly sadistic game , the Aloof were offering her a clear choice .
She could return to Tassef , return to the Amalgam .
She could announce that she ’d put a toe in these mysterious waters , and lived to tell the tale .
Or she could dive into the bulge , as deep as she ’d ever imagined , and see where the network took her .
“ No promises ? ” she asked .
“ No guarantee I ’ll come out the other side ?
No intimations of contact , to tempt me further ? ”
She was thinking aloud , she did not expect answers .
Her hosts , she was beginning to conclude , viewed strangers through the prism of a strong , but very sharply delineated , sense of obligation .
They sent back the insentient probes to their owners , scrupulously intact .
They had woken this intruder to give her the choice : did she really want to go where her transmission suggested , or had she wandered in here like a lost child who just needed to find the way home ?
They would do her no harm , and send her on no journey without her consent , but those were the limits of their duty of care .
They did not owe her any account of themselves .
She would get no greeting , no hospitality , no conversation .
“ What about Jasim ?
Will you give me a chance to consult with him ? ”
She waited , picturing his face , willing his presence , hoping they might read her mind if her words were beyond them .
If they could decode a yearning towards a point in the sky , surely this wish for companionship was not too difficult to comprehend ?
She tried variations , dwelling on the abstract structure of their intertwined data in the transmission , hoping this might clarify the object of her desire if his physical appearance meant nothing to them .
She remained alone .
The stars that surrounded her spelt out the only choices on offer .
If she wanted to be with Jasim once more before she died , she had to make the same decision as he did .
Symmetry demanded that he faced the same dilemma .
How would he be thinking ?
He might be tempted to retreat back to the safety of Tassef , but he ’d reconciled with her in Shalouf for the sole purpose of following her into danger .
He would understand that she ’d want to go deeper , would want to push all the way through to Massa , opening up the short - cut through the core , proving it safe for future travellers .
Would he understand , too , that she ’d feel a pang of guilt at this presumptuous line of thought , and that she ’d contemplate making a sacrifice of her own ?
He had braved the unknown for her , and they had reaped the reward already : they had come closer to the Aloof than anyone in history .
Why could n’t that be enough ?
For all Leila knew , her hosts might not even wake her again before Massa .
What would she be giving up if she turned back now ?
More to the point , what would Jasim expect of her ?
That she ’d march on relentlessly , following her obsession to the end , or that she ’d put her love for him first ?
The possibilities multiplied in an infinite regress .
They knew each other as well as two people could , but they did n’t carry each other ’s minds inside them .
Leila drifted through the limbo of stars , wondering if Jasim had already made his decision .
Having seen that the Aloof were not the torturers he ’d feared , had he already set out for Tassef , satisfied that she faced no real peril at their hands ?
Or had he reasoned that their experience at this single node meant nothing ?
This was not the Amalgam , the culture could be a thousand times more fractured .
This cycle of guesses and doubts led nowhere .
If she tried to pursue it to the end she ’d be paralysed .
There were no guarantees ; she could only choose the least worst case .
If she returned to Tassef , only to find that Jasim had gone on alone through the bulge , it would be unbearable : she would have lost him for nothing .
If that happened , she could try to follow him , returning to the bulge immediately , but she would already be centuries behind him .
If she went on to Massa , and it was Jasim who retreated , at least she ’d know that he ’d ended up in safety .
She ’d know , too , that he had not been desperately afraid for her , that the Aloof ’s benign indifference at this first node had been enough to persuade him that they ’d do her no harm .
That was her answer : she had to continue , all the way to Massa .
With the hope , but no promise , that Jasim would have thought the same way .
The decision made , she lingered in the scape .
Not from any second thoughts , but from a reluctance to give up lightly the opportunity she ’d fought so hard to attain .
She did n’t know if any member of the Aloof was watching and listening to her , reading her thoughts , examining her desires .
Perhaps they were so indifferent and incurious that they ’d delegated everything to insentient software , and merely instructed their machines to baby - sit her while she made up her mind where she wanted to go .
She still had to make one last attempt to reach them , or she would never die in peace .
“ Maybe you ’re right , ” she said .
“ Maybe you ’ve watched us for the last million years , and seen that we have nothing to offer you .
Maybe our technology is backwards , our philosophy naive , our customs bizarre , o
In the recent political battle around the Marine recruiting station in Berkeley there has been much confusion around the concept or slogan of “ supporting the troops , ” but opposing the unjust wars of the Bush regime .
Many who oppose the Bush regime wars also say they “ support the troops . ”
Let me say it straight out — I do not support the troops and neither should you .
It is objectively impossible to support the troops of the imperialist military forces of the U.S. and at the same time oppose the wars in which they fight .
The United States has over 700 military bases or sites located in over 130 foreign countries .
The hundreds of thousands of troops stationed in these countries are not there to preserve or foster freedom and democracy as the Bush regime would like to claim , but to maintain U.S. imperialist domination of the world .
The United States now spends more on its military than all the other nations of the world combined .
If you “ support the troops ” in Iraq , Afghanistan , and the other more than 100 countries in which they are located , you also objectively support U.S. hegemony in the world .
I believe that the vast majority of people who say they support the troops do not wish to support U.S. imperialism , but that is what they are really doing by putting forth the slogan of “ support the troops . ”
We need to oppose the recruitment of men and women into the military .
We need to support resisters within the military who have realized what they are doing and now choose to resist the role of the U.S. military .
This includes people such as Lt. Ehren Watada who refused to deploy to Iraq .
Watada stated , “ Never did I imagine my president would lie to go to war , condone torture , spy on Americans … ”
He was the first officer to refuse to go to Iraq and he was court - martialed .
Another resister is Camilo Mejia .
In 2004 Sergeant Mejia was sentenced to one year in prison when he was court - martialed for refusing to assist the military in Iraq .
Mejia said , “ I am only a regular person that got tired of being afraid to follow his own conscience .
For far too long I allowed others to direct my actions even when I knew that they were wrong .... ”
We need to expose that those in the U.S. military are trained to be part of a “ killing machine . ”
While not every member of the military is an individual murderer , they are all part of a system that commits war crimes , including aggressive wars , massacres , rape , and other crimes against humanity , all in the service of U.S. imperialism .
The bottom line is that even if these people are relatives or friends , you can not support the troops without also supporting the objective role that these troops play in the imperialist system .
United States troops are acting as destructive and murderous forces of invasion and occupation .
The people of Iraq and Afghanistan see this on a daily basis .
Hundreds of thousands have died as a direct result of the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Millions are either internal or external refugees .
Tens of thousands have been detained in prisons , with thousands of these tortured and scores murdered .
Haditha , Iraq where 24 Iraqis were massacred is just the best known of the massacres .
Women and children are routinely described as “ collateral damage ” by military spokespersons when they are murdered in military operations .
“ Support for the troops ” has become political cover to support the wars .
In Congress , many of those who claim they oppose the wars , use “ support of the troops ” to vote for hundreds of millions of dollars to fund the wars .
These politicians are political opportunists , but there are also people who genuinely oppose the war , but who also say “ I support the troops . ”
But to decide whether U.S. troops deserve support you must analyze what they actually do in countries occupied by the U.S.
The wars these troops are engaged in have the goal of maintaining and extending U.S. hegemony throughout the world .
They are unjust , illegal , and immoral wars .
Can you support the troops in these wars ?
Why is this any different from a German in World War II saying , “ I oppose the wars launched by Hitler , but I support the troops of the German army which are making these wars possible . ”
When the Marines in Haditha massacred Iraqis , including women and children , would it have been correct to say I supported the Marines who killed those people , but not the massacre ?
This would be ridiculous , but no more so than supporting the troops engaged in the war that made the Haditha massacre possible in the first place .
In 1933 Marine Major General Smedley Butler clarified the role of the U.S. military .
He stated , “ War is just a racket …
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses … I spent 33 years and four months in active military service as a member of this country ’s most agile military force , the Marine Corps …
In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism ... ”
Like Butler , Watada , and Mejia , those in the military today must take responsibility for what the military does .
Just like the German soldiers of World War 2 could not hide behind the “ I was just following orders ” excuse , military personnel today also can not hide behind it .
Those of us who oppose the unjust wars of the Bush regime must struggle with those in the military and those that support them to expose what role the troops objectively play .
Supporting the troops engaged in making war against other nations and people on behalf of U.S. imperialism is not acceptable .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Chinese officials cut short a relay of the Olympic torch through Paris on Monday after thousands of pro-Tibet protesters forced it to be extinguished and turned the event into a shambles .
French riot police grapple with a demonstrator trying to grab the Olympic torch in Paris April 7 , 2008 .

The flame had to be snuffed out at least twice and sheltered in a bus on several occasions to protect it from the mass of demonstrators who repeatedly blocked its path , denouncing China ’s crackdown on Tibet .
Apparently angered by a human rights banner hanging from Paris city hall , the Chinese organizers called off a reception for the torch cortege at the last minute and sped past hundreds of flag - waving protesters awaiting the flame ’s arrival .
“ Free Tibet , ” the crowds chanted , with bystanders repeatedly charging the imposing security cordon to try to grab the flame in scenes reminiscent of the protests that hit the torch ’s chaotic journey through London on Sunday .
“ No flames in Tibet , ” said one banner strung from a bridge over the River Seine .
“ Boycott Chinese goods , ” said another banner , while hundreds of brightly colored Tibetan flags fluttered in the cold winter sunlight .
Hundreds of pro-Chinese supporters also joined the crush , waving aloft the red Chinese flag , and there were occasional scuffles between the different camps as they awaited the flame .
The relay organizers finally threw in the towel near the French national assembly after parliamentarians rolled out a banner backing human rights .
The flame was put onto a bus and driven down to the final stage of the relay in southern Paris .
There , former swimming champion Christine Caron set alight a cauldron in front of the Charlety stadium and in a carefully stage - managed show , fireworks flashed up around the podium .
But the real fireworks were seen on the streets of Paris , with the build up to the August Beijing Olympics rapidly becoming a public relations disaster for the Chinese organizers .

IMAGE PROBLEM
Olympic officials and government ministers were clearly embarrassed by the mayhem that unfolded around the capital despite some 3,000 police being called up to control the crowds .
“ The Olympic flame is a symbol of peace , of respect and of solidarity .
Olympic values were a bit ridiculed today , ” Sports Minister Bernard Laporte told France 2 television .
“ It ’s not very good for the image of France , ” he added .
Chinese authorities appeared to have complete say over the relay , switching off the torch when they feared protesters were too close and skipping the town hall ceremony .
“ The Chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by Parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
It is their responsibility , ” Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoe said after the flame failed to show up .
The French leg of the relay set off at 12.30 p.m. ( 1030 GMT ) from the Eiffel Tower , but what Beijing has called a “ harmonious journey ” rapidly became a violent obstacle course .
Police clad in riot gear detained 18 demonstrators , the Interior Ministry said , wrestling some of them to the ground when they tried to cross the security barriers .
Television showed one protester lying in the road , his face smeared with blood .
“ We want free Tibet ” he shouted .
“ We are doing our best but it will take the world to put pressure on China to help bring democracy and human rights to Tibet , ” said Phurbu Dolker , a 21 - year - old Tibetan refugee .
The Olympic flame will now fly to its next stop , San Francisco .
It is expected to remain a magnet for anti-Chinese protests ahead of the games .
The flame is due to return to Beijing on August 6 , two days before it will be used to light the cauldron at the Olympic opening ceremony .
I 'm not an avid Facebook user , but I have been checking it every now and then for the promised chat application , and as of today it seems to finally be available for everyone .
And , although I have certain reservations about yet another web based chat application , I must say I love it .
The chat is integrated into Facebook well - all of its components are displayed in a minibar that 's always at the bottom of your screen .
It 's practical , yet unobtrusive .
My Facebook friends seem to have embraced it really well , since most of them have started chatting like crazy right away .
The whole thing simply makes sense ; you 're there to communicate with your friends anyway , so chat is the logical extension to Facebook 's functionality .
Options and features wise , Facebook chat does n't really offer all that much ; the settings tab hides exactly four options : Show Mini-Feed Stories in Chat , Play Sound for New Messages , Keep Online Friends Open , and Show Only Names in Online Friends .
The chat history is remembered even after you close the chat , and even after you log out and log back in .
It would be nice if you could extract the entire log and save it somewhere as backup , though .
I 'd also like to see the standard , one click status updates : I 'm busy , I 'm AFK , etc .
The Facebook folks are aware that features are scarce , and they promise more in the future .
All in all , Facebook chat is a great addition to the service .
To paraphrase one of our commenters , Facebook chat maybe wo n't replace your other chat applications , but it 'll do just fine for chatting with people who you usually do n't chat with .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
A day before Israel implements a " routine " emergency drill , an Israeli official Monday said the entire country is at risk of Hezbollah rocket attacks and blamed Iran for " provoking us " by backing the terrorist group .
" An Iranian attack will lead to a harsh retaliation by Israel , " says Benyamin Ben Eliezer .
Israeli Infrastructure Minister Benyamin Ben Eliezer warned against an attack by Iran , which he said is unlikely to happen .
" An Iranian attack will lead to a harsh retaliation by Israel , which will lead to the destruction of the Iranian nation , " Ben Eliezer said , pointing out that Iran " will not attack Israel so quickly because they understand the ramifications . "
" They are certainly aware of our strength , " he said .
" Nonetheless , the Iranians are provoking us through their allies Syria and Hezbollah , ( providing ) them with much weaponry , and with that we have to contend . "
On Tuesday , Israel will begin a nationwide emergency response starting with a 90 - second - long siren that will sound across Israel at 10 a.m. ( 3 a.m. ET ) except in the southern town of Sderot , a frequent target of rocket attacks launched by Palestinian militants in Gaza .
Ben Eliezer stressed that the nationwide emergency drill " is not aimed at threatening any of the countries surrounding us . "
But he offered a bleak scenario for Israel in the face of a future war .
Do n't Miss Israel to hold nationwide emergency drill
" I predict that in the opening strike , hundreds of rockets will land in Israel , " Ben Eliezer said .
" There will not be a place in the country out of the range of the missiles and rockets of Syria and Hezbollah . "
During Tuesday 's drill , Israeli television will show a message from the military as well as instructional videos on how to seek shelter during an alert .
During that time , Israeli schools and government offices will practice entering protected spaces .
The country will also begin practicing its response to a variety of attacks , including rocket strikes and incidents involving chemical and biological agents .
Haemek Hospital in Afula will be one of the institutions taking part in those drills , which will end on Thursday .
Speaking on Sunday , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stressed the exercise " is only a drill " and has nothing to do with " exaggerated " reports of heightened tensions with Syria .
" I would like to make it unequivocally clear that this is a routine drill , " Olmert said before the start of his weekly Cabinet meeting .
" The state of Israel is not intent on any violent confrontation in the north .
On the contrary , we have said more than once that we have an interest in holding peace negotiations with Syria .
They know exactly what our expectations are .
I can also say that we know what their expectations are ; if these conditions will bear fruit , then this is what we are intent on and nothing else . "
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the exercise is a direct result of Israel 's 2006 war with Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon , which failed to weaken the Hezbollah either militarily or politically .
" The Second Lebanon War created a situation by which the home front is part of the front , " Barak said Monday .
" Israel has no interest in escalating the situation in the region . "

Abstract
The Resource Description Framework RDF allows users to describe both Web documents and concepts from the real world — people , organisations , topics , things — in a computer - processable way .
Publishing such descriptions on the Web creates the Semantic Web. URIs ( Uniform Resource Identifiers ) are very important , providing both the core of the framework itself and the link between RDF and the Web .
This document presents guidelines for their effective use .
It discusses two strategies , called 303 URIs and hash URIs .
It gives pointers to several Web sites that use these solutions , and briefly discusses why several other proposals have problems .

Scope
This document is a practical guide for implementers of the RDF specification .
The title is inspired by Tim Berners - Lee 's article " Cool URIs do n't change " [ Cool ] .
It explains two approaches for RDF data hosted on HTTP servers .
Intended audiences are Web and ontology developers who have to decide how to model their RDF URIs for use with HTTP .
Applications using non-HTTP URIs are not covered .
This document is an informative guide covering selected aspects of previously published , detailed technical specifications .
The 303 URIs are based on the httpRange - 14 resolution [ httpRange ] by the Technical Architecture Group ( TAG ) .
We assume that you are familiar with the basics of the RDF data model [ RDFPrimer ] .
We also assume some familiarity with the HTTP protocol [ RFC2616 ] .
Wikipedia 's article [ WP - HTTP ] serves as a good primer .
Table of Contents
1. Introduction
The Semantic Web is envisioned as a decentralised world - wide information space for sharing machine - readable data with a minimum of integration costs .
Its two core challenges are the distributed modelling of the world with a shared data model , and the infrastructure where data and schemas can be published , found and used .
Users benefit from getting information " raw and now " [ Give ] and in portable data formats [ DP ] .
Providers often publish data embedded in a fixed user interface , in HTML .
A basic question is thus how to publish information about resources in a way that allows interested users and software applications to find and interpret them .
On the Semantic Web , all information has to be expressed as statements about resources , like the members of the company Example.com are Alice and Bob or Bob 's telephone number is " +1 555 262 " or this Web page was created by Alice .
Resources are identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) [ RFC3986 ] .
This modelling approach is at the heart of Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) [ RDFPrimer ] .
A nice introduction is given in the N3 primer [ N3 Primer ] .
Using RDF , the statements can be published on the Web site of the company .
Others can read the data and publish their own information , linking to existing resources .
This forms a distributed model of the world .
It allows the user to pick any application to view and work with the same data , for example to see Alice 's published address in your address book .
At the same time , Web documents have always been addressed with URIs ( in common parlance often referred as Uniform Resource Locators , URLs ) .
This is useful because it means we can easily make RDF statements about Web pages , but also dangerous because we can easily mix up Web pages and the things , or resources , described on the page .
So the question is , what URIs should we use in RDF ?
As an example , to identify the frontpage of the Web site of Example Inc. , we may use http://www.example.com/ .
But what URI identifies the company as an organisation , not a Web site ?
Do we have to serve any content — HTML pages , RDF files — at those URIs ?
In this document we will answer these questions according to relevant specifications .
We explain how to use URIs for things that are not Web pages , such as people , products , places , ideas and concepts such as ontology classes .
We give detailed examples as to how the Semantic Web can ( and should ) be realised as a part of the Web .
2. URIs for Web Documents
Let us begin with an example .
Assume that Example Inc. , a fictional company producing " Extreme Guitar Amplifiers " , has a Web site at http://www.example.com/ .
Part of the site is a white - pages service listing the names and contact details of the employees .
Alice and Bob both work at Example Inc .
The structure of the Web site might thus be :
http://www.example.com/
the homepage of Example Inc. http://www.example.com/people/alice the homepage of Alice http://www.example.com/people/bob the homepage of Bob
Like everything on the traditional Web , each of the pages mentioned above are Web documents .
Every Web document has its own URI .
Note that a Web document is not the same as a file : a single Web document can be available in many different formats and languages , and a single file , for example a PHP script , may be responsible for generating a large number of Web documents with different URIs .
A Web document is defined as something that has a URI and can return representations ( responses in a format such as HTML or JPEG or RDF ) of the identified resource in response to HTTP requests .
In technical literature , such as Architecture of the World Wide Web , Volume One [ AWWW ] , the term Information Resource is used instead of Web document .
On the traditional Web , URIs were used primarily for Web documents — to link to them , and to access them in a browser .
The notion of resource identity was not so important on the traditional Web , a URL simply identified whatever we see when we type it into a browser .
2.1. HTTP and Content Negotiation
Web clients and servers use the HTTP protocol [ RFC2616 ] to request representations of Web documents and send back the responses .
HTTP has a powerful mechanism for offering different formats and language versions of the same Web document known as content negotiation .
When a user agent ( such as a browser ) makes an HTTP request , it sends along some HTTP headers to indicate what data formats and language it prefers .
The server then selects the best match from its file system or generates the desired content on demand , and sends it back to the client .
For example , a browser could send this HTTP request to indicate that it wants an HTML or XHTML representation of http://www.example.com/people/alice in English or German :
GET / people / alice HTTP/1.1 Host : www.example.com
Accept : text / html , application / xhtml+xml Accept - Language : en , de
The server could answer :
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content - Type : text / html Content - Language : en Content - Location : http://www.example.com/people.en.html
followed by the content of the HTML document in English .
Here we see Content negotiation [ TAG - Alt ] in action .
The server interprets the Accept - Language headers in the request and decides to return the English representation of the resource in question .
Note that the URI of this representation is passed back in the Content - Location header , this is not required but a recommended good practice ( see [ CHIPS ] , 7.2 ) .
Clients see that this URI is connected to the specific representation ( in this case English ) and search engines can refer to the different representations by using the different URIs .
This implies that it is possible to have multiple representations of the same resource .
Content negotation is often implemented with a twist : Instead of a direct answer , the server redirects to another URL where the appropriate representation is found :
HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location : http://www.example.com/people/alice.en.html
The redirect is indicated by a special Status Code , here 302 Found .
The client would now send another HTTP request to the new URL .
By having separate URLs for different representations , this approach allows Web authors to link directly to a specific representation .
RDF / XML , the standard serialisation format of RDF , has its own content type , application / rdf+xml .
Content negotiation thus allows publishers to serve HTML representations of a Web document to traditional Web browsers and RDF representations to Semantic Web - enabled user agents .
This also allows servers to provide alternative RDF serialisation formats like Notation3 [ N3 ] or TriX [ TriX ] .
3. URIs for Real - World Objects
On the Semantic Web , URIs identify not just Web documents , but also real - world objects like people and cars , and even abstract ideas and non-existing things like a mythical unicorn .
We call these real - world objects or things .
Given such a URI , how can we find out what it identifies ?
We need some way to answer this question , because otherwise it will be hard to achieve interoperability between independent information systems .
We could imagine a service where we can look up a description of the identified resource , similar to today 's search engines .
But such a single point of failure is against the Web 's decentralised nature .
Instead , we should use the Web itself — an extremely robust and scalable information publishing system — as a lookup service for resource descriptions .
Whenever a URI is mentioned , we can look it up to retrieve a description containing relevant information and links to related data .
This is so important that we make it our number one requirement for cool URIs :
1 . Be on the Web .
Given only a URI , machines and people should be able to retrieve a description about the resource identified by the URI from the Web .
Such a look - up mechanism is important to establish shared understanding of what a URI identifies .
Machines should get RDF data and humans should get a readable representation , such as HTML .
The standard Web transfer protocol , HTTP , should be used .
Let 's assume Example Inc. wants to publish contact data of their employees on the Semantic Web so their business partners can import it into their address books .
For example , the published data would contain these statements about Alice , written here in N3 syntax [ N3 ] :
< URI - of - alice > a foaf : Person ; foaf : name " Alice " ; foaf : mbox < mailto:alice@example.com > ; foaf : homepage < http://www.example.com/people/alice> .
What URI should we use instead of the placeholder < URI - of - alice > ?
Certainly not http://www.example.com/people/alice , because that would confuse a person with a Web document , leading to misunderstandings :
Is the homepage of Alice also named “ Alice ” ?
Can a homepage itself have an e-mail address ?
And does it make sense for a home - page to have itself as its home - page ?
So we need another URI .
( For in - depth treatments of this issue , see What HTTP URIs Identify ? [ HTTP - URI2 ] and Four Uses of a URL : Name , Concept , Web Location and Document Instance [ Booth ] ) .
Therefore our second requirement :
2 . Be unambiguous .
There should be no confusion between identifiers for Web documents and identifiers for other resources .
URIs are meant to identify only one of them , so one URI can't stand for both a Web document and a real - world object .
We note that our requirements seem to conflict with each other .
If we can't use URIs of documents to identify real - world object , then how can we retrieve a representation about real - world objects based on their URI ?
The challenge is to find a solution that allows us to find the describing documents if we have just the resource 's URI , using standard Web technologies .
The following picture shows the desired relationships between a resource and its representing documents :
3.1 Distinguishing between Representations and Descriptions
It is important to understand that using URIs , it is possible to identify both a thing ( which may exist outside of the Web ) and a Web document describing the thing .
For example the person Alice is described on her homepage .
Bob may not like the look of the homepage , but fancy the person Alice .
So two URIs are needed , one for Alice , one for the homepage or a RDF document describing Alice .
The question is where to draw the line between the case where either is possible and the case where only descriptions are available .
According to W3C guidelines ( [ AWWW ] , section 2.2. ) , we have a Web document ( there called information resource ) if all its essential characteristics can be conveyed in a message .
Examples are a Web page , an image or a product catalog .
In HTTP , because a 200 response code should be sent when a Web document has been accessed , but a different setup is needed when publishing URIs that are meant to identify entities which are not Web documents .
In the next section , solutions are described that allow you to mint URIs for things and also allow clients to get a description of the thing using standard Web technologies .
4. Two Solutions
There are two solutions that meet our requirements for identifying real - world objects : 303 URIs and hash URIs .
Which one to use depends on the situation , both have advantages and disadvantages .
The solutions described in the following apply to deployment scenarios in which the RDF data and the HTML data is served separately , such as a standalone RDF / XML document along with an HTML document .
The metadata can also be embedded in HTML , using technologies such as RDFa [ RDFa Primer ] , microformats and other documents to which the GRDDL [ GRDDL ] mechanisms can be applied .
In those cases the RDF data is extracted from the returned HTML document .
4.1 . Hash URIs
The first solution is to use “ hash URIs ” for non-document resources .
URIs can contain a fragment , a special part that is separated from the rest of the URI by a hash symbol ( “ # ” ) .
When a client wants to retrieve a hash URI , then the HTTP protocol requires the fragment part to be stripped off before requesting the URI from the server .
This means a URI that includes a hash cannot be retrieved directly , and therefore does not necessarily identify a Web document .
But we can use them to identify other , non-document resources , without creating ambiguity .
If Example Inc. adopts this solution , then they could use these URIs to represent the company , Alice , and Bob :
http://www.example.com/about#exampleinc
Example Inc. , the company http://www.example.com/about#bob
Bob , the person
http://www.example.com/about#alice
Alice , the person
Clients will always strip off the fragment part before requesting any of these URIs , resulting in a request to this URI :
http://www.example.com/about RDF document describing Example Inc. , Bob , and Alice
At this URI , Example Inc. could serve an RDF document that contains descriptions of all three resources , using the original hash URIs to identify the resources .
The following picture shows the hash URI approach without content negotiation :
Alternatively , content negotiation ( see Section 2.1. ) could be employed to redirect from the about URI to either a HTML or an RDF representation .
The decision which to return is based on client preferences and server configuration , as explained below in Section 4.7 .
The Content - Location header should be set to indicate if the hash URI refers to a part of the HTML document or RDF document .
The following picture shows the hash URI approach with content negotiation :
4.2. 303 URIs forwarding to One Generic Document
The second solution is to use a special HTTP status code , 303 See Other , to give an indication that the requested resource is not a regular Web document .
Web architecture tells you that for a thing resource ( URI ) it is inappropriate to return a 200 because there is , in fact , no suitable representation for those resources .
However , it is useful to provide information about those resources .
The W3C's Technical Architecture Group proposes in its httpRange - 14 resolution [ httpRange ] document a solution that is to direct you to a document which has information about the thing you asked about .
By doing this we avoid ambiguity between the original , real - world object and the resource that represents it .
Since 303 is a redirect status code , the server can give the location of a document that represents the resource .
If , on the other hand , a request is answered with one of the usual status codes in the 2XX range , like 200 OK , then the client knows that the URI identifies a Web document .
If Example Inc. adopts this solution , they could use these URIs to represent the company , Alice and Bob :
http://www.example.com/id/exampleinc
Example Inc. , the company http://www.example.com/id/bob
Bob , the person
http://www.example.com/id/alice
Alice , the person
The Web server would be configured to answer requests to all these URIs with a 303 status code and a Location HTTP header that provides the URL of a document that represents the resource .
For example , to redirect from http://www.example.com/id/alice to http://www.example.com/doc/alice .
Content - negotiation is then used when retrieving a representation from the document URI using a HTTP request .
The server decides ( see Section 4.7 ) to return either HTML or RDF ( or more alternative forms ) and sets the Content - Location header to the URI where the specific representation can be retrieved .
This setup should be used when the RDF and HTML ( and possibly more alternative representations ) convey the same information in different forms .
When the information in the variations differs considerably , the 303 approach as described below should be used .
See the following illustration for the solution providing the generic document URI .
In this setup , the server forwards from the identification URI to the generic document URI .
This has the advantage that clients can bookmark and further work with the generic document .
A user having a RDF - capable client could bookmark the document , and mail it to another user ( or device ) which then dereferences it and gets the HTML or the RDF view .
Also , the server can add representations in new languages in the future .
Just because the client started with the URI of a thing , it does n't mean that the document involved is not a first class document on the WWW .
The background of generic document resources is described in [ GenRes ] .
4.3 . 303 URIs forwarding to Different Documents
When the RDF and HTML representations of the resource differ substantially , the previous setup should not be used .
They are not two versions of the same document , but different documents altogether .
Again , the Web server would be configured to answer requests with a 303 status code and a Location HTTP header that provides the URL of a document that represents the resource .
The following picture shows the redirects for the 303 URI solution without the generic document URI :
The server could employ content negotiation ( see Section 2.1. ) to send either the URL of an HTML description or RDF .
HTTP requests for HTML content would be redirected to the HTML URLs we gave in Section 2 .
Requests for RDF data would be redirected to RDF documents , such as :
http://www.example.com/data/exampleinc
RDF document describing Example Inc. , the company http://www.example.com/data/bob
RDF document describing Bob , the person http://www.example.com/data/alice
RDF document describing Alice , the person
Each of the RDF documents would contain statements about the appropriate resource , using the original URI , e.g .
http://www.example.com/id/alice , to identify the described resource .
4.4 . Choosing between 303 and Hash
Which approach is better ?
It depends .
The hash URIs have the advantage of reducing the number of necessary HTTP round - trips , which in turn reduces access latency .
A family of URIs can share the same non-hash part .
The descriptions of http://www.example.com/about#exampleinc , http://www.example.com/about#alice , and http://www.example.com/about#bob are retrieved with a single request to http://www.example.com/about .
However this approach has a downside .
A client interested only in # product123 will inadvertently load the data for all other resources as well , because they are in the same file .
303 URIs , on the other hand , are very flexible because the redirection target can be configured separately for each resource .
There could be one describing document for each resource , or one large document for all of them , or any combination in between .
It is also possible to change the policy later on .
When using 303 URIs for an ontology , like FOAF , network delay can reduce a client 's performance considerable .
The large number of redirects may cause higher latency .
A client looking up a set of terms through 303 may use many requests , even though the first request has already loaded everything there is to know .
When hosting large - scale datasets with the 303 solution , clients may be tempted to download all data using many requests .
We advise to additionally provide SPARQL endpoints or comparable services to answer complex queries on the server directly , rather than to let the client download a large set of data via HTTP .
Note also , that both 303 and Hash can be combined , allowing a large dataset to be separated into multiple parts and have an identifier for a non-document resource .
An example for a combination of 303 and Hash is :
http://www.example.com/bob#this
Bob , the person with a combined URI .
Any fragment identifier is valid , this in the above URI is a suggestion you may want to copy for your implementations .
Conclusion .
Hash URIs should be preferred for rather small and stable sets of resources that evolve together .
The ideal case are RDF Schema vocabularies and OWL ontologies , where the terms are often used together , and the number of terms is unlikely to grow out of control in the future .
Hash URIs without content negotiation can be implemented by simply uploading static RDF files to a Web server , without any special server configuration .
This makes them popular for quick - and - dirty RDF publication .
URIs of the bob #this form can be used for large sets of data that are , or may grow , beyond the point where it is practical to serve all related resources in a single document .
303 URIs may also be used for such data sets , making neater - looking URIs , but with an impact on run-time performance and server load .
If in doubt , follow your nose .
4.5 . Cool URIs
The best resource identifiers do n't just provide descriptions for people and machines , but are designed with simplicity , stability and manageability in mind , as explained by Tim Berners - Lee in Cool URIs do n't change and by the W3C Team in Common HTTP Implementation Problems ( sections 1 and 3 ) :
Simplicity .
Short , mnemonic URIs will not break as easily when sent in emails and are in general easier to remember , e.g. when debugging your Semantic Web server .
Stability .
Once you set up a URI to identify a certain resource , it should remain this way as long as possible .
Think about the next ten years .
Maybe twenty .
Keep implementation - specific bits and pieces such as .php and .asp out of your URIs , you may want to change technologies later .
Manageability .
Issue your URIs in a way that you can manage .
One good practice is to include the current year in the URI path , so that you can change the URI - schema each year without breaking older URIs .
Keeping all 303 URIs on a dedicated subdomain , e.g .
http://id.example.com/alice , eases later migration of the URI - handling subsystem .
4.6 . Linking
All the URIs related to a single real - world object — resource identifier , RDF document URL , HTML document URL — should also be explicitly linked with each other to help information consumers understand their relation .
For example , in the 303 URI solution for Example Inc. , there are three URIs related to Alice :
http://www.example.com/id/alice
Identifier for Alice , the person
http://www.example.com/people/alice
Alice 's homepage http://www.example.com/data/alice
RDF document with description of Alice
Two of them are Web document URLs .
The RDF document located at http://www.example.com/data/alice might contain these statements ( expressed in N3 ) :
< http://www.example.com/id/alice> foaf : page < http://www.example.com/people/alice>; rdfs:isDefinedBy < http://www.example.com/data/alice>; a foaf : Person ; foaf : name " Alice " ; foaf : mbox < mailto:alice@example.com > ; ...
The document makes statements about Alice , the person , using the resource identifier .
The first two properties relate the resource identifier to the two document URIs .
The foaf : page statement links it to the HTML document .
This allows RDF - aware clients to find a human - readable resource , and at the same time , by linking the page to its topic , defines useful metadata about that HTML document .
The rdfs : isDefinedBy statement links the person to the document containing its RDF description and allows RDF browsers to distinguish this main resource from other auxiliary resources that just happen to be mentioned in the document .
We use rdfs : isDefinedBy instead of its weaker superproperty rdfs:seeAlso because the content at / data / alice is authoritative .
The remaining statements are the actual white pages data .
The HTML document at http://www.example.com/people/alice should contain in its header a < link > element that points to the corresponding RDF document :
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " lang= " en " > < head > < title > Alice 's Homepage </ title > < link rel=" alternate " type=" application / rdf+xml " title= " RDF Representation " href = " http://www.example.com/data/alice "
/> </ head > ...
This allows RDF - aware Web clients to discover the RDF information .
The approach is recommended in the RDF / XML specification ( [ RDFXML ] , section 9 ) .
If the RDF data is about the Web page , rather than an expression of the information in it , then we recommend using rel= " meta " instead of rel= " alternate " .
The client also can deduce similar link information directly from the HTTP headers : that a thing is described by a Web document which can be found at the end of a 303 redirect ; that the Content - Location resource is a content - specific version of the generic document , and more .
Ontologies for these relations are not discussed here .
The following illustration shows how the RDF and HTML documents should relate the three URIs to each other :
4.7 . Implementing Content Negotiation
The W3C's Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group has published a document that describes how to implement the solutions presented here on the Apache Web server .
The Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies [ Recipes ] mostly discuss the publication of RDF vocabularies , but the ideas can also be applied to other kinds of small RDF datasets that are published from static files .
However , especially when it comes to content negotiation , the Recipes document does n't cover some important details .
Content negotiation is a bit more difficult in practice because of mixed - mode clients that can deal with both HTML and RDF , such as Firefox with the Tabulator extension .
These browsers announce their ability to consume both RDF and HTML through Accept headers that use q ( quality ) values :
Accept : application / rdf+xml;q=0.7 , text / html
This browser accepts RDF with a q value of 0.7 and HTML with a q value of 1.0 ( the default ) .
This means the browser has a slight preference for HTML over RDF .
Now , a client preference for HTML does n't necessarily mean that every server should send HTML .
The server has to look at the client 's preferences , and then it must make a decision based on the quality of the different variants it could offer .
For example :
If the HTML variant is a simple low - quality rendering of the RDF , like a property - value table or a list of triples , then the server should send the RDF , unless the client has a very strong preference for HTML .
If HTML and RDF variant contain the same information , and both are of high quality , then the server should treat both variants with equal preference , and leave the choice to the client 's preferences .
If the RDF variant is only a part of the information offered in the HTML , or is scraped from the HTML , then the server should probably send the HTML , unless the client has a strong preference for RDF .
There are algorithms for choosing the best match by comparing client preferences with the quality of the server 's available variants .
For example , the Apache server can be configured with server - side qs values that specify their relative quality .
A qs value of 1.0 for application / rdf+xml and 0.5 for text / html , would mean that the HTML variant has only approximately half the quality of the RDF and might be appropriate in the first case from the list above .
If the HTML is a news article and the RDF contains just minimal information such as title , date and author , then 1.0 for the HTML and 0.1 for the RDF would be appropriate .
To determine the best variant for a particular client , Apache multiplies the client 's q value for HTML with the configured qs value for HTML ; and the same for RDF .
The variant with the higher number wins .
Apache 's documentation has a section with a detailed description of its content negotiation algorithm [ ApCN ] .
HTTP 's Accept header is described in detail in section 14.1 of the HTTP specification [ HTTP - SPEC ] .
Content negotiation , with all its details , is fairly complex , but it is a powerful way of choosing the best variant for mixed - mode clients that can deal with HTML and RDF .
5. Examples from the Web
Not all projects that work with Semantic Web technologies make their data available on the Web .
But a growing number of projects follow the practices described here .
This section gives a few examples .
ECS Southampton .
The School of Electronics and Computer Science at University of Southampton has a Semantic Web site that employs the 303 solution and is a great example of Semantic Web engineering .
It is documented in the ECS URI System Specification [ ECS ] .
Separate subdomains are used for HTML documents , RDF documents , and resource identifiers .
Take these examples :
http://id.ecs.soton.ac.uk/person/1650 URI for Wendy Hall , the person http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/wh HTML page about Wendy Hall http://rdf.ecs.soton.ac.uk/person/1650 RDF about Wendy Hall
Entering the first URI into a normal Web browser redirects to an HTML page about Wendy Hall .
It presents a Web view of all available data on her .
The page also links to her URI and to her RDF document .
D2R Server is an open - source application that can be used to publish data from relational databases on the Semantic Web in accordance with these guidelines .
It employs the 303 solution and content negotiation .
For example , the D2R Server publishing the DBLP Bibliography Database publishes several thousand bibliographical records and information about their authors .
Example URIs , again connected via 303 redirects :
http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/dblp/resource/person/315759
URI for Chris Bizer , the person http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/dblp/page/person/315759
HTML page about Chris Bizer
The RDF document for Chris Bizer is a SPARQL query result from the server 's SPARQL endpoint :
http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/dblp/sparql?query=
DESCRIBE+\%3Chttp\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de
\%2Fdblp\%2Fresource\%2Fperson\%2F315759\%3E
The SPARQL query encoded in this URI is :
DESCRIBE < http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/dblp/resource/person/315759 >
This shows how a SPARQL endpoint can be used as a convenient method of serving resource descriptions .
Semantic MediaWiki is an open - source Semantic wiki engine .
Authors can use special wiki syntax to put semantic attributes and relationships into wiki articles .
For each article , the software generates a 303 URI that identifies the article 's topic , and serves RDF descriptions generated from the attributes and relationships .
Semantic MediaWiki drives the OntoWorld wiki .
It has an article about the city of Karlsruhe :
http://ontoworld.org/wiki/Karlsruhe the article , an HTML document http://ontoworld.org/wiki/_Karlsruhe the city of Karlsruhe http://ontoworld.org/wiki/Special:ExportRDF/Karlsruhe RDF description of Karlsruhe
The URI of the RDF description is less than ideal , because it exposes the implementation ( php ) and refers redundantly to RDF in the path and in the query .
A much cooler URI would be for example http://ontoworld.org/data/Karlsruhe , as it allows content negotiation to be used to serve the data in RDF , RIF ( Rule Interchange Format ) , or whatever else we think of next .
6. Other Resource Naming Proposals
Many other approaches have been suggested over the years .
While most of them are appropriate in special circumstances , we feel that they do not fit the criteria from Section 3 , which are to be on the Web and do n't be ambiguous .
Therefore they are not adequate as general solutions for building a standards - based , non-fragmented , decentralized Semantic Web .
We will discuss two of these approaches in some detail .
6.1 . New URI Schemes
HTTP URIs already identify Web resources and Web documents , not other kinds of resources .
Should n't we create a new URI scheme to identify other resources ?
Then we could easily distinguish them from Web documents just by looking at the first characters of the URI .
For example , the info scheme can be used to identify books based on a LCCN number : info:lccn/2002022641 .
Here are examples of such new URI schemes .
A longer list is provided by Thompson and Orchard in URNs , Namespaces and Registries [ TAG - URNs ] .
Magnet is an open URI scheme enabling seamless integration between Web sites and locally - running utilities , such as file - management tools .
It is based on hash - values , a URI looks like this :
magnet :?xt=urn:sha1:YNCKHTQCWBTRNJIV4WNAE52SJUQCZO5C .
is an open URI scheme enabling seamless integration between Web sites and locally - running utilities , such as file - management tools .
It is based on hash - values , a URI looks like this : .
The info : URI scheme is proposed to identify information assets that have identifiers in existing public namespaces .
Examples are URIs for LCCN numbers ( info:lccn/2002022641 ) and the Dewey decimal system ( info : ddc/22/eng//004.678 ) .
is proposed to identify information assets that have identifiers in existing public namespaces .
Examples are URIs for LCCN numbers ( ) and the Dewey decimal system ( ) .
The idea of Tag URIs is to generate collision - free URIs by using a domain name and the date when the URI was allocated .
Even if the domain changes ownership at a later date , the URI remains unambiguous .
Example : tag:hawke.org,2001-06-05 : Taiko .
is to generate collision - free URIs by using a domain name and the date when the URI was allocated .
Even if the domain changes ownership at a later date , the URI remains unambiguous .
Example : . XRI defines a scheme and resolution protocol for abstract identifiers .
The idea is to use URIs that contain wildcards , to adapt to changes of organizations , servers , etc .
Examples are @ Jones.and .
Company /(+phone.number ) or xri://northgate.library.example.com/(urn:isbn:0-395-36341-1 ) .
To be truly useful , a new scheme must be accompanied by a protocol defining how to access more information about the identified resource .
For example , the ftp:// URI scheme identifies resources ( files on an FTP server ) , and also comes with a protocol for accessing them ( the FTP protocol ) .
Some of the new URI schemes provide no such protocol at all .
Others provide a Web Service that allows retrieval of descriptions using the HTTP protocol .
The identifier is passed to the service , which looks up the information in a central database or in a federated way .
The problem here is that a failure in this service renders the system unusable .
Another drawback can be a dependence on a standardization body .
To register new parts in the info : space , a standardization body has to be contacted .
This , or paying a license fee before creating a new URI , slows down adoption .
In such cases a standardization body is desirable to ensure that all URIs are unique ( e.g. with ISBNs ) .
But this can be achieved using HTTP URIs inside an HTTP namespace owned and managed by the standardization organization .
Independent of standardization body and retrievability , pending patents and legal issues can influence the adoption of a new URI scheme .
When using patented technology , implementers should verify that a Royalty - Free license is available .
The problems with new URI schemes are discussed at length in URNs , Namespaces and Registries .
6.2 . Reference by Description
" Reference by Description " radically solves the URI problem by doing away with URIs altogether : Instead of naming resources with a URI , anonymous nodes are used , and are described with information that allows us to find the right one .
A person , for example , could be described by name , date of birth , and social security number .
These pieces of information should be sufficient to uniquely identify a person .
A popular practice is the use of a person 's email address as a uniquely identifying piece of information .
The foaf : mbox property is used in Friend of a Friend ( FOAF ) profiles for this purpose .
In OWL , this kind of property is known as an Inverse Functional Property ( IFP ) .
When an agent encounters two resources with the same email address , it can infer that both refer to the same person and can treat them as one .
But how to be on the Web with this approach ?
How to enable agents to download more data about resources we mention ?
There is a best practice to achieve this goal : Provide not only the IFP of the resource ( e.g. the person 's email address ) , but also an rdfs : seeAlso property that points to a Web address of an RDF document with further information about it .
We see that HTTP URIs are still used to identify the location where more information can be downloaded .
Furthermore , we now need several pieces of information to refer to a resource , the IFP value and the RDF document location .
The simple act of linking by using a URI has become a process involving several moving parts , and this increases the risk of broken links and makes implementation more cumbersome .
Regarding FOAF 's practice of avoiding URIs for people , we agree with Tim Berners - Lee 's advice : “ Go ahead and give yourself a URI .
You deserve it ! ”
7. Conclusion
Resource names on the Semantic Web should fulfill two requirements : First , a description of the identified resource should be retrievable with standard Web technologies .
Second , a naming scheme should not confuse things and the documents representing them .
We have described two approaches that fulfill these requirements , both based on the HTTP URI scheme and protocol .
One is to use the 303 HTTP status code to redirect from the resource identifier to the describing document .
One is to use “ hash URIs ” to identify resources , exploiting the fact that hash URIs are retrieved by dropping the part after the hash and retrieving the other part .
The requirement to distinguish between resources and their descriptions increases the need for coordination between multiple URIs .
Some useful techniques are : embedding links to RDF data in HTML documents , using RDF statements to describe the relationship between the URIs , and using content negotiation to redirect to an appropriate description of a resource .

They 're all still planets .
So it goes with the human brain and gender .
While males and females might sometimes act as though they come from different planets , a new study in flies suggests the brain is largely unisex .
By artificially triggering the neurons responsible for singing — normally a male only activity - researchers have made female flies play their first tune .
Male flies work hard to convince females to mate with them , often by showing a talent such as sticking out one wing and vibrating it to produce sound .
Earlier studies had identified the neurons responsible for the male singing behavior but it seemed that females had that circuit too , even though they do n’t sing .
“ The mystery at the root of our study is the neuronal basis of differences in male and female behavior , ” said Gero Miesenböck at the University of Oxford .
“ Anatomically , the differences are subtle .
How is it that the neural equipment is so similar , but the sexes behave so differently ? ”
To answer that question in the flies , the researchers used a special technique they developed in which the singing circuit could be turned on in either males or females with a simple flash of light .
First , they confirmed the connection between that circuit and the courting behavior in males .
When they triggered the same circuit in members of the opposite sex , the otherwise quiet female flies immediately began acting like males .
“ They just stuck out their wing and started singing , ” Miesenböck said .
However , the rookie females did sing off key .
“ If you look carefully , the females do sound different , ” he said .
“ They have a different pitch and rhythm and are n’t as well controlled . ”
He thinks those distinctions probably stem from real , if subtle , differences between the male and female brains , not from a lack of practice .
Nevertheless , the findings in flies suggest that the circuits for maleness are present but dormant in females .
In an earlier study in mice , other researchers found that females took on masculine behaviors when a particular pheromonal cue was blocked , suggesting that male behavior is actively repressed in the rodents .
“ In flies , you do n’t see a spontaneous emergence of male behavior when you block pheromonal cues , ” he said .
“ Rather , it requires an artificial trigger .
Female flies have the program , but they seem to lack the activating command .
Either way , the principle is the same [ in flies and mice ] : males and females are not as different as you might think . ”
The new findings suggest that flies must harbor key nodes or “ master switches ” that set the whole system to the male or female mode , according to the researchers .
Their next goal is to find those controls .

THE Spanish navy has seized an American treasure - hunting ship it suspects of stealing more than $ A570 million worth of gold and silver from a sunken Spanish galleon .
A navy corvette blocked the path of the Odyssey Explorer after it left the safety of Gibraltar , and threatened to open fire when the captain refused to let officers board .
The warship , flanked by vessels from the Spanish Civil Guard , escorted the Odyssey Explorer to the Spanish port of Algeciras so police could search it .
If it 's possible to assemble a piece of IKEA furniture without cursing at the top of your lungs , I 've never seen it happen .
There 's always a missing piece of hardware , an unclear spot on the instructions , or an excruciating amount of hex wrenching to be done .
The next time you ball your fists mid-assembly and curse all things Swedish , though , try to calm down .
After all , IKEA 's just another charity trying to get by .
Wait , what ?
You read that correctly ; IKEA 's technically a charity .
But before you write down the umlaut - riddled name of your most recent dresser purchase as a charitable donation on your next tax return , it 's worth exploring this ownership structure , which was brought to light by a 2006 article in The Economist .
Ingvar Kamprad founded IKEA in Almhult , Sweden in 1943 when he was just 17 years old .
Kamprad originally sold low - priced consumer goods from his home and by mail , but added a furniture line in 1948 .
As the company began opening its trademark sprawling stores , Kamprad grew fabulously wealthy , although he retained frugal tastes like driving an aging Volvo and always flying economy class .
By some debated estimates , Kamprad is the world 's richest man , and even Forbes ' more conservative accounting pegs him as the seventh - richest person in the world with a net worth in the neighborhood of $ 31 billion .
Why can't anyone agree on how much Kamprad 's worth ?
Well , for one he does n't technically own IKEA anymore .
In 1982 , his ownership stake in the company was given to the newly formed Stichting Ingka Foundation , a Dutch charity .
The foundation in turn administers the stores through Ingka Holdings , a wholly owned subsidiary that operates as a for - profit company .
With an estimated endowment of over $ 36 billion in 2006 , the Stichting Ingka Foundation is arguably the world 's largest charity .
The charity 's stated goal is " to promote and support innovation in the field of architectural and interior design , " surely a noble aim , but it 's unclear how generous its support is .
It 's been confirmed that the foundation has given 1.7 million Euros a year to Sweden 's Lund Institute of Technology for some time , but even that amount seems fairly tightfisted in light of its gigantic endowment .
In other words , if you 're an aspiring architect waiting for some financial support from IKEA , you 're probably better off getting a job as a cashier at one of their stores than hoping for a grant .
So what 's going on here ?
It would seem that the entire charitable foundation is a clever , if dubious , way for IKEA to avoid paying taxes .
In 2004 , the company pulled in a 1.4 billion euro profit , but since it 's owned by a tax - exempt charity , it did n't pay a dime .
Moreover , the Byzantine structure of for - profit holding companies nestled within non-profit charities effectively safeguards Kamprad from any sort of outside takeover bids for his housewares behemoth .
The five - member board of the foundation , which is headed by Kamprad , is the de facto management for all of the IKEA stores .
All of this sounds pretty clever , but if the stores are all owned by a charity , how can Kamprad and his family make any cash off of them ?
Maybe he 's doing all this out of the goodness of his heart after all , right ?
The company 's been just as clever in that regard , too .
If the Stichting Ingka Foundation is really just a giant piggy bank , it 's got a rather sizable hole in it .
While the charitable foundation owns the IKEA stores , it does n't own the IKEA trademark or concept .
These items belong to Inter IKEA Systems , a private , for - profit Dutch company .
Inter IKEA
Systems collects hefty franchise fees from each IKEA store ; according to The Economist , these fees amounted to 631 million euros in 2004 .
However , thanks to a convoluted multi-national system of ownership here , too , the company ended up paying a scant 19 million euros in taxes on this huge sum .
Who owns Inter IKEA Systems and its maze of parent companies ?
Nobody knows .
Since they 're private companies incorporated in various locations , their ownership is kept secret , and IKEA 's certainly not about to spill the beans .
It would seem reasonable to suggest that Kamprad probably owns it .
Should we really be surprised , though ?
These are the same people who can make a dresser that weighs just ten pounds , fits in a box the size of a deck of cards , and sells for four dollars .
Just remember , when you scarf down a two - dollar plate of Swedish meatballs after buying furniture , you should n't feel ashamed for pigging out .
Instead , hold your head up high and know that you 've made your contribution to charity today .
( Wait , you have some sauce on your chin .
You 'll probably want to wipe that off first . )
“ Self - Made in America ” a book by John McCormack , suggests that if you are investing less than 25 % of your income then you are n’t serious about becoming wealthy .
But how do you afford to do this without suffering ?
The answer is here .
You can do this by eliminating waste and impulse spending from your spending habits .
Studies have shown that the average person blows around 25 % of their income in these two totally unnecessary areas ; waste spend and impulse spending .
Let ’s see what these two types of unnecessary spending are and how to eliminate them .
First I will define waste spending .
There are two main types of waste .
Firstly waste is when you spend more money than you need to in order to get the result that you want .
Secondly waste is when you buy more than you need in order to get the result that you want .
Here are two examples around food .
An example of Type 1 Waste would be buying a sandwich for lunch for $ 5 when you could have made the same sandwich at home , and brought it with you , for only 50 cents .
You are paying ten times the true value of that sandwich by buying it ready made .
You probably also spent more time standing in line to be served than the time you would have required to make the sandwich at home .
An example of Type 2 Waste is when you buy more food than you need and then have to throw it away .
Because you could n’t be bothered taking the time to calculate the amount that you really needed you overspent on your food bill .
Read
The facts are that people are regularly guilty of both type 1 and type 2 waste on a regular basis , and not just with food .
They tend to buy without asking for discounts and they over buy in all areas of their life .
Now let ’s define impulse spending .
Impulse spending is when you buy something that you had no intention of buying until you saw it by chance .
It is no coincidence that supermarkets put chocolate bars and magazines next to the checkouts .
They are there because the supermarket is well aware of the profit potential for them from impulse spending .
Impulse spending does not enhance your lifestyle .
You are simply buying something just because you saw it and quite often you do n’t even really want nor need these items .
I was amazed to discover that most books purchased are never read .
In fact the statistics are that 80 % of books purchased are never even started and half of those that are started are never finished , People buy books on impulse , usually because they are attracted to the title and the cover design .
The main areas of impulse spending are sweets and magazines and anything that is “ on sale ” .
People also tend to impulse spend in their areas of interest or hobbies .
Young women will impulse spend on clothes , shoes and makeup .
Musicians will impulse spend in the music shop , and so on .
If you can eliminate waste spending and impulse spending then , if you are like the typical American , you will free up around 25 % of your income that you can put to investing .
But how do you cure yourself of these costly habits ?
You can do this easily by developing two new habits .
New Habit Number 1 :
The self - made rich decide in advance where and how they are going to spend their money .
The average person spends their money randomly as the urge seizes them .
Deciding where you money is going to go , while you are still at home , eliminates impulse spending .
Making a conscious decision as to the value you will receive for each dollar spent will help eliminate waste spending .
Develop the habit of deciding , on pay day , where your money is going to go , write this down and then read over it and ask yourself if any of that planned expenditure is in the waste spending category .
When you are going shopping take a list and stick to the list .
This will help remove the impulse spending habit .
Developing the habit of deciding in advance where your money will go is a great way to ensure that you still maintain your quality of life in the present , but you free up money for investing so that you can become rich and enjoy a much greater quality of life in the future ,
New Habit Number 2 :
The self made rich have the habit of writing down every cent that they spend , as they spend it , so that they are fully aware of where their money is going .
The average person is surprised when their money runs out because they were not fully aware of how much they where spending .
As a result , bad money managers find that they have too much month at the end of the money whereas good money managers find that they have too much money at the end of the month .
Develop the habit of recording your expenditure as you spend it .
Become fully aware of where your money is going and always ask yourself if this particular transaction is going to truly enhance your life or not .
If the answer is no then do n’t go through with that transaction .
Developing these two simple habits will free up a surprising amount of money for you to put to investing .
So how should you invest that money in order to maximize your profits ?
Unfortunately this article is long enough already so that secret will have to be revealed on another day .
Political correctness elevates sensitivity over truth .
– Bill Maher
You Americans can be so silly sometimes .
Take the latest flare - up of political correctness in your sports world .
Kelly Tilghman , the Golf Channel anchor who during Friday ’s broadcast from the Mercedes - Benz Championship said while discussing Tiger Woods ’ dominance that young players on the PGA Tour should “ lynch him in a back alley , ” was suspended two weeks Wednesday for the remark .
The move came after a wave of outrage that included a call for her to be fired by civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton and despite a statement from the Woods camp saying , “ It is a complete non-issue . ” ( Story )
Let ’s see if we can sort this out .
One possibility is that Sharpton , the Golf Channel and any number of other people think that Tilghman was serious .
That she was literally suggesting that other golfers drag Tiger ’s uppity butt into an alley , string a rope through the fire escape , and hang him by the neck until he stops thrashing .
Makes a certain degree of sense , of course – after all , he is married to a white woman and his habit of thumping his betters on the course makes clear that he does n’t know his place .
Might be a good idea to send a message to any other Negroes thinking about taking up the White Man ’s Basketball .
Is there a history of racism with this reporter ?
Is there some larger context that would lead us to believe she uttered the L - word with malicious intent ?
If so , good for the Golf Channel .
The last thing a civilized society can tolerate is open race - baiting by members of the press .
Even the sporting press .
But if there were such evidence against Tilghman , you ’d think it would have been presented by now , would n’t you ?
The other possibility is that America has now become so sensitive to the blight of racism within its borders that it can no longer tolerate any word that a cynical grandstander might be able to twist , misconstrue and decontextualize for personal gain .
Hence the good Rev. Sharpton making a show of riding in to rescue Tawana Brawley Tiger Woods .
Interesting question , given that it took him roughly eight seconds to jump on Lynchgate but months to notice the plight of the Jena 6 .
If , in fact , we have this much to fear from the careless use of words , there ’s only one thing to do : purge the language of offensive terminology .
Today .
I encourage you to do your part , and you can begin by writing to the editors at Merriam - Webster , one of the nation ’s most prominent hate - speech profiteers .
Additionally :
The L - word should never be uttered again , under threat of civil penalty .
This , unfortunately means that Denver Broncos safety John L**** will need to change his name immediately .
We must call for a boycott of financial services provider Merrill L**** until such time as they stop promoting their racist agenda via the dog - whistle pejorative in their name .
For the love of God , will somebody do something about L**** burg , Virginia and the Klan ’s favorite party punch , the L**** burg Lemonade ?
There ’s more , because the L - word is n’t the only bit of potentially offensive racist code in the language .
For instance :
Spade :
As in , “ call a spade a spade ” or “ in spades ” or “ spade flush ” or “ hand me that spade so I can dig up these infernal weeds in my petunia bed . ”
Once upon a time the S - word was a nasty racial epithet and not everyone knows that the origins and uses of these terms have nothing to do with race .
We ca n’t risk the offense that might arise from misunderstanding .
Spook :
Or the other S - word .
It ’s historically been used to refer to ghosts and spies , and can also connote startlement – as in , “ the horse always spooked when it came near the stream . ”
However , as with the previous S - word , it has been also been employed by racists to denigrate African - Americans .
Black : Forgive me if I seem extreme in my zeal to rid the world of misunderstanding , but can we even refer to the color black without connoting all the injustice and horror that has been visited upon American “ blacks ” over the past 400 years ?
As Ossie Davis astutely noted in his famous essay , “ The English Language is My Enemy , ” even casual , everyday references to color make clear that white is good and black is bad .
So not only do we need to come up with new , non-offensive words for “ black , ” we need to steer clear of “ white , ” as well .
Slave :
Please tell me you do n’t need this one explained to your dumb ass , okay ?
Obviously this is just a start .
But we do owe a debt of gratitude to Sharpton and the Golf Channel for their enlightened , good - faith efforts to move America forward .
Say what you want about the dearth of professional opportunity available for African - Americans , about the appalling state of education in their communities , about the poverty and enduring stigma of living in a culture where your skin color marks you as less intelligent and less capable , perhaps even branding you as a genetically programmed criminal .
The only reliable way to assure a nation where all are truly equal is to thoroughly regulate the speech of sports reporters .
We know this to be true , because we have seen firsthand the power that comes from excising offensive words from our language .
Just last July the NAACP held a public ceremony where they buried â€ œthe N - word .â€ 
And there was never racism in America again .
The growing movement to host a presidential debate focused on science has reached a new milestone .
The organizers of Science Debate 2008 have set a date , April 18 , and a venue , the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia .
With the details firm , the four remaining presidential candidates Democrats Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton along with Republicans John McCain and Mike Huckabee , have received their invitations .
There is no word yet on which candidates plan to attend , but we 'll keep you updated as ( we hope ) the RSVPs come in .
Wired.com has expressed public support for Science Debate 2008 , joining a long list of other institutions that believe the candidates ' ability to set smart policies on scientific issues is a key component of their fitness for the presidency .
For more background on Science Debate 2008 , you can check out our previous coverage here on Wired Science and a longer article from Sarah Lai Stirland , Wired.com 's crack political reporter .
Sarah had a great quote from Lawrence Krauss , a physics professor at Case Western , noting the host of science - based topics that have serious policy significance–stem cell research , climate change , science education , and biotechnology .
( And Loretta , I 'm sure , would add the future of space exploration ) .
UPDATE ( 1:50 pm ) : I left Mike Gravel and Ron Paul off my shortened list of " the remaining " presidential candidates .
They are still running , but were not invited to the debate .
I 'm sorry , Paul fans .
I struck through the " the " .

The careers of two of Africa 's most prominent politicians - Robert Mugabe and Nelson Mandela - have striking similarities .
Both were born in an era when white power prevailed throughout Africa , Mandela in 1918 , Mugabe in 1924 .
Both were products of the Christian mission school system , Mandela of the Methodist variety , Mugabe of the Catholic .
Both attended the same university , Fort Hare in South Africa .
Both emerged as members of the small African professional elite , Mandela a lawyer , Mugabe a teacher .
Both were drawn into the struggle against white minority rule , Mandela in South Africa , Mugabe in neighbouring Rhodesia .
Both advocated violence to bring down white - run regimes .
Both endured long terms of imprisonment , Mandela , 27 years , Mugabe , 11 years .
Both suffered the anguish of losing a son while in prison ; and both were refused permission to attend the funeral .
But whereas Mandela used his prison years to open a dialogue with South Africa 's white rulers in order to defeat apartheid , Mugabe emerged from prison bent on revolution , determined to overthrow white society by force .
Military victory , said Mugabe , would be the " ultimate joy " .
Even after seven years of civil war in Rhodesia in which at least 30,000 people died , when the opportunity to gain power through elections was on offer , Mugabe expressed his disappointment that he would be denied the kind of power that military victory would have given him .
Power for Mugabe was not the means to an end but the end itself .
This year Mandela celebrates his 90th birthday , acclaimed around the world as one of the great leaders of his time , while Mugabe battles on grimly after 28 years of power in Zimbabwe like an 18th - century prizefighter blinded by his own blood - and the blood of many others .
Yet the early years of Mugabe 's rule seemed so full of promise .
Instead of the angry Marxist ogre that the white minority had feared , after winning the 1980 election Mugabe appeared as a model of moderation , pledging to work for reconciliation and racial harmony .
Even the recalcitrant white leader , Ian Smith , who had previously denounced him as " the apostle of Satan " , now found him " sober and responsible " .
Western governments lined up with offers of aid .
In its first year of independence , Zimbabwe was awarded £ 900 m in aid , enabling Mugabe to embark on ambitious programmes of education and health development .
The white population , too , benefited from growing economic prosperity .
Given large increases in commodity prices , white farmers - the backbone of the economy - became ardent supporters of Mugabe 's government and his ruling Zanu - PF party .
" Good old Bob ! " they cheered .
But Mugabe 's black political opponents fared less well .
Within weeks of gaining power in 1980 , Mugabe set out to crush political opposition in Matabeleland and establish a one - party state .
The military campaign he unleashed there in the 1980s culminated in mass murder .
As many as 20,000 civilians are estimated to have died .
But it gave Mugabe the total control he had always sought .
In Harare , meanwhile , Mugabe 's inner circle scrambled for property , farms , businesses and government contracts .
Mugabe joined the fray , but his real obsession was not with personal wealth but with power .
Year by year , he acquired ever greater powers , ruling the country through a vast system of patronage , favouring loyal aides and cronies with government positions and ignoring the spreading blight of corruption .
" I am rich because I belong to Zanu - PF , " boasted one of Mugabe 's proteges , a millionaire businessman .
" If you want to be rich you must join Zanu - PF . "
With his one - party system , Mugabe 's tentacles reached into every corner of the land .
One by one , parliament , the state media , parastatal organisations , the police , the civil service and , eventually , the courts , were subordinated to his will .
In dealing with dissidents , his secret police were licensed to harass , intimidate and even murder at will .
By the mid-1990s , Mugabe had become an irascible and petulant dictator , brooking no opposition , contemptuous of the law and human rights , surrounded by sycophantic ministers and indifferent to the incompetence and corruption around him .
Whatever good intentions he had started out with had long since faded .
A land reform programme financed by Britain came to a halt when it was discovered that Mugabe was handing out farms intended for peasant resettlement to his own cronies .
Ordinary people meanwhile suffered the brunt of government mismanagement .
By 2000 , Zimbabweans were generally worse off than they had been at independence : average wages were lower ; unemployment had trebled ; public services were crumbling and life expectancy was falling .
As opposition to his rule mounted , Mugabe struck back with increasing ruthlessness .
His first target was white farmers who , worried about their title to land , had shown signs of supporting a new opposition coalition , the Movement for Democratic Change .
Hoping to bolster his popularity , Mugabe sent gangs of party activists to rural areas to seize control of white - owned farms to distribute to his supporters , but it led only to the collapse of the agricultural industry .
His ultimate objective , however , was to crush all opposition and remain in power for as long as he wanted .
Since 2000 , he has used all the government 's resources to attack his opponents , sanctioning murder , torture and lawlessness of every kind , rigging elections , violating the courts and suppressing the independent press .
In a speech in 2003 , he warned he would use even worse violence if necessary , threatening to act like a " black Hitler " against the opposition .
" If that is Hitler , then let me be a Hitler tenfold .
That is what we stand for . "
The cost of this strategy has been enormous .
Zimbabwe has been reduced to a bankrupt and impoverished state , threatened by economic collapse and catastrophic food shortages .
But still Mugabe fights on .
" No matter what force you have , this is my territory and that which is mine I cling [ to ] unto death , " he said in 2001 .
And he is far from finished .
Though losing control of parliament in last month 's election , he can still rely on party militias , youth groups , war veterans , police and army generals to help him win the next round of the presidential election .
Violence has been Mugabe 's stock - in - trade for more than 30 years .
Indeed he has boasted that he has " a degree in violence " .
It is not a pleasant prospect for Zimbabweans yearning for something better .

Amy Winehouse ’s ‘ Back To Black ’ has replaced Coldplay to become Amazon ’s biggest selling album of all time .
The singer ’s second album , which was released at the end of 2006 , has continued to sell in well despite her personal problems .
The online retailer revealed said that sales of the album doubled last week after the singer was cautioned by police for slapping a man with an open hand .
“ The sales of ‘ Back to Black ’ have been consistently high for the last year and a half and we have seen massive uplifts on the title during periods when Amy Winehouse has commanded many column inches , ” said Julian Monaghan , Head of Music Buying at Amazon .
Monaghan said the publicity from Winehouse ’s tabloid troubles had enabled her music to reach “ a very wide audience ” .
“ She has lead the way in a resurgence of British female music talent and she thoroughly deserves the mantle of the biggest selling album of all time , " he added .
Coldplay ’s 2005 album ‘ X&Y ’ is second in the list , with Keane ’s ‘ Hopes and Fears ’ third .
Other members of the top - 10 include albums by The Beatles , Snow Patrol and Robbie Williams .
Only a few days left to Double your gift
The decision to begin a garden feels a bit like what I imagine the decision to skydive or bungee jump feels like :
You ’re excited !
You have a vision !
You make arrangements for the day you ’ll do the skydiving / bungee - jumping / gardening deed and then it comes , and you approach the edge of the plane door / cliff / plot and suddenly your heart is pumping and all you can think is What .
Have .
I. Done .
Tighten your harness .
Take a deep breath .
You ’ve got a team of trained professionals right behind you : author and small - space gardening expert Marie Viljoen ; Ceci de Corral , the design and installations manager at the rooftop farm and educational center Brooklyn Grange ; and the author and gardener Alex Mitchell .
Here are 23 of their best tips for starting your first garden :
On getting started
1. Just start .
“ Really , just start .
Buy a pot .
Buy potting soil , ” says Viljoen .
You ’ll already be halfway to a garden by the time you decide what to plant in it .
2. Read up .
“ Educate yourself on the veggies you are choosing and their needs , ” de Corral says .
She learned the hard way that the tomato plants on the Brooklyn Grange , which get full sun , were extremely happy , while the tomatoes in her shady backyard refused to bear fruit .
And that said …

3 . Take notes , and look back on them every season .
This is one of de Corral ’s biggest tips : Learn from your mistakes and successes ; get yourself a journal and take careful note of what does and does n’t work .
You ’ll not only have a record of what you grew every year , but you ’ll also be able to track your progress ( and only plant winners ) .
4 . Seek out help from resources .
“ Ask questions at your nursery or reach out to companies like Brooklyn Grange ! ” says de Corral .
Others have recommended local extension services or master gardeners .
A brick - and - mortar nursery ( and the people who staff it ) is one of Viljoen ’s favorite resources .
5 . And use your neighbors as resources .
Mitchell advises looking at the gardens around your neighborhood : “ Chances are , that ’s what will grow well in your garden too . ”
6 . Know your conditions , but do n’t be intimidated by them .
At first , de Corral was nervous that growing would be harder or harsher or less successful or more taxing in an urban environment .
“ But as it turns out , the basics are still the same : Plant a seed , make sure it ’s getting adequate light and water , let nature do the rest , ” she says .
7 . That includes your soil .
This is especially important if you live in a city , says Viljoen , who tends an impressively productive garden in her Brooklyn backyard .
Get your soil tested !
This will help guide you toward what to plant ( or not ) .
In addition to the mineral and chemical composition , learn whether it ’s wet or dry , sandy or clay - rich .
On what to grow
1. Learn your aspect .
That ’s the direction — north , south , east , or west — your garden faces , says Viljoen .
And that will affect the kind of light your garden will get , and what will grow well there .
2. Embrace the power of threes .
“ Over the years I ’ve discovered that planting one of everything looks messy , ” says Mitchell — even if you ’re aiming for a relaxed - looking garden .
“ You get a lot more impact if you select a handful of great plants and repeat them throughout the garden in groups of three . ”
( Bonus : Choosing only a handful of plants means fewer disparate plant needs to juggle . )
3 . Let the labels lead you .
“ The labels [ on seed packets and seedlings ] are there for a reason , ” says Mitchell .
“ If it says a plant ‘ requires full sun ’ and you only have a shady patch under a fire escape , choose something else .
If it is n’t ‘ frost hardy , ’ do n’t expect it to sail through a snowstorm . ” o
4 . But do n’t be discouraged by shade .
“ I learned you can grow runner beans with just four hours of sun , ” Viljoen says .
Many herbs will do well , too .
Just because tomatoes wo n’t grow in shade does n’t mean lots of other things wo n’t .
5. California poppies have been deeply rewarding for Mitchell .
“ Sown once , never forgotten , ” she says .
“ They come back year after year , popping up in unexpected places , and are such a gorgeous saturated orange . ”
( Nota bene : Make sure you have the right climate for them ! )
6 . Daily pick - your - own salad can be yours .
Greens are one of Viljoen ’s favorite things to grow — and they grow quickly , which means near - instant gratification .
“ Last year , I was gathering daily arugula and mustard , ” she says .
7. Strawberries do very well — even in pots , even in the shade , says Viljoen .
If you have sun , look for everbearing strawberries , which produce fruit all summer .
If you have more shade , look for Alpine strawberries like fraises des bois , which are tiny shade - adapted strawberries .
On keeping it alive
1 . There ’s a reason — and a solution — for every problem .
“ And it ’s usually much easier to fix than you think , ” says de Corral .
“ Do n’t be intimidated !
Look at your struggling basil plant as an opportunity to learn that basil likes light and humidity , or your yellowing greens to research the importance of nitrogen in soil . ”
2 . Make the roots feel at home .
As soon as you transplant something — that is , move it from a pot to a plot of soil or vice versa , water it , says Viljoen .
3 . Do nothing .
Well , not nothing , but a hands - off approach , one in which nature takes the reins , is a good one , advises Mitchell .
Watch carefully :
You ’ll learn what ’s growing well in the spot where you ’re hoping to plant your garden , and then you can make plans from there .
And you may be surprised : “ That boring bunch of twigs in December may turn into a beautiful flowering shrub in the spring .
Do n’t chop things down before you ’re absolutely sure they ’re not going to do something lovely at some point in the year . ”
4. Drainage , drainage , drainage !
“ Do n’t forget to make drainage holes in pots , ” pleads Mitchell .
Most plants in pots need a place for extra water to go ; this will prevent against drowning them .
Choose pots that already have drainage holes , or poke them out yourself .
5 . Err on the side of under -watering .
“ If you ’re under - watering , the plant tells you immediately , ‘ Hey , I ’m droopy , give me water ’ , ” says Viljoen .
“ Other way around , you do n’t realize until it ’s almost too late . ”
On enjoying it
1. Concentrate on completing one manageable task rather than trying to tackle the whole garden at once , says Mitchell .
“ It ’s easy to go out into the garden and feel overwhelmed , then drift around doing lots of things not very well — weeding a bit here , pruning a bit there . ”
Instead , tackle one smaller thing fully and well .
Mitchell recommends planting a container or sowing a row of lettuces .
2. Remember that learning the hard way can be the best way to learn , says de Corral .
You ’re going to kill some plants .
It ’s OK .
Next year , you ’ll kill fewer plants , and the next year , fewer :
You ’re not likely to put tomatoes in full shade again once you realize that they ’re not so successful there .
3 . Let it go .
“ Remember nature never stands still , ” says Mitchell , and therefore , “ your garden will never be perfect . ”
Embrace this , but do n’t focus on it : Instead of focusing on the things that do n’t work , devote time to and derive joy from the things that do — “ and your garden will be a place of pleasure not pain ! ”
4 . Think of your garden the same way you ’d think of a relationship with a person , says Viljoen .
“ If you take it for granted , it ’s going to go south pretty quickly .
They need the gardener every day . ”

Clinton has already won enough pledged members to meet the 20 percent threshold required to vote out a minority report .
Clinton convention strategy in doubt
If the fight over whether to count the results in Florida and Michigan makes it to the Democratic National Convention , Hillary Clinton will not have enough pledged votes on the 169 - member Credentials Committee to deliver a majority decision in her favor , according to an analysis conducted for Politico .
Her only hope of getting the key committee to vote out a “ majority report ” supporting her position rests on her ability to persuade an as - yet - undetermined number of the 25 members appointed to the committee by party Chairman Howard Dean to cast votes for her position .
Advertisement
The DNC ’s Credentials Committee consists of 144 pledged members ( Florida and Michigan are not included ) plus the 25 party leaders and elected officials appointed by Dean .
The 25 Dean appointees include a mix of Dean loyalists , Obama supporters and at least several individuals who have endorsed Clinton .
" If the formal process of seating a delegation cannot be resolved , " a Clinton senior adviser said , " those 25 will be important . "
The analysis was conducted by Matt Seyfang , an attorney and a former delegate counter for past Democratic presidential candidates including Bill Clinton in 1992 to Bill Bradley in 2000 .
According to his projections and a calculation of the number of committee seats that each candidate is entitled to based on their proportion to the statewide vote or the relevant caucus rules , Obama holds roughly 65 seats and Clinton 56 .
There are slightly more than 23 seats still to be decided in the remaining contests .
Seyfang ’s findings reveal that Clinton faces an uphill battle if , as she signaled on Saturday , her campaign decides to take her fight to seat the Florida and Michigan delegations to the Credentials Committee .
“ I have no intention of stopping until we finish what we started and until we see what happens in the next 10 contests and until we resolve Florida and Michigan , ” she told the Washington Post .
“ And if we do n't resolve it , we 'll resolve it at the convention — that 's what credentials committees are for . ”
While it is mathematically impossible for Clinton to win a majority without winning over a number of Dean ’s appointees , it is also highly unlikely that Barack Obama will have enough votes to capture a majority without doing the same .
He would need to sweep the remaining contests by runaway margins to win the roughly 20 seats necessary to gain a majority .
Clinton has , however , already won enough pledged members to meet the 20 percent threshold required to vote out a minority report , meaning that both Democratic candidates could have their positions voted on by all seated convention delegates .
The prospect of a convention that begins with a contentious vote on a “ minority ” or “ majority ” report is “ the nightmare scenario , ” according to one Democratic party insider .
Neither campaign tracks projections on Credentials Committee seats , according to aides charged with the arcane process of counting delegates .
The DNC also does not track these totals but relies on state parties to report their totals as they are determined .
Adding to the confusion surrounding the Credentials Committee , a subject that has perplexed many party veterans , is the fact that Democrats have not found themselves studying the minutiae of convention rules since 1980 .
Since then , convention votes , including those in the Credentials Committee , have been pro forma .
Clarification : The Democratic National Committee 's Credentials Committee consists of 186 members who cast 183 votes when Florida and Michigan members are included in the count .

Given that three of us were also obviously dykes , or at least local weirdoes , you might have caught on that we were entertaining visitors .
But no , you struggled masterfully , albeit unsuccessfully , to hide your disdain for our friends from Ohio .
Your undertone snide comments were not unnoticed , my friend .
Next time , make those comments while you 're in the kitchen .
Saying things like " you people are horrible " in a perky bright voice is bad form , to say the least .
Fucking unforgivably rude is more like it .
For your information , miss i'm - too - young - to - remember - the - plague - years , that ancient ( over 50 ) woman from Ohio who ordered too much food and was loud and annoying to you comes out here to meet up with us because we took care of her son while he was dying a dozen years ago .
The same son she drove to New York so he could attend the first year of Harvey Milk High .
The same son she came out to once he was 16 .
The son who died a month before his 22nd birthday .
She 's been at the forefront of what passes for a gay rights movement in Ohio , and has stood up so that pathetic little twinks like you can walk down the street in your aberzombie and felch uniforms and hold hands .
And even with what you acted like , she still tipped you 20 % , because she remembers her son working in a similar restaurant , and his struggles with money .
Next time someone who does n't fit your personal tastes comes into your restaurant , perhaps you might try some compassion , or even just some human respect .
Remember the word diversity ?
It applies to you and your tiny narrow mind as well .

Ah , spring !
When a gentleman 's fancy turns to Mac cloning !
Like ZDNet 's Jason Perlow .
... I have to think that this whole idea of commercially produced Mac Clones has legs ...
Ah , so Perlow 's a leg man .
Well , Jason , the Macalope 's not sure what you 're into but , just so you know , these particular legs are likely to be of the short , stumpy variety .
But despite all the lusting , is this relationship meant to be ?
Sure , cloners were able to legally have their way with Windows , but OS X ain't that kind of girl .
She 's gonna put up a fight .
There is the obvious difference here that Apple owns Mac OS X and the rights to the hardware platform it runs on , whereas IBM had a non-exclusive license from Microsoft which prevented a loophole from being closed , but to use the hackneyed phrase -- when there is a will , there is a way .
There are certainly going to be more attempts to create unlicensed Mac clones .
The problem is , who wants to buy a computer running an unsupported operating system from a company that has the life expectancy of a fruit fly ?
I have always said that it made absolutely no sense that Apple backed off from the prospect of cloned systems .
And the Macalope has always said that the water fountains at ZDNet must be served with lead pipes .
How easy is it ?
Well , along with legal copies of Mac OS X and a special EFI firmware emulator for PC BIOS - based equipment and instructions how to put it all together it does n't really require any more effort than what it would have typically taken a PC homebrewer to assemble their own DOS or Windows - based white box 10 or 15 years ago .
Hmm .
The Macalope likes your American ingenuity , Jason , but he's not hearing the words that brings this sleazy scenario to its tacky nadir : steampunk casemod .
Think about it .
If you want a clone Mac or a " Hackintosh " that badly , you can have one , for just a small amount of effort and a very modest cash investment in a relatively generic PC motherboard , processor , RAM , video card and case with power supply assembled from an ever - growing list of compatible parts .
Rob Griffiths might disagree with the " small amount of effort " part .
Here 's what he went through :
After all of the parts arrived at my home , it took a few hours to build the machine .
...
But building the hardware is actually the easy part of the process .
...
Next , I installed Vista on the PC , just to be sure everything worked .
From there , it then took many more hours to get OS X working right -- while the process is relatively straightforward , there are a lot of steps involved , and BIOS settings to tweak .
If you want to run Windows and OS X on the same drive , there are more hoops to jump through to get it all working .
But after many hours of reading , assembling , disassembling , screaming , installing , uninstalling , reinstalling , saying bad words , pestering friends , and generally not having very much fun , I was done : my machine was up and running , and capable of booting into either Windows Vista or Mac OS X 10.5.2 .
Jason , the Macalope decrees your pimp name to be " Sugar - Coatin ' Perlow " .
But over at ZDNet , hope springs eternal :
In all likelihood , you probably can run it on the PC you have now ...
That 's true !
But , in the Macalope 's case , that 's because the PC he has now is a Mac .
You see , time being money , this colossal exercise is only economically worthwhile if your only opportunity cost is the hours you 'll lose from your job as a fry chef down at the DQ .
Oh , you 'll need to be your own support person , and it will probably be more than a little bit messy , but if you are determined to " screw the man " so to speak , than a private citizen can effectively do whatever the heck they want without any interference at all from the Evil Fruit .
Who burned the Reichstag ?
Why , Steve Jobs burned the Reichstag , of course .
Jason 's just having a little fun , but when did the computer company with the 7 % market share become the Great Satan ?
Do n't get me wrong , Ubuntu Hardy Heron is nice and all , but a Mac OS X I could easily and legally install on any random $ 500 - $ 700 Dell or Taiwanese special from Costco or Wal - Mart ?
OK , the Macalope may be an ungulate , but he still does n't like it when other people make him throw up in his own mouth .
It 's baffling how someone could get through an entire article and neglect to address one simple question : what 's in it for Apple ?
Attracting homebrew Linux users ?
No offense , Jason , but that 's not exactly the gold ring of desktop computer market share .
This is not business analysis .
This is technology fantasy porn .
And Apple 's just not that into you .
All things being equal , the brown and furry one would much rather steal market share from Windows than Linux .
The Macalope has a lot of respect for the neck - bearded Linux gnomes who solder and compile long into the night .
Sure , they 're cheap , but they live by a noble , if smelly and hirsute , code .
And the Macalope loves the idea of three viable desktop alternatives really competing against each other .
In any event , licensed Mac cloning is simply not going to happen .
The experience from the mid '90s is that licensees do n't increase sales , they rob sales from Apple .
And the amount of money to be made on licensing is never going to be greater than the sales of Apple hardware lost .
That leaves unlicensed cloning which will never be really mainstreamed because of the obvious legal , technical and , well , moral implications .
Sadly , this wo n't stop some fevered imaginations from going on and on about how very , very hot it gets them .
Ew , indeed .
Strange creatures are taking over the NASA computers .
It would make a bizarre story if it was little green men hacking into computers , Asgard style .
Alas and Alack , it 's just weird little red ants that love living in computers .
Anything really , they do n't make ant hills , they make do with whatever is around .
And the warm fuzzy interiors of computers seem to be a choice spot for these Carribean ants .
With the rather fruity and mellow name of Crazy Rasberry , these fiesty creatures seem to be taking over everything .
It 's not just the Johnson Space Centre that 's decrying an attack of bugs ; the whole surrounds seem to be suffering from a siege of ants .
The ants have been causing all kinds of trouble in five Texas counties in the Gulf Coast area .
Because of their sheer numbers , the ants are short - circuiting computers in homes and offices , and knocking systems offline in major businesses .
When IT personnel pry the affected computers open , they find the machines loaded with thousands of ant bodies .
Reminds you of the computers mentioned in Discworld , does n't it ?
The young white shark spent five months at the Monterey Bay Aquarium , in a million - gallon exhibit that was beginning to feel like a fish bowl .
So he became antsy and began to jump , as if to beg his handlers for freedom , and like mother birds they delivered him offshore and punted him from the nest .
Smartly , the junior apex predator chose a southbound journey toward warmer climes ; he swam beyond Southern California deep into Mexico .
His is a realm without borders ; he requires no passport .
Advertisement
Nor does he need a parent or guardian ; though young , he possesses white shark instincts honed over millions of years .
But he is young , and still small .
He measured only 5 feet 10 and weighed 140 pounds when set free Feb.
5 , wearing high - tech tags that may allow scientists to shadow him through much of the summer .
Years from now , if he can avoid serious trouble , he ’ll attain a great white size of perhaps 18 feet and 4,000 pounds .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , what an incredible adventure life must be .
Like the previous white shark released after a lengthy aquarium stay , this one rounded Cabo San Lucas off Baja California ’s tip and entered the Sea of Cortez .
But he took a more direct approach and arrived much quicker , and his tags are longer - lived so scientists may learn much more this time around .
“ We ’re like , ‘ Go shark , go ! ’ ” says Salvador Jorgensen , a researcher with the Tagging of Pacific Pelagics program at Stanford University ’s Hopkins Marine Station .
“ It ’s really exciting .
But we ’re also biting our nails a little bit because he ’s just wandering through these heavily fished areas . ”
Stanford is the aquarium ’s lead partner in the white shark research program .
Scientists , with the help of partners at Long Beach State and the Southern California Marine Institute , have learned that Eastern Pacific white sharks spend about three years eating fish in the Southern California bight , or off Baja and maybe in the Sea of Cortez .
Advertisement
After that they begin a new life phase .
They develop different teeth , designed to kill elephant seals and other pinnipeds .
They gravitate either to Northern California or Guadalupe Island , 150 miles west of Baja , where they spend late - summer and fall near seal rookeries .
Extensive tagging of adult white sharks at both locations has shown they migrate each winter either to the Hawaiian Islands or a vast and featureless gathering place halfway to Hawaii , referred to as the White Shark Cafe .
It ’s not known why but perhaps mating is involved .
Nor is it known whether Northern California sharks mingle with Guadalupe sharks , but there ’s no evidence of a Northern California shark visiting Guadalupe , or vice - versa .
Advertisement
And , it is not known to which group the juvenile shark now exploring mainland Mexico near Mazatlan will ultimately belong .
But his is an important mission : to help scientists identify critical nursery habitats that “ are the key to learning how best to build protection for these animals , ” says Barbara Block , principal investigator with the TOPP project .
Because he ’s already at the southernmost known range of juvenile white sharks , scientists anticipate he will turn north and begin to explore the Sea of Cortez .
When the archival tag pops free July 2 -- the second tag is a positioning unit with a longer life span -- it ’ll reveal the shark ’s diving habits and temperature preferences .
Advertisement
( The previous shark ventured 300 miles west upon release and was 700 miles offshore at one point during his southbound journey .
He spent daytime near the surface but by night remained at an average depth of 250 feet . )
What tagging studies cannot reveal , however , can only be imagined .
The latest shark took a more coastal route .
He bypassed Baja ’s large lagoons , where thousands of Pacific gray whales were wintering or embarking on the long journey back to Arctic home waters .
Did he come face - to - face with creatures so large , and what might his reaction have been ?
Advertisement
He undoubtedly probed many of the peninsula ’s cavernous dark reefs , which are home to territorial groupers with mouths equally cavernous and dark .
At virtually every turn were gargantuan sea lions , curious , powerful and voracious ; future items of sustenance but for now something to steer clear of .
As for other sharks , they have hammer - shaped heads and monikers such as Tiger and Bull ; hardly your choir - boy types .
But the most serious threat is the same to all swimming creatures of the region : a minefield of invisible gill - nets and baited longline hooks , which have depleted Mexico ’s sharks over the years .
Advertisement
This juvenile knows something about indiscriminate fishing gear , though , having been caught in a net off Ventura last summer .
His life was spared when he was donated to the aquarium , and for 162 days he served as ambassador for his species , to more than 650,000 human visitors .
His message was simple : “ We ’re not savage killers as you may have been led to believe , thanks to sensational movies such as ‘ Jaws . ’
Rather , we ’re vital members of the marine ecosystem , just trying to survive . ”
No other shark , it seems , has tried harder .

Alaska offers a variety of hunting opportunities , many of them world class .
The options include taking kids grouse or hare hunting along back roads in the Interior , filling the freezer with muskox , or conducting a once - in - a - lifetime brown bear or mountain goat hunt in the Southeast rainforest or along the Southcentral coast .
Some species , such as caribou and moose , are widely distributed across much of the state .
However , depending on the month , animals may be scarce even where good habitat exists , but abundant elsewhere .
Many big game species in Alaska make long migrations between their seasonal ranges .
The keys to hunting successfully are careful planning and thorough preparation .

IF Britain wants to pay more than £ 15 for a DVD player then it may as well just go ahead and boycott the Beijing Olympics , the prime minister said last night .
Mr Brown stressed that although the Chinese had failed to exert their influence in a bid to halt the violence in Darfur , they had produced a slimline DVD player with a really impressive range of features , for what could only be described as ' silly money ' .
The prime minister added : " It 's multi-region , it 's got progressive scan – whatever that is – and it's got a ' zoom ' function .
For fifteen quid !
" But if you want to go back to the dark days of paying £ 25 or even £ 30 for some piece of stone - age Taiwanese crap , then be my guest . "
Meanwhile China 's 25 million prisoners of conscience have confirmed they will not be attending the summer games , mainly because they are all in jail for not loving communism .
Li Fung - Choo , serving 18 years for whistling a Perry Como song , said : " While the world focuses on China 's failure to intervene in Darfur , I have to admit I 'm slightly more focused on their failure to let me go to the toilet . "
His cell - mate Zhen Lao - Jing , sentenced to life for watching The Color Purple , added : " The Darfur situation is vexing .
I would write a letter , but unfortunately someone has just attached a car battery to my privates .
" But by all means do bring your foreign currency to Beijing and watch some steroid addicts chase each other round a football pitch . "
Phoenix Makes a Grand Entrance
NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander can be seen parachuting down to Mars , in this image captured by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
This is the first time that a spacecraft has imaged the final descent of another spacecraft onto a planetary body .
From a distance of about 310 kilometers ( 193 miles ) above the surface of Mars , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter pointed its HiRISE camera obliquely toward Phoenix to capture this shot .
Phoenix had just opened its parachute 46 seconds earlier , jettisoned its heat shield and was two minutes and 52 seconds away from landing on the Red Planet .
The image reveals the parachute and a dangling Phoenix below .
The cords attaching the spacecraft 's back shell and parachute are faintly visible .
The surroundings look dark , but correspond to the fully illuminated Martian surface , which is much darker than the parachute and back shell .
Phoenix released its parachute at an altitude of about 12.6 kilometers ( 7.8 miles ) .
The HiRISE , acquired this image on May 25 , 2008 , at 4:36 p.m. Pacific Time ( 7:36 p.m. Eastern Time ) .
It is a highly oblique view of the Martian surface , 26 degrees above the horizon , or 64 degrees from the normal straight - down imaging of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
The image has a scale of 0.76 meters per pixel .
This image has been brightened to show the patterned surface of Mars in the background .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems , Denver , is the prime contractor for the project and built the spacecraft .
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment is operated by the University of Arizona , Tucson , and the instrument was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. , Boulder , Colo .

If the typical question for a war supporter is , " How much longer do we stick with an ineffective policy in Iraq ? " the typical response is , " Until we achieve victory . "
The next question , of course , is trying to get a definition of " victory . "
Fred Kaplan explains :
By the administration 's own measures , then , victory in Iraq is not in sight , nor is there much evidence that the road we are treading will lead us toward that destiny .
And yet our president still seems to have little comprehension of what the war that he has spawned is all about . [...]
In his speech at the State Department on Monday , where he restated his goal of achieving " victory , " he also said of the fallen soldiers in Iraq that " one day people will look back at this moment in history and say , ' Thank God there were courageous people willing to serve because they laid the foundations for peace for generations to come . ' "
A wartime president who has no real allies and whose own military is too small to achieve such lofty goals should begin to scale back his rhetoric so that it has at least a patina of plausibility .
By defining victory in Iraq as an outcome that lays " the foundations for peace for generations to come , " George W. Bush ensures that defeat is nearly inevitable .
All the while , of course , John McCain insists that he will deliver more of the same .
Sen .
John McCain has long said he is in robust health and is strong enough to hike the Grand Canyon , but he also is receiving what his staff Monday termed a “ disability pension ” from the Navy .
When McCain released his tax return for 2007 on Friday , he separately disclosed that he received a pension of $ 58,358 that was not listed as income on his return .
On Monday , McCain ’s staff identified the retirement benefit as a “ disability pension ” and said that McCain “ was retired as disabled because of his limited body movements due to injuries as a POW . ”
McCain campaign strategist Mark Salter said Monday night that McCain was technically disabled .
“ Tortured for his country -- that is how he acquired his disability , ” Salter said .
Advertisement
Certain types of military and veterans pensions are either partially or completely tax - exempt , depending on the seriousness of the disability .
In McCain ’s case , the exemption is 100 % .
If McCain had to pay taxes on the full amount of the pension , it would have increased his tax bill by about $ 18,000 based on the percentage of his income he paid to the federal government .
McCain spent 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi .
After he was released in 1973 , he returned home on crutches and began a painful physical rehabilitation .
He later regained flight status and commanded a Navy squadron before retiring from the service in 1981 .
McCain would be the oldest man to enter the White House if he is elected president , and questions have been raised about his health .
Advertisement
McCain has twice developed melanoma , a potentially deadly form of skin cancer .
The fact that he is legally designated with a disability pension may raise further questions .
“ It is a legitimate question to ask about the commander in chief :
Is he fit to serve , ” said Robert Schriebman , a senior Pentagon tax advisor and tax attorney who recently retired as a judge advocate for a unit of the California National Guard .
If McCain can hike across the Grand Canyon , then why should he be getting disability payments from the government that are tax - exempt , Schriebman asked .

McCain shattered his knee and broke both arms when he was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967 .
In his autobiographies , McCain said that his knee still bothered him in cold weather and that he was unable to raise his hands above his shoulders .
Elmo Baker , a retired colonel and president of a Vietnam War POW group , said many former POWs were receiving some type of military pension that was partly or fully tax - free .
Baker said he was receiving payments that were 70 % tax - free , but that he “ did n’t have as many injuries as McCain did . ”
Advertisement
Many of the Vietnam POWs are receiving payment under a program known as “ combat - related special compensation , ” which provides benefits and tax exemptions under a complex system , based on such factors as the type of injury and the years of service .
Paul Galanti , another former POW in the group , said that while McCain ’s injuries were serious enough to qualify him for disability , it would not affect his performance as president .
“ I do n’t know of any physical requirements to be commander in chief , ” Galanti said .
“ He would have a nice car to drive around in and a nice airplane to fly in . ”

Boycotting the Olympics West Afraid to Risk Isolating Beijing
China has done everything it can to present itself in a positive light ahead of the Olympics .
But its crackdown on protests in Tibet are showing the darker side of the regime .
Calls for a boycott , however , are unlikely to succeed as the last thing the West wants to do is push China into isolation .
Scientists are working on new solutions to the ancient problem of maintaining a fresh water supply .
With predictions that more than 3.5 billion people will live in areas facing severe water shortages by the year 2025 , the challenge is to find an environmentally benign way to remove salt from seawater .
Global climate change , desertification , and over - population are already taking their toll on fresh water supplies .
In coming years , fresh water could become a rare and expensive commodity .
Research results presented at the Trombay Symposium on Desalination and Water Reuse offer a new perspective on desalination and describe alternatives to the current expensive and inefficient methods .
Pradip Tewari of the Desalination Division at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre , in Mumbai , India , discusses the increasing demand for water in India driven not only by growing population and expectancies rapid agricultural and industrial expansion .
He suggests that a holistic approach is needed to cope with freshwater needs , which include primarily seawater desalination in coastal areas and brackish water desalination as well as rainwater harvesting , particularly during the monsoon season .
" The contribution of seawater and brackish water desalination would play an important role in augmenting the freshwater needs of the country . "
Meenakshi Jain of CDM & Environmental Services and Positive Climate Care Pvt Ltd in Jaipur highlights the energy problem facing regions with little fresh water .
" Desalination is an energy - intensive process .
Over the long term , desalination with fossil energy sources would not be compatible with sustainable development ; fossil fuel reserves are finite and must be conserved for other essential uses , whereas demands for desalted water would continue to increase . "
Jain emphasizes that a sustainable , non-polluting solution to water shortages is essential .
Renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar , and wave power , may be used in conjunction to generate electricity and to carry out desalination , which could have a significant impact on reducing potential increased greenhouse gas emissions .
" Nuclear energy seawater desalination has a tremendous potential for the production of freshwater , " Jain adds .
The development of a floating nuclear plant is one of the more surprising solutions to the desalination problem .
S.S. Verma of the Department of Physics at SLIET in Punjab , points out that small floating nuclear power plants represent a way to produce electrical energy with minimal environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions .
Such plants could be sited offshore anywhere there is dense coastal population and not only provide cheap electricity but be used to power a desalination plant with their excess heat .
" Companies are already in the process of developing a special desalination platform for attachment to FNPPs helping the reactor to desalinate seawater , " Verma points out .
A. Raha and colleagues at the Desalination Division of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre , in Trombay , point out that Low - Temperature Evaporation ( LTE ) desalination technology utilizing low - quality waste heat in the form of hot water ( as low as 50 Celsius ) or low - pressure steam from a nuclear power plant has been developed to produce high - purity water directly from seawater .
Safety , reliability , viable economics , have already been demonstrated .
BARC itself has recently commissioned a 50 tons per day low - temperature desalination plant .
Co-editor of the journal* , B.M. Misra , formerly head of BARC , suggests that solar , wind , and wave power , while seemingly cost effective approaches to desalination , are not viable for the kind of large - scale fresh water production that an increasingly industrial and growing population needs .
India already has plans for the rapid expansion of its nuclear power industry .
Misra suggests that large - scale desalination plants could readily be incorporated into those plans .
" The development of advanced reactors providing heat for hydrogen production and large amount of waste heat will catalyze the large - scale seawater desalination for economic production of fresh water , " he says .
* This research is published in the International Journal of Nuclear Desalination .
Pee from more than 4,000 volunteers shows that people from different nations often have spectacularly different metabolisms .
The finding could point to new ways to deal with obesity , diabetes , high blood pressure and other health problems , researchers said .
After guts break down food and drink , chemicals left in their urine can reveal a lot about peoples ' bodies and lifestyles .
Urine samples were analyzed from some 4,630 volunteers from the United States , China , Japan and the United Kingdom .
More than 1,000 different molecules were looked at .
Each country turned out very different , metabolically .
" For instance , Chinese and Japanese people are almost identical genetically , which is n't surprising , since they diverged culturally only a few thousand years ago — but they are very different metabolically , " said researcher Jeremy Nicholson , a biological chemist at Imperial College London .
" We know there 's a huge difference in the diseases that different nations risk — broadly speaking , the Japanese tend to die of strokes , the Chinese of heart attacks — and we see those differences reflected in their urine , " he added .
" Of course they 're different in terms of lifestyle — the Japanese tend to eat more fish than the Chinese as a whole do — but their gut bacteria are also very distinct as well . "
Gut microbes help us get energy from our food .
" In your guts , you have about 1.5 kilograms ( 3.3 pounds ) of 1,000 different species of bacteria , " Nicholson explained .
" If you include all the genes from bacteria along with your own , only about 1 to 2 percent of the genes in your body are human , with the rest from the gut microbes .
And what bacteria you have can be quite different from person to person . "
Within countries , there are big differences metabolically also — for instance , between the north and south United States , and between northern and southern China .
At least some of this may be due to cuisine — for instance , wheat is the staple grain in northern China , while rice is the standard in southern China .
" You can even pick out different cities — you can see the differences between Chicago and Corpus Christi , " Nicholson said .
In terms of cardiovascular or heart health , southern China fared the best while Texas did worst .
" Honolulu was right in the middle — that 's ironic , given how Honolulu is also roughly in the middle geographically between Asia and America , " Nicholson said .
The investigation not only looked at chemicals known to be linked with certain disorders , but also discovered hitherto unknown links between certain molecules and diseases .
For example , no one had known that a compound known as formate was connected with any disease , " and formate turned out to be strongly linked with blood pressure , " Nicholson said .
" So this approach might lead to ways to predict or prevent high blood pressure based off formate . "
In the future , urine might help shed light on diabetes , atherosclerosis , obesity and even cancer , he added .
The scientists detailed their findings online April 20 in the journal Nature .
Mr Miliband said he was taking the reports very seriously
Miliband 's reaction
The council is " deeply concerned " about its staff 's safety after its employees were interviewed by security services and a director was detained by police .
Mr Miliband said the Russian ambassador in London would meet the head of the diplomatic service over the issue .
" Any intimidation or questioning of officials is completely unacceptable . "
The British Council says it is " deeply concerned " for the safety of its staff , after its employees in Russia were called in for interviews with the FSB security service - and some were visited by Interior Ministry officials at their homes late on Tuesday .
Litvinenko row
Meanwhile , St Petersburg office director Stephen Kinnock was followed , stopped and released by authorities on Tuesday .
Mr Kinnock - son of former Labour leader Neil - was held by the side of the road on Tuesday night and accused of going up a one - way street the wrong way and of smelling of alcohol .
The British Consul in St Petersburg came to pick him up an hour later .
Our main concern is the safety and security of both our Russian and UK staff
British Council
UK stance on Lugovoi case
The St Petersburg British Council office closed on Wednesday because all Russian staff have been summoned by the Russian authorities .
The British Council has been at the centre of a row between Russia and the UK , part of an ongoing dispute over the death of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko , who was poisoned in London .
Russian authorities have ordered offices outside Moscow to shut - Britain has refused .
Mr Miliband said Tuesday had seen " productive " discussions between British diplomats and Russian authorities in Moscow .
But he said : " We 've also heard last night and today very serious reports of intimidation and harassment of British Council officials , obviously we take that very seriously indeed . "
' Completely legal '
He said he would meet the chief executive of the British Council to discuss the matter later and the Russian ambassador would meet the head of the British diplomatic service .
Mr Kinnock was detained by police in St Petersburg
Mr Miliband argued that cultural exchange between the two countries was a good thing and that the council 's work was " completely legal " and Britain would defend its staff 's integrity .
And he said the only losers , should the offices shut , would be the Russian people and the reputation of the Russian government .
The British Council , which aims to promote cultural and educational ties , has been accused of violating Russian tax rules .
The row comes on top of ongoing tensions over the death of former KGB officer Mr Litvinenko in London in November 2006 .
He had been given a fatal dose of radioactive polonium 210 .
Retaliatory measure
The UK wants Russia to hand over businessman Andrei Lugovoi , whom UK investigators suspect of murdering Mr Litvinenko .
When Russia refused to extradite Mr Lugovoi , Britain expelled four Russian diplomats and Moscow followed suit .
Russian officials have described the action against the British Council as a retaliatory measure .
On Wednesday , a British Council spokesman said Russian staff in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg were " summoned for interview by the FSB at their headquarters and subsequently visited in their homes late last night by officials of the Russian Ministry of the Interior " .
They have been called to more interviews on Wednesday , he said .
" Our main concern is the safety and security of both our Russian and UK staff and we are deeply concerned by both these incidents , " he added .
Conservative former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC the episode had " absolutely nothing " to do with the British Council and was rooted in " the very strong reaction of President Putin " to British attempts to extradite the man suspected of murdering Mr Litvinenko .
By Jim Baxter , NMA President
Jennifer Muir of the Orange County Register did a little digging at the California DMV and found that thousands of state employees have special license plates that are not traceable for enforcement purposes .
The recipients are primarily involved with enforcement activities , although for many that ’s a stretch .
The rationalization is that they need untraceable plates to protect themselves from vengeful criminals .
As it turns out the “ confidential plates ” also protect the holders from traffic tickets , parking fines , road tolls , and other unpleasantries of life .
They are just one more example of our two tiered society where the farmers , clerks , merchants , mechanics and homemakers are held to the letter of the law while the police , courthouse residents , and elected officials have “ professional courtesy . ”
Our system was based on the ideal that everyone is to be held to the same standard , be equally responsible for our actions and that there not be an anointed elite with privileged status .
Granted , this is an “ ideal ” and ideals are something we strive for knowing that perfection is usually not achievable .
Still , when a glaring and pregnant contradiction to the ideal is so apparent and malignant , as is “ professional courtesy , ” why is it so readily ignored ?
Jennifer Muir ’s exposé uncovered a program that has existed for three decades and was certainly obvious to our “ representatives , “ those in positions of power .
Of course they too were attracted to confidential license plates .
For as long as traffic laws have been enforced there has been professional courtesy among police officers .
Cops do n’t give tickets to other cops .
Why is that ?
If these laws have merit and it ’s to everyone ’s benefit that these laws be obeyed why are n’t the enforcers held accountable ?
Cops do n’t let other cops rob , kidnap , or murder — what ’s up with traffic laws ?
Could it be that many of these laws are not necessary , constructive , or fair , and the police inherently know this ?
Is it that many of these laws and their enforcement are more about making a buck for the sponsoring governments than they are about public safety ?
Perhaps the ultimate solution to professional courtesy is to trim back the laws to those the cops will enforce against other cops and see how that works out .

The Sarasota Herald - Tribune 's column today on the awful Sarasota , FL , Supervisor of Elections , Kathy Dent --- and the criminal complaint against her outrageous , unlawful Election Day , in - precinct campaigning against a 2006 ballot initiative to ban touch - screen voting machines in the county ( the initiative passed , despite her best efforts , and carefully placed brochures on voter sign - in tables ! ) --- is so good that I do n't want to quote from it .
I want you to read it .
As the Herald - Trib describes , as revealed in Dent 's interview conducted by the Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement , concerning her inappropriate ( and illegal ) placement of pro-touch - screen brochures in polling places , Dent admits she was aware of a voter 's complaint about it , but ignored it " because she had assumed it was from ' one of the activists ' that had been criticizing her and her machines . "
The FDLE report on the matter , including their interview with the apparently - pathological Ms. Dent , as referenced in the column as " good reading " , may be downloaded here [ PDF , 16 mb ] .
Dent , of course , is the woman who also presided over the FL - 13 U.S. Congressional election that same year , when 18,000 votes disappeared in her county only , and only on her precious , now - banned , ES&S Ivotronic touch - screen machines , as the Republican Vern Buchanan reportedly edged out Democrat Christine Jennings by just 369 votes .
If the linked column does n't give you enough of an idea of what a horrible , anti-democracy villain Dent really is , perhaps the following lovely , 30 - second phone message --- left on the voice mail of Tallahassee ' Election Supervisor ( and democracy hero ) , Ion Sancho , moments after he appeared on a Fort Myers radio show , heard in Sarasota , in which he was asked about , and praised , the Sarasota citizen ballot initiative to do away with the touch - screens --- will give you some idea :
Sancho adds that Dent was also scheduled to appear on the same program , but begged off , likely after she'd heard that he would also be a guest .
Though when he got off the air and checked his cell phone messages , he found she 'd called immediately after the program .
So she was apparently available to listen to it , at least , even if she did n't have the courage to come on and defend her views .
We hope to have more soon on Dent and this case --- for which she 's ( incredibly ) been exonorated by the FDLE --- in the not - too - distant future .
CORRECTION / UPDATE :
We originally characterized the phone call from Dent to Sancho , posted above , as being in regard to the FL - 13 election fiasco .
In fact , Dent 's call to Sancho was made prior to the '06 Election , in reference to his radio interview comments on the Election Reform initiative , as now explained above .
We touched base with Sancho just now , and he had some additional thoughts about Dent and her inappropriate campaign to defeat the initiative in question .
Said Sancho : " This woman knowingly campaigned against an initiative on the ballot .
If she wanted to do that , at a minimum , she should have formed a political action committee to do so .
Supervisors of Elections do n't give up their right to free speech , but they have to follow the law , particularly if they wish to influence anything on the ballot . "

About No Debt Plan : From my about page :
My name is Kevin and I author this blog .
I write No Debt Plan to help readers eliminate debt , learn how to budget and save , and move themselves towards financial freedom .
I began writing on personal finance in late 2006 on my personal blog , but started No Debt Plan in January of 2008 to give my personal finance articles a permanent , focused home .
* * * * *
Jonathan over at Master Your Card recently asked his readers , “ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? “ .
He gave ten tips on how to achieve becoming a millionaire .
I thought it might be fun to provide the mirror image of those tips .
In short , to show you how to not become a millionaire .
Here goes !
Ten Steps to Avoid Becoming a Millionaire
Accept whatever salary an employer offers .
Negotiating is a hard , scary process .
Do n’t bother with it and just be happy you have a job .
Do n’t try to improve yourself at work .
Stick to the status quo .
Act like you ’re in a union .
Only do what you are told to do .
Ignore naysayers or people warning you of an upcoming layoff .
Never leave the company you work for .
Unless you are fired or laid off , do n’t leave your current employer .
Remember , they gave you a shot !
You owe it to them to stick around for as long as possible .
Do n’t track how much you earn and spend .
Budgeting by far is the most difficult thing to do in personal finance .
It takes a lot of time and can expose our true financial selves .
That can be painful .
Just do n’t do it .
Spend more than you earn .
If the credit card company is willing to let you pay off that plasma TV next year , why should n’t you ?
You ’re in your prime !
You can save later and catch up .
It ’ll be easy then .
But for now , that Porsche Boxster , 4,000 sq. ft. house for two , and an exercise machine look mighty fine .
Ignore work benefits .
401 k plan ?
Sounds kind of funny to me .
Why would the company want to give me money ?
Plus , I ’d miss that 3 % in every paycheck .
Honest .
I ’m actually going to write an entire post on this soon , so stay tuned .
Ignore your tax withholdings .
Huge refund checks at the end of the year always save you from financial disaster .
Why would you ever want to change that ?
It ’s so much easier to just get the big check after tax season .
Do n’t open any IRAs .
You ’re already doing that darn 401 k thing — that ’s more than enough !
3 % of your income already hurts .
Plus , does n’t IRA stand for Independent Righteous Arsenal ?
Invest sometime later .
Remember , you ’ve got bills to pay .
There is n’t enough money to sit aside for investing .
Just wait .
You ’ll use next year ’s raise , or wait until the kids move out of the house .
Then you ’ll have time and money .
Saving is complicated .
Those guys on late night TV with the $ 99 investment programs must have gotten it lucky .
Now look at them — making money by sharing their tips with the world .
Hold on .
I ’ll be right back .
I need to go order one .
Phew , that was hard .
Time to go be a couch potato .
Or maybe I ’ll keep sitting here …
Update :
This post has been featured at MSN ’s Smart Spending Blog , has been all over Stumble Upon , and has been linked to by various personal finance sites .

How many more times are we going to hear yet another Republican claiming to have a magic plan to sort out the budget ?
They always talk about it but when they control all branches of Washington , the results spoke for themselves .
It should come as no surprise to anyone that the McCain plan is the latest GOP attempt at spinning America into giving corporate welfare while everyone else pays the price .
Since McCain thinks it ’s so easy , let ’s hear specifics now .
What is he going to cut from the budget ?
Sounds like the latest edition of Republican voodoo economics .
Robert Bixby , executive director of the Washington - based Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan group that advocates budget restraint , said “ the huge imbalance ” in McCain ’s plan “ is that the tax cuts are specific and large and the spending cuts are small and vague . ”
Once , McCain was a deficit hawk , Bixby said , but “ strange things happen when people run for president . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted against adding an amendment to a housing market rescue bill that would have given bankruptcy judges the power to ease mortgage payment terms for some distressed borrowers .
Offered as an amendment by Illinois Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin to a broad bill hammered out earlier this week , the amendment was opposed by Republicans and the banking industry .
The overall bill , estimated to cost $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion , would give homebuilders and other businesses hit hard by the recent housing slump a $ 6 billion temporary tax break .
It would also give the Federal Housing Administration a bigger role in the mortgage market and create additional tax incentives to stimulate the housing business .

Shell U.S. President John Hofmeister
John Hofmeister , the Houston - based president of Shell Oil's U.S. operations , expressed doubt about the validity of peak oil theory in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box show .
" The peak oil theory has really swamped the world .
God bless Matt Simmons , " Hofmeister told CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla , according to a transcript provided to WND by CNBC .
" His assumptions are correct based on his hypotheses , but his hypotheses are too narrow . "
Matt Simmons , a Houston - based investment banker who specializes in the energy industry , is widely known for his 2005 book , " Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy , " in which he analyzed oil depletion data from Saudi Arabian wells .
The peak oil theory argues the world 's oil resources are finite and will be completely exhausted at a future date .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Simmons , one of the most vocal and visible of the peak oil advocates in the industry today , has also been a frequent television guest arguing that the world is running out of oil .
In a recent YouTube.com - archived appearance on Bloomberg TV , Simmons argued the world has hit peak oil now , predicting prices as high as $ 300 a barrel
The peak oil theory , first espoused by Shell Oil geoscientist M. King Hubbert in 1956 , has come under increasing criticism in recent years , as repeated predictions of world oil depletion have failed to match empirical data documenting increasing reserves .
For instance , data produced by the U.S. Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration currently shows 1.3 trillion barrels of proven oil reserves worldwide , more than ever in recorded history , despite a doubling in world oil consumption since the 1970s .
In what has become a contentious worldwide debate over whether peak oil is fact or fiction , Simmons dismisses statistics that are not consistent with his depletion models .
The Energy Information Administration " has been as inept at forecasting oil outlook in both production and prices as anyone , " Simmons told WND in an e-mail , " yet so few ever remember their awful forecasts . "
Hofmeister explained to the CNBC audience why he believed Simmons ' hypotheses were too narrow .
" In other words , Simmons is looking at conventional oil only , " Hofmeister said .
" In the industry , we look at unconventional oil as well . "
RELATED : BP employees may face criminal charges
Unconventional oil is a reference to oil that is not found as crude oil in reservoirs contained in sedimentary rock layers just below the surface of the earth .
An example of unconventional oil is the oil sands in Alberta , Canada , from which oil is produced .
When President Bush took office on Jan. 20 , 2001 , the price of oil was approximately $ 24 a barrel , too low for the oil sands to be converted to oil economically .
But now , with the price of oil hovering near $ 100 a barrel , conversion of the oil sands has become economically feasible .
Canada has become the largest supplier of foreign oil to the U.S. , supplying the U.S. with more than 70 million barrels of oil a month , according to current EIA statistics .
Hofmeister also questioned whether Simmons ' models accurately estimated the probability of new discoveries of previously unknown oil reserves .
" Simmons is also basing his conclusions on a particular study of one country , Saudi Arabia , while there are a whole lot of other reservoirs around the world we 're still discovering , " Hofmeister continued .
" Some day we will peak , but not because we do n't have enough oil . "
For instance , WND recently reported Brazil 's announcement of the discovery of a new ultra - deep offshore oil field in the Atlantic Ocean , containing an estimated 5 to 8 billion barrels of oil , enough to expand the country 's proven reserves by 40 to 50 percent .
Again , Simmons is dismissive .
" The great Brazil find , as best laid out in the February issue of World Oil , is a great example of a handful of extremely expensive , rank wildcat wells finding at least traces of hydrocarbons , " he said .
" But until scores of other wells are both flow - tested and also cored , there is no solid idea of how much oil might ever be recovered , " he continued .
" Given the severe deepwater rig shortage , it might take a decade or more to genuinely test the Santos Basin . "
" I would be delighted to be wrong on all this , " Simmons wrote , " but too much hard data is too specific , and the optimist case is all faith - based theories . "
Brazil disagrees with Simmons ' pessimistic outlook .
Sergio Gabrielli , the chief executive officer of the state - run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA claims the new find off the coast of Brazil may contain as much as 80 billions barrels in oil reserves which Brazil is moving to commercially exploit and further explore right now .
Simmons ' pessimistic focus on oil depletion statistics are today being contested , even by traditional oil industry experts such as Daniel Yergin and his Cambridge Energy Research Associates , or CERA , in Cambridge , Mass .
" This is the fifth time that the world is said to be running out of oil , " Yergin says in industry speeches .
" Each time , technology and the opening of new frontier areas has banished the specter of decline .
There 's no reason to think that technology is finished this time . "
Yergin came to world fame in the oil industry with the publication in 1991 of his now - classic book , " The Prize : The Epic Quest for Oil , Money & Power . "
A Jan 18 press release on the CERA website presents additional data questioning one of Simmons ' key assumptions .
In a study that examined oil depletion data from 811 separate oil fields accounting for about two - thirds of current global production and half of the total proved and probable conventional oil reserve base , CERA concluded the aggregate global decline rate is 4.5 percent , not the 8 percent cited in many studies .
The study , drawing from a source CERA described as " the most extensive field production database in the world , " demonstrated lower decline rates in recent years due to better reservoir management practices and the impact of new technology .
CERA concluded the new data means " no near - term peak oil " is likely , directly countering the predictions of peak oil advocates such as Simmons .
Finally , as WND recently reported , new scientific discoveries have produced important evidence supporting the abiotic theory of the origin of oil .
Scientists have recently reported abiotic liquid hydrocarbons exuding from the mantle of the earth in fissures such as the Lost City Hydrothermal Field on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and abundant abiotic liquid methane found on Titan , the giant moon of Saturn , as found by the Cassini - Huygens mission jointly launched by NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
Traditional petro-geologists have maintained that oil is biological in origin , arising from organic material deposited in sedimentary soil .
The organic theory of the origin of oil has served as a logical underpinning of the tautology at the heart of the peak oil theory .
Only a finite amount of biological material was deposited in sedimentary soil capable of forming oil , so there has to be a finite amount of oil .
The abiotic theory suggests oil is formed naturally in the mantle of the earth by chemical reactions such as are described in the Fisher - Tropsch equations the Nazis developed to make synthetic oil from coal prior to World War II .
The abiotic theory would suggest more deep - earth discoveries of oil should be forthcoming , especially with new technology to find and recover cost - effectively offshore oil .
With more than 70 percent of the earth covered by water , much previously unexplored territory remains to be explored for oil , as ultra - deep drilling technology continues to progress .

Iraq war architect blames Powell for Iraq John Byrne

Print This Email This Blames Powell , Armitage , Bremer , Rumsfeld , Rice
The man who led the office that supplied the Bush Administration with " raw intelligence " on Iraq now says everyone else is to blame but himself .
Douglas Feith , President Bush 's former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy , headed the Office of Special Plans , a secretive outfit which passed along unverified " alternative " intelligence to Administration decisionmakers in the run up to war .
A Senate Intelligence Committee report found that the Office " developed , produced , and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship , which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community , to senior decision - makers . "
In other words , they passed on " intelligence " that was never vetted , much of which appeared to align with a hawkish Administration agenda .
On Thursday , Feith pointed his finger at everyone but himself regarding the war in Iraq .
According to the Washington Post 's Dana Milbank , at a book - launch party for his new book , " War and Decision : Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism , " Feith blamed a laundry list of officials for failing " to challenge the logic of going to war . "
Blames Bush , too " He argued that former secretary of state Colin Powell and his deputy , Richard Armitage , were the ones who failed to challenge the logic of going to war -- not him , " Milbank wrote .
" He suggested that Powell , Armitage , Franks , former Iraq viceroy Jerry Bremer and even Feith 's old boss , Donald Rumsfeld , should be blamed for the postwar chaos in Iraq -- not him .
He blamed then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice for the way she operated ( " fundamental differences were essentially papered over rather than resolved " ) .
He accused the CIA of " improper " and unprofessional behavior .
And he implicitly blamed President Bush for not cracking down on insubordinate behavior at the State Department . "
" Yet at the same time , Feith told the ... crowd that he disapproved of the " snide and shallow self - justification typical in memoirs of former officials , " or what Feith cleverly called the " ' I - was - surrounded - by - idiots ' school of memoir writing , " Milbank continues .
" Feith pointed out that he supported his account with 140 pages of notes and documents .
And yet , in his hour - long panel discussion , Feith seemed to be of the impression that he had , in fact , been surrounded by idiots . "
Feith himself has n't escaped accusations that he was aloof during his time at his Office of Special Plans .
According to Bob Woodward 's Plan of Attack , then - Secretary of State Colin Powell referred to the Office as the " Gestapo " office .
Former CIA director George Tenet called his work " total crap . "
When Feith stepped in to back recruiting a brigade of " Free Iraqi Forces " to enter Iraq with Americans , according to the book Cobra II , " Franks turned to Feith in a Pentagon corridor , letting him know where he stood : ' I do n't have time for this fucking bullshit . "
During his book launch party , Feith ironically remarked , " The CIA and the intelligence community should not be shading intelligence . "
Milbank notes that Feith has been out of touch .
Vaunting his book on " 60 Minutes , " Feith asserted the Administration did n't need to claim Iraq had weapons of mass destruction to invade .
" Pointing so many fingers in so many directions , a man is bound to get confused -- as happened when Steve Kroft asked him on " 60 Minutes " about his claim that the lack of troops contributed to looting in Baghdad , " he adds .
" ' I do n't believe I raised the troop - level issue in that connection , " Feith replied .
Then Kroft presented him with the passage .
" That 's a fair point , ' Feith amended . "
Remarked Milbank wryly , " It must have been very difficult being Doug Feith : correct all the time , and surrounded by idiots . "
From little white lies to nation - destroying omissions , lying has been around as long as the truth .
And while lying has a rich history , the vast majority of humanity , almost all of the time , tells the truth .
And why not ?
It is far easier , creates an atmosphere of trust , and facilitates a stable society .
But every now and again , you get the sneaking suspicion that the person across from you is n't giving it to you straight .
Everyone wants to know how to catch liars in the act ... in fact , while this article has some great tips , you can find even more information in Bust Liars : Become a Human Lie Detector .
This book will tell you everything you need to know about picking up on those subtle hints liars can't help but display .
So how do you tell if you 're being lied to ?
Before we cover that , we have to ask two important questions .
The first question is :
Do you really want to know ?
Some people willingly blind themselves and accept a lie as fact solely because the truth might be too painful to handle .
On the other hand , some people are so desperate to believe that the painful truth is a lie that they will see “ signs of lying ” where none exist .
The first step to discovering a lie , then , is to be aware of your personal feelings about the subject .
In other words , what is your involvement in this possible lie ?
The second question is :
Why would this person lie to you ?
What is at stake here ?
Maybe he is afraid of being punished , or of the loss of the ability to obtain what he desires ( for instance , your business ) , or , ironically , he is afraid he will lose your trust .
In order to really be accurate in spotting a lie , you must be aware of the other person 's motivations for lying to you , including what you might do to him if you knew the truth .
An example of this is a child lying to a parent to avoid being grounded :
He is desperately avoiding the punishment he is certain the truth would bring .
The parent , being aware of this , is in a better position to gauge the child 's lie .
So , you want to know , you 're certain he has a reason and you 've got the feeling that he is hiding the truth ?
Let 's test that theory ... with science !
Know how he talks normally .
The first step to reading a liar 's body language is to know his normal , everyday conversational habits .
This is referred to as someone 's “ baseline ” behavior – normal eye , hand and body movements during a pleasant conversation in which there is no pressure or lying .
This will allow you to detect variations when the lie occurs , without mistaking a naturally awkward or shy person for a chronic liar .
Notice how stress influences his patterns .
It is notoriously difficult to tell the difference between a person who has been put on the spot ( that is , under stress and pressure ) , and an out - and - out liar .
This is because most of the tell - tale signs of lying are based around the fact that telling a lie is a stressful event on the body and mind – it seems humans are not built for distorting the truth , and forcing that situation has recognizable repercussions .
Look for the signs .
This is a list of the most common “ tells ” that people have while attempting to lie .
Again , note that most of these also occur when someone is feeling stressed by the conversation .
Little to no body movement .
People will sometimes “ freeze , ” not quite facing the other person , and will move as little as possible during the lie .
Alternatively , some people will fight this by being overly dramatic , moving the body much more than normal to try and “ sell ” the lie .
No eye contact .
A lot of information is conveyed through eye contact , and most people have an extremely hard time lying to someone while looking directly into his eyes .
Sometimes this will only occur at the moment of the lie , a brief glance at the floor or to the right .
Again , some will try to sell the lie by making and maintaining eye contact fiercely , much more so than usual .
Stress gestures ( rapid blinking , scratching , itching , swallowing , fidgeting , etc. ) .
If discovered , a deception carries much greater risk of punishment than simply telling the truth , and people understand this .
This uncomfortable situation will make them uncomfortable , and they will act accordingly .
Looking up to the right .
Looking up and to the right stimulates the part of the brain associated with imagination ( that is , making things up ) , whereas looking up and to the left stimulates the part of the brain associated with recalling memories ( that is , telling the truth ) .
Touching the nose and covering the face / mouth .
Habits from childhood , these gestures are a subconscious attempt to “ cover up ” the lie , and put distance between the liar and you .
Rise in vocal pitch .
Another product of stress , the liar 's voice will get higher and squeaky .
This should be noticeable if you are familiar with his normal speaking voice .
Wide - eyed , innocent look .
Another product of childhood fibs , based on the “ who , me ? ” fake innocence usually associated with a kid denying he has his hand in the cookie jar while it is still in there .
A noticeable pause in speaking .
Most people lack the ability to come up with a plausible fiction in an instant , so they have to take a moment to think something up .
This results in a pause , usually right before the lie itself , while they desperately reach for something other than the truth .
Careful questioning will reveal variations in their story , as a consistent fiction is hard to remember , whereas actual events are usually easy to recall .
Lying by omission .
Sometimes a lie will happen by not speaking – that is , the liar omits an important piece of information from an otherwise truthful statement .
However , this omission will , in the mind of the liar , poison the “ truthful ” statement , thus rendering it a lie .
The above signs will still be present , with the addition of more obvious signs after he has finished talking .
( An example : After talking in a relatively truthful manner , he falls silent and immediately looks away , covering his mouth and fidgeting . )
Ask .
A risky maneuver , as a person who is telling the truth may be horribly offended .
Sometimes , however , a liar will come clean if given the chance to , as he realizes that continuing to lie when you know he 's doing so would be far worse than just admitting the lie .
Trust your intuition .
Notice I say “ intuition ” and not “ desire . ”
Most people have a pretty decent “ lie detector ” built in , and if you trust it , it can usually point the way .
However , some people may want to believe they are being lied to , and they mistake this desire for “ a gut feeling . ”
So before you start accusing anyone of a lie , make sure you 're not trying to project your desire on an innocent person .
Using the above steps , you should be able to determine the difference between a lie and the truth to a much more accurate degree .
And while we may not have an answer to how to define truth for certain , we will at least be able to tell if the other person feels like he is lying ... and if it feels like a lie , it probably is .
Good luck !
In her latest effort to win votes by changing the color of her spots , Hillary has just announced that she ’s been a lifelong gun nut .
Yes , you heard it right .
The women who led the Million Mom anti-gun March on Washington is now a pistol - packing momma .
“ You know , my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl , ” she said .
“ You know , some people now continue to teach their children and their grandchildren .
It ’s part of culture .
It ’s part of a way of life .
People enjoy hunting and shooting because it ’s an important part of who they are .
Not because they are bitter . ”
Of course , Hillary could n’t let the moment go without a wee bit of parsing :
“ As I told you , my dad taught me how to shoot behind our cottage , ” she said .
“ I have gone hunting .
I am not a hunter .
But I have gone hunting . ”
This is n’t the first time she ’s made the claim – there ’s this from this past February :
“ I have hunted .
My father taught me how to shoot .
I went duck hunting in Arkansas I remember standing there in that cold water it was so cold at first light I was with a bunch of my friends – all men – so the sun is up and the ducks are flying and they were playing a trick on me they were saying were not going to shoot – you shoot they wanted to embarrass me so the pressure was on .
And I shot a banded duck they were as surprised as I was . ”
Now , maybe Hillary ’s telling the truth .
Maybe she stood at the crack of dawn “ in the cold water ” waiting to bag her first bird .
Maybe she ’s a proud member of America ’s gun “ culture . ” Maybe .
But after her extremely detailed , and totally false , Bosnia sniper - fire snafu , I ’d like a little more detail on her latest gun tale before we ’re going to believe that Ms. Gun Control is the new Charlton Heston .
Let ’s revisit Hillary ’s actual history with guns and gun control , which , you ’ll be surprised to find out , involves an awful lot of rewritten history :
ABC , February 2008 ( via MyDD ) :
Gun Control Advocates Call Clinton a Hypocrite … Andy Pelosi of Gun Free Kids , writes , “ quite frankly , there are many gun control advocates that find it distasteful that Clinton appears to be running to the right of Obama on guns . ”
Running for the Senate in 2000 , Clinton appeared before newspaper publishers in May of that year to say that gun control was part of the raison d’etre for her Senate campaign .
CNN , May 2000 : Hillary Clinton renews call for gun licensing and registration
NYT , May 1999 : Hillary Clinton Appeals For Gun Control Lobbying
NJ.com , February 2008 :
Clinton ’s attack is highly ironic , as well , both because she has changed positions on guns even more rapidly than Obama , and because she has one of the strongest gun violence prevention ( GVP ) records of any federal office holder .
To wit : Clinton stated her support for national licensing and registration of all newly purchased handguns in a May 2000 meeting with newspaper publishers , but stated during a debate last month in Nevada that she opposed implementing a national gun licensing registry … ” .
Yeppir , there ’s more than a bit of the pot calling the kettle in Clinton ’s carefully parsed , but transparent and toxic attack .
So , not only is Clinton ’s arithmetic incorrect as to Obama ’s so - called “ rapidly changed position , ” but her own stated stance on gun regulation has both changed dramatically and done so in a much shorter time frame .
No hypocrisy there , right ?
Gail Collins , NYT , February 2008 :
“ Clinton used to be very vocal about gun control when she was running for Senate in New York , but now there ’s nothing about it on her Web site . ”
So now Hillary says she ’s really pro-gun after a life of being one of the most anti-gun politicians on the planet .

China uncovers thousands of illegal land grabs : report
by Staff Writers
Beijing ( AFP ) April 14 , 2008
Chinese authorities uncovered 31,700 cases of illegal land grabs in four months in a crackdown on one of the major factors behind rising social unrest across the country , state media reported on Monday .
The unlawful land grabs were discovered between September 15 last year and January 15 , and led to 2,864 people being punished , Xinhua news agency quoted Zhang Pu of the Ministry of Land and Resources as saying .
Land illegally seized amounted to 224,000 hectares ( 553,000 acres ) in total , according to Xinhua , nearly 60 percent of which was used before getting government approval .
The seizures reflect a widespread problem that sees local government authorities collude with businessmen to force people off their property to make way for lucrative developments .
It is a phenomenon which extends from the cities to rural areas , with residents kicked out of their homes or off their land for little or no compensation .
As part of the crackdown authorities retook or demolished unlawful buildings and seized or fined people a total of four billion yuan ( 570 million dollars ) , Xinhua said .
Human rights activists say corruption is so endemic that the government can do little to solve the problem , even if it genuinely wants to stop the land grabs , which have been a big part of the nation 's modernisation drive .
According to figures from the Ministry of Public Security , there were 87,000 protests across the country in 2005 , up 50 percent from two years earlier , many of them over land grabs .
The amount of land illegally grabbed last year was up 68 percent from 2006 , according to the news agency .

What 's for lunch ?
But there 's a cheaper , faster , better way to satisfy your hardware jones .
Tucked over on the left side of the page , the nerd gnomes in Beacon Hill , Seattle , have embedded an option that blows computer shopping into , well , the clouds .
Click on " Amazon Web Services . "
Key in your Amazon ID and password and behold : a data center 's worth of computing power carved into megabyte - sized chunks and wired straight to your desktop .
Clones of that HP tower cost 10 cents per hour — 10 cents ! — and they 're set to start spitting out widgets as soon as you upload the code .
Virtual quad cores are a princely 80 cents an hour .
Need storage ?
All you can eat for 15 cents per gigabyte per month .
And there 's even a tool for monitoring your virtual stack with an iPhone .
No precious cash tied up in soon - to - be - obsolete silicon , no 3 am runs to the colo cage .
Outsource your infrastructure to Amazon !
There 's a name for this : cloud computing .
Or less poetically , utility computing , or even the unfortunate acronym HaaS , meaning hardware as a service .
Whatever it 's called , Jeff Bezos is loving it .
On a sunny winter day , with Mount Rainier and the Olympic range on spectacular display , the bald billionaire sits in a conference room in the converted VA hospital that serves as Amazon headquarters .
He 's ticking off all the reasons why Amazon Web Services and its industrial - strength suite of online processing power , storage , and other geeky treats are the best thing to come out of the company since 1 - Click .
AWS capitalizes on Amazon 's combination of computational skills and operational savvy .
It piggybacks on a multibillion - dollar IT infrastructure .
And it pulls in a whole new category of customers looking for rock - solid scalable computing on demand — blue - chip startups like Zillow and PowerSet , kids in garages building the next Google , even adventurous corporate IT jocks looking to offload some of the drudgery .
But hold on , Jeff .
Back in the material world of FedEx boxes and holiday wish lists , some 80 million Amazon customers this year are expected to drop $ 20 billion nonvirtual dollars into the Beacon Hill till .
Computer hardware is right up there on the hit parade with Harry Potter novels and boxed DVDs of The Simpsons .
For years , Wall Street and Silicon Valley alike have rolled their eyes at the legendary Bezos attention deficit disorder .
What 's that secret pet project ?
Spaceships !
Earth to Jeff :
You 're a retailer .
Why swap pricey stuff in boxes for cheap clouds of bits ?
Cue one of Bezos ' famed mirth bursts : " That 's a really good question ! "
Honk !
But Bezos being Bezos — ex-hedge - fund quant , cool Seattle Spock to Silicon Valley 's high - flying Captain Kirks — there 's also a really good answer , and it goes something like this :
Do n't get hung up on ecommerce .
Do n't fixate on Amazon Prime , media downloads , or Kindle eReaders .
And never , ever listen to Wall Street .
Because while the pinstripes gnashed their teeth about costs — more than $ 2 billion spent on IT ! —
Amazon was bolting together the world 's broadest , deepest , smartest , most versatile global technology platform , ready for anything from running data centers to delivering cat litter .
Now Bezos ' globe - spanning empire is primed to lead the migration of computing power from the desktop to the Net .
It 's a shift potentially as dramatic as the desktop revolution that another Seattle - area company — often similarly underestimated — rode to power two decades ago .
Jeff Bezos ' aerial department store leafing out into a digital cloud forest .
Amazon , indeed .
If you 're an Amazon customer living between the Golden Gate Bridge and the western edge of the Rockies , there 's a good chance your latest shipment originated in a big box rising from the sagebrush in Fernley , Nevada , a half hour drive up I - 80 from Reno .
If a spreadsheet turned into a building , this would be it : 14 windowless football fields of wide - open concrete .
Inside , it 's a Donkey Kong world of overhead conveyor belts , automated chutes , and robotic tilt trays .

Tom Taylor , an operations maestro visiting from Seattle , reaches toward one of the shelves and pulls out a hefty tome entitled Introductory Physics With Algebra as a Second Language : Mastering Problem - Solving .
It 's lightly used , with a barcode label pasted neatly on the cover .
" The seller could be anybody , " Taylor half shouts through the din and mandatory earplugs .
" You need a scanner to know whose it is . "
Amazon is notoriously tight with operational data .
But the company does provide a few figures , and one shines a light on how far Amazon has come from the old Wal - Mart - in - the - sky concept .
Almost a third of the store 's total number of sales last year were made by people selling their stuff through the Amazon machine .
The company calls them seller - customers , and there are 1.3 million of them .
They 're just one wave of outsiders to have washed over Bezos ' threshold .
The next is already breaking : Web developers itching to make their mark on the Net .
The transformation from storefront to platform happened by evolution rather than design .
It began way back in the dialup dark ages , when Bezos and his crew were looking for a cheap and easy way to expand the store 's reach .
One solution was to let Web developers link directly to Amazon products on their own pages — and give them a 15 percent bounty on sales they generated .
Today that program , Amazon Associates , is the Net 's definitive distributed sales network , turbocharged by the world 's biggest archive of product information , customer reviews , and recommendations .
One spooky Associates service dubbed Omakase — Japanese for " Leave it up to us ! " — offers up Amazon product ads keyed to your site 's content , your audience 's response to earlier ads , and ( gulp ) the specific viewer 's past Amazon purchases .
Google AdSense with a kickback .
Turning other people 's sites into Amazon storefronts set a stage for the next leap : letting outsiders sell their own stuff through Amazon 's platform .
Third - party selling began in 1999 as a jittery response to eBay , which looked smart for avoiding handling things physical altogether .
Amazon 's auctions were a bust , but they kicked off what is now the thriving Amazon Marketplace ( " Sell Your Stuff " ) .
The company earns a cut of up to 15 percent from sellers who opt for plain - vanilla product listings ( " 12 used & new from $ 58.99 " ) .
High rollers can sign up for top - of - the - line Fulfillment By Amazon , which parks their goods on the shelves ( 45 cents per cubic foot per month ) , then slips them into Amazon 's own shipping stream .
If you 're Target or the NBA ( or , until recently , Borders ) , you can sit back and rent a world - class ecommerce operation , from shopping cart to warehouse to delivery .
The rationale for all this , in Jeff - speak , is " totally not abstract . "
Meaning it 's a no-brainer .
" If you 're trying to have not just every book but every out - of - print book , every indie - band CD , and every vinyl record , there 's no way you 're going to do it on your own .
You have to open up . "
That turns out to be harder than it sounds .
When Amazon plunged into auctions , its simple dotcom - era server - and - database combo was already staggering under the combined weight of growing complexity — recommendation engines , transaction tools , a steady rain of new features — and mushrooming traffic .
Beset by problems with speed , reliability , and scalability , engineers first tried migrating the whole hairball to a mainframe .
It did n't help .
Then they gambled on a Net- centric idea just beginning to bubble through the computer science world : loosely joined software modules , each performing a specific function while exchanging information with the others .
Bingo .
Log in to Amazon 's gateway today and more than 100 separate services leap into action , crunching data , comparing alternatives , and constructing a totally customized page ( all in about 200 milliseconds ) .
The new architecture brought a huge improvement — along with an unexpected opportunity .
" We were already building these really incredible , robust services for ourselves , " says Andy Jassy , who wrote the original Amazon Web Services business plan four years ago and has been running the operation ever since .
" It was n't a huge leap to realize they could be valuable to other people . "
Thus Amazon 's next new business : opening not just the store in the sky , but the very silicon and software that keeps it aloft .
Just across Highway 101 from the Googleplex in Mountain View , California , a banner fluttering from a nondescript building heralds yet another high tech dream : Ooyala .
Inside , a dozen software engineers wearing headphones pore over screenloads of code while grazing on M&Ms and organic treats served in plastic tubs .
The three founders , all Google emigres , are chasing a suitably big idea — interactive " hypervideo " with seamlessly embedded links .
What they 're not doing is blowing capital on shiny hardware .
They built their television killer using little more than the desktops in front of them , plus major slices of computing power courtesy of Mr. Bezos .
" You can't execute fast when you 're running to the data center every night to fix machines , " says Ooyala engineering chief Sean Knapp .
" Infrastructure is the big guys ' most powerful asset .
This levels the field . "
Ooyala — that 's " cradle " in India 's Telugu language — epitomizes Amazon 's vision of utility computing .
Last December , Knapp and his crew beat more than 900 other AWS - powered startups in a demo derby , taking home $ 50,000 in cash and $ 50,000 in usage credits .
( Bonus prize : a decommissioned Amazon server plus a gold - painted , Bezos - autographed sledgehammer to bash it with . )
Ooyala joins a who's who of high - profile AWS clients , including Justin.tv , which serves up a half - million live videostreams daily thanks to Amazon hardware .
Real estate site Zillow recalculated the values of 67 million US homes in several massive runs , and the gray old New York Times crunched 150 years ' worth of newspapers into searchable PDFs .
An estimated 10,000 new developers are signing up monthly , with the total closing in on 400,000 .
As New York venture capitalist Fred Wilson Twittered during a brief outage of Amazon 's S3 storage service in February , " amazing how many of the services i use are reliant on S3 . "
Among the temporary casualties that morning was Twitter itself , which stashes user profile images on Amazon 's servers .
Utility computing is Web 2.0 's version of rocket fuel .
" You do n't generate your own electricity , " Bezos says .
" Why generate your own computing ? "
The forces driving online apps —
Internet bandwidth and reliability — also mean that , in terms of data per dollar , servers in your closet or colocation facility can't compete with industrial - scale bits piped in from hundreds , even thousands , of miles away .
Amazon 's developer - customers reap several advantages .
Capital efficiency is one .
( Trendy Mountain View - and Delhi - based startup SlideShare cheekily dubbed one of its presentations " Using S3 to Avoid VC . " )
Another is instant scalability .
AWS users can add or delete server and storage capacity without getting up from their Aerons .
AWS trades heavily on the fact that Amazon itself is the biggest customer .
" We tend to build the things people are asking for internally , " Jassy says .
And the idea that AWS is mostly about wringing extra bucks ( especially off - season ) out of Amazon 's data centers ?
" We 've far exceeded the excess capacity of our internal system , " Jassy says .
" That ship sailed 18 months ago . "
For a company at which operational data is a state secret , that 's a telling detail : AWS is now big enough to be piling up its own silicon .
A museum of Amazon memorabilia decorates the Beacon Hill building 's lobby .
One cabinet enshrines a faded copy of the May 31 , 1999 , issue of Barron's .
" Amazon.bomb , " the cover screams .
Barnes & Noble , then the King Kong of booksellers , had already followed Bezos online .
Wal - Mart was gearing up for a Net offensive , too .
And Amazon 's numbers , Barron 's smirked , were " gimmicky . "
Nearly a decade later , Beacon
Hill is still on top .
" We can live with being underestimated , " Bezos says .
That 's easy to do , for the moment .
Wall Street 's best guesses for AWS 's 2007 revenue do n't even reach $ 100 million — the proverbial pimple amid nearly $ 15 billion in overall sales .
Projections are doubly hard to gauge because a big part of the appeal to Web - focused startups is what Bezos calls " paying by the drink . "
Upload an app that no one uses , and Amazon does n't charge a penny .
Stable startups like widget maker Renkoo talk about spending around $ 1,000 a week on AWS ; storage - heavy customers like photo site SmugMug can push that into five figures .
But there is one indisputably positive indicator , for utility computing in general and maybe for Amazon in particular : the pack of other companies building data centers capable of delivering similar services .
Salesforce.com already offers Force.com , a platform for online business apps .
Storage giant EMC recently paid $ 76 million for the online backup service Mozy .
IBM has a project dubbed Blue Cloud , teed up to launch this spring , that reportedly targets financial services companies .
Then there 's Google , which has amassed a purported motherlode of computing power and bandwidth .
And across Lake Washington there 's Microsoft , orchestrating a global data center buildout .
Bill Gates ' anointed successor as Redmond 's software king , Ray Ozzie , recently credited Amazon with " some fairly provocative , interesting services . "
But he also predicted " big volleys " from the rest of the pack over the next 18 months .
Bezos does n't disagree .
" I 'd be surprised if no one else does this , " he says , pausing for effect .
" It 's a really good idea ! "
And there may be an ace up his sleeve .
Any economist will tell you that a commodity business — storing and processing data , for instance — is a mug 's game , with prices that plunge inevitably toward the cost of production ( in the case of bits , pretty close to zero ) .
That 's music to Bezos ' ears .
" Commodity businesses do n't scare us , " he says .
" We 're experts at them .
We 've never had 35 or 40 percent margins like most tech companies . "
That 's not Amazon 's only edge .
Chasing those fat margins , both Google and Microsoft are building their own Web apps — the same market indie developers can enter on the cheap using AWS .
Sergey and Larry will gladly toss you the API for Google Earth — but if you 're building a better mapping app , Amazon is your place .
And even if Google or Microsoft eventually does embrace utility computing , would anyone building , say , a better search engine want to park their code in Mountain View ?
As VC Fred Wilson suggests , " Amazon is out - Googling Google . "
One sure sign of where things are heading is the flock of geeky enablers circling Amazon 's cloud .
In November , Red Hat released a version of Enterprise Linux tuned for Amazon 's services , opening a trove of 3,000 Red Hat - certified apps to AWS developers .
The Ruby on Rails crowd is all over Amazon 's instant infrastructure , as are communities pushing things like Erlang ( an open source language for parallel processing ) and Hadoop ( an open source equivalent of Google 's core software ) .
Many startups , like Elastra and Coghead , are building first - wave AWS tools to take developers to the next level even faster .
" Web services are part of a tectonic shift , " says Adam Selipsky , who heads the AWS product team .
" Fortress - style software development is history . "
Bezos likes to say that Amazon is a software company at heart .
That has a corollary :
The more open it is , the more powerful it is .
Consumers continue to get the world 's best retail experience .
Long - tail retailers get the world 's best back office , plus shelf space in the mother of all malls .
Developers get a cheap , instant , essentially limitless computing cloud .
And there 's the real disruption .
Instead of building cute apps and ladling them out to the masses — the Google and Microsoft model — Amazon is delivering silicon power to the people .
Bezos is fueling a flotilla of nimble , aggressive entrepreneurs , including frontier types chafing inside gilded prisons like the Googleplex .
For them , AWS is a launch pad , not just for the next million Facebook apps , but also for personal live TV channels , virtual desktops , pay - by - the - mile auto insurance , and no doubt plenty of things no one has thought of yet .
When Bezos wrote the company 's original business plan — famously careening toward Seattle in a Chevy Blazer , his wife MacKenzie at the wheel — he knew little about books and cared not much more :
They were merely a vehicle for a larger vision .
" We 're willing to plant seeds and wait five to seven years for them to turn into trees , " Bezos says .
" We focus our strategies on delivering fundamental services better than anyone else .
Technology changes .
Competitors change .
But 10 years from now , nobody 's going to say to us , We love what you do , but it 's too fast . '
Or
It 's too reliable , ' or too cheap . ' "
Someone is watching the results — particularly the 30 - plus percent annual sales growth across Amazon 's sprawling bazaar .
Eighteen months ago , half the analysts following the company rated the stock " sell " or " underperform " — Wall Street 's equivalent of an F .
Since then , the cost of an AMZN share has doubled , while the rest of high tech is relatively flat at best .
Which is one reason why Bezos , who owns nearly 100 million shares — worth more than $ 7 billion — gives every appearance of being the happiest man in high tech .
" People in this business spend a lot of time looking at ideas and asking , why do that ?
But sometimes the more powerful question is , why not ? "
This time , he does n't honk .

Taxes are something every American pays at some point in their lives – they ’re inevitable .
Today , we ’re taking a look at all the different taxes that Americans pay on a daily basis .
1 ) Income Taxes
Whenever someone thinks of taxes , they usually think of federal income taxes first .
That is because between Federal and State taxes , some Americans lose as much as 35 % of their paychecks to income taxes .
2 ) Business Taxes
Also known as corporate taxes , business taxes are direct taxes levied on the profits of businesses .
However , expenses that are deemed necessary to the business can often be deducted to lower the amount of profits subject to tax , some business opt for the eis scheme option that helps them raise capital in a faster way .
3 ) Property Taxes
Property taxes are imposed on property by reason of its ownership .
They are usually paid on real estate , but can also be paid on personal property , such as boats , automobiles , recreational vehicles , and other business inventories .
4 ) Payroll Taxes
These are the taxes that must be deducted from wages paid to employees , and the employer usually must match the amount taxed .
Some payroll taxes include federal withholdings , disability insurance , Medicare , and other state withholdings .
5 ) Inheritance Taxes
The inheritance tax , also known the “ death tax ” , is a tax that arises from the death of a taxpayer .
It is imposed on the transfer of any property or asset transferred as the result of a death .
6 ) Capital Gains Taxes
In the United States , a tax is levied on all income generated from a taxpayer ’s capital gains , which are profits from the sale of an asset that was purchased at a lower price .
The most common capital gains are created from the sale of stocks , bonds , and property .
7 ) Excise Taxes
Any tax that is based on the value of the product being taxed is considered an excise tax .
They are based on the quantity of the product .
Common examples include those levied on gasoline , cigarettes , taxes , and even those on CD - R’s and DVD - R’s that are paid to copyright owners .
8 ) Sales Taxes
Consumption taxes , also known as sales taxes , are levied at the point of purchase for specific goods and services .
It is usually a percentage determined by the levels of government charging the tax .
Due to individual state and local taxes , the exact rate you pay will vary widely by location .
9 ) Gift Taxes
A gift tax is a one that is levied on the transfer of a property by one taxpayer to another while receiving either nothing or something with a less than equal value in return .
Selling something at less than its full value , or making an interest - free or reduced interest loan , may qualify as giving a gift .
10 ) Retirement Taxes
All taxes levied by the government to plan for a taxpayer ’s retirement could be considered retirement taxes .
In the United States , we pay into a social security system that provides income to retired workers from the general fund .
Our tax is regressive as we all pay the same rate up to a specific cap .
Then all income above the cap is not taxed .
11 ) Tariffs
An import or export tariff is paid when someone moves any good through a political border .
Typically , it is used to “ encourage ” local businesses and “ discourage ” the purchase of foreign goods , as it increases the price for the foreign goods .
12 ) Tolls
Tolls are charged to drivers who cross through designated bridges , tunnels , and even some roads .
They ’re usually always paid in fixed amounts each time you drive pass through the restricted area .
Tolls are frequently used to fund state projects , but can also be used for privately funded projects .
How many of these taxes were you familiar with ?
Did any of them surprise you ?
In their ever continuing battle to free the Internet , The Pirate Bay has now launched an uncensored blogging service , called Baywords .
The service is intended to be a safe haven for bloggers who want to be able to write whatever they want , without being afraid to get shut down by their blog host .
The Pirate Bay is known for defending people ’s right to freedom of speech on the Internet , and this is exactly what motivated them to start this new blogging service .
Brokep , one of the co-founders of the site , told Torrent Freak that the idea to start a blogging service came up when the weblog of one of his friends was taken down from WordPress recently , for linking to copyrighted material .
This , of course , goes against the “ uncensored web ” philosophy of The Pirate Bay team , and they did n’t hesitate to start their own blogging service , Baywords , using WordPress as their blogging engine .
On the frontpage of the newly launched service Brokep writes : “ Many blogs are being shut down for uncomfortable thoughts and ideas .
We will not do that .
Our goal is to protect freedom of speech and your thoughts .
As long as you do n’t break any Swedish laws in your blog , we will defend it ” .
In a response , Matt Mullenweg from WordPress told TorrentFreak that he supports Pirate Bay ’s Baywords , but he assured us that WordPress.com would never take down a blog for posting deviating thoughts or ideas .
“ Word Press.com supports free speech and does n’t shut people down for “ uncomfortable thoughts and ideas ” , in fact we ’re blocked in several countries because of that .
However as a US - based companies we must comply with US laws , which means if the primary purpose of a blog is distributing illegal material it ’s not a good fit for WordPress.com , ” Matt said .
Baywords is currently working on expanding the feature list to include support for domain redirects and improved stats .
The service is ad - free for now , but Brokep told Torrent Freak that there will be ads blended into the blog design later , to cover the expenses .
This is not the first time The Pirate Bay has launched a service where people can publish whatever they want , without being censored .
They have already created an image hosting service for this reason , and a YouTube competitor is soon to follow .
For people who are considering moving their WordPress or Blogger account over to Baywords , importing is pretty straightforward and compatible with all the popular blog platforms .
Do n’t forget to add TorrentFreak to your blogroll !
Update : Matt Mullenweg ’s response was added to the article after publication .
This is the first of several posts on the topic of Haskell ’s laziness .
After several weeks of playing , I ’m coming to the conclusion that laziness - by - default is a hinderance rather than a virtue .
Let ’s start at the start though by trying to add some numbers together .
-- Non tail recursive ; 5 Mb of live objects at end .
mysum [ ] = 0 mysum ( x:xs ) = x + mysum xs main = putStrLn $ show $ mysum $ take 100000 $ [ 1 .. ]
As the comment says , this is a dumb version .
It consumes 5 Mb of memory because it ’s not tail recursive .
Incidentally , after causing my machine to thrash several time during my experiments , I found it useful to use ‘ ulimit ’ to restrict the maximum heap size available to the process .
Also , you can pass extra args to your haskell app to get it to report real - time memory stats , like this :
ghc sum.hs && / bin / bash -c ' ulimit - Sv 100000 ; ./a.out + RTS - Sstderr '
Anyhow , the memory blowup is easy to fix ; just pass an ‘ accumulator ’ parameter when you do the recursive call :
-- Tail recursive , but 3.5 Mb of live objects at end .
mysuma acc [ ] = acc mysuma acc ( x:xs ) = mysuma ( acc+x ) xs main = putStrLn $ show $ mysuma 0 $ take 100000 $ [ 1 .. ]
Hmm , it ’s now tail recursive but it still consumes 3.5 Mb ?
This is where Haskell ’s laziness makes things quite different from ocaml and other strict languages .
When we pass the accumulated value , haskell does not actually evaluate the addition prior to making the recursive call .
It will delay the computation until its value is actually required .
So , on each recursive call , the accumulator looks like an unevaluated “ 1+2 ” and then “ 1+ 2+3 ” etc .
We can fix this by explicitly telling haskell to evaluate the addition prior to making the call :
-- Tail recursive , with ' seq ' to force immediate evaluation of addition .
-- 40 k of live objects at end .
mysumas acc [ ] = acc mysumas acc ( x:xs ) = ( acc+x ) `seq` mysumas ( acc+x ) xs main = putStrLn $ show $ mysumas 0 $ take 100000 $ [ 1 .. ]
Finally we have a program which only consumes a tiny amount of heap space .
But it took a surprising amount of effort .
There ’s lots more information about this situation on the haskell wiki .
GOP p.r. guy / proud Villanova grad Jonathan Grella has a great catch from Hardball at his alma mater : the kid who asked the smart aleck question I referenced below about Hillary " hitting the sauce " is the son of Fox anchor Steve Doocy .
Peter Doocy , who asks the question at about the 3:00 mark above , is a junior here and a spitting image of his father .
I can confirm that McCain did not , though , join the younger Doocy for a post - game shot .

I picked up the NZ Herald this afternoon , a local broadsheet newspaper that I read from time to time , and noticed quite an interesting mistake .
This screenshot was grabbed from the NZ Herald website http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/3/story.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10486347 ( page 2 ) .
For those that picked up the paper , it ’s located in the Business section , page C5 .
Mistakes in newspapers are often simple typos , so when one comes along that simply breaks the laws of physics as we know it , it ’s good to have a laugh :D .

Twan van Laarhoven pointed out that fzip from the other day is a close cousin of applicative chosen to be an inverse of the universal construction ' unfzip ' .
During that post I also put off talking about the dual of zipping , so I figured I 'd bring up the notion of choosing a notion of ' cozipping ' by defining it as an inverse to a universally definable notion of ' counzipping ' .
[ Edit : Twan pointed out I had flipped which was the dual of zip , revised ]
Abusing the new category - extras to avoid making an enormous post and recycling the constructions from the previous post , we can define :
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} module Control .
Functor .
Cozip where import Control .
Arrow ( ( ||| ) , ( +++ ) ) import Control .
Monad .
Identity import Control .
Bifunctor .
Biff import Control .
Bifunctor .
Fix
The same inverse question leads to some observations about the dual of fzip as opposed to its inverse .
We could call them cozip and uncozip for lack of a better name , but as we will see cozip is more accurately about deciding classifying the contents of the functor , so maybe deserves a better , more evocative name like ' decide ' or ' cleave ' .
counzip and its bifunctorial equivalent always exist .
counzip :: Functor f =>
Either ( f a ) ( f b ) -> f ( Either a b ) counzip = fmap Left ||| fmap Right counbizip :: Bifunctor f =>
Either ( f a c ) ( f b d ) -> f ( Either a b ) ( Either c d ) counbizip = bimap Left Left ||| bimap Right Right
But there are some cases where its inverse does n't exist , such as the Reader / State monads , or where uncozip only has a right inverse like with Maybe / Either .
Counzipping basically demonstrates the fact that if I have either a container of a's or a container of b's , I can treat that as a container of ' as or bs ' , giving up the knowledge that the container contains entirely one or the other .
Its inverse describes the cases where we can recover this information .
class Functor f =>
Cozip f where cozip :: f ( Either a b ) ->
Either ( f a ) ( f b ) instance Cozip Identity where cozip = bimap Identity Identity .
runIdentity
Now , in general a functor that has more than one ' hole ' will not be recoverable because one hole could contain an a , and the other could contain a b , so you would be unable to perform the split .
Futhermore unless there is a way to decide the value contained you 'll never be able to tell which branch of the Either to return , so functors like the reader / state monads are out .
However , this does not close the door to a few other functors :
instance Cozip ( ( , ) c ) where cozip ( c , ab ) = bimap ( ( , ) c ) ( ( , ) c ) ab -- ambiguous choice instance Cozip Maybe where cozip = maybe ( Left Nothing ) ( bimap Just Just ) -- cozip = maybe ( Right Nothing ) ( bimap Just Just ) -- ambiguous choice instance Cozip ( Either c ) where cozip = ( Left .
Left ) ||| bimap Right Right -- cozip = ( Right .
Left ) ||| bimap Right Right
Note that the definitions for Maybe and ( Either c ) had to ' choose ' where to put the " Nothing / Left " term .
Consequently they are only right - inverses of counzip .
You can also go and generate one that says that the functor coproduct of a pair of cozippable functors is cozippable , just like the functor product of a pair of zippable functors is zippable ( given by the construction given for BiffB the other day ) .
Finally , the only surprising instance is for the free monad of a cozippable functor .
-- instance Cozip f => Cozip ( Free f ) where instance Cozip f => Cozip ( FixB ( BiffB Either Identity f ) ) where cozip ( InB ( BiffB ( Left ( Identity ( Left a ) ) ) ) ) = Left ( InB ( BiffB ( Left ( Identity a ) ) ) ) cozip ( InB ( BiffB ( Left ( Identity ( Right a ) ) ) ) ) = Right ( InB ( BiffB ( Left ( Identity a ) ) ) ) cozip ( InB ( BiffB ( Right as ) ) ) = ( ( InB . BiffB .
Right ) +++ ( InB . BiffB .
Right ) ) ( cozip ( fmap cozip as ) )
This says that even though Either is not ' bicozippable ' - which appears to be an ill - defined concept - we can build up a general cozip for the free monad of an cozippable functor .
The reason is that if your functor only has one place to put a value , then putting the free monad in that place just means that you have to search longer .
So , we 've found the fact that free monads of cozippable functors are cozippable , in contrast to the conclusion of the other day that cofree comonads of zippable functors are zippable .

The US government has redesigned several of its notes in recent years
The US government has been told to change the size or texture of its banknotes because it is difficult for blind people to tell the notes apart .
A US federal appeals court upheld a ruling that having all dollar notes the same size and texture was unacceptable .
The judges voted two to one to reject the government 's claim that changing note sizes would be too expensive .
The Treasury Department was concerned about the potential costs of redesigning vending machines .
" A large majority of other currency systems have accommodated the visually impaired , and the secretary does not explain why US currency should be any different , " Judge Judith Rogers wrote in the court 's opinion .
New notes
The case was brought by the American Council for the Blind , which proposed several solutions such as different note sizes for different denominations , embossed dots or raised printing .
The US should make the US currency available to all who use it - blind or otherwise
BBC News website reader Benet Schirber , Minnesota , USA
Readers ' reaction The Treasury Department said it was reviewing the ruling .
According to documents filed in the case , 937,000 people in the US are legally blind while another 2.4 million count as having low vision , meaning they are unable to read newspaper print .
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing , which prints the notes , has commissioned a report looking at how to better serve the blind .
Redesigned banknotes have been brought out in recent years to make counterfeiting more difficult , including a new $ 20 bill in 2003 , $ 10 bill in 2006 and a $ 5 bill earlier this year .

What are these ?
NEW YORK 
In a sign that fears of a financial catastrophe are waning , the stock market rallied 3.6 % Tuesday — its best second - quarter start in 70 years .
A day after wrapping up its worst quarterly performance in 5 ½ years , stocks got a big confidence boost from investment bank Lehman Bros. , ( LEH ) which successfully raised $ 4 billion in capital .
The move bolstered Lehman 's balance sheet and sent a strong message to jittery investors that the firm was financially sound and not likely to experience the same fate as investment firm Bear Stearns , which collapsed two weeks ago .
" Stocks rallied because some of the fear factor is coming out of the market , " says Chris Orndorff , a portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel .
" Investors are starting to realize that it is unlikely that other firms are going to disappear overnight like Bear Stearns did . "
The decision in mid-March by the nation 's central bank to make its cash available to brokerage firms , coupled with proposals to better police financial firms announced Monday by the U.S. Treasury Department , seems to have reassured investors that the worst - case financial scenarios are unlikely .
Stocks soared Tuesday as a result .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index , which accounts for about 70 % of the value of the stock market , rallied 3.6 % to 1370 — the best start to a second quarter since a 4.8 % jump in 1938 , S&P says .
The big jump , which was driven largely by double - digit gains posted by financial stocks , cut the S&P 's 2008 loss to 6.7 % .
The Dow Jones industrials jumped 391 points , or 3.2 % , to 12,654 , slashing its 2008 loss to 4.6 % .
Investors seem to be taking comfort in the fact that major financial companies are moving swiftly to address liquidity concerns and boost investor confidence .
The big gains came despite the fact that UBS , ( UBS ) one of Europe 's biggest banks , said Tuesday that it would write down $ 19 billion more to cover losses related to mortgage - related assets .
On the positive side , UBS also said it will issue $ 15 billion in stock to bolster its cash reserves .
" We are moving between two storms , " says David Kelly , chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds .
" It looks like the credit angst is dying down just as economic angst is rising . "
The economy is just now starting to feel the negative effects of slowing growth .
But Kelly says investors are more adept at dealing with a recession .
" We have gone from worrying about an unknown story ( the credit crisis ) to a known story ( an economic slowdown ) , " Kelly says .
However , there was a bright spot Tuesday in news that March manufacturing was not as weak as thought .
But a recession can still hurt stocks .
" The euphoria will be replaced by the cold hard realism that earnings are going to be much lower than they were in 2007 , " Orndorff says .
" The feeling of crisis may be over , but the hard part of making money is just beginning . "
White House Blacklist Breakthrough : Online media team up for free press victory Eric Brewer

This I thought it was shameful that 10 days after David Barstow 's NY Times article about how the establishment media colluded with the Pentagon to sell the war in Iraq and the " war on terror " to the American people by hiring the Pentagon 's " message force multipliers " as military analysts , no one had asked the White House about it .
I 'd been trying , but I 'd been on Dana Perino 's ' blacklist ' during my last six visits to the briefing room .
Today she again ignored me ( I was sitting in the front row ) until the very end of the briefing , when she was forced to call on me thanks to the intervention of Les Kinsolving of WorldNetDaily .
Les had noticed at previous briefings that I was being singled out , and he thought it was n't fair .
Today he put Dana on the spot .
A video of this exchange is now available here .
Les Kinsolving : How about this gentleman 's question ?
He 's had his hand up all this time .
Ms. Perino : Yes .
I 'm well aware .
I 'm sure it will be a great question .
Go ahead .
Me : The NY Times has reported that over the last ...
Ms. Perino :
It 's definitely going to be a good question .
Me : ... over the last 6 years , the Pentagon conducted a secret operation designed to sell the war in Iraq and the ' war on terror ' to the American people .
It recruited more than 75 ex-military officers , many with financial ties to the defense industry , provided them with talking points and an extraordinary degree of access not available to ordinary members of the press , including meetings with the Secretary of Defense , and got them hired as supposedly independent military analysts by every U.S. television network .
One of its participants described the program ...
Ms. Perino :
Do you have a question ?
Me : One of its participants described the program as " Psyops on Steroids , " and others said ...
Ms. Perino :
Is this your opinion ?
Me : I 'm describing the program .
Ms. Perino :
What 's your question ?
Me : Others said that if they departed from the Pentagon 's talking points , their access was cut off , and my question is : Did the White House know about and approve of this operation ?
Ms. Perino : Look , I do n't ... I did n't know ... look , I think you guys should take a step back and look at this op ... look , DOD 's made a decision , they 've decided to stop this program .
But I would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something .
And I do n't think that that should be against the law .
And I think it 's absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and who are going to be providing their opinions on it .
It does n't necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration .
I think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration .
That does n't mean that we should n't talk to people .
Weak , Dana .
The DOD has decided to suspend , not stop the program .
And secretly propagandizing the American people IS against the law .
This one : " No part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States not heretofore authorized by the Congress .ï¿ ½
And when you say , " That does n't mean we should n't talk to people " who are " tough on the administration , " why wo n't you talk to me unless Les Kinsolving forces you to ?
Afterwards , I thanked Les and had a good talk with fellow White House correspondent Helen Thomas .
She advised me to keep coming , keep sticking my hand in the air , and , if I 'm ignored , to speak up .
None of the other journalists spoke to me , but one cameraman walking by said " Good work " .

Radley Balko : We Are n't ' Over ' Race
Monday , May 05 , 2008
By Radley Balko

I spent an afternoon last week at the American Civil Rights Museum in Memphis , Tenn .
The museum is built around the Lorraine Motel , where just outside room 306 , Martin Luther King was assassinated 40 years ago .
It 's an emotionally draining experience .
The museum begins with a look at slavery in America , starting with the first importation of slaves in the 1600s , then continuing up through the Civil War and the period of reconstruction in the south .
The institution of slavery is of course an abomination .
And though parts of America 's founding on the principles of equality before the law will always be tainted by our early reliance upon the forced labor of other human beings , there 's nothing uniquely shameful about slavery 's role in early America that could n't also be said about its presence in other parts of the world , and throughout most of human history .
Indeed , the United States probably deserves some credit — we were the second major power in the modern world to abolish the practice , though we trailed Great Britain by about 50 years .
( France abolished and reestablished slave practices several times in the 18th and 19th centuries ) .
It 's when the museum gets into the 20th century and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s that it begins to get especially emotionally taxing .
You pass by wrenching photographs , grainy video , and firsthand accounts of lynchings , bombings of black churches , and slayings of civil rights workers .
The museum also features the charred remains of a Greyhound " freedom rider " bus , set ablaze after its occupants were arrested in Alabama for attempting to integrate the state 's bus station .
One exhibit features a section on the 1957 barricade at a public school in Little Rock , including that intense photo of young , white Hazel Bryan — her face wrenched in hate and contempt — heckling the young , black Elizabeth Eckford as she attempted to enter the all - white school .
As I walked through this part of the museum , it struck me that this is n't the past .
It 's the recent past .
Eckford and Bryan are still alive ( the history of their reconciliation and subsequent parting again is a fascinating story in its own right ) , as are many of the civil rights leaders who look down from the museum 's walls .
It was only a generation ago that Bull Connor unleashed his fire hoses , attack dogs , and goons on civil rights protesters in Alabama .
As late as the early 1970s , the city of Memphis chose to close its public swimming pools rather than allow white and black children to cool off in the same water .
This is n't ancient history .
My dad grew up through all of this .
It seems to me that it 's a bit premature , then , for us to insist — as one conservative pundit suggested to me last month over dinner — that black Americans " just get over the whole racism thing . "
That pundit was referring to the controversy over Sen. Barack Obama , and the intemperate and ugly statements made by his longtime pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
I have no interest in defending the substance of what Wright has said over the last week , or of the passages that have been pulled from his sermons and played over the Internet and cable television .
There are a few things he has said that I would defend .
There are many , many things he has said that I find objectionable , abhorrent , and twelve kinds of crazy .
But it 's worth keeping in mind that for 200 years , hundreds of thousands of black people were imprisoned in this country as slaves .
For another 100 years , in most of the country , they were second - class citizens , subject to rapes , lynchings and beatings ; denied the right to vote ; forced into segregated buses , schools , parks , and public facilities ; and denied due process in the criminal justice system .
Bizarre as some of Rev. Wright 's conspiracy theories may sound , there actually have been some pretty bizarre conspiracies against black Americans over the years .
I can't begrudge black Americans if for three hours on Sunday they want to indulge in a bit of righteous indignation within the walls of their places of worship .
Even if that indignation sometimes expresses itself in hateful or nutty ways , or in ways I 'll never quite understand .
America has come a long way with respect to race , but it would be foolish to say that the remnants of racism are n't still with us , or that — as I 've heard some commenters suggest — that the only discrimination that matters any more is the kind of elitist reverse discrimination we sometimes see in affirmative action programs ( for the record , I 'm opposed to state - sanctioned affirmative action ) .
We are n't " over " race , nor we should pretend to be .
Just this week , a new study showed that of the 350,000 low - level marijuana arrests in New York City over the past decade , over half the arrestees were black .
This despite the fact that blacks make up only about 25 percent of the city 's population , and that according to survey data , black people are actually less likely to smoke marijuana than white people .
Jack Cole , a former narcotics officer who now heads up the anti-drug war group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , has noted that there are a higher percentage of black men in prison in American today than there were in South Africa at the height of apartheid .
Blacks make 15 percent of drug users , but 45 percent of people incarcerated for drug offenses .
One in three black men between 20 and 29 is either in prison or on probation or parole .
These statistics are terrible .
Many on the left attribute them to institutional racism in the criminal justice system , and to discrepancies and bias in sentencing laws .
Many on the right say they 're the product of a culture of criminality and hoodlumism too common today in many black and urban communities .
There 's probably some truth to both theories .
It seems unlikely that we could in just a few decades purge the criminal justice and legal systems of centuries of ingrained , systemized racism .
It seems just as unlikely the pathologies inculcated and deep - seated hurt inflicted on black Americans by hundreds of years of abuse , neglect , and oppression could , likewise , be erased in little more than a generation ( not to mention the harm done by well - intentioned but devastating destructive public assistance programs such as AFDC ) .
So where does this leave us with respect to Sen. Obama and Rev. Wright ?
I guess I find it hard to hold Sen .
Obama 's choice of churches against him .
There are plenty of issues where I have fundamental disagreements with Sen. Obama .
But nothing in his career , public statements , or actions suggest he believes in black liberation theology , or that he subscribes to Rev. Wright 's wackier theories .
And I see nothing contradictory or hypocritical when some contrast Obama 's rhetoric on race with his membership in Wright 's church .
On the contrary , it suggests a particularly human , honest , and realistic approach to race and civil rights :
We should be striving to move forward — to the point where we one day might " get beyond race . "
But it would be foolish to blur the recent past , or to gloss over the anger , hurt , and resentment still lingering — on both sides — from the civil rights struggles of just a generation ago .
We are finally entering an era where we can talk about these things openly , and without fear of retribution .
Given America 's history , I 'd say black Americans have earned the right to take advantage of the era to express some anger — even anger I personally may find unfounded , ill conceived , or misdirected .

In modern times , you rarely see any men having to stand ashenly by their women .
But in the past , women got tangled up with sex and power .
When Bette Davis played Elizabeth I , she was always sending her lovers off to the Tower of London when they made eyes at her pretty ladies - in - waiting .
Catherine the Great was hardly known for her restraint .
And there were Agrippina and Cleopatra , of course .

フロリダ州立大学の心理学者は，ある実験を行った。被験者には，女性が文章を読み上げる様子を映したビデオを見てもらう。ただしそのビデオは無声で，一定時間毎にランダムな単語が画面隅に表示される。被験者の半分はその単語をなるべく見ないように要求され，残りの半分は自由に眺めていればよいと言われる。
結果，単語を見ないよう要求された被験者は，そうでない被験者と比較して，血液中のグルコース（ブドウ糖）の量が顕著に減少していたという。
この研究グループは他にも面白い実験を行っている。今度は，被験者には色の名前が書かれた文字を見てもらう。ただしその文字は，文字の内容とは関係の無いランダムな色で塗られている（例えば赤い文字で「青」と書かれていたりする）。被験者には，その文字は無視して，使われている色の名前を答えていくという作業を行ってもらう。
このとき，被験者の半分は砂糖入りのレモネードを飲んでから作業を始める。残りの半分は偽薬として人工甘味料入りのレモネードを飲んでから始める。すると，前者は後者と比較して低い誤答率を保つことができたという。

Author Rupert Sheldrake , whose ideas about biology and consciousness sometimes spark controversy , was stabbed after giving a lecture in Santa Fe , NM , last week .
He is currently recovering .
Here is a local news article , and following is Mr. Sheldrake 's own account of the events ( continues after the jump ) …
Every time my heart beat , a fountain of blood spurted from the wound in my thigh about four inches into the air .
I was fortunate that several people from the audience with medical experience rapidly came to my assistance , including a nurse , doctor and paramedic .
I lay down on the stage while they fastened a belt around my thigh as a tourniquet and pressed on my leg to reduce the flow of blood .
Suddenly I felt a violent blow on my left thigh , as if I had been punched .
It was totally unexpected , and I did not see my assailant run towards me .
He was rapidly pulled away .
I looked down at my leg , and to my astonishment saw the handle of a dagger sticking out of my trousers .
Without thinking , I pulled it out : the blade of the bloodstained weapon was about five inches long and an inch wide .
I felt my trouser leg was wet with blood , and I pulled my trousers down .
A week ago , on the afternoon of Wednesday April 2 , I was giving a talk to several hundred people at the International Science and Consciousness Conference in the ballroom of the La Fonda Hotel , in the centre of Santa Fe , New Mexico .
After the talk ended at 3 pm , I stepped down from the podium and was talking to people in a small group that had gathered around me .
Quite soon , a team of paramedics arrived , bandaged my wound , inserted an
intravenous drip and lifted me onto a stretcher ( called a gurney in
America ) .
When they carried me out into the street , blue lights were
flashing on police cars , and press photographers and TV cameramen soon had
me in their focus .
I was driven in the ambulance to St Vincent Regional
Medical Center , and taken to the emergency room , where the staff examined my
wound .
A few minutes later my old friend Larry Dossey walked in , having been
told of the attack .
I was delighted to see him .
He is not only a friend but
a doctor , and has seen many wounds from his time as a battalion surgeon in
Vietnam .
Some policemen also arrived , and questioned me about the attack ,
asked me to write a statement and photographed my leg and bloodstained
clothes .
The wound had stopped bleeding , but my thigh had swollen enormously .
The
trauma surgeon , Dr Caesar Ursic , at first considered the possibility of
leaving the wound to heal without surgical intervention , but it continued to
swell , and he decided that it would be better to open up my leg to clean out
the wound and stop the internal bleeding .
He offered me a choice , and I
asked Larry 's advice .
He was unhesitant – go for the operation .
So I did .
The anaesthetist was very friendly , and after taking my medical details and
discussing the procedure , she told me about her dogs that know when she is
coming home as I was wheeled into the operating theatre .
My attacker was Japanese , and had arrived from Japan only a few days
beforehand .
He had spoken to me the day before my lecture , telling me he was
hearing voices .
He was obviously in distress .
I later learned that he had
told several other people about the voices , and some had tried to help him .
But no one anticipated that he would turn violent , and neither I , nor anyone
else I know of , had any premonition of it .
Although the report in USA Today
said that he was " disturbed " by my lecture , which was on the extended mind ,
this was misleading ; he was disturbed anyway .
In any case , his English was
probably too poor to understand much of what I said .
The fact that I was
speaking in the final session of the conference may have had more to do with
it – if he was going to do something spectacular , this was his last chance .
After stabbing me , he was rapidly brought to the floor by an Australian
rugby player , and was held down by several men until the police led him away
in handcuffs .
While on the ground , he apparently said that the voices had
told him to attack me .
He is now in Santa Fe jail awaiting trial .
I feel no
anger towards him , but am pleased that he is locked away and unable to harm
anyone else .
When I regained consciousness I was lying on my back in a hospital bed with
tubes everwhere , but not in pain .
A blood - filled drainage tube came out of a
hole in my leg , draining the wound .
I had an intravenous line through which
I could administer morphine by pressing a button , but I never needed any
medication .
Dr Ursic told me that he had removed a blood clot the size of a
tennis ball , sealed off several small arteries that were bleeding into my
muscles , and cleaned out the wound .
He said that he was surprised by the
large amount of tissue damage , which reminded him of what he had read about
hari - kiri wounds , caused by twisting the blade .
At the time , he did not know
that my assailant was Japanese .
The dagger had caused a wound about five
inches deep and an inch wide , severing the tissue in my quadriceps muscle
but fortunately missing the femoral artery by about half an inch .
He told
me it would probably be few days before I could begin to walk again , using a
walking frame .
The nursing staff were very helpful , and I had a stream of visitors ,
including some of the conference staff , several conference participants ,
some former students of mine and friends who live in Santa Fe .
I also had
many comforting phone calls , first and foremost from my wife Jill , in
London .
My room began to fill up with beautiful bunches of flowers ,
including organic tulips , and baskets of fruit and other food .
I was carried
along by a great surge of love and well - wishing , with messages pouring in
from around the world conveyed to me via Jill and via Larry and Barbara
Dossey .
I learned that at the conference itself , immediately after the
stabbing , dozens of people formed a circle to pray for me .
Other chanted in
a nearby church .
My family and many friends around the world were praying
for me .
Several of my visitors gave me various forms of healing , including
Reiki , and one of the nursing staff , who was also a practitioner of Healing
Touch , visited me at nights just before I went to sleep , leaving me feeling
as if I were floating like a feather .
On Friday Dr Ursic removed all my tubes , and with the help of the physical
training staff I ventured out of bed for the first time , moving a few yards
in a walker .
On Saturday , for the first time , I began to put my weight on my
left leg and hobbled about a 100 yards with the frame .
That evening I was
due to be speaking at an event in the Lensic Theatre in Santa Fe , part of an
election year " Festival of Optimistic Voices " , organized by my old friend
Nina Wise .
I felt strong enough to do it , and Dr Ursic arranged for me to be
able to leave the hospital for a few hours .
I was taken to the theatre by
Larry and Barbara Dossey .
I was the first speaker after the interval , and
after being introduced had to walk to the middle of the stage with my
walker , in front of several hundred people .
The story of my stabbing had
been on the front page of the local newspaper , the New Mexican , and I was
given a very warm reception .
I spoke on Science and Hope .
( The video of my
talk should be online soon with a link from my web site , www.sheldrake.org)
I had expected to be using the walker for about a week , but on Sunday
morning Dr Ursic thought I might be able to graduate to a four - legged
walking stick ( known in America as a quad cane ) .
He was right .
I was
discharged from the hospital soon afterwards , and came to stay with Larry
and Barbara Dossey in their beautiful house , amidst pine and juniper trees
in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo mountains .
The next day , as I was
walking around the house , I realized that I had forgotten my cane and was
walking without it .
My left leg still feels clumsy , stiff and weak , and my
thigh is swollen , but my healing has been exceptionally fast and I have
experienced no pain throughout the whole process .
I have also felt no fear ,
and have indeed felt calm and happy , even blissful at times .
I attribute all
this to my good fortune in having such a skillful surgeon in Caesar Ursic ,
who in all my encounters with him was completely present and
trust - inspiring , excellent care at St Vincent 's , the love and support of my
family and friends , the prayers of so many people , and the healings I have
received .
I am also very fortunate to be able to recover at the home of
Larry and Barbara Dossey , which is like a sanctuary .
They are looking after
me wonderfully well , and it is great fun being with them .
As I said on
Saturday night at the Lensic
Theatre , if you have to get stabbed , Santa Fe
is the best place for it to happen .
I am due to fly to Tucson tomorrow to attend the Toward a Science of
Consciousness Conference at the University of Arizona , where I am scheduled
to give a keynote address on Saturday morning , and I plan to fly home to
London on Monday .
As usual I am not traveling with a computer , and will only
start to answer emails when I am home again .
There are more than 2,000 in
my inbox , so if you have written to me , I apologize for the delay in
replying , and it may be a while before I can respond .
I am very grateful to all those people who have helped me here in Santa Fe ,
and to all those at home and around the world who have been praying for me
and sending me their love and support .
It has made all the difference .
The Freedom Tower will be the tallest building in New York
A homeless man has found confidential blueprints for New York 's new Freedom Tower dumped in a city rubbish bin .
Mike Fleming handed the documents - marked " Secure Document - Confidential " in to the New York Post newspaper .
The Freedom Tower is being built at Ground Zero , to replace the World Trade Centre towers destroyed on 9/11 .
A spokeswoman apologised for the security breach and said that anyone found responsible would be liable for " serious disciplinary action " .
' Game plan '
Mr Fleming said he was concerned that the documents might fall into the wrong hands .
" I was outraged , because this is priceless , " he told the New York Post .
" This could have ended up on eBay or gotten to al - Qaeda . "
The blueprints reveal details of the new building 's floor plans , along with the specifications of its concrete walls and its heating and ventilation systems .
Steve Yang , an architect who spoke to the New York Post , said that the plans would have been helpful for a terrorist planning an attack .
" An expert in explosives , demolition or biological weapons certainly could glean enough here to develop a game plan , " he said .
However , Candace McAdams , a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which owns the site , said that the plans were " not very detailed " and available to anyone bidding on contracts .
The Port Authority will now conduct an inquiry to find out how the breach occurred .

Last time the Los Angeles Lakers ruled the NBA , Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard were trying to beat them .
Howard fell short with Orlando in the 2009 NBA Finals .
Howard 's opportunity at Walt Disney World comes just down the road from where the Lakers celebrated their championship victory 11 years ago .
This is so sad .
I 'm all for freedom of religion , but this did n't have to happen .
An 11 - year - old girl died after her parents prayed for healing rather than seek medical help for a treatable form of diabetes , police said Tuesday .
Everest Metro Police Chief Dan Vergin said Madeline Neumann died Sunday .
" She got sicker and sicker until she was dead , " he said .
Vergin said an autopsy determined the girl died from diabetic ketoacidosis , an ailment that left her with too little insulin in her body , and she had probably been ill for about 30 days , suffering symptoms like nausea , vomiting , excessive thirst , loss of appetite and weakness .
The girl 's parents , Dale and Leilani Neumann , attributed the death to " apparently they did n't have enough faith , " the police chief said .
The family does not attend an organized church or participate in an organized religion , Vergin said .
" They have a little Bible study of a few people . "
Lately I 've been delving into the WordPress ecosystem , as it seems to be the most popular blogging platform around at the moment .
I 've set up two blogs with it so far .
In the process , I 've gotten quite comfortable with the setup , interface , and overall operation of WordPress .
I 've been thoroughly impressed with the community around WordPress , and the software itself is remarkably polished .
That 's not to say that I have n't run into a few egregious bugs in the 2.5 release , but on the whole , the experience has been good bordering on pleasant .
Or at least it was , until I noticed how much CPU time the PHP FastCGI process was using for modest little old blog.stackoverflow.com .
For context , this is running on a Windows Web Server 2008 virtual machine with a single core of a 2.13 GHz Xeon 3210 entirely dedicated to it .
This is an incredibly scary result ; blog.stackoverflow.com is getting , at best , a moderate trickle of incoming traffic .
It 's barely linked anywhere !
With that kind of CPU load level , this site would fall over instantaneously if it got remotely popular , or God forbid , anywhere near the front page of a social bookmarking website .
For a bare - bones blog which is doing approximately nothing , this is a completely unacceptable result .
It 's appalling .
As evidence of what a systemic problem this is , there 's an entire cottage industry built around shoehorning better caching behavior into WordPress .
Take your pick : WP - Cache , WP - Super - Cache , or Bad Behavior .
The caching add - ins do n't work very well under IIS because they assume they 're running on a * NIX platform , but they can be coerced into working .
Does it work ?
Does it ever .
Here 's what CPU usage looks like with basic WP - Cache type functionality enabled :
I 'm not alone ; just do a web search on WordPress CPU usage or WordPress Digg Effect and you 'll find page after page of horror stories , most ( all ? ) of which are solved by the swift and judicious application of the WP - Cache plugins .
It 's not like this a new issue .
Personally , I think it 's absolutely irresponsible that WP - Cache like functionality is n't already built into WordPress .
I would not even consider deploying WordPress anywhere without it .
And yet , according to a recent podcast , Matt Mullenweg dismisses it out of hand and hand - wavingly alludes to vague TechCrunch server reconfigurations .
A default WordPress install will query the database twenty times every time you refresh the page , even if not one single element on that page has changed .
Does n't that strike you as a bad idea ?
Maybe even , dare I say it , sloppy programming ?
I understand that users may have umpteen thousand WordPress plugins installed , all of which demand to change on every page load .
Yes , the easiest path , the path of least resistance , is to mindlessly query the database every time you 're building a page .
But I cannot accept that a default , bare - bones WordPress install has n't the first clue how to cache and avoid expensive , redundant trips to the database .
It 's frustrating , because caching is a completely solved problem in other programming communities .
For example , the .NET framework has had page output caching and page fragment output caching baked into ASP .
NET for years .
I sure am glad I started this blog in Movable Type way back in 2004 .
Their classic static rendering blog engine approach may be derided today , but I shudder to think of the number of times the Coding Horror webserver would have been completely incapacitated over the years by the naive -- no , that 's too tame -- brainlessly stupid dynamic rendering approach WordPress uses .
What I just do n't understand is why , after all these years , and all these documented problems , WordPress has n't folded WP - Cache into the core .
If you 're ever planning to have traffic of any size on a WordPress blog , consider yourselves warned .
It does not take much expertise to understand that the current tightness of the oil market is in large part due to the situation in Iran and Iraq .
As is well - known , Iran and Iraq have the highest proven oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia .
Iran also has the highest proven natural gas reserves after Russia .
But oil and gas production in both countries remains far behind their capacities .
The case of Iraq is too well - known to require elaboration .
But Iran also produces much less oil and gas than it could .
The main reasons are the U.S. - led sanctions regime and the international economic boycott of Iran .
The consequences for the Iranian energy industry have been devastating .
As the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) observes [ .pdf ] , Iran ’s oil production has declined from 6 million barrels per day ( BPD ) of crude oil in 1974 to 3.8 million BPD in 2006 .
“ Iran ’s oil fields need structural upgrades including enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) efforts such as natural gas injection , ” states the EIA .
“ Iran ’s fields have a natural annual decline rate estimated at 8 percent onshore and 10 percent offshore , while current Iranian recovery rates are 24 - 27 percent , 10 percent less than the world average .
It is estimated that 400,000 - 500,000 bbl/d of crude production is lost annually due to reservoir damage and decreases in existing oil deposits . ”
The Iranian government aims to boost its oil production to 5 million BPD , but the EIA does not believe a production increase will happen at least through 2012 .
As the agency notes , to increase its production , “ Iran will need foreign help . ”
In natural gas the situation is in many ways even worse .
More than 60 percent of Iranian proven natural gas reserves have not been developed .
Iran hardly exports any gas at all .
Of course , the Iranian government also bears responsibility for the abject state of the oil industry .
Since hard - liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005 , investment conditions for private foreign companies have worsened .
The Iranian policy of keeping out Western companies is , in fact , the mirror image of the Western policy of sanctions .
Both policies seriously hamper Iranian economic development .
To break this deadlock , what the West needs to do is to stop treating Iran as its worst enemy , put an end to sanctions , and instead encourage business and political relations as much as possible .
That way the position of the hardliners inside Iran would be undermined and the prospects for peace and stability in the Middle East would be greatly enhanced .
Ending Tyranny
Such a policy of “ détente ” is exactly the opposite of current Western policy toward Iran .
Although the threat of U.S. military action has receded , the American government remains on a collision course with Iran .
It has repeatedly said that “ nothing is off the table . ”
The Democratic opposition in Congress fully supports this confrontation policy , as does the EU .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has even upped the ante recently by saying that the U.S. - Iranian “ standoff ” is “ the world ’s greatest crisis ” and that the world is confronted with a “ catastrophic alternative : an Iranian bomb or the bombing of Iran . ”
The U.S. and Europe continue to insist that Iran end its uranium enrichment program , which they claim is part of an Iranian plan to develop an atomic bomb .
They have persuaded the Security Council of the United Nations to join in this demand .
Iran refuses to give up enrichment .
The fact is that Iran is acting within its rights .
It is entitled under the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) to pursue enrichment of uranium .
The NPT requires that member countries cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , whose task it is to see to it that their nuclear projects are used for peaceful purposes only .
Iran does so , and the IAEA has repeatedly stated that it has found no evidence that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon .
There is thus no legal basis for instituting sanctions against Iran , as the Security Council has done  let alone for tightening these sanctions or taking military action against Iran .
Indeed , it is not Iran but rather the U.S. that is acting in violation of the NPT .
The treaty requires the owners of nuclear weapons to assist the other signatories in developing their own peaceful nuclear energy programs .
In fact , the U.S. is boycotting Iran and is supporting three countries  India , Pakistan , and Israel  that have developed atomic bombs while opting out of the NPT .
These three countries surround Iran .
The NPT also requires the U.S. and other signatories to reduce their nuclear arsenals .
Instead , the Bush administration is modernizing and expanding the American nuclear arsenal .
As of the year 2000 , the U.S. nuclear arsenal comprised 5,400 multiple - megaton warheads atop intercontinental ballistic missiles , 1,750 nuclear bombs and cruise missiles ready to be launched from B - 2 and B - 52 bombers , a further 1,670 “ tactical ” nuclear weapons , plus some 10,000 nuclear warheads stored in bunkers ( Chalmers Johnson , Sorrows of Empire , 2004 , p. 64 ) .
Many argue that Iran is a special case .
It is not considered a “ normal ” country , because it is supposedly run by a bunch of mad , fanatical mullahs who would not hesitate dropping an atomic bomb if they had one .
This image of Iran is apparent in the rhetoric employed by Western leaders .
Bush has said that “ Iran ’s actions threaten the security of nations everywhere ” and that Iran is “ the world ’s leading state sponsor of terrorism . ”
Tony Blair , the former British prime minister , has claimed that Iran is “ the greatest enemy of peace in the world . ”
In a speech he made in several Gulf countries , Blair said that the world is engaged “ in a monumental struggle between those who believe in democracy and moderation , and forces of reaction and extremism . ”
In this epic contest , Iran is ideological enemy number one , Blair stated .
Public opinion in Western countries largely seems to have accepted this view of the Iranian regime as evil , irrational , and unpredictable .
World Peace
How “ evil ” is Iran really ?
Although Tony Blair does not acknowledge it , Iran is a democracy , of sorts , whereas the Gulf states that are supported militarily and politically by the U.S. and the UK , not to mention Saudi Arabia , are not .
Iran is hardly a perfect democracy ; its unelected clergy are in many ways the ones who rule the country .
The Iranian government also frequently tramples on human rights : it violates freedom of speech , imprisons people for their views , and does not allow many social freedoms that we take for granted .
Such evils should be opposed , of course .
But the same can be said of countries such as Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and China , yet those countries escape being labeled part of the “ axis of evil . ”
Iranians also have the freedom to move in and out of their country and interact with people abroad , with not too many restrictions .
For these reasons alone , Iran can by no stretch of the imagination be called a totalitarian country .
More to the point is that Iran cannot credibly be called a threat to “ world peace . ”
The Iranian regime has never invaded another country , initiated a war , or tried to impose its rule by military means on other nations .
It is equally false to claim , as President Bush has done , that Iran “ is the world ’s leading state sponsor of terrorism . ”
Iran has always opposed al - Qaeda , it does not sponsor terrorist acts in Western countries , and it has never supported the Taliban , even though Bush has claimed that it does .
Iran does support Hezbollah and Hamas , but these are groups that fight against what they believe to be the repressive policies of Israel .
Military - Industrial Complex
Conversely , we may ask , how “ good ” is the United States really ?
Is the U.S. a force for “ moderation and democracy ” in the world ?
Unfortunately , the historical record does not bear this out .
Since the end of World War Two , the U.S. has supported dozens of murderous dictators both financially and militarily : for example , Joseph Mobutu of Zaire , Augusto Pinochet of Chili , Suharto of Indonesia , Saddam Hussein of Iraq , the shah of Iran , Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua , Fulgencio Batista of Cuba , and dictatorships in Greece , Portugal , Pakistan , Egypt , and many other countries .
In 1954 the CIA sabotaged the elected government in Guatemala .
The U.S. invaded Panama in 1989 , killing 3,000 to 4,000 civilians .
It trained and supported death squads in El Salvador .
It supported the Taliban , brought the Ba’ath Party to power in Iraq , and sold material for chemical weapons to the regime of Saddam Hussein .
Why has U.S. foreign policy been so much at odds with the high - minded moral ideals touted by its leaders ?
In my view , this must be ascribed to the fact that within the U.S. a huge military - industrial - bureaucratic complex has come into existence over the last decades , fed by hundreds of billions of dollars in military spending , which has created a policy dynamic of its own , based on its own financial and political interests rather than on any “ democratic ” ideals .
This complex has seriously corrupted the American political system , the one having become so intertwined with the other that its ruling elites effortlessly job - hop back and forth .
To give one example , as former CIA officer Philip Giraldi pointed out last year , “ at least 43 former employees , board members , or advisers for defense contractors are currently serving or have recently served in policy - making positions in the Bush administration . ”
To mention just a few examples , former undersecretary of defense and World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz worked as a consultant for Northrop Grumman , maker of the B2 bomber and other weapon systems ; Gordon England , former secretary of the Navy , was executive vice president at General Dynamics , producer of the Abrams tank and the Trident submarine ; former secretary of state Colin Powell served on the board of Gulfstream Aerospace , a weapons supplier to Kuwait and other Gulf states ; Lynne Cheney , wife of Vice President Dick Cheney , sat on the board of arms producer Lockheed ; and Powell A. Moore , former assistant secretary of defense , was vice president for legislative affairs at Lockheed .
American military contractors not only fund politicians on a grand scale , they also give financial support to universities , research institutions , and the media .
In many cases they own television networks , film studios , newspapers , and so on .
When similar connections are observed in Russia , Western commentators are quick to point out the “ corruption ” of the Russian system , but they ignore the same situation in the U.S .
The U.S. military - industrial - bureaucratic complex is not confined to the borders of the United States .
As historian Chalmers Johnson has documented , the U.S. has over the last decades created a worldwide “ empire of military bases . ”
“ Not including the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts , ” Johnson writes , “ we now station over half a million U.S. troops , spies , contractors , dependents , and others on military bases located in more than 130 countries , many of them presided over by dictatorial regimes that have given their citizens no say in the decision to let us in . ”
The U.S. seems to have fallen into the trap that former U.S. president and Army Gen .
Dwight Eisenhower warned of in his famous , prophetic farewell speech in 1961 , in which he coined the term “ military - industrial complex . ”
Eisenhower warned that the U.S. “ must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence by the military - industrial complex . ”
Coup D’Etat
When it comes to Iran , the U.S. and the UK have never shown any interest in supporting “ freedom ” and “ democracy . ”
Since the start of the century , the Anglo - Persian Oil Company , later the Anglo - Iranian Oil Company , now BP , had an exclusive concession to Iranian oil .
In 1947 , Iranian oil workers went on strike against the atrocious conditions under which they had to work ( no vacation , no sick leave , no disability compensation , no electricity , no running water ) .
The British broke the strike by force , leaving dozens of strikers dead .
The Iranian parliament then called for the renegotiation of the concession  a proposal promoted by the highly popular politician Mohammed Mossadegh .
As the company resisted tooth and nail and tensions rose , the Iranian parliament in 1951 approved a new proposal by Mossadegh , who was soon elected prime minister by the parliament , to nationalize the oil assets .
The shah , Reza Pahlavi , felt he had no choice but to sign the bill into law .
The British reacted by organizing a boycott of Western oil companies against Iran , which led to a severe economic crisis .
Then , Britain , with the encouragement of elderly statesman Winston Churchill , engineered a coup d’etat against Mossadegh in 1952 , which failed .
At that time Iran was still looking for support from the United States , where Mossadegh was a highly popular figure .
( In 1951 Mossadegh had been declared “ Man of the Year ” by Time magazine ! )
When Eisenhower became president in 1952 , the British managed to convince the Americans to support them .
In a joint British - American coup organized by the CIA in 1953 , Mossadegh was ousted and jailed .
The exiled Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was brought back to Iran .
He immediately went on to brutally repress his political opponents , sentencing hundreds of Mossadegh ’s supporters to death .
As oil historian and Eni strategist Leonardo Maugeri observes in his new book , The Age of Oil , “ A dictatorial regime then replaced the only democratic and  paradoxically  Western - oriented experience Iran would ever know . ”
For the next 25 years the U.S. faithfully supported the regime of the shah , who was no force for “ democracy and moderation . ”
The shah ’s Savak , notes British Middle Eastern expert and veteran journalist Robert Fisk , was the most notorious and murderous secret police force in the Middle East  “ its torture chambers among the Middle East ’s most terrible institutions . ”
None of this mattered to the U.S. and other Western countries , since the shah , as Fisk notes , was “ the guardian of our oil  during his regime , international oil companies exported 24 billion barrels of oil out of Iran . ” U.S. support for the shah was so strong that “ a permanent secret U.S. mission was attached to Savak headquarters , ” where the tortures took place .
Ironically , in view of the current nuclear conflict with Iran , the U.S. in those days did its best to push nuclear power stations upon the shah .
The shah ’s nuclear ambitions were aborted only when the Iranian people rose up against his regime in 1979 .
The story of American wrongs against Iran does not end there .
A year after the Ayatollah Khomeini came to power , the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Iran .
The Reagan administration decided immediately “ to do whatever was necessary and legal ” to prevent Iraq from losing the war .
The U.S. gave $ 5.5 billion in “ loans ” to Saddam to buy arms .
Shipments from the U.S. and other Western countries to Iraq included bacterial cultures to make weapons - grade anthrax ( The Sorrows of Empire , pp. 223-224 ) .
In 1984 , the president ’s special Middle East envoy , Donald Rumsfeld , visited Baghdad to show his support for Saddam .
When Saddam carried out his infamous mass murder of the Kurds in Halabja on March 16 , 1988 , with Western - supplied chemical weapons , the American government incredibly put the blame on Iran ( see A Poisonous Affair by Joost Hiltermann ) .
The Iranians by that time had complained to the UN Security Council many times about the use of chemical weapons by Iraq against Iranian troops , but the Council did not see fit to condemn Saddam .
Rebellious Province
The current conflict  the U.S. - Iranian standoff , as Sarkozy has it  cannot be understood without reference to this historical context .
On the one hand , Iran is what it is today in large part as a result of Western policies : the Iranian people turned to radical Islam as a liberating force because the so - called forces for moderation and democracy supported the tyranny of the shah ; they turned to socialism and state intervention as the result of abuses and exploitation by Western oil companies .
On the other hand , the U.S. singles out Iran as a “ force of evil ” not because it has , in fact , such an evil regime , but because Iran refuses to subject itself to American military , political , and economic interests  because it resists America ’s striving for world hegemony .
With a bit of exaggeration Iran might be called a rebellious province of the U.S. global empire .
As a Shi’ite , Persian nation , Iran is also of course a threat to the regional hegemony of America ’s most important ally , Saudi Arabia , and the other Arab Gulf states .
Clearly there is no moral or historical justification for the current U.S. and Western policy of confrontation toward Iran .
What is more , it is counterproductive .
It favors the hard - liners and extremists inside Iran and makes it difficult for pro-Western voices to be heard .
What should be done is to reverse this policy .
The EU in particular should take the lead in ending all sanctions against Iran and welcoming that country back into the international community .
This would give moderate forces inside Iran a great boost .
Then , who knows ?
“ Regime change ” might come about after all  peacefully , and by the Iranian people ’s own choice .
The threat of nuclear war would disappear , and the world would be a safer , better place  with more oil and gas to boot .

Summary of Findings
The Republican nomination contest is being increasingly shaped by ideology and religion as it moves toward the Super Tuesday states on Feb .
5 . John McCain has moved out to a solid lead nationally , increasing his support among Republican and GOP - leaning voters from 22 % in late December to 29 % currently .
Mike Huckabee , at 20 % , and Mitt Romney , with 17 % , trail McCain .
Rudy Giuliani is a distant fourth , polling just 13 % .
Giuliani ’s support has declined seven points since late December .
McCain ’s gains over this period have come almost entirely from moderate and liberal Republicans , among whom he now holds a two - to - one lead over his rivals .
The preferences of conservative Republicans are split along religious lines .
Huckabee leads the field among conservative evangelicals , drawing 33 % to 25 % for McCain and just 12 % for Romney .
In the poll , conducted before the Michigan primary , Romney leads McCain and far outdistances Huckabee — and the rest of the GOP field — among non-evangelical conservative Republicans .
Giuliani ’s support among Republicans , as well as his personal image , has declined sharply in recent months .
Currently , 13 % of Republican and Republican - leaning voters support Giuliani , down from 26 % in November .
Favorable opinions of Giuliani also have eroded .
In August , just 15 % of Republican and Republican - leaning voters expressed an unfavorable opinion of Giuliani ; that number nearly doubled in December ( to 28 % ) , and has risen to 36 % in the current survey .
The Democratic nomination contest is being affected by different dynamics than the GOP race — class , race and gender — though ideology is a factor among the Democrats as well .
Overall , Clinton leads Obama by 46 % to 31 % , with 13 % for John Edwards .
In late December , Clinton ’s lead over Obama was 20 points ( 46 % - 26 % ) .
Obama has made substantial gains among higher - income Democratic voters .
Currently , he leads Clinton by 44%- 35 % among Democratic voters with household incomes of at least $ 75,000 a year .
In December , he trailed Clinton among Democratic voters in this group by 35 % - 31 % .
Clinton continues to hold a commanding lead among less well - off Democrats .
Obama now runs even with Clinton among liberals ; he trailed by more than 20 points among liberals in late December ( 49 % Clinton vs. 27 % Obama ) .
He also has made gains among African Americans and now holds a 52%- 33 % lead among black Democrats .
To voters , gender is being viewed as more of an issue for Clinton than race is for Obama .
Roughly four - in - ten Democratic voters ( 43 % ) , including comparable proportions of men and women , say that Clinton is being held to higher standard because she is a woman .
Just a quarter of Democrats ( 25 % ) say Obama is being held to a higher standard because he is black ; about a third of black Democrats ( 32 % ) believe Obama is being held to a higher standard because of his race , compared with 23 % of whites .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Jan. 9-13 among 1,515 adults , finds that the early primaries have had a decided impact on how voters in each party view which candidate has the best chance of winning the general election ( this survey was conducted before the Jan.15 Michigan primary ) .
More than twice as many Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters say Obama has the best chance of winning than did so in November ( 35 % now vs. 14 % then ) .
Clinton ’s advantage in electability now stands at a modest 46 % - 35 % ; two months ago , she held a 59 % - 14 % advantage .
The shifts in Republican voters ’ views about candidate electability are even more striking .
McCain is now clearly seen as the GOP candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; 42 % believe he has the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee , compared with 16 % in November .
Giuliani ’s once sizable advantage in electability has disappeared over the past two months .
The Democratic Race
Clinton ’s standing among Democratic voters nationally has changed very little in recent months , even after her defeat in Iowa and comeback victory in New Hampshire .
She currently draws 46 % of the vote , which is virtually unchanged from December and November .
Obama ’s support is up modestly from late December , shortly before the Iowa and New Hampshire contests .
Currently , he garners 31 % of the vote , up from 26 % in December and 23 % in November .
Edwards ’ national support has been largely unchanged through this period .
Currently , about half of women Democratic voters ( 49 % ) support Clinton , compared with 28 % who back Obama .
Among men , the race is much closer : 41 % favor Clinton and 36 % back Obama .
Obama has gained seven points among men since December .
The largest gender gaps are among younger people , conservative and moderate Democrats , and those with lower incomes and less education .
Clinton leads Obama among younger women ( those under age 50 ) by a 49 % - 32 % margin ; but among men in the same age group , she trails Obama by 44%- 35 % .
There are only modest gender differences among people ages 50 and older .
Clinton also holds a sizable lead ( 59 % - 22 % ) among conservative and moderate women ; but among men in this group the race is even .
Among liberals , by contrast , Obama does better among women , while Clinton fares better among men .
The gender gap is fairly small among college graduates .
However , among those who have not attended college , 57 % of women favor Clinton compared with 45 % of men .
There is no gender gap among people in households with annual incomes of greater than $ 50,000 ; among lower - income Democrats , Clinton draws much greater support among women than among men ( 57 % vs. 44 % ) .
Gender and Race
Both Democratic and Republican voters see gender as a more important factor than race in the Democratic nomination .
More voters say that Hillary Clinton is being held to a higher standard because she is a woman than say Barack Obama is being held to a higher standard because of his race .
Voters are also more likely to say that Clinton ’s gender will hurt her more than Obama ’s race will hurt him .
About four - in - ten Democratic voters ( 43 % ) say that Hillary Clinton is being held to a higher standard than other candidates because she is a woman .
Far fewer Democrats ( 25 % ) believe Obama is being held to a higher standard because of his race .
Republicans are less likely than Democrats to say that either Clinton or Obama is being held to higher standard because of their gender or race ; however , twice as many Republicans see Clinton being held to a higher standard than say that about Obama .
Among Democrats and Democratic - leaning voters , men and women ( and whites and African Americans ) are about equally likely to believe that Clinton is being held to a higher standard .
Somewhat more Republican women than GOP men say that Clinton is held to a higher standard ( 27 % vs. 18 % ) .
Black Democrats more often than white Democrats see race as a negative factor in evaluations of Obama : 32 % say he is being held to a higher standard because he is African - American ; 23 % of white Democrats say this .
Democratic and Republican voters hold similar opinions about whether race and gender will ultimately help or hurt the Democratic candidates .
For voters in both parties , the candidates ’ backgrounds — Clinton ’s involvement in her husband ’s administration and Obama ’s status as a relative newcomer to national politics — are viewed as having a greater impact on voters ’ decisions .
Roughly a third of Democratic voters ( 34 % ) , and about the same percentage of Republicans ( 35 % ) , believe that if Clinton is the Democratic nominee , the fact that she is a woman will hurt her candidacy .
Far more believe she will either be helped by her gender or it will make no difference .
Clinton ’s involvement in Bill Clinton ’s administration is seen as a more important factor — 53 % of Democrats say it will help her , while 46 % of Republicans say it will hurt .
Fewer voters believe that Obama ’s race will have a negative impact on his candidacy : 29 % of Democrats and 22 % of Republicans believe that if Obama is the Democratic nominee , his race will hurt him .
Black and white Democrats do not differ in their opinions ; roughly three - in - ten in each group say he will be hurt , while two - in - ten say he will be helped .
For both Democrats and Republicans , Obama ’s limited experience in national politics is viewed as a bigger factor than his race .
More than four - in - ten Democrats ( 44 % ) , and 52 % of Republicans , believe that Obama being relatively new to national politics will hurt him with voters .
The Republican Race
In late December , McCain , Giuliani and Huckabee had comparable levels of support nationally : McCain drew 22 % , Giuliani 20 % and Huckabee 17 % .
McCain is now the national frontrunner at 29 % , followed by Huckabee ( 20 % ) and Romney ( 17 % ) .
Despite winning neither of the early contests , Romney ’s support nationwide has risen five points since late December .
Fred Thompson draws the same low level of support that he did in late December ( 9 % ) .
In September , shortly after he announced his candidacy , Thompson had 22 % of the GOP vote and ran second to Giuliani in the national survey .
Religion continues to be a major factor in the GOP contest .
Huckabee holds a slim lead among white evangelical Protestants ( 34 % vs. 27 % for McCain ) , while McCain holds a substantial lead among white mainline Protestants , as well as among white Catholics .
Among white Republican mainline Protestants , McCain leads by 29 % to 17 % over Giuliani ; he nearly doubles the support of Romney and Giuliani , his next closest competitors , among white Catholics ( 41 % McCain vs. 21 % Romney , 20 % Giuliani ) .
Despite his declining support , Giuliani has held on to some of his support in the states with primaries and caucuses between Jan. 29 and Feb .
5 . When these 22 states are analyzed together , 17 % back Giuliani , only slightly behind Romney ( 18 % ) , Huckabee ( 20 % ) and McCain ( 25 % ) .
McCain ’s lead over the rest of the field is far stronger in the states with primaries later on the calendar .
As Republican voters look at the field of candidates running for their party ’s nomination , they see substantial ideological differences .
Rudy Giuliani is perceived to be far more moderate than other leading candidates .
Just 38 % of Republican and Republican - leaning voters describe Giuliani as “ conservative , ” while 40 % say he is “ moderate ” and 22 % describe him as “ liberal . ”
By comparison , 50 % of Republicans say John McCain is conservative , and roughly two - thirds describe both Mitt Romney ( 68 % ) and Mike Huckabee ( 65 % ) as conservative .
In this regard , both Romney and Huckabee come closer to how Republican voters describe themselves : 66 % of Republican and Republican - leaning registered voters think of themselves as conservative , while 29 % say they are moderate and just 4 % say they are liberal .
Many Democratic voters also see ideological differences between Clinton and Obama .
Nearly half of Democrats ( 47 % ) describe Barack Obama as “ liberal , ” compared with 38 % who say the same about Hillary Clinton .
And 29 % think Clinton is “ conservative , ” compared with 19 % who say Obama is conservative .
Clinton ’s average rating is somewhat more conservative , and Obama ’s is somewhat more liberal , than where Democratic voters typically place themselves .
About a third of Democrats ( 34 % ) describe themselves as liberal , 44 % as moderate , and 22 % as conservative .
Republicans see both Clinton and Obama as far more liberal candidates than do Democrats .
And also unlike Democrats , Republicans see Clinton as the more liberal of the two .
Eight - in - ten Republican voters ( 81 % ) describe Clinton as liberal , with 42 % saying that she is “ very liberal ” .
Obama is also thought of as a liberal candidate by most Republicans ( 70 % ) , but substantially fewer describe him as “ very liberal ” compared with Clinton ( 24 % ) .
While perceptions of Clinton and Obama are starkly different across party lines , the leading GOP candidates look more similar to both groups of voters .
In general , Democratic voters give roughly the same ideological ratings to McCain , Huckabee and Romney as do Republican voters .
While Giuliani ’s popularity continues to decline among his own party ’s voters , the images of McCain and Huckabee have improved .
About seven - in - ten Republican voters ( 71 % ) now express a favorable opinion of McCain , up from 65 % last month .
And while as many Republicans offer positive ratings of Huckabee as rate Giuliani favorably ( 57 % ) , the former Arkansas governor receives considerably better marks now than he did in December 2007 , when fewer than half of Republican voters had a favorable opinion ( 47 % ) .
Views of Mitt Romney have improved somewhat .
More Republicans now offer an opinion of Romney , and just over half of Republican voters ( 55 % ) have a positive opinion , a modest increase from last month ( 49 % ) .
McCain Popular Among Key GOP Groups
McCain receives solid favorable ratings from all key groups of Republican voters .
Republican - leaning independents offer nearly identical ratings of McCain as do those who identify as Republicans .
Fully two - thirds of conservative white evangelical Protestant GOP voters have a favorable view of McCain , as do nearly three - quarters of other conservatives ( 72 % ) , and moderate and liberal Republicans ( 74 % ) .
McCain also receives virtually identical ratings from younger and older voters , men and women , and voters of different educational backgrounds .
Views of the other leading GOP candidates are not as uniformly positive .
Seven - in - ten conservative white evangelical Protestants ( 70 % ) have a favorable impression of Huckabee , but smaller majorities of other conservatives ( 55 % ) and moderates and liberals ( 52 % ) share that view .
Nearly three - in - ten ( 28 % ) conservative Republicans who are not white evangelicals offer an unfavorable opinion of Huckabee .
By contrast , Mitt Romney ’s best ratings come from conservative Republican voters who are not white evangelicals ; about two - thirds in this group ( 66 % ) offer a positive view of him .
On the other hand , just over half ( 51 % ) of white evangelical conservatives rate him favorably , while three - in - ten have an unfavorable view .
Romney is even less popular among moderate and liberal Republican voters ; fewer than half in that group ( 43 % ) have a positive opinion of the former Massachusetts governor , and nearly as many have a negative opinion ( 39 % ) .
Views of Giuliani are the most mixed .
Sizable minorities in all key groups give Giuliani unfavorable ratings , including about four - in - ten white evangelical conservatives and moderates and liberals .
Even among non-evangelical conservatives , Giuliani ’s strongest group , nearly three - in - ten ( 29 % ) have a negative opinion of him .
Huckabee supporters offer the most negative ratings of other leading GOP candidates .
More than half of those who say they are voting for Huckabee rate Giuliani unfavorably ( 54 % ) , and more express a negative view of Romney ( 45 % ) than express a positive view ( 36 % ) .
The Democratic Field
Views of the leading Democratic candidates have not changed significantly since before the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary .
Hillary Clinton is evaluated favorably by nearly eight - in - ten Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters ( 79 % ) , while nearly three - quarters ( 73 % ) express positive opinions of Barack Obama .
John Edwards receives considerably lower marks than do Clinton and Obama ; six - in - ten have a positive opinion of the former North Carolina senator , while about a quarter ( 26 % ) have a negative view .
Solid majorities of Democratic voters in all key groups express favorable views of Clinton , but she is especially popular among blacks ( 87 % ) , women ( 83 % ) and liberals ( 85 % ) .
Obama is also highly popular among most groups , especially among college graduates ( 88 % favorable ) and liberals ( 87 % ) .
Conservative Democrats , however , rate Obama much less favorably than they rate Clinton .
Seven - in - ten conservative Democrats have a positive opinion of Clinton , while just over half ( 54 % ) have a positive view of Obama .
Just half of conservative Democrats ( 50 % ) view Edwards favorably .
Clinton supporters rate Obama and Edwards somewhat less favorably than their supporters rate her .
Two - thirds of Democrats who support Obama for the party ’s nomination and 60 % of those who support Edwards have a positive opinion of Clinton .
By contrast , just 57 % of Clinton supporters have positive views of Obama and even fewer ( 47 % ) have a favorable impression of Edwards .
Strong majorities of independent voters express positive views of John McCain ( 64 % ) and Barack Obama ( 62 % ) .
No other candidate is viewed favorably by a majority of independent voters .
Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton receive the highest unfavorable ratings .
Fully half of independent voters rate Giuliani negatively and about the same number has an unfavorable view of Clinton ( 48 % ) .
Like Clinton , Huckabee receives mixed ratings among independents , though he is not as well known as Clinton .
About as many independent voters have an unfavorable impression of Huckabee as a favorable one ( 40 % vs. 36 % ) .
Views of Bloomberg
Amid speculation that Michael Bloomberg may run for president , the survey shows that large minorities of Republican , Democratic and independent voters have negative views of the New York City mayor ; about as many are not familiar enough with Bloomberg to offer a rating .
Bloomberg is especially unpopular among Democrats .
More than four - in - ten ( 44 % ) view him unfavorably , compared with 39 % of Republicans and 38 % of independents .
Republicans and independents are also less familiar with Bloomberg .
About half of Republican voters ( 48 % ) could not offer a rating .
‘ Change ’ Seen as Most Important
As was the case in Iowa and New Hampshire , change has become a major theme of the national primary campaign .
Overall , more than a third of voters ( 35 % ) rate the ability to bring about needed change as the most important candidate quality , followed by saying what the candidate believes ( 24 % ) , having the best experience ( 19 % ) , and caring about average people ( 15 % ) .
Roughly four - in - ten Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters ( 41 % ) view the ability to effect change as the most important candidate quality — more than double the percentage naming any other trait .
Among Democratic voters , liberals ( at 51 % ) are the most likely to view change as most important .
Among Republican and Republican - leaning voters , change is not valued as highly as a candidate quality .
For about a third ( 32 % ) , a candidate saying what they believe is most important , while 27 % see the ability to bring needed change as most important .
There is greater agreement among Democrats and Republicans about the kind of change they would most like to see in Washington .
A plurality of both Democratic voters ( 37 % ) and Republican voters ( 43 % ) say that getting the two major parties to work together is most important .
Smaller numbers in each party view reducing the influence of money and special interests , or changing foreign and domestic policies as most important .
Voters Mostly Satisfied With Their Choices
In the wake of the Iowa and New Hampshire contests , both Democratic and Republican voters have become increasingly satisfied with the quality of candidates running for their parties ’ nominations .
Currently , 78 % of Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters say they have an excellent or good impression of the candidates running in their party , and 28 % describe the field as excellent .
This is up from 67 % expressing satisfaction in November .
Republican and Republican - leaning voters remain somewhat less satisfied than Democrats with the choices available to them , though their views of the GOP field have improved since the fall .
Currently , 68 % say the party ’s candidates are excellent or good , up from 56 % in November .
The greatest gains in satisfaction on the GOP side come from the Christian conservative and moderate wings of the party .
In November , just 47 % of moderate and liberal Republicans were satisfied with the field of candidates .
Today , 64 % of moderate and liberal voters say they have an excellent or good impression of the GOP candidates .
Similarly , just 55 % of conservative white evangelical Protestants expressed satisfaction with their choices in November , compared with 68 % today .
Following the early caucuses and primaries , more voters are focusing intently on the candidates .
Fully half of registered voters now say they have given a lot of thought to the candidates running for president this year , up from 40 % on the eve of the Iowa caucuses .
In October , only about a third ( 34 % ) reported this level of serious consideration .

Tom Hanks and Paul Giamatti took the Capitol by storm last night for the premier of their mini-series , John Adams .
Hanks garners a level of star power that brings out some of the Hill ’s finest to gawk , but as he was walking through the halls of the Capitol , it seemed like Hanks was the one in awe .
( Photo by John Shinkle )
As he was giving his entourage a history lesson of the building , Hanks told Politico that the building “ just knocks you back . ”
He stopped at the statue of Philo T. Farnsworth , inventor of the first completely electronic television and referred to him as “ the father of HBO . ”
Among the entourage was Hanks ’ daughter , Liz , who , dressed in a fabulous sequined t- shirt dress ( from Banana Republic on sale , she told us ) , affectionately shepherded Hanks around with a , “ This way Dad . ”
Nancy Pelosi gave Giamatti a shout out for being an Italian John Adams .
The feature ’s director , Tom Hooper , said he cast Giamatti because he ’s real .
“ The last thing I wanted to do was cast a dashing , masculine idol to play John Adams , when the man in reality was a balding , plump , middle aged man , ” Hooper told Politico .
Not that he was calling Giamatti plump and middle aged , but he did say Giamatti provides a level of surprise for the audience .

Kirk Ellis , the screenwriter that adapted David McCullough ’s epic biography , said the adaptation took five and a half years , just a year and half shy of the seven years it took McCullough to write the book .
McCullough , who also was in attendance , worked closely with Ellis on the screenplay , giving notes on various drafts throughout .
In addition to the honored guests of Pelosi , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , who each got a shout out from HBO co-president Richard Plepler .
Spotted at the reception with appropriately tooth - picked apps were Reps .
Dave Obey ( D - Wisc. ) and Jane Harman ( D - Calif . ) and former Rep. Tim Roemer ( D - Ind . ) .
Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) was also there , but when Pelosi was shouting , “ Teddy !
Come back ! ” word is he had already left to show some fatherly support for his son , Rep. Patrick Kennedy ( D - R.I. ) , who had legislation on the floor .
And of course , no trip to Washington is complete without some political chatter .
Hanks , an Obama supporter , said , “ I wish the election was being held tomorrow .
I ’m bored ! ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A fire sale of Bear Stearns Cos Inc stunned Wall Street and pummeled global financial stocks on the eve of an expected U.S. interest rate cut aimed at preventing a meltdown of the financial system .
On a day marked by gut - wrenching drops of financial shares such as Lehman Brothers , U.S. stocks almost ventured into bear market territory -- a drop of 20 percent from the October high .
The market staged a late partial recovery as optimism set in over an expected decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to slash rates by as much as 1 percentage point on Tuesday to jump - start financial markets and prevent a recession .
The cut would be the latest in a series that has brought down borrowing costs but hammered the U.S. dollar to record lows .
“ They have spent some bullets .
The Fed has a lot more bullets than we ’ve seen so far , ” said Brian Edmonds , managing director of fixed income at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York .
Things looked bleak on Monday morning .
Staff at Bear Stearns ’ Manhattan headquarters were welcomed to work by a two - dollar bill stuck to the revolving doors -- a spoof on the rock - bottom price of $ 2 a share that JPMorgan Chase is paying for the firm .
A hopeful Coldwell Banker real estate agent was hawking cheap apartments to employees who saw the value of their stock options go up in smoke .
The combination of Bear ’s swift bailout and the Fed ’s offer on Sunday to extend direct lending to securities firms for the first time since the Great Depression highlighted just how hard the credit crisis has hit Wall Street .
And it scared market players worldwide .
“ If you get a crisis of confidence in the wholesale banking space and something the size of Bear Stearns could go under , then people start to panic .
You get a real fear factor , ” said Simon Maughan , analyst at MF Global in London .
The grim mood spread .
Investors bailed from rival Lehman for fear it would be next to face a cash crunch .
Lehman shares plummeted 48 percent to a nearly 8 - year low but partly recovered to close down 19 percent .
JPMorgan shares , by contrast , jumped 10 percent after the bank set a deal to buy Bear for $ 236 million , or a little over $ 2 a share -- a fraction of its 2007 high of $ 172.61 .
JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon , a details - oriented Wall Street luminary with a track record of fixing up banks , also got the Fed to agree to guarantee up to $ 30 billion of Bear ’s hard - to - value assets .
“ When you get the most severely damaged collateral and cover yourself to the tune of $ 30 billion , that cushion goes a long way , ” explained Bill Fitzpatrick , an analyst at Optique Capital , which owns shares of JPMorgan .
CONNECTIVITY - NOT ALWAYS A GOOD THING
Starting with packaging and reselling loans to U.S. borrowers with spotty credit , Wall Street ’s financial engineering led to a global boom in complex debt instruments that are now very tough to value .
Markets for these securities have dried up and caused multibillion - dollar losses at banks worldwide -- from the biggest names in banking to regional German banks few had ever heard of before disaster struck .
The financial world is more interconnected than ever and the merest whiff of trouble can result in an old - fashioned bank run : traders and funds pulling out money and calling in loans .
Bear ’s demise shows how fast things can change on Wall Street .
Less than a week ago , the firm ’s stock was trading at more than $ 60 a share and its chief insisted it was in good shape .
On Monday afternoon , phones at Bear ’s trading floor were dead .

Bankers around the world were already fretting about job losses because of the endless series of credit losses .
It could get worse :
The mayhem could spill over to Main Street , already reeling from a housing crisis .
That ’s why policymakers are pulling out all the stops , from cutting interest rates to flooding the financial system with cash to prevent it from seizing up .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , a student of the Depression , is now using tools the Fed has n’t touched since the 1930s .
Trying to assuage worries that the credit crisis is spinning out of control , President George W. Bush said the United States was “ on top of the situation . ”
Bush , who came under fire for lack of leadership by Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton , later met with top financial regulators , including U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Bernanke .
Paulson defended the government - sponsored Bear Stearns rescue as a better option than letting it go bust .

Government funds from the booming Gulf and Asia - Pacific regions have pitched in by buying stakes in big - name banks such as Citi and brokerages such as Merrill Lynch .
This time around , though , the sovereign wealth funds were conspicuously absent -- spelling trouble ahead .
“ There ’s no way anybody ’s going to catch a falling knife .
Why come in now ? ” said Craig Russell , Beijing - based chief market strategist at Saxo Bank .
The problem is that banks need the cash to shore up their balance sheets .
So shares of European banks -- including UBS in Switzerland , HBOS in Britain and SocGen in France -- fell more than 10 percent on concerns they have to take bigger hits -- haircuts , in Wall Street speak -- on their holdings of credit assets .
IN MOURNING
The sale of Bear was a rude awakening to the 85 - year - old firm ’s 14,000 staff , who own roughly 30 percent of the company .
Overnight , fat options packages turned worthless and job security vanished .
“ The valuation is virtually nothing , ” said a Singapore - based Bear Stearns employee .
“ It is indeed rock bottom .
We have tanked .
It ’s very , very sad .
Everyone is in mourning . ”
The mood among U.S. staff was similarly solemn , with financial TV network CNBC reporting that JPMorgan is looking to cut half of the Bear work force .
“ I ’ve been at Bear for 11 years and I want to vomit , ” said a Bear Stearns employee who described himself as a partner .
A lot of people lost a lot of money .
At a neighborhood party in New Jersey over the weekend , a Bear Stearns office plodder told a longtime stock broker colleague at the firm who lost $ 9 million in wealth : “ You lost a lot more than I did .
You ’re a big fish . ”
And then there is English entrepreneur Joe Lewis , a high - stakes currency trader who bought a stake of about 10 percent in Bear and about $ 1 billion in the hole .
He called the JPMorgan ’s offer “ derisory . ”
Lewis himself is now seen as damaged goods .
Futures brokerage MF Global assured the market that Lewis was not on its client roster as investors pushed down its shares as much as 78 percent for fear Bear ’s collapse might spill over .
Any crisis brings opportunities , though .
Phones were ringing off the hook at law firms that specialize in suing corporations whose stock has plummeted .
“ Shareholders do n’t contact me when they are happy with the way things are going with their investments , ” said Ira Press , a lawyer at class - action firm Kirby McInerney .
It ’s Star Wars meets the Ten Commandments .
A $ 50 million , no , make that $ 100 million futuristic fantasy film ( with funding coming from “ the Germans ” ) that a San Francisco pastor said he was commanded to make by that Studio Chief in the Sky .
The story would be far too weird to believe had doc filmmaker Michael Jacobs not captured it all on film .
He played his Audience of One at last weekend ’s True / False Festival ( which , quick pitch , is the hippest festival in the UNIVERSE and , quick disclaimer , I do some writing for ) , continuing a festival run that includes wins at the Bend , SXSW , Silverdocs and SFDoc fests .
Our hero is Pentecostal pastor Richard Gazowski , who seems to spend much of his Sunday sermon preaching the gospel of big - budget indie cinema .
He watched his first movie at 40 , has never directed anything , but anticipates making the biggest blockbuster ever .
One thing going for Gazowski :
He ’s persuasive enough to talk a bunch of people in working for him ( and his wife agrees to sell their house to cover a trip to Italy to shoot the exterior scenes ) .
As he stalks the Italian set wearing an outfit that could have been lifted from a spoof of Orson Welles , Gazowski wrangles with his neglected actors ( found via Craigslist ) , leads prayer sessions and urges on his design crew to create ever - more - wacked futuristic costumes and sets .
Anyone who has seen Burden of Dreams , Lost in La Mancha or Hearts of Darkness knows how this narrative unfolds : Everything goes wrong .
When Gazowski returns home , he and his quest to make the movie gets weirder .
And weirder .
And funnier .
Audience of One has n’t found a home yet , but Jacobs said talks are underway with broadcasters and distributors .

9 -11 ..... Who Really Did It ?
US News Media 's Latest Disgrace
After prying loose 8,000 pages of Pentagon documents , the New York Times has proven what should have been obvious years ago : the Bush administration manipulated public opinion on the Iraq War , in part , by funneling propaganda through former senior military officers who served as expert analysts on TV news shows .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
In 2002 - 03 , these military analysts were ubiquitous on TV justifying the Iraq invasion , and most have remained supportive of the war in the five years since .
The Times investigation showed that the analysts were being briefed by the Pentagon on what to say and had undisclosed conflicts of interest via military contracts .
Retired Green Beret Robert S. Bevelacqua , a former Fox News analyst , said the Pentagon treated the retired military officers as puppets : “ It was them saying , ‘ we need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you . ’ ” [ NYT , April 20 , 2008 ]
None of that , of course , should come as any surprise .
Where do people think generals and admirals go to work after they retire from the government ?
If they play ball with the Pentagon , they get fat salaries serving on corporate boards of military contractors , or they get rich running consultancies that trade on quick access to high - ranking administration officials .
If they ’re not team players , they ’re shut out .
Yet , what may be more troubling , although perhaps no more surprising , is how willingly the U.S. news media let itself be used as a propaganda conduit for the Bush administration regarding the ill - advised invasion of Iraq .
Fox News may have been the prototype of the flag - waving “ news ” outlet that fawned over pro-war retired military officers and mocked anti-war citizens .
But the same imbalance could be found at the major networks , like NBC where then - anchor Tom Brokaw spoke in the first person plural as he sat among a panel of retired brass on the night of the Iraq invasion – March 19 , 2003 – and said : " In a few days , we 're going to own that country . "
The blame also goes far beyond the TV networks , to the most prestigious print publications .
The New York Times famously promoted fictional stories about Iraqi aluminum tubes for building nuclear weapons , and the Washington Post editorial page remains to this day an ardent cheerleader for the war .
So , the real question is not how widespread the ethical lapses of the U.S. news media were – both in palming off self - interested ex-generals as objective observers and for failing to demonstrate even a modicum of skepticism in publishing false articles that paved the way to war .
Rather , the urgent question is what must be done if the United States is to reclaim its status as a functioning constitutional Republic in which a reasonably honest news media keeps the public adequately informed .
Having spent most of my career on the inside at places such as the Associated Press and Newsweek , it ’s been my view for many years that the mainstream U.S. news media ca n’t be reformed , that it is beyond hope .
Though there are still good journalists working at major news companies – and the better news outlets do produce some useful information , like Sunday ’s story in the Times – the central reality is that corporate journalism is rotten at the core and wo n't stop spreading the rot throughout the U.S. political process .
That ’s why for the past dozen - plus years at Consortiumnews.com , we have called for a major public investment in honest journalism , so information can be produced that it is both professional and independent of the kinds of external pressures that have deformed today ’s mainstream press .
We must find new ways to tell the news .
The Reagan Era
The scope of the problem dawned on me in the late 1980s , as I watched the widespread criminality of the Iran - Contra and related scandals – ranging from money - laundering , gun-smuggling , drug - trafficking and acts of terrorism – get swept under the rug because they implicated senior U.S. officials .
During those years , I witnessed the Washington press corps – which still basked in the glory of Watergate and the Pentagon Papers – rushing headlong toward becoming little more than a propaganda funnel for the powers - that - be .
Indeed , in 1992 , my first book , Fooling America , argued that the Watergate - Vietnam - era press corps was undergoing a historic transformation into a snarky conveyor of ill - considered conventional wisdom .
The book also made the case that this transformation was not accidental , nor was it driven just by corporate greed and journalistic careerism ( though there was plenty of both ) .
There also was a powerful ideological component .
Behind the scenes , the Reagan administration had constructed a domestic framework modeled after CIA psychological warfare programs abroad .
The main difference this time was that the psy - op took aim at the American people with the goal of managing how they perceived events , what insiders called “ perception management . ”
From documents that I uncovered during the Iran - Contra scandal , it was clear that the motive behind this extraordinary operation was the bitterness that conservatives felt toward the mass protests against the Vietnam War and toward American journalists whose reporting supposedly had undermined the war effort .
So , Ronald Reagan ’s team made it a high priority to rein in troublesome journalists and to reverse the so - called “ Vietnam Syndrome , ” the American people ’s revulsion over any more foreign military adventures .
The documents revealed that the domestic operation took shape in the early 1980s under the guidance of CIA Director William Casey , who even donated one of the CIA ’s top propagandists , Walter Raymond Jr. , to manage the program from inside President Reagan ’s National Security Council staff .
Other factors fed into the success of this propaganda operation , especially the rise of a bright group of political intellectuals known as the neoconservatives .
They proved especially adept at using McCarthyistic tactics to marginalize and silence dissent .
The crowning achievement of this decade - long effort came during the first Persian Gulf War of 1990 - 91 .
President George H.W. Bush believed that a successful U.S. - led ground offensive could finish the job of bringing the American people back from their post - Vietnam malaise .
However , after months of devastating aerial bombings , Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had persuaded Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait with no more killing , and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and other front - line U.S. commanders favored the deal .
But Bush rebuffed the offer , instead ordering the ground attack that slaughtered tens of thousands of fleeing Iraqi troops during a 100 - hour campaign .
[ For details , see the Colin Powell chapter of Neck Deep . ]
When the ground war ended , Bush offered an insight into his central motivation .
In his first comments about the U.S. victory , he declared : “ By God , we ’ve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all . ”
Amid the war euphoria , some American journalists who had thought a less violent solution should have been pursued – including conservative columnist Robert Novak – offered cringing self - criticisms about their mistaken doubts .
The only sustained criticism of President Bush on the war came from the neocons , like Charles Krauthammer , who complained that Bush should have let the killing go on , that he stopped the ground war too soon , that he should have conquered Baghdad and occupied Iraq .
In my book , Fooling America , I told the story of this decline and fall of the U.S. news media , from its glory days of Watergate to its groveling days of the early 1990s .
But 16 years ago , few people wanted to hear the story – or believe it .
The common view at the time was that the Washington press corps was still the aggressive watchdog of Watergate fame and , if anything , was too “ liberal . ”
Though I had a major publisher in Morrow , the book got little circulation and was trashed by key book reviewers , including one from the Washington Post .
The thought that the heroic Washington press corps was changing into something cowardly and reckless was an idea whose time had not yet come .
[ Fooling America has long been out of print , but some of the material can be found in Robert Parry ’s later books , Lost History , Secrecy & Privilege and Neck Deep . ]
Repeating History
In the investigation of how the Pentagon used TV military analysts to sell the Iraq War – thus allowing George W. Bush to “ complete the job ” left unfinished by his dad – the New York Times also traced the administration ’s P.R. theories back to the Vietnam War and to the early days of the Reagan era .
“ Many [ TV military analysts ] also shared with Mr. Bush ’s national security team a belief that pessimistic war coverage broke the nation ’s will to win in Vietnam , and there was a mutual resolve not to let that happen with this war , ” the Times reported in the article by David Barstow .
“ This was a major theme , for example , with Paul E. Vallely , a Fox News analyst from 2001 to 2007 .
A retired Army general who had specialized in psychological warfare , Mr. Vallely co-authored a paper in 1980 that accused American news organizations of failing to defend the nation from ‘ enemy ’ propaganda during Vietnam .
“ ‘ We lost the war – not because we were outfought , but because we were out Psyoped , ’ he wrote .
He urged a radically new approach to psychological operations in future wars – taking aim not just at foreign adversaries but at domestic audiences , too .
“ He called his approach ‘ MindWar ’ – using network TV and radio to ‘ strengthen our national will to victory . ’”
But the danger of “ MindWar , ” aimed by the U.S. government at the American people , is that it turns inside - out the concept of a democratic Republic in which a well - informed people exercise meaningful control over their government .
Instead , you end up with a duplicitous government using propaganda , fear and intimidation to whip the people into line .
Rather than the government being the servant of the people , the people become the servant of the government .
Then , as undemocratic regimes have shown throughout history – with the voice of the people silenced – insiders get a free hand to carry out foolhardy policies and to line the pockets of their friends .
With the U.S. taxpayers now looking at an open - ended Iraq
War with the total cost possibly reaching $ 3 trillion , it should n’t be too hard to figure out who the “ winners ” were in this “ MindWar . ”
Often they were the same TV military analysts and news media pundits who were advocating for the invasion more than five years ago .
Almost everyone of them has made out like bandits , many with fat stock portfolios and posh vacation homes , not to mention appreciative CEOs back at corporate central .
The “ losers ” should be equally apparent .
Besides the fleeced American taxpayers , there have been more than 4,000 U.S. soldiers dead , another 30,000 wounded , and hundreds of thousands of dead and maimed Iraqis .
This bloody march of folly began some three decades ago when the U.S. news media began surrendering its responsibility to keep the people informed and instead opted for the easier and more lucrative role of acting as propagandists for the powerful .
The New York Times article is just further proof of that sorry reality .

Approximately two weeks after we reported on TuneBoom Pro , a tool apparently used by major labels and indie artists to artificially inflate the number of times their songs had been streamed on MySpace , the site has gone offline .
We had contacted MySpace about TuneBoom Pro , but it 's unclear whether MySpace had anything to do with the site 's disappearance .
Update : Bands Divided Over MySpace Play - Count Boosters .
One way or another , the site is offline .
However , bands and labels looking for a way to fake MySpace popularity have plenty of other ways to manipulate their play counts on MySpace Music .
A reader recently sent in a list of 46 alternatives to the possibly defunct TuneBoom Pro service .
Is it wrong to inflate MySpace song plays ?
If every other band and label is doing it , you almost have to – just like baseball players and steroids .
It 's unlikely that MySpace will be able to defeat every type of play count - increasing technology , just like it 's unlikely that Major League Baseball will ever be able to do away completely with all performance - enhancing drugs .
For the music fan , the only sensible solution is to assume that ahigh number of MySpace play counts or a MySpace chart appearance may not mean anything .
The same goes for the number of Facebook friends a company has .
Leaving this dilemma aside for the moment , here 's the anonymousListening Post reader e-mail that brought TuneBoom 's possible closureto our attention ( edited for clarity ) :
TuneBoom was great .
I do n't know if you wanted to shut them down ornot , but I could understand , as most of these are scams and you can ' ttell which are which ... lol ... but TuneBoom was great – a nice bunch of guys !
Theyreally cared , man ... very pro .
I used a few of the others and they wereterrible .
TuneBoom did traditional marketing also and did pressreleases , all sorts of promo .
I 'll miss them ... these others seemjust more like sharks .
If anyone has had a positive or negative experience with any ofthese other services , please drop me an e-mail by clicking on thelittle envelope symbol at the top of this post .
I 'll keep your name outof it – just wondering what they have been like to deal with , and whatthe results have been .
Did one of these 46 companies help send yourband to the top of the MySpace charts ?
Update : A Listening
Post reader writes , " We have been using this program to add about 500 plays a day afterbeing told A&R people were looking for song plays and show adds .
I
used to use a friend adder but that was a little sketchy and dangerous , [ and ] this thing can't get you busted .
It 's just an app that you download for $ 50 and [ it ] adds plays and or visits in any amount you tell it .
You can doit via a proxy IP to look like you are getting listens from around theworld , and set the interval between hits .
It ca n't get you in trouble , asyou could target a rival band ...
No dealings with the company but itworks . "

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A roadside bomb killed three U.S. soldiers in Iraq on Saturday , pushing the U.S. death toll closer to the 4,000 mark at the start of the sixth year of the war for U.S. troops .
The deaths , which brought the number of U.S. soldiers killed since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 to 3,996 , came three days after President George W. Bush said the United States was on track to victory in Iraq .
In an upbeat speech marking the fifth anniversary of the war , Bush acknowledged the “ high cost in lives and treasure ” but said a U.S. troop build - up in Iraq had reduced violence there and opened the door to a strategic victory in the war on terror .
The war is a major issue in the presidential campaign , with Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton calling for an early troop withdrawal timetable .
Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain wants to keep troops in Iraq until it is more stable .
The U.S. military said the three soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb blew up near their vehicle northwest of Baghdad .
Two Iraqi civilians also died in the attack .
It gave no further details about where the incident occurred .
Roadside bombs are the biggest killers of soldiers in Iraq .
On Friday , a U.S. soldier died from wounds sustained from “ indirect fire ” , a term commonly used by the military to refer to a mortar or rocket attack , south of Baghdad .
Six members of a U.S. - backed neighborhood patrol group were killed early on Saturday in a U.S. helicopter strike on their checkpoint in Salahuddin province , police and a local tribal leader said .
The U.S. military said it had conducted a helicopter attack in the province , but denied it had attacked a checkpoint .
It said the strike killed six men suspected of placing roadside bombs .
Investigations were under way , the military said .
SUNNI PATROL TENSIONS
The U.S. military has credited the formation of what it calls Concerned Local Citizen groups ( CLCs ) , also known as Awakening Councils , for playing a crucial role in a 60 percent drop in violence across Iraq since last June .
The mostly Sunni Arab neighborhood patrols have some 90,000 men in western Anbar and provinces north and south of Baghdad .
The U.S. military pays them $ 300 a month to patrol their neighborhoods and man checkpoints .

Tribal leader Abu Faruq said Saturday ’s air strike took place on a CLC checkpoint near the town of Ishaqi , 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of Baghdad .
“ They knew all this area under is my control , and all the men were in uniform and were not firing their weapons , so why did this happen ?
If Awakening checkpoints are hit this way , it is a disaster , ” he said .
The incident is the latest in a string of disputes between the CLCs and the U.S. military .
In November , U.S. warplanes attacked a CLC checkpoint north of Baghdad , killing 25 men .
In February , CLCs in Jurf al - Sukr , south of Baghdad , said U.S. forces killed three of their number , and in the same month , neighborhood patrols in Diyala province , north of Baghdad , temporarily stopped working to demand more pay and the removal of a local police chief .
The southern Baghdad districts of Shurta and Hay al - Amil and the southern city of Kut were reported to be quiet on Saturday after Mehdi Army fighters loyal to Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr clashed with Iraqi and U.S. forces a day earlier .
Sadr imposed a unilateral ceasefire on his unruly militia last August and extended it last month , a move U.S. commanders say has helped to reduce violence in Iraq .
But the gunbattles in Baghdad and Kut have raised fears that it may be unravelling at a time when the U.S. military is in the process of withdrawing 20,000 troops .
Mehdi Army fighters have complained that the truce ties their hands and opens them to attack by rival Shi’ite factions and U.S. forces .
U.S. commanders say they only target Mehdi Army units that have ignored Sadr ’s ceasefire order .
It 's the bridge porting ... love it or hate it its a distinctive ' brap brap brap ' sound .
At those levels of boost and that sized porting those definitely do n't qualify for anything streatable .
But damn , those are some insane numbers .
Rotary 's definitely have their niche , normally aspirated they are nearly bullet proof high rpm goodness for the road .
Under 15 lbs of boost and a little bit of mild porting and they make great street racers that last a ' reasonable ' amount of time .
Crazy high end tuned bridge ported , crazy boosted mad engines like those probably do n't last much longer than any typical funny car engine , but its probably one of the least expensive ways to get seriously low numbers .
Oh , and I think a good mildly ported turbocharged rotary with decent exhaust system sounds pretty nice .
Harrington , Wash .
“ That door , ” he says with dramatic pause .
“ That door weighs 4,000 pounds .
It ’s been reinforced to withstand a nuclear blast . ”
Peter Davenport has a radio voice , the kind of exaggerated baritone that cuts through walls and most doors , but not this one .
This is solid steel and a foot thick .
It is Davenport ’s door , which opens into a tunnel leading below ground to what was once a nuclear missile complex here in the desert of eastern Washington .
The Air Force decommissioned the site in the mid-1960s and it sat empty for most of the time since .
Davenport , longtime director of the National UFO Reporting Center , a nonprofit clearinghouse and 24 - hour hotline for UFO sightings , bought it for $ 100,000 two years ago to turn into his new headquarters .
Why does a man buy an old windowless missile complex deep underground , only to spend his days tracking unidentified objects flying through the sky ?
Davenport does n’t have an answer .
Furthermore , he does n’t need one .
As a full - time UFO investigator and possessor of one of the world ’s most comprehensive , though unofficial , UFO databases , his life already runs counter to convention .
The center , in continuous operation since 1970 , is known worldwide among those interested in UFOs : scientists as well as people surfing the Web .
The hotline is posted on various UFO websites , and calls -- as many as 20,000 in a year -- come from people who believe they ’ve seen or experienced something beyond the ordinary , potentially involving extraterrestrials .
If the case seems compelling and is a short flight away , Davenport will investigate in person .
He takes written reports , records testimony and consults experts in specialty areas .
Davenport , 60 , is a passionate , cerebral man with a haughty disdain for the media .
“ I do not countenance fools , ” he had said earlier that day , almost as a warning .
“ The work of studying UFOs is of immense consequence to every living thing on this planet .
If I sense you are wasting my time , I will be blunt . ”
His life revolves around a question , namely : “ Are we alone in the universe or are we not ? ”
He believes there are clues behind the monstrous door that he now faces .
He picks up a shovel .
He has not been to his missile site in weeks , and 3 feet of snow blocks the doorway .
He breaks up chunks and shovels them to the side .
It is 34 degrees on a late March afternoon , the sun just beginning to set over this patch of land 50 miles west of Spokane .
Not a single house can be seen -- only snow and mounds of barren terrain and the occasional frozen tumbleweed like rolled - up cobwebs in the distance .
A wrenching sound breaks the silence .
Davenport has pried open the door .
He tilts his head , then squeezes through sideways before disappearing into darkness .
“ He ’s not the normal guy on the street , but crazy ?
No .
He ’s not crazy , ” Robert B. Frost says of Davenport , whom he ’s known for most of the last two decades .
The former chief engineer for Boeing ’s portion of the B - 2 bomber project , Frost met Davenport , a fellow techie , in Seattle .
“ The guy ’s brilliant , ” Frost says .
“ Personally , I think he ’s going to prevail on this thing . ”
By that , Frost means time will prove Davenport correct on his hunch that UFOs represent a real phenomenon .
Although mainstream science tends to dismiss the subject , along with Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster , a number of prominent scientists and much of the public -- as many as 60 % , according to polls -- believe UFOs exist and should be studied .
As a corollary , a large number of astronomers believe life in other parts of the universe is not only possible but likely .
Among the famous , former President Carter , anthropologist Margaret Mead , psychiatrist Carl Jung and astronaut Gordon Cooper reported seeing a UFO or proclaimed a belief in UFOs as representing visitations from extraterrestrials .
Last fall , Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich , at the time running for the Democratic presidential nomination , made headlines by admitting he had seen , in the 1980s , a strange “ triangular craft ” hovering above a rural area of Washington state .
In a way , Davenport ’s destiny was sealed , by his own reckoning , at age 6 .
In 1954 , while sitting in a car with his mother and brother at a drive - in theater in St. Louis , he looked out the window and , there in the sky , a bright red disc hovered then -- whoosh -- disappeared into the horizon .
“ If there was a seminal moment , ” Davenport had said earlier .
“ That would be it . ”
He read and eventually wrote widely on the subject as a sideline to his education , which included earning degrees in biology and Russian at Stanford University and graduate degrees in genetics and the biochemistry of fish at the University of Washington .
He became founding president of a Seattle - area biotechnology company , BioSyn Inc. , and nine years later , in 1994 , sold his stock and made a small fortune .
That same year , he got a phone call from Robert Gribble , a retired firefighter in Seattle , who for two decades had acted as a one - man clearinghouse for UFO information and operator of a 24/7 national UFO hotline ( 206-722-3000 ) .
Gribble wanted to pass the torch .
Davenport accepted and has been director of the National UFO Reporting Center since , keeping the same hotline and funding the operation out of his own pocket .
Costs can range from $ 500 to $ 5,000 a month , depending on travel .
Davenport has few other expenses .
He never married , never had kids .
He drove old cars .
For a dozen years he ran the center out of a rented home near Seattle ’s University District .
Then he got the notion that he wanted his own missile site .
“ There was an allure to the idea , ” he says he told friends .
Davenport , who had long been interested in aircraft and rocketry , had heard of missile silos for sale in eastern Washington .
One in particular was going for a bargain price : Atlas Missile Site No. 6 , in which the previous owner had killed and dismembered a visitor .
Long - haul truck driver Ralph Benson was convicted of murder in 2004 and was suspected in at least one other murder when he died in prison two years later .
Davenport bought the site from Benson ’s sons .
“ I do n’t know about the kind of people who buy these things , ” Davenport says , his voice trailing off in the darkness .
He leaves the steel door propped open , and fumbles for lights .
A series of clicks , and the room turns pale yellow .
He stands in an entryway , all concrete and steel , and dank like a cave .
On each side is a tunnel .
He takes the tunnel to the right , clomps down a metal tube about 50 yards long .
It is large enough for him to walk through without bending .
The tube leads to a cave about the size of a basketball court .
Piles of debris can be seen in the semi-darkness .
“ Launch control room , ” he says with his radio voice .
Davenport offers up specs ( corroborated by military documents ) :
The ceilings are 16 feet high , the walls 18 inches thick .
The complex , made of 3 million tons of concrete , can withstand a blast 50 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb at a distance of 1.6 miles .
He returns to the vestibule and enters the other tunnel , similarly constructed , which opens into another cavernous space : the missile room .
The complex was known as a “ coffin launcher . ”
This is where the Atlas missile rested flat .
Above , the ceiling was a sliding metal door , which opened as hydraulics raised the rocket for launching .
Toward the back of the missile room , shrouded in darkness , sits Davenport ’s life work : a collection of tens of thousands of reports on UFO sightings from all over the world .
He has files from long before the television show “ The X - Files ” brought the paranormal to prime time .
The information is meticulously labeled and filed in a long row of mismatched metal file cabinets .
They form the shape of a miniature city skyline .
The plan was to live and work in here .
But the site needed more work than expected .
The place leaks .
The ventilation is n’t good , and there ’s a little bat problem .
For now , the center ’s phone and answering machine will stay at Davenport ’s Harrington apartment , a few miles away , until Missile Site No. 6 is fixed up .
Davenport is doing most of the fixing up himself .
Shadows flicker as he shines his flashlight around .
He walks to the nearest cabinet , opens a drawer and randomly pulls out a thick sheaf of files .
Call logs .
A file for every month .
A sampling of entries :
Jan 6 , 1995 .
0:15 .
Warm Beach , WA .
Two women observe a strange “ rope of light , ” with a bright sphere attached .
Jan 6 , 1995 .
17:30 .
Glendo , WY .
Mother and son witness large glowing craft maneuver into cloud .
Pursued by mil. aircraft .
Jan. 7 , 1995 . 5:00 .
Makapuu Point , HI .
Man and wife observe bizarre hump - backed triangular object over sea .
Opaque windows .
Davenport says that of the vast majority of UFO sightings , up to 90 % are explainable : weather balloons , military aircraft , satellites and the like .
Many more prove to be hoaxes .
But then there ’s the tiny percentage , maybe only a handful each year , where something was definitely seen -- often by multiple reliable sources -- and that defy explanation .
He believes that clues lie buried in these hill - sized mounds of paper that he has meticulously cataloged , if only the government or a university would do the research .
“ I ’m willing to share data , ” he says .
“ I ’m willing to throw all of it to anyone who wants to know . ”
There have been few takers .
Someday , he says , a UFO event could take place that would prove irrefutable , and then people would be forced to make a leap in consciousness as big as stone - agers into cyberspace .
If that happens , the files in this underground castle could take on new significance .
Or not .
Either scenario comes with a burden .
Arthur C. Clarke , author of the classic novel “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey , ” who died this month in Sri Lanka , once said : “ Either we are alone in the universe or we are not .
Both are equally terrifying . ”
Davenport slams the drawer shut .
He sighs .
Outside , the sun has set and the evening sky has darkened enough for celestial bodies to become visible .
The constellation Orion appears in the southern sky , and Mars twinkles too .
“ Not many people would waste their lives pursuing such an elusive subject , ” Davenport says on the drive home .
His car is an 18 - year - old gray Crown Victoria with a quarter - million miles .
The windshield is cracked .
“ Sometimes I do n’t know why I do it . ”
Then he remembers Elger Berg of Seattle .
Berg was a carpenter and mechanic .
He had waited 64 years to tell the story of something he had seen outside a small village in Alaska when he was a young man : a cigar - shaped craft with blue - green lights that flew over his head and disappeared into the mountains .
After hearing Davenport on the radio , Berg sought him out to tell him about the UFO .
Four months later , in early 2001 , Berg died at age 84 .
His story , which Davenport captured on cassette , is the only record of the incident .
If someone , anyone , ever wants to look into it for whatever reason , the tape and accompanying notes await in a safe place , in a city of file cabinets , under the desert .

Some scientists believe a number of dinosaurs had feathers
The plant - eating Psittacosaurus had a thick layer of shark - like skin hidden under scales .
Palaeontologists believe this tough outer coating supported the dinosaur 's organs and protected it from predators .
Tooth marks suggest the dinosaur was torn open by a scavenger , giving a unique insight into their biology , 100 million years after this one 's death .
The research is published in the Royal Society 's journal Proceedings B .
' Unprecedented understanding '
Soft tissues such as skin are rarely preserved in the fossil record , leading to heated debate over what dinosaurs looked like , and whether they were covered in primitive feathers or scales .
The Psittacosaurus , or parrot lizard , specimen gives the first detailed picture of what dinosaurs were like deep under the skin .
To have the skin folded on the fossil so that you can see the cross section through it is remarkable
Mark Witton , University of Portsmouth
" As noted from the studies on modern - day animals , this fibre structure plays a critical part in the stresses and strains the skin may be subjected to and is ideally suited to providing support and protection , " explained Professor Theagarten Lingham - Soliar of the University of KwaZulu - Natal , Durban , South Africa , in the paper .
" Psittacosaurus gives a remarkable , unprecedented understanding of the dinosaur skin . "
' Prehistoric pig '
The specimen comes from an area of China that has yielded a treasure trove of uniquely - preserved fossils .
" Discoveries like this from China are certainly churning out new surprises , " commented Mark Witton of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth , UK .
" To have the skin folded on the fossil so that you can see the cross section through it is remarkable . "
He said the skin of the dinosaur would have been " incredibly tough " and probably served to protect the animal from attack by predators .
" We imagine this Psittacosaurus as a tubby little animal walking around on its back legs , " he added .
" Psittacosaurus may have been a bit like a prehistoric pig , wandering around woodlands and forests and eating all manner of plants , scavenging the odd carcass and maybe eating the odd little animal here and there . "
The Chinese specimen appears to have met its match during the life and death struggles of the Lower Cretaceous .
Tooth marks and fractures in the skin suggest it was attacked by another dinosaur , and then covered by sediment rapidly after its demise , allowing soft tissue to be preserved in remarkable detail .

An Arkansas contest between “ not ” and “ knot ” ended in a “ no ” this week .
Last year , the state legislature botched a law intended to make 18 the minimum age for marriage , instead mistakenly removing the limit entirely .
As long as they had the consent of their parents , children  no matter how young  could have demanded matrimonial bonds under the law passed in error in 2007 : “ In order for a person who is younger than eighteen ( 18 ) years of age and who is not pregnant to obtain a marriage license , the person must provide the county clerk with evidence of parental consent to the marriage . ”
The idea was to allow an exception for teenagers who were pregnant .
The problem was with the “ not , ” which crept in by accident , according to Representative Will Bond , who sponsored the bill .
“ There was some confusion , technical errors , ” Mr. Bond said .
“ We should have said it just does n’t make sense . ”
As the collapse of the subprime mortgage market roils the economy , it is in places like Three Lakes — the fast - growth fringes of America ’s metro areas — where much of the trouble is originating .
Most of Miami - Dade County ’s 29,923 foreclosures in the first three quarters of 2007 occurred on its outer fringes .
In Clark County , Nevada , where nearly one in 20 homes is in foreclosure , the worst damage has likewise been done in a ring around central Las Vegas .
Nationally , the variety of communities facing a wave of foreclosures is striking .
Many areas of go - go growth — the Southwest , California ’s Central Valley , much of Florida , eastern Colorado , Greater Atlanta — have been hard - hit .
So too have portions of the Rust Belt , and a narrow east - west strip running from Tennessee into Arkansas .
The places encompass run-down neighborhoods as well as areas with at least a veneer of affluence .
( On the street pictured below , many of the houses sold for $ 400,000 or more . )
If nothing else , the meltdown forces us to consider how much uncertainty may lurk beneath the surface of apparent prosperity ; an ample suburban house could be an asset or a liability , depending on the terms of the mortgage and the direction of the local market .
At first , the subprime crisis stung two groups in particular — people of modest means who ’d gotten in over their heads , and a wealthier crowd , people working at hedge funds and investment houses , who ’d trafficked in the first group ’s debt , fueling the market for exotic , unstable loans .
One might find a measure of rough justice in the travails of the latter group ( 45 residences in Greenwich , Connecticut , home to many hedge - fund operators and investment bankers , were in foreclosure in the third quarter of 2007 ) .
But the ripples from the subprime crisis are now beginning to affect nearly everyone .
A cooler housing market chills construction , consumer confidence , retail sales , and all the rest .
Not least , the crisis is harming the neighbors of people in foreclosure , even those who are n’t having trouble making loan payments .
According to one academic study , every foreclosure reduces the value of all other houses within an eighth of a mile by about 1 percent , as the sight of vacant property scares off potential buyers .
Combine that with a market already in decline , and neighborhoods that begin to have troubles can go off the cliff .
On the street pictured , three houses not in foreclosure have been languishing on the market for 72 , 97 , and 149 days ; asking prices along the cul - de - sac vary widely , but average about $ 40,000 less than the comparable prices in the first two quarters of the year .
Still , the beat , if now more muted , goes on .
On Miami ’s 99 JAMZ radio station , interspersed with spots for personal - injury lawyers and offers of lump - sum payments in exchange for pensions or legal settlements , an ad touts condos for people who ’ve had trouble with credit in the past — just $ 500 down .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Tax rebates are the centerpiece of the government 's plan to stimulate the economy , but many Americans are planning to put the money in the bank or use it to pay off debt , according to a survey released Monday .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 41 % of respondents plan to use their rebates to pay off bills , and 32 % will put the money in savings .
Just 21 % of those polled intend to spend the money , while 3 % said they will donate the extra money to charity .
The rebate checks are part of a $ 170 billion economic stimulus package passed by Congress last month that also includes tax rebates for small businesses , as well as payments to disabled veterans and some senior citizens .
The package will pay $ 600 to most individual taxpayers who earn less than $ 75,000 , and $ 1,200 for married taxpayers filing joint returns who together earn less than $ 150,000 .
There is also a $ 300 - per- child tax credit .
Overall , the rebates will put $ 120 billion in the hands of individuals , with the aim to get them spending in order to boost the faltering U.S. economy .
Follow the money
Jared Bernstein , an Economic Policy Institute senior economist , notes that taxpayers have in the past spent half to two - thirds of their rebate checks .
However , he points out that the current economic conditions are unique .
" We 've never done this in a period when American households are so deeply indebted , " he said .
" While [ saving the rebate ] is a valiant thing to do , what you want them to do is spend it . "
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moodys.com , thinks it is important to distinguish between what people say they plan to do , and what they actually end up doing .
Zandi thinks taxpayers will end up spending two - thirds of their rebate checks , which he estimates could add up to $ 70 billion flowing into the economy .
" I think that matters , " he said .
" If it 's spent between May and Christmas it will add at least a percentage point to GDP by the end of the year . "
Permanent tax cuts
Separately , the CNN / Opinion Research poll also found that 54 % of respondents are in favor of making permanent the federal income tax cuts passed into law since George W. Bush became president .
The so - called Bush tax cuts , which are set to expire within the next few years , have become a contentious political issue .
Some Democratic lawmakers have argued that the cuts favor higher - income taxpayers , while some Republican legislators say the cuts are important for economic growth .
The sudden and uncontrollable paedophilia exhibited by a 40 - year - old man was caused by an egg - sized brain tumour , his doctors have told a scientific conference .
And once the tumour had been removed , his sex -obsession disappeared .
The cancer was located in the right lobe of the orbifrontal cortex , which is known to be tied to judgment , impulse control and social behaviour .
But neurologists Russell Swerdlow and Jeffrey Burns , of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville , believe it is the first reported case linking damage to the region with paedophilia .
“ We ’re dealing with the neurology of morality here , ” says Swerdlow .
Since the area does not affect physical health , “ it ’s one of those areas where you could have a lot of damage and a doctor would never suspect something ’s wrong , ” he says .
“ He was n’t faking , ” says Burns .
“ But if someone argues that every paedophile needs a MRI , the difference in this case was that the patient had a normal history before he acquired the problem .
Most paedophiles develop problems early on in life . ”

Massage parlours
The man , a schoolteacher , began secretly visiting child pornography web sites and soliciting prostitutes at massage parlours , activities he had not engaged in previously .
Swerdlow says while the man felt that his new behaviour was unacceptable , “ in his words , the ‘ pleasure principle ’ overrode his restraint ” .
When the man ’s wife found out he had made subtle sexual advances towards young children , he was legally evicted from his house , found guilty of child molestation and medicated for paedophilia .
The judge ruled that he had to pass a 12 - step Sexaholics Anonymous rehabilitation program or face jail time .
But the man was expelled after he failed to restrain himself from asking women at the program for sex .
The evening before his prison sentencing he took himself to a hospital complaining of headache and saying he was afraid he would rape his landlady .
Balance problems
After he was remanded to psychiatric care , he complained of balance problems and a MRI scan revealed an egg - sized brain tumour .
Further tests found the man was also unable to write or copy drawings and was unconcerned when he urinated on himself .
But seven months after the tumour was removed , and after successfully completing the Sexaholics Anonymous program , the man returned home .
In October 2001 he complained of headaches and secretly collected pornography once more .
But after a MRI scan revealed tumour regrowth and it was removed , the behaviour again disappeared .
Swerdlow suggests that physicians who see personality changes coupled with an inability to write or copy pictures may now want to consider brain disease as a possible cause .
Behavioural neurologist David Rosenfield , of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , says : “ They have an interesting patient .
I would wonder whether the tumour caused hormonal changes . ”
Rosenfield thinks further research should investigate whether other problems with the orbifrontal cortex can be linked to paedophilia .
Burns and Swerdlow presented their findings in New York at the annual meeting of the American Neurological Association .

O2 has announced it 's cutting the price of the 8GB iPhone from £ 269 to £ 169 .
It 's a big surprise , somewhat reminiscent of the one third price cut Apple introduced two months after its American launch .
Those who 've bought an iPhone in the last two weeks will get £ 100 back .
But the difference is this - it appears to be simply an O2 promotion , with Carphone Warehouse joining in , without any involvement from Apple .
I 've just confirmed with them that the price at the Apple store will stay the same - so there are going to be plenty of unsold iPhones stacking up there .
Apple wo n't say whether it is cutting the price it charges O2 for the phone , but I 'd be amazed if it is lopping £ 100 off .
So why is O2 giving away what must be all of its profit margin ?
A spokesman at the mobile operator reassures me that the phone has been its best - selling handset ever and this is simply a " promotion to maintain momentum " .
The new 16GB version is n't coming down in price , so perhaps O2 has seen customers trading up and is worried that the 8GB version looks a bit dear .
But there has just been a massive and expensive - looking advertising campaign in the UK national newspapers , so it looks as though that may have been a waste of money .
And the man at O2 admitted that “ a lot of people who wanted it have now got it " and that the price has been holding some potential customers back .
So a few questions hang in the air .
What does Apple - notorious for controlling pretty strictly the pricing of its products - think of the behaviour of its sole UK operator ?
Has the iPhone , after a sparkling debut , turned into a sluggish seller in the UK ?
Or does this simply mean that the 3G iPhone will be arriving in June when O2's cut - price promotion ends ?

Are n't we just waiting for that eternal part of ourselves to come out clear ?
Ken Livingstone is taking on the car – and he appears to be winning .
The London mayor was denounced five years ago when he introduced a congestion fee , requiring every vehicle entering the central core to pay for the privilege on weekdays .
There are no toll booths .
Instead , hundreds of mounted cameras at boundary roads take photographs of licence plates .
Drivers have until midnight that day to pay – online , by phone , at self - service kiosks or at shops and gas stations – and if they do n't , late fees are applied .
The zone where the congestion fee applies was expanded last year and , beginning in late October , large gas - guzzling cars and trucks will face a surcharge .
Currently , drivers must pay £ 8 , or about $ 16 , on the day they enter the zone .
If they pay the next day , the charge goes up to £ 10 , or about $ 20 .
After that , stiff penalties begin to accrue .
In an effort to reduce carbon emissions and encourage Londoners to take transit or switch to cleaner cars like hybrids , Livingstone plans a whopping £ 25 daily charge , about $ 50 , for highly polluting vehicles to enter the central district .
Statistics from Transport for London show the congestion fee is working .
Traffic entering the original zone fell instantly by 21 per cent .
Crashes declined , smog decreased , and cycling rose .
Other cities have followed suit with similar fees or variations on the idea , including Stockholm , Milan and Berlin .
The Maharishi became well - known in the 1960s
Meeting the Beatles
The roots of the Maharishi's life remain shrouded in mystery .
He said himself that " monks are not expected to speak about themselves ; the message is important , not the person . "
It seems likely he was born sometime between 1911 and 1918 .
The son of a government revenue inspector , Mahesh trained as a physicist and worked in a factory , before devoting his life to the study of the Vedic science of consciousness .
His spiritual mentor Jagadguru Shankaracharya , bequeathed to Mahesh the task of keeping the tradition of Transcendental Meditation alive , and the young Maharishi retreated to prepare .
HAVE YOUR SAY Transcendental Meditation can be done by anyone irrespective of your religious background V. Kumar , Chennai
By 1959 , his " technique " - that of unfolding the potential of Natural Law to improve all areas of life - was complete , and he set off on his first international mission of peace .
The Maharishi's commercial mantras drew criticism from stricter Hindus , but his promises of better health , stress relief and spiritual enlightenment drew devotees from all over the world .
Celebrity neophytes included the Rolling Stones , Shirley MacLaine and Mia Farrow .
With the Beatles in 1967
The mesmerised band planned a three month retreat to the Maharishi's Rishikesh ashram , but the trip descended into farce .
Ringo Starr went home after 10 days " for egg and chips " , and the others soon followed .
John Lennon admitted to " an error of judgement " , writing the scathing " Sexy Sadie " about him .
George Harrison defected to the Hare Krishna movement , though he continued supporting the Maharishi's Natural Law party in Britain which stood in general elections between 1992 and 2001 .
Despite these setbacks , by 1972 , the glamorous guru had attracted 100,000 members to his Academy , set up Institutes of Meditation across the world and made the cover of Time magazine .
Business empire
This self - accredited international peace keeper claimed credit for keeping peace in the Lebanon and Mozambique , and for reducing crime on the streets of Washington , through his power over the collective consciousness .
Western students funded his Academy of Spiritual Enlightenment with a tithe of one week 's wages , and the Maharishi 's business empire spread from the poverty - stricken streets of Delhi , to his American business branch in Iowa .
From his corporate headquarters in the Netherlands , viewers could receive his mantras on a 24 - hour television cable channel .
Yogic flying is practised by the Maharishi's devotees
At his Universities of Management , advanced students were offered courses in levitation , but the majority of study was aimed at " improving managerial consciousness . "
The man who brought the powers of eastern meditation to the west , took a Wall Street methodology back with him to the banks of the Ganges .
In 1997 , he founded India 's new Institute of Technology , a 500 - acre educational kingdom , and two years later , courted controversy with plans for urban improvement in San Paulo , Brazil .
The Maharishi's principles of Natural Law allowed him to ally such profit - making schemes with his undaunted spirituality .
He said himself , " Managers are the most creative people in the world . "
His own managerial consciousness permitted him to inhabit a 200 - room mansion , with a fleet of cars , helicopters and a hundred security guards , described as a cross between " Blackpool and Lourdes " .
In January 2008 , he announced his retirement and retreat into silence at his home in Vlodrop , saying his work was done and that he wanted to dedicate his remaining days to studying ancient Indian texts .
He died peacefully in his sleep the following month , reportedly of natural causes .
With his strong personality , beatific smile and high - pitched giggle , Mahesh Yogi was no holy hermit .
He managed the contradictions of his lifestyle with the simple command to " Just be yourself " .
The greatest exponent of his own technique , the Maharishi accredited all his successes , spiritual and secular , to the singular " power of om " .
図書館で HDL の教科書を読むと、ハードウェア記述言語というのはある意味マルチパラダイム言語だという事がわかった。と言うのも、ハードから近い順に次のような書き方を全部サポートしているのだ。
構造 （Structure）記述 : 回路図をそのまま文字にしただけ
データフロー （Dataflow）記述 : 数式のレベルで書ける
機能 （Behavior）記述 : 副作用のある代入や、制御構造が使える。
こ、これは面白い！どこが面白いかと言うと、この
Structure , Dataflow , Behavior というのは、プログラミング言語で言うと、論理型言語、関数型言語、手続き型言語に対応している。しかもこの順序は、実装から遠いと思っていた順だ。つまり、普通手続き型言語が一番機械語に近くて、論理型言語が一番遠くて実装がややこしい。しかし、ハードの世界になると逆転して、実は論理型が一番メカに近くて、手続き型が一番人工的なのだ！うーん目から鱗。

Converting Ruby 1.9 Bytecode to Python
By Peter Cooper
Never one to let us down on the ingenuity front , Why The Lucky Stiff ( author of the Poignant Guide and creator of Shoes ) is busy working on a system that can convert Ruby 1.9 bytecode to Python bytecode ( and from there into regular Python by way of Python 's decompilation facilities ) .
It 's exactly the sort of thing that could take off with more eyes looking at it , and Why has made it available on GitHub .
This technique is n't likely to unite Python and Ruby in any deep and meaningful way ( to the point of a shared interpreter ) , but the research and experiments involved are worth a try .
The avenue was quiet except for the whirring sound of the cranes and thud of the barriers as they touched the ground .
Contractors operated the cranes , but American soldiers transported the barriers on trucks and directed their placement .
The team building the barrier was protected by M - 1 tanks , Stryker vehicles and Apache attack helicopters .
As the workers labored in silence , there was a burst of fire as an M - 1 tank blasted its main gun at a small group of fighters to the west .
An Apache helicopter fired a Hellfire missile at a militia team equipped with rocket - propelled grenades , again interrupting the night with a thunderous boom .
A cloud of dark smoke was visible in the distance through the Stryker ’s night - vision system .
Concrete barriers have been employed in other areas of Baghdad .
As the barriers were being erected in other neighborhoods , some residents said they feared being isolated .
But walls have often proved to be an effective tool in blunting insurgent attacks .
American and Iraqi forces here say they have been battling Iranian - backed groups and militia fighters who support Moktada al - Sadr , the anti-American cleric .
Much of Sadr City has become a sanctuary for such militias .
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki ’s recent offensive in Basra led to an increase in rocket attacks on the Green Zone .
Many of the Shiite militias that the American and Iraqi forces have been battling in the Tharwa area of Sadr City in the past several weeks have been infiltrating from the north .
Al Quds Street has become a porous demarcation line between the American - and Iraqi - protected area to the south and the militia - controlled area to the north .
Editor ’s note : Justin Raimondo ’s column will return Friday .
The shooting has already started in the Persian Gulf  and chances are we ’ll be at war with Iran before President Bush ’s term is up .
An American ship under contract with the U.S. Navy  the Western Venture  claims it was in international waters when Iranian speedboats approached and failed to answer radio calls .
Shots were fired on the American side .
Iran denies the whole thing .
Yet you ’ll recall that in the last incident , involving the capture of British sailors , the story about being in international waters was the same  except , it turns out , they were n’t in international waters , but in disputed waters , just as we speculated in this space .
There ’s no reason to expect anything different this time .
Clearly , the U.S. and Britain are trying to trigger a new conflict with the most brazen provocations , and they do n’t really care how it happens  only that it does .
The indications of an imminent attack  the latest incident , the steady stream of accusations coming from the U.S. regarding Iranian influence in Iraq , the nuclear charade , etc .
 have suddenly taken a more ominous turn with the recent statement of America ’s top military officer that the U.S. is weighing military action against Iran .
The Washington Post reports :
“ The nation ’s top military officer said yesterday that the Pentagon is planning for ‘ potential military courses of action ’ as one of several options against Iran , criticizing what he called the Tehran government ’s ‘ increasingly lethal and malign influence ’ in Iraq .
Admiral Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said a conflict with Iran would be ‘ extremely stressing ’ but not impossible for U.S. forces , pointing to reserve capabilities in the Navy and Air Force . ”
Speaking of malign influences : since when does an American military officer make foreign policy pronouncements , as if he were the president ?
It ’s an indication of the advances militarism has made in what used to be a republic that no one has so much as blinked at the brazenness of such blatant Caesarism .
The reasons for the uptick in the rhetorical and physical assault on Iran by the Americans are entirely due to domestic politics , not anything occurring on the ground in the region .
Hillary Clinton ’s demagogic threat to “ obliterate ” Iran , uttered on national television just before the Pennsylvania primary , was meant to buttress her newfound image as a shot - swilling macho up against the effete , Adlai Stevenson - esque Barack “ Arugula ” Obama .
It ’s the Old Politics , trying to revive the red state - blue state dichotomy , and it ’s driving us down the road to war with Tehran .
McCain , too , is helped by the ratcheting up of tensions in the Persian Gulf : think what the outbreak of war with Iran would do for his underdog candidacy .
Standing behind this developing pro-war Popular Front , the central factor in turning the U.S. toward a policy of confrontation rather than constructive engagement with Iran has been the Israel lobby .
Since 1993 , the Lobby has been demanding that the U.S. take a more aggressive approach to the mullahs of Tehran , and , with few exceptions , has been largely successful .
The policy of “ dual containment , ” conceived by the Clinton administration during the early 1990s , meant that the U.S. was committed to hostile relations with both Iraq and Iran .
The policy , as John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt point out , “ was essentially a copy of an Israeli proposal . ”
It meant stationing troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to offset an alleged threat to American interests .
Yet there was no reason to assume Tehran had hostile intentions toward the U.S .
At the time , Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was eager to establish friendly relations with the U.S.
As pressure built to abandon “ dual containment ” and initiate a more workable policy that would give the U.S. more flexibility , the Lobby went on the offensive with a relentless campaign to impose economic sanctions on Iran .
The Iranians , determined to signal their willingness to be reasonable , chose an American oil company , Conoco , to develop the Sirri oil fields .
As Trita Parsi points out in Treacherous Alliance : The Secret Dealings of Israel , Iran , and the United States :
“ For AIPAC , the Conoco deal ‘ was a coincidence and a convenient target . ’
The organization went into high gear to use the Iranian offer not only to scuttle the Conoco deal , but also to put an end to all U.S. - Iran trade .
In a report that it released on April 2 , 1995 , titled ‘ Comprehensive U.S. Sanctions Against Iran : A Plan for Action , ’ AIPAC argued that Iran must be punished for its actions against Israel .
‘ Iran ’s leaders reject the existence of Israel .
Moreover , Iran views the peace process as an American attempt to legalize Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian , Muslim lands , ’ it said .
Pressured by Congress , AIPAC , and the Israelis , President Clinton swiftly scrapped the deal by issuing two executive orders that effectively prohibited all trade with Iran .
The decision was announced on April 30 by Clinton in a speech before the World Jewish Congress . ”
This was n’t enough for the Lobby , which brought pressure on Sen .
Alphonse D’Amato to introduce a bill that imposed sanctions on any countries doing business with either Libya or Iran .
The Iran - Libya Sanctions
Act passed the House with not a single dissenting vote , and the same scenario went down in the Senate .
The Lobby made sure the Iranian peace offering was rudely rebuffed  and the president reminded of just who was in charge of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East .
The White House meekly went along with the Lobby ’s wishes : after all , the presidential election was but three months away .
The Conoco affair should dispel any myths about the supposedly supreme power of the “ oil lobby ” as the decisive factor in shaping U.S. policy in the region : the Israel lobby beat them hands down .
As James Schlesinger put it , “ It is scarcely possible to overstate the influence of Israel ’s supporters on our politics in the Middle East . ”
The harder the Iranians tried to approach the Americans , the more rudely they were repulsed .
The election of the even more pro-American Mohammad Khatami as Iran ’s president in 1997 did not break the back of “ dual containment ”  dubbed “ a nutty idea ” by Brent Scowcroft , albeit one with plenty of domestic political traction .
The U.S. had every reason to pursue a policy of engagement , while that was possible , giving Iranian moderates the political breathing space they needed to ensure the growth of pro-American forces in the country .
The benefits of opening up Iran to American investment are similarly obvious , yet our leaders chose to do otherwise due solely to the power of the Lobby .
As Ephraim Sneh , a prominent figure on the Israeli Right , acknowledged : “ We were against it because the interest of the U.S. did not coincide with ours . ”
In short : Washington policymakers weighed the interests of both the U.S. and Israel , and made their decision accordingly
From dual containment to regional transformation and “ regime change ” was not a long road to travel .
After 9/11 , Washington embarked on a campaign to topple the governments of both Iraq and Iran , as well as Syria , and rid Lebanon of Hezbollah while they were at it .
As soon as “ mission accomplished ” was declared in Iraq , the Israelis and their American amen corner began demanding action against Iran .
In an interview with the Times of London , Ariel Sharon declared that Washington had better start threatening to march on Tehran “ the day after ” Baghdad was secured .
By late April 2003 , the Israeli ambassador to Washington was complaining that the demise of Saddam ’s regime was “ not enough . ”
Those indolent Americans must be made to “ follow through ” by taking action against “ great threats of that magnitude coming from Syria , coming from Iran . ”
Shimon Peres rallied the faithful with an op-ed in the War Street Journal titled “ We Must Unite to Prevent an Ayatollah Nuke . ”
The neoconservatives convened a special all - day conference devoted to inciting war hysteria aimed at Tehran , with all the usual suspects  Michael Ledeen , Bernard Lewis , Reuel Marc Gerecht  in attendance .
The cry went up : “ Regime change ! ”
The only question was which exile faction we were going to support : the royalists , or the cult - like neo -Marxist Mujahideen - e - Khalq ( MEK ) and its numerous well - connected front groups in the U.S. and Europe .
The leaders of the latter have energetically vied for the role of the Iranian Chalabi , coming up with reams of “ intelligence ” detailing Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons program .
Their “ revelations , ” however , have been definitively debunked by the latest national intelligence estimate , which says Tehran abandoned its nuclear program some time ago .
All those diagrams and documents coming from MEK by the truckload were evidence of a nuclear program that no longer existed .
If any of this sounds familiar , then it should .
The efforts of the Lobby are n’t limited to war propaganda .
The AIPAC spy trial  in which two top officials of the powerful pro-Israel lobbying organization have been indicted for passing top - secret classified information to Israeli embassy officials  is all about Israel ’s attempt to penetrate U.S. governmental discussions about what stance to take regarding Iran , with the goal of exerting maximum influence on American policymaking circles .
Israel considers a nuclear - armed Iran an “ existential threat ” to the Jewish state , a contention that amounts to little more than absolute nonsense .
Their argument goes something like this :
Iran is not a normal state , it is run by ideologues who are profoundly invested in apocalyptic religious visions that can only end in war .
Deterrence means nothing to them .
They want to be incinerated in a nuclear exchange involving Israel , themselves , and quite possibly the U.S. , because it fulfills the ancient prophecies and means the return of the Mahdi , or something along those lines .
This makes no more sense than the inverse version of the religion - determines - all theory , which would have the “ born again ” George W. Bush intent on provoking a nuclear war in the Middle East in order to bring about the Second Coming and the Kingdom of God on Earth  as the Christian dispensationalists who make up so much of the GOP ’s base fervently believe is entirely possible and certainly desirable .
These latter , of course , are the foot - soldiers of the Israel Lobby in America , a group that GOP presidential candidate John McCain has actively courted in the person of the Rev. John Hagee .
Rev.
Hagee is a vicious Catholic - hater and all - around nut - job who looks forward to a nuclear war in the Middle East as the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy .
Hagee has lately taken up with AIPAC , appearing at their last national confab in a starring role .
This administration , which has been in thrall to the Israel lobby more than any other , has been increasing the volume in its war of words with Tehran since January of this year , and , as Bush ’s reign comes to an inglorious end , there apparently remains one last act of perfidy the neocons will leave as their legacy .
Bush ’s going away gift to the American people looks more than likely to be another war  one that truly does make the Iraq war seem like a “ cakewalk ” in comparison .
It took a few years for the impact of the war in Iraq to be felt by the American people , and its full impact has yet to hit .
Not so with the next war .
The firing of a few shots at those speedboats sent the price of oil up three bucks .
Think of what a full - scale all - out war would do to the price of nearly everything .
And for what ?
Iran , a signatory to the Nonproliferation Treaty , says it is not seeking to build nuclear weapons , and that the production of nuclear energy for peaceful uses is the one and only goal of its activities on this front .
This is more than Israel can say , far more .
Everyone knows the Israelis have nukes  the technology for which they probably stole from us  and they are one of the few civilized countries who have n’t signed the NPT and refuse to even discuss doing so .
If ever there was a nuclear rogue nation , then surely it is Israel .
As Henry Kissinger said of them in a 1969 memo to Richard Nixon : “ The Israelis , who are one of the few peoples whose survival is genuinely threatened , are probably more likely than almost any other country to actually use their nuclear weapons . ”
Although the Iranians claim their nuclear program is geared exclusively toward peaceful purposes , that they have the option to act otherwise , should the need arise , is a challenge to Israel ’s nuclear hegemony .
The Iranians , by American and Israeli lights , have no right to a deterrent .
In a world where “ benevolent global hegemony ” is the goal of U.S. foreign policy , there is no right to self - defense ; that , along with national sovereignty , has been abolished .
Defiance is met with an implacable campaign for regime - change in the offending nation .
By all indications , Iran is the next victim to be made an example of , sometime in mid-summer , or so the rumor goes .
We know where the presidential candidates stand on this issue .
Hillary looks forward to the “ obliteration ” of Iran and takes up Charles Krauthammer ’s demand that we extend our nuclear shield over Tel Aviv just as we would do the same for , say , Toledo .
Indeed , there are not a few who would argue that we would be fully justified in sacrificing the latter in order to save the former , and not all of them are to be found among Rev.
Hagee ’s deluded flock .
In any case , we know what the McCain - Hagee position is without even having to ask .
We also know where Obama stands on all or most of this : he advocates a policy of engagement with the Iranians , just as he has endorsed talking with South American caudillo Hugo Chavez , and for the same very sound reasons : because it ’s talk or fight .
He clearly realizes waging perpetual war is hardly in our interests , even if we had the financial and military capacity to carry out such a crazed policy .
Yet , if he ’s speaking out about this , at this crucial moment  when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs is practically declaring war on the Iranians  then I just ca n’t hear him : he must not be speaking very loudly , or perhaps this gets lost amid all the soaring rhetoric about Change and Hope and A Better Tomorrow .
Hillary voted for the Kyl - Lieberman resolution , which designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guards  an official part of the Iranian armed forces  as a “ terrorist organization , ” and now Gen .
Petraeus is telling us Tehran is funding , arming , and succoring those who are killing American soldiers and bombing the Green Zone .
The main threat against us in Iraq is no longer the Sunni “ dead - enders , ” as Don Rumsfeld liked to call them , it ’s the Mahdi Army  Iraqi Shi’ites  and the Iranians , who have very close ties to the government our troops are dying to defend .
If Bush seeks to obliterate Iranian hopes for regional preeminence by launching an attack before he leaves office , one can hardly see how the Clintons could possibly object : perhaps they ’ll declare that , this time , we have to send enough troops to “ do the job . ”
This , you ’ll recall , was Hillary ’s McCain - like critique of the Iraq invasion long before being antiwar was required of all Democratic presidential aspirants .
No doubt she ’ll revert to that when the time comes , but what about Obama ?
He could skewer Hillary the hawk with one well - placed arrow , aimed straight at her vulnerability on the Iran issue .
With the first shots of a new war already fired , apparently , and rumors of an imminent American strike at Iran flying thick and fast , Obama could denounce her as a warmonger , a McCain in drag , whose short - term political opportunism is helping to embroil us in a quagmire far worse than the one in Iraq , where she played a similar role in 2003 .
Yet I hear nothing like this coming from Obama ’s camp .
Maureen
Dowd nails it , with her typically acerbic take :
“ Despite all his incandescent gifts , Obama has missed several opportunities to smash the ball over the net and end the game .
Again and again , he has seemed stuck at deuce .
He complains about the politics of scoring points , but to win , you ’ve got to score points . ”
The American people oppose war with Iran , perhaps more than they want out of Iraq : the economic consequences alone will infuriate them far more than any other foreign policy decision of this administration .
What the War Party is hoping is that their fury will be directed overseas , at our alleged “ enemies ” in Tehran , and not at home , in the direction of Washington , where proper blame belongs .
Americans await the advent of a real leader , the sort who could and would focus that anger on the right target .
Whether Obama has the gumption  and the strategic sense  to make this fight about policy , not personalities , race , and gender , remains to be seen .
He ’s promised us a new politics , but that does n’t have to mean blandness and an inability to fight .
It can and must mean sharp attacks on wrong ideas  and one looks in vain for an idea as wrongheaded as war with Iran .
@jimgoldstein asks : “ one things I see bloggers struggle with is blog spam .
When self promotion goes to far . “
I agree Jim .
There are different kinds of spam – the main stuff we see is the auto - generated stuff that fills our inboxes and hits our comment filters but then there is a more subtle kind of spam – where bloggers overstep the mark on other people ’s blogs by promoting themselves to a point where they put others off .
I see this every day in the comments on my blogs where the comments left are five words long and only slightly on topic and then there ’s a list of 2 - 3 links as a signature .
The comments left are obviously a thinly veiled attempt at self promotion .
The problem with this approach of self promotion is that you can do more harm for yourself than good .
If you comments are allowed on your blog the reaction from others who see it can actually hurt your brand .
I write about this in 10 Way s to Hurt Your Blog ’s Brand by Commenting on Other Blogs .
The key to growing your blog is to create value .
Create useful and unique content on your own blog ( do n’t get caught up in the self promotion game in every 2nd post ) and to do the same thing on other people ’s blogs .
The people ’s blogs that I visit from comments on my blog ( and others ) are those who have something interesting and useful to say – not those who leave links on dull and spammy comments ) .
OK – it ’s over to you – what do you think ?
Here ’s this week ’s “ Where In The Universe ? ” mystery image .
Your mission , should you choose to accept , is to guess what location in the universe is depicted here .
No peeking below before you make a guess .
Give yourself an extra point if you can name the feature shown here , and another point or two if you can name the spacecraft that took this image .
I have to admit , I was drawn to this image strictly by the color : blue is my favorite , and especially this shade of blue .
Kind of electric , do n’t you think ?
Let ’s see , could this be a moon , or a planet , or even a portion of a planetary nebula , or perhaps a photo from somewhere on our home planet ?
Make your guesses now , or maybe you knew what this was the moment you saw it ….
Have you made your guess ?
This spectacular image was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope .
It ’s a close - up view of an electric - blue aurora that is eerily glowing on the planet Jupiter .
It was taken by HST ’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) using an ultraviolet filter .
Auroras are curtains of light resulting from high - energy electrons racing along the planet ’s magnetic field into the upper atmosphere .
The electrons excite atmospheric gases , causing them to glow .
The aurora is centered on Jupiter ’s magnetic north pole .
Although this aurora resembles the same phenomenon seen at Earth ’s polar regions , this image shows unique emissions from the magnetic “ footprints ” of three of Jupiter ’s largest moons .
These points are reached by following Jupiter ’s magnetic field from each satellite down to the planet .
Auroral footprints can be seen in this image from Io ( along the left hand limb ) , Ganymede ( near the center ) , and Europa ( just below and to the right of Ganymede ’s auroral footprint ) .
These emissions , produced by electric currents generated by the satellites , flow along Jupiter ’s magnetic field , bouncing in and out of the upper atmosphere .
They are unlike anything seen on Earth .
This ultraviolet image of Jupiter was taken with the on November 26 , 1998 .
In this ultraviolet view , the aurora stands out clearly , but Jupiter ’s cloud structure is masked by haze .
So , how ’d you do ?

An investigation by Connecticut 's Attorney General over bait - and - switch charges has gotten electronics megalith Best Buy to budge over its allegedly deceptive " secret website . "
An inch , at least .
The company has expanded the disclaimer on in - store kiosks to tell customers that similar interfaces may be deceiving .
A banner at the top of the in - store kiosk interface now reads :
THIS KIOSK DISPLAYS IN - STORE PRICES — WHICH MAY DIFFER FROM NATIONAL INTERNET PRICES
Promotions can differ between stores and internet .
See your sales associate if you have questions .
The legal controversy arose over accusations of running a bait - and - switch scam using bestbuy.com and the company 's in - store kiosks .
The kiosks use an identical interface to bestbuy.com , but do n't list the various deals and sales available on the website .
Customers pondering why an in - store price was more expensive than one advertised online would allegedly be told the deal had expired or never existed .
The clerk would then show the price listed on the kiosk under the pretext that it was bestbuy.com as proof of the customer 's descent into madness .
Best Buy denied any wrong - doing and said they use the same interface " to ensure that customers familiar with the national web site could easily navigate the in - store kiosk . "
The company agreed last March , however , to add a banner to its in - store site reading " This Kiosk Reflects Local Store Pricing . "
Some critics were not satisfied by the change and noted the kiosk 's appearance remains virtually identical to the website and customers still access information by clicking a tab marked " BestBuy.com . "
These potentially deceptive problems with the kiosks remain to this day .
But at least the banner is a little more eye - catching .
Feel free to check yourself out of the asylum . ®
Richard Jones ' Log : pyglet 1.1 alpha 1 released
Sun , 02 Mar 2008
pyglet 1.1 alpha 1 adds more features than any previous release , including fast graphics routines , formatted text layout , animated GIF support , resource loading , and even some bug fixes .
If you 're not working in a production environment and can afford some instability , go straight to the download server to grab a source or egg release , and start reading up on all the new features .
This is a pretty exciting release for Alex and myself as it represents the beginning of the added value we wanted to see in pyglet beyond the basic OpenGL + other stuff that appeared in pyglet 1.0 ( even though pyglet 1.0 " basic other stuff " like video playback was pretty darned cool . )
One of the more popular white person activities of the past fifteen years is attempting to educate others on the evils of multi-national corporations .
White people love nothing more than explaining to you how Wal * Mart , McDonalds , Microsoft , Halliburton are destroying the Earth ’s culture and resources .
While the growth of multi-national corporations can be attributed to a number of complex social , economic and political factors , many white people prefer to take the word of two trusted sources : No Logo and AdBusters .
Published in 2000 , No Logo has been responsible for more white person “ enlightenment ” than any book since the burning of the library at Alexandria .
By reading this one magic book , white people are able to get a full grasp on the evils of multi-national corporations and then regurgitate it to friends and family .
Advanced white people will supplement No Logo with a subscription to AdBusters , where they will learn how to subvert corporate culture and return it to the masses .
Specifically , this means taking ads and redoing them to give a negative message about a product .
Apparently the belief is that when other people see this ad , they will be hit with an epiphany that their entire existence has been a Matrix - style manufactured universe .
If you plan to engage in lengthy conversations or get high with white people it is recommended that you read No Logo or one issue of AdBusters .
Failing that , it is acceptable to buy a copy to leave on your coffee table .
When white people see it , they will recognize you as someone who can see through the advertising and has a proper perspective on life .
When engaging in a conversation about corporate evils it is important to NEVER , EVER mention Apple Computers , Target or Ikea in the same breath as the companies mentioned earlier .
White people prefer to hate corporations that do n’t make stuff that they like .
Following these simple steps can help you gain the trust and respect of white people in a relatively short period of time .
Scientists who want to describe their work on Wikipedia should not be forced to give up the kudos of a respected journal .
So says a group of physicists who are going head - to - head with a publisher because it will not allow them to post parts of their work to the online encyclopaedia , blogs and other forums .
The physicists were upset after the American Physical Society withdrew its offer to publish two studies in Physical Review Letters because the authors had asked for a rights agreement compatible with Wikipedia .
The APS asks scientists to transfer their copyright to the society before …
Using a new technique , two NASA scientists have identified the lightest known black hole .
With a mass only about 3.8 times greater than our Sun and a diameter of only 15 miles , the black hole lies very close to the minimum size predicted for black holes that originate from dying stars .
" This black hole is really pushing the limits .
For many years astronomers have wanted to know the smallest possible size of a black hole , and this little guy is a big step toward answering that question , " says lead author Nikolai Shaposhnikov of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
The tiny black hole resides in a Milky Way Galaxy binary system known as XTE J1650 - 500 , named for its sky coordinates in the southern constellation Ara. NASA 's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) satellite discovered the system in 2001 .
Astronomers realized soon after J1650 's discovery that it harbors a normal star and a relatively lightweight black hole .
But the black holeâ€™s mass had never been measured to high precision .
Shaposhnikov and his Goddard colleague Lev Titarchuk presented their results on Monday , March 31 , at the American Astronomical Society High - Energy Astrophysics Division meeting in Los Angeles , Calif .
Titarchuk also works at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va. , and the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , DC .
The method used by Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk has been described in several papers in the Astrophysical Journal .
It uses a relationship between black holes and the inner part of their surrounding disks , where gas spirals inward before making the fatal plunge .
When the feeding frenzy reaches a moderate rate , hot gas piles up near the black hole and radiates a torrent of X - rays .
The X - ray intensity varies in a pattern that repeats itself over a nearly regular interval .
This signal is called a quasi- periodic oscillation , or QPO .
Astronomers have long suspected that a QPO 's frequency depends on the black hole 's mass .
In 1998 , Titarchuk realized that the congestion zone lies close in for small black holes , so the QPO clock ticks quickly .
As black holes increase in mass , the congestion zone is pushed farther out , so the QPO clock ticks slower and slower .
To measure the black hole masses , Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk use archival data from RXTE , which has made exquisitely precise measurements of QPO frequencies in at least 15 black holes .
Last year , Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk applied their QPO method to three black holes whose masses had been measured by other techniques .
In their new paper , they extend their result to seven other black holes , three of which have well - determined masses .
" In every case , our measurement agrees with the other methods , " says Titarchuk .
" We know our technique works because it has passed every test with flying colors . "
When Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk applied their method to XTE J1650 - 500 , they calculated a mass of 3.8 Suns , with a margin of uncertainty of only half a Sun .
This value is well below the previous black hole record holder with a reliable mass measurement , GRO 1655 - 40 , which tips the scales at about 6.3 Suns .
Below some unknown critical threshold , a dying star should produce a neutron star instead of a black hole .
Astronomers think the boundary between black holes and neutron stars lies somewhere between 1.7 and 2.7 solar masses .
Knowing this dividing line is important for fundamental physics , because it will tell scientists about the behavior of matter when it is scrunched into conditions of extraordinarily high density .
Despite the diminutive size of this new record holder , future space travelers had better beware .
Smaller black holes like the one in J1650 exert stronger tidal forces than the much larger black holes found in the centers of galaxies , which make the little guys more dangerous to approach .
" If you ventured too close to J1650 's black hole , its gravity would tidally stretch your body into a strand of spaghetti , " says Shaposhnikov .
Shaposhnikov adds that RXTE is the only instrument that can make the high - precision timing observations necessary for this line of research .
" RXTE is absolutely crucial for these black hole mass measurements , " he says .
In the Kentucky case , there was considerably less agreement among the justices than the vote of 7 to 2 might indicate .
Six of the seven justices in the majority wrote separate opinions .
The chief justice ’s opinion was signed by only two others , Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Justice Kennedy was the only member of the majority who did not write separately .
Justice Alito wrote a separate opinion suggesting that he regarded the chief justice ’s opinion as insufficiently conclusive and therefore open to “ misinterpretation ” by those who might see it as an invitation to “ litigation gridlock . ”
Justice Alito said that because ethics rules bar most medical professionals from taking part in executions , challenges based on the absence of doctors and nurses from the execution chamber must fail because an alternative protocol that would require their participation “ cannot be regarded as ‘ feasible ’ or readily available . ”
Another member of the majority , Justice John Paul Stevens , said in his separate opinion that he felt bound by the court ’s precedents to uphold the constitutionality of the Kentucky protocol .
But he went on to call for abolishing the death penalty , both as a matter of policy and of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence .
“ State - sanctioned killing , ” Justice Stevens said , was “ becoming more and more anachronistic . ”
Justice Stevens voted with the majority that restored capital punishment in 1976 , his first year on the court .
But he said he had changed his mind , based on “ my own experience ” in seeing how the death penalty is actually carried out in a changing climate .
Among the factors he singled out was a series of decisions that he said had “ endorsed procedures that provide less protections to capital defendants than to ordinary offenders . ”
The set of opinions in this case , Baze v. Rees , No. 07-5439 , put the personalities and priorities of the individual justices on display as much as any case in recent years .
There was Chief Justice Roberts , including in his opinion a discourse on the need for courts to step aside .
The Kentucky inmates ’ proposed approach , he said , “ would embroil the courts in ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise and would substantially intrude on the role of state legislatures in implementing their execution procedures . ”
There was Justice Stevens , the court ’s senior member , who turns 88 on Sunday , taking a singular path as he has so often during his long career .
Back in the days of HYLO , it was common to write hylomorphisms with an additional natural transformation in them .
Well , I was still coding in evil imperative languages back then , but I have it on reliable , er.. well supposition , that this is probably the case , or at least that they liked to do it back in the HYLO papers anyways .
Transcoding the category theory mumbo- jumbo into Haskell , so I can have a larger audience , we get the following ' frat combinator ' -- you can blame Jules Bean from #haskell for that .
hyloEta :: Functor f => ( g b -> b ) -> ( forall a . f a -> g a ) -> ( a -> f a ) hyloEta phi eta psi = phi .
eta . fmap ( hyloEta phi eta psi ) .
psi
We placed eta in the middle of the argument list because it is evocative of the fact that it occurs between phi and psi , and because that seems to be where everyone else puts it .
Now , clearly , we could roll eta into phi and get the more traditional hylo where f = g .
Less obviously we could roll it into psi because it is a natural transformation and so the following diagram commutes :
This ' Hylo Shift ' property ( mentioned in that same paper ) allows us to move the ' eta ' term into the phi term or into the psi term as we see fit .
Since we can move the eta term around and it adds no value to the combinator , it quietly returned to the void from whence it came .
hyloEta offers us no more power than hylo , so out it goes .
So , if its dead , why talk about it ?
Well , when we move to a generalized hylomorphism we have a design decision that has some performance effects , and my initial pass at a generalized hylomorphism is n't as general as it could be .
When we open up the generalized hylomorphism and look at its guts ( check the slightly updated source code from yesterday ) we see :
g_hylo ' w m f g = liftW f . w . fmap duplicate .
fmap ( g_hylo ' w m f g ) . fmap join .
m . liftM g
expanding that to include the eta term gives us 4 candidate locations where we can abuse its status as a natural transformation to slot it in .
g_hylo ' 1 w m f eta g = liftW f . w . eta . fmap duplicate .
fmap ( g_hylo ' w m f g ) . fmap join .
m . liftM g g_hylo ' 2 w m f eta g = liftW f . w . fmap duplicate .
eta . fmap ( g_hylo ' w m f g ) . fmap join .
m . liftM g g_hylo ' 3 w m f eta g = liftW f . w . fmap duplicate .
fmap ( g_hylo ' w m f g ) .
eta . fmap join .
m . liftM g g_hylo ' 4 w m f eta g = liftW f . w . fmap duplicate .
fmap ( g_hylo ' w m f g ) . fmap join .
eta . m . liftM g
g - hylo ' 1 and g_hylo ' 4 are particularly interesting because we have functions sitting right next to them that we can fuse it into by generalizing the type signatures only slightly and because that leaves a run of 3 fmaps in a row that we can fuse together .
If we generalize the signatures of both w and m we get the following definition that allows you to place it on the left or the right , and for g_hylo to not have to care about it .
-- new and improved !
g_hylo :: ( Comonad w , Functor f , Monad m ) => ( forall a . f ( w a ) -> w ( g a ) ) -> ( forall a . m ( e a ) -> f ( m a ) ) -> ( g ( w b ) -> b ) -> ( a -> e ( m a ) ) -> ( a -> b ) g_hylo w m f g = extract .
g_hylo ' w m f g .
return -- | the kernel of the generalized hylomorphism g_hylo ' :: ( Comonad w , Functor f , Monad m ) => ( forall a . f ( w a ) -> w ( g a ) ) -> ( forall a . m ( e a ) -> f ( m a ) ) -> ( g ( w b ) -> b ) -> ( a -> e ( m a ) ) ->
( m a -> w b ) g_hylo ' w m f g = liftW f . w . fmap ( duplicate .
g_hylo ' w m f g . join ) . m . liftM g
The slightly generalized signatures for our two distributive laws now allow them to change functors on the way through , but we shed a superfluous argument .
Note that while 3 ' Functors ' e , f and g are involved , only f needs to be a Functor in Hask because we do the duplication , hylomorphism and join all inside f in either case .
And most of the time e = f = g .
For instance e or g could be exponential or contravariant .
So now that we 've generalized our generalized hylomorphism we 're done right ?
Not quite .
Unfortunately the same trick does n't work for the generalized chronomorphism defined last night .
To see why , we have open up chrono and peek at its guts .
chrono = g_chrono id id
Well , that was boring .
Digging deeper we find :
g_chrono :: ( Functor f , Functor g , Functor m , Functor w ) => ( forall b. f ( w b ) -> w ( f b ) ) -> ( forall b. m ( f b ) -> f ( m b ) ) -> ( f ( Cofree w b ) -> b ) -> ( a -> f ( Free m a ) ) -> a -> b g_chrono w m = g_hylo ( distCofree w ) ( distFree m )
Sticking in hylo 's vestigial natural transformation , we get :
g_chronoEta :: ( Functor f , Functor g , Functor m , Functor w ) => ( forall b. g ( w b ) -> w ( g b ) ) -> ( forall b. m ( f b ) -> f ( m b ) ) -> ( g ( Cofree w b ) -> b ) -> ( forall c. f a -> g a ) -> ( a -> f ( Free m a ) ) -> a -> b g_chronoEta w m f eta g = g_hylo ( distCofree w . eta ) ( distFree m ) f g -- g_chronoEta w m f eta g = g_hylo ( distCofree w ) ( eta . distFree m ) f g
And so , we roll up our sleeves ready to merge it into something , be it f , g , w , m , anything , but it seems the only places eta can go is to merge into one of the distributive laws , because f and g are executed lifted .
Unfortunately , the user passed us rules for distributing the base functor of the cofree comonad and free monad , not for distributing the whole cofree comonad .
And my efforts to generalize distFree and distCofree have thus far met with some frustration , there is n't much to grab onto there to write the more general signature .
Ideally , I 'd just be able to merge it into one of the distributive laws .
Since the HYLO guys liked to put it on the left of the recursive call to the hylomorphism , we 'll look at distCofree .
The desired signature for distCofree ' would be :
distCofree ' :: ( Functor f , Functor g , Functor h ) => ( forall a . f ( h a ) -> h ( g a ) ) -> f ( Cofree h a ) ->
Cofree h ( g a )
and it should have the property that :
distCofree ' ( f . eta ) == distCofree ' f .
eta
Without that , g_chronoEta is more powerful than g_chrono .
Naturally .

Play it again Madge : Madonna is hoping to resurrect her ailing film career
It is one of the greatest films of Hollywood 's golden era , a triple Oscar - winning classic with electrifyingly charismatic stars and a script bursting with memorable lines .
But now Madonna has stunned the movie industry with plans to remake Casablanca – and this time set it in Iraq .
The singer , whose previous film career has been littered with critical and commercial turkeys , is also planning to take the lead role of Ilsa Lund , which originally made a star of Ingrid Bergman .
A source at a major Hollywood studio that was recently approached by the 49 - year - old star said : " She is still determined to make it in the movies .
" She and her representatives have been touting around a project which is a remake of Casablanca .
The reception has been lukewarm to say the least .
No one can understand why she wants to redo what many people consider the greatest film of all time . "
In the 1942 original , Bergman starred opposite Humphrey Bogart , who played Rick Blaine , a cynical bar owner in the Moroccan city of Casablanca in the early days of the Second World War .
Ilsa is torn between love for her husband , a Czech Resistance leader , and her ex-lover Rick .
Madonna is said to believe the film will make her reputation as an actress , after a string of high - profile flops such as Shanghai Surprise , Body Of Evidence and Swept Away , her much - derided 2002 collaboration with husband Guy Ritchie .
The source said : " Madonna is talking about taking the Ingrid Bergman role for herself , even though Bergman was in her 20s when she played Ilsa and Madonna is nearly 50 .
" She wants to update the story and maybe set it in a modern war zone such as Iraq .
There is no script yet .
" Madonna and her people are testing the waters to see if this is the right vehicle for her and if a major studio will get behind the project . "

Classic : Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the 1942 original
The movie , which regularly tops lists of the greatest films ever made , includes the classic song As Time Goes By and memorable quotes such as : " Here 's looking at you , kid " , " We 'll always have Paris " and " Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine " .
But one of the lines most closely associated with Casablanca – " Play it again , Sam " – is a misquotation .
In fact , Ilsa says : " Play it once , Sam , for old times ' sake .
Play it , Sam . "
Later , Rick says : " You played it for her and you can play it for me .
If she can stand it , I can .
Play it ! "
Bollywood filmmaker Rajeev Nath is also said to be working on a remake set in India , calling it " a tribute to the original " .
A spokeswoman for Madonna refused to comment .

And here 's how she might ' improve ' the classic script

Now who do we have to pay to adopt him ?
We 'll always have Basra ...
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful fitness regime ...
I stick my neck out for nobody - just in case they see the wrinkles .
It does n't take much to see that Saddam 's Weapons of Mass Destruction arsenal did n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world .
If you watch this remake , you 'll regret it .
Maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon and for the rest of your life .
Bluetooth is a technology used to connect devices over short distances .
Often , users will ask “ how to connect Bluetooth speaker to laptop ” ?
Manufacturers take advantage of Bluetooth connectivity in devices ranging from office copiers through smart home sensors to mobile Bluetooth speakers .
This technology is well established already .
But , it still remains a mystery for many users how Bluetooth devices work .
In this guide , we ’ll learn how Bluetooth works .
Followed by how to connect a Bluetooth speaker to a laptop with Windows 10 .
How Does A Bluetooth Speaker Work ?
Bluetooth speakers , as well as any other Bluetooth - enabled device , use short - range radio waves to connect and communicate with each other .
It works the same way your speakers connect to a home audio system through cables but instead they use radio waves .
In both cases you need to transfer or stream audio data to your speakers which is possible through cable , Bluetooth or Wi-Fi alike .
Bluetooth actually uses the same 2.4GHz frequency as the Wi-Fi networks and it creates a network that is about 10 meters in radius , which is able to connect and support up to eight devices at once .
That said , when you know how to connect a Bluetooth speaker to laptop with Windows 10 , as well as other Bluetooth devices , you can create a home or office Bluetooth network that manages between two and eight devices simultaneously .
With the adoption of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification in 2010 , Bluetooth now offers lower energy consumption , lower costs , multivendor interoperability and wider range , which makes it a viable alternative to Wi-Fi networks that are considered faster than Bluetooth .
The biggest advantage of mobile devices like Bluetooth speakers is that they can run long hours without draining their battery and the one of the laptops to which they are connected .
Advantages And Limitations Of Bluetooth Speakers
Bluetooth is a simple to operate technology and connecting two devices , or pairing them , takes seconds once they are able to identify each other .
The Bluetooth range of 10 meters , or around 20 feet , is wide enough for most operations you perform over a network when streaming music or video , printing documents or checking your smart sensors .
You should be aware that walls , floors or ceilings can reduce the range of the network but this is true for any wireless technology .
Bluetooth is considered more safe than the average Wi-Fi connection as Bluetooth networks change frequencies often which makes network penetration harder .
Bluetooth devices encrypt their connections , which provides another layer of network security .
Sometimes you might experience difficulties pairing Bluetooth devices from unknown manufacturers but if you know how to connect Bluetooth speakers to laptop with Windows 10 properly , there should be no problem at all .
How To Connect Bluetooth Speaker To Laptop ( Windows 10 )
A good number of users upgrading to Windows 10 from previous Windows versions experience troubles connecting a Bluetooth speaker to their Windows 10 laptop as the user interface is different from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 .
If you want to connect a new Bluetooth speaker , make sure it is switched on and actively seek available Bluetooth networks .
Your laptop ’s Bluetooth should be discoverable for other devices if you are to pair them with your machine :
Open Control Panel
Click on Change Bluetooth Settings
Check the Allow Bluetooth devices to find this PC checkmark
Check the other desired options
Click OK
Then , you need to enable Bluetooth at all .
To do this , click on the Action Center icon .
Then , check if the Bluetooth box shows your Bluetooth connection as “ on ” or “ off ” .
Click to activate or right - click to go to the Bluetooth Settings .
The Bluetooth settings page has a slider to toggle Bluetooth connectivity on and off and also lists all the paired and available Bluetooth devices .
You need to download all the required drivers for you Bluetooth speaker to work , so scroll to the bottom of the page and check “ Download over metered connections ” for your laptop to download drivers even on mobile connections .
Now , your Bluetooth speaker should be visible to the laptop and ready to pair and operate .
Activating Bluetooth Speakers On Laptop With Windows 10
So far , you have made your Windows 10 laptop discoverable over Bluetooth and have downloaded the required drivers for your Bluetooth speaker .
It is time to activate it and stream audio over Bluetooth .
Follow the below steps on how to connect your Bluetooth speaker to laptop in Windows 10 and stream audio .
Open the Settings App and click on Devices
Click on the Bluetooth tab
The Manage Bluetooth devices tab opens
Now , switch on the Bluetooth on your laptop through the toggle button .
Press the pairing button on your Bluetooth speaker .
A flashing light will appear while the speaker is in pairing mode and is searching for a Bluetooth networking device .
Your Bluetooth speaker will appear on the list of available Bluetooth devices .
Select the speaker after it shows in the Bluetooth devices list on your laptop .
Click on Pair .
Once your Windows 10 laptop and the Bluetooth speakers have established a successful connection , a label saying “ Connected ” will appear below the device name .
How To Connect Bluetooth Speaker To Laptop : Concluding Words
Once you know how to connect a Bluetooth speaker to laptop with Windows 10 , you can use the same procedure for connecting any other Bluetooth device to your mobile computer .
Do not forget to make your laptop ’s Bluetooth connection discoverable to other devices .
Always download the required device drivers to avoid frustrations .
Especially when pairing a Bluetooth device with your laptop .
Also , check your Bluetooth connection list on a regular basis to avoid pairing with unknown devices .
Remove any unrecognized connections whether it is a speaker or another Bluetooth device .

A few months ago , I was planning Sara 's birthday weekend in New York City and consulted with her about which hotel would serve as home base .
As Sara and I sorted through a half - dozen websites , looking at pictures and reading reviews , she noted which hotels were close to the theater district and the room rates .
My reply ?
" Marty from London said the king - size beds at the Westin Times Square were huge . "
We booked it .
A week later , while arranging our family trip to Miami for February break , it happened again .
" This place is great , " Sara decided .
" They have a kiddie pool for Teddy , and a playground , and arts - and - crafts activities for Hazel . . . "
" And the suites have Jacuzzi tubs in the master bedrooms ! " I interjected .
Again , a reservation was made within minutes .
Many people will tell you that a hotel room is just a place to sleep while on a trip , but I beg to differ .
That 's because I 'm a big believer in the virtues of " hotel sex , " and while I can't put my finger on exactly why , I know it 's a phenomenon that exists for many , if not most , couples .
I 've talked to friends and relatives who agree with the idea that regardless of why you 're in a hotel for a night , whether it 's business or pleasure , visiting family or getting away for an anniversary , the chances of a married couple making love goes up exponentially when there 's a mint on the pillow .
So why is check - in a turn - on ?
Do hotel chains put pheromones in their air - conditioning units ?
Is there something in the newness of the location , giving couples a risk - free opportunity to " take their act on the road " ?
Or is it as simple as the fact that hotels are places where someone else will replenish the linens and even deliver overpriced club sandwiches to your door , creating an atmosphere of freedom that encourages friskiness ?
The first time Sara and I ever stayed in a hotel together was toward the end of college , when an older friend from Brandeis got married in New Jersey .
We drove down and arrived at an offramp - adjacent Sheraton , knowing that between the ceremony , reception , and our need to drive home first thing in the morning , we might spend less than an hour in the hotel awake .
But I remember checking into the hotel , opening the door of our " deluxe " room with a view of the Garden State Parkway , and feeling like carrying Sara over the threshold .
It was our honeymoon suite , even though we were n't the ones getting hitched .
It also set a precedent that would be upheld for more than 16 years and counting .
In that time , I 've tried to figure out what 's behind the " hotel sex " mind - set .
When possible to do so without incurring dirty looks or harassment suits , I 've talked to other couples to see if it was a cultural thing or age specific , but it seems nearly universal .
My buddy Matt had a hypothesis that since many couples meet at a time when they are living with roommates or , worse , their families , hotel rooms , with their steel doors and deadbolts , offer a level of privacy they can get nowhere else .
After all , there 's no such thing as a " Do not disturb " sign when you 're cohabitating with a bunch of roomies who are privy to every creak of your bedsprings .
The seclusion theory certainly holds water when one realizes there is a real difference between " hotel sex " and " bed - and - breakfast sex , " which requires more restraint and subtlety .
That 's because at a B &B , there 's a good chance you 'll end up sharing a breakfast table with your neighbors the next morning .
Maybe time will change our " hotel sex " drive .
It could be that in 15 years , when Sara and I fly off to see Hazel graduate from college , or in 25 years when we take a trip to watch Teddy help the Patriots win their 14th Super Bowl , we 'll check into a hotel , put our bags down , take a nap , and that 's as far as things will go .
But for now , and the foreseeable future , I 'll treat every check - in as an opportunity for some suite lovin ' . . . with no reservations .

Ontarians will soon be able to air their linen in public .
Premier Dalton McGuinty is to announce today that clotheslines can no longer be banned in subdivisions or almost anywhere else in the province .
In a bid to curb the use of energy - sucking dryers , the new regulation will overrule neighbourhood covenants – part of the mortgage agreement between many developers and homebuyers – that outlaw clotheslines because they 're considered unsightly .
The regulation , to take effect today , will not only prohibit new bans but also wipe out most that already exist , a provision that angered the province 's building industry .
It will apply to free - standing and semi- detached homes and most row houses .
Highrise condos and apartments wo n't be affected for now .
The province wants more consultation about them to deal with safety and other concerns .
" The premier wanted to move quickly on this because it 's a simple way to help families save money and help to save the environment , " said a government official .
" We 're always looking for opportunities to help people find ways to conserve energy and fight climate change . "
The announcement will come as Toronto Hydro launches a giveaway of 75,000 clotheslines through four retail chains .
Each Saturday and Sunday from April 26 to May 11 , retractable lines for indoor or outdoor use , worth $ 13 to $ 15 each , will be handed to the first 500 shoppers at some Home Depot , Wal - Mart , Costco and Zellers locations .
Details can be found at torontohydro.com .
Dryers account for 5 to 6 per cent of Ontario 's household electricity demand .
An average machine consumes about 900 kilowatt - hours of energy each year and results in the discharge of up to 840 kilograms of air pollution and greenhouse gases .
Each dryer adds about $ 90 a year to a household 's electricity bill .
The new regulation comes under the province 's Energy Conservation Leadership
Act , which empowers the government to remove barriers to conservation , including covenants and municipal bylaws .
McGuinty 's move , following a 60 - day consultation period , was urged by many elected municipal officials and environment groups .
Ontario's chief conservation officer , Peter Love , recommended overriding the bans last November .
Across North America , the issue has spawned an advocacy movement known as " Right to Dry . "
But the group that represents the province 's housing industry said the regulation should not be retroactive .
All new developments could be clothesline - friendly but existing bans should not be overturned , said Victor Fiume , past - president of the Ontario Home Builders Association and general manager of Oshawa - based Durham Homes .
" It 's taking away a right from people who knew ( a ban ) was in place and purchased a home because of that , " Fiume said .
Clothesline bans are imposed in 20 to 30 per cent of the province 's subdivisions , and are part of the legally binding contract between builder and buyer , he said .
" Is this what government should be doing – overturning contracts signed by parties voluntarily ?
" It 's a slippery slope to arbitrarily remove a covenant between builders and buyers . "

Instead of an " arbitrary " government move , it would be better if opponents of the bans sought a court ruling against them .
But that has never happened , he said .
In any case , Fiume said , the new regulation is a non-issue because few people will use clotheslines in any case .
" With today 's lifestyle , no one has the time or inclination to hang their clothes outside to dry . "
The new regulation is just a first step , said Chris Winter of the Conservation Council of Ontario .
" The overwhelming majority of people say it 's a good move and are solidly behind it .
That does n't mean the overwhelming majority will dry every piece of clothing on a clothesline .
But this is a start . "

INTERVIEWS : WES CHERRY
Wes Cherry .
Never heard of him ?
Well , he 's only the creator of possibly the most played computer game ever written .
Nope , it 's not Space Invaders , but humble Solitaire for Windows , installed on hundreds of millions of machines World wide .
Sadly , a compensation or royalty package was never discussed , so he 's never benefited financially .
We sent Wes a load of questions , and the best part of a year later he got back to us to reveal what it 's like to be responsible for a global recession , as well as giving away the secret of Bill Gates ' strategy for winning at Minesweeper .
Are you bitter at not being paid for such a popular and essential utility ?
( armaitus )
Yeah , especially since you are all probably paid to play it !
I would like to compensate you for your fabulous game since Bill Gates wo n't .
How much money do you want ?
( Artamnesia )
One penny per copy .
If everybody pitches in , I promise to throw you all a big party .
What did you play when you were skiving off during the creation of Solitaire ?
Do you know I almost failed my degree because of you ?
Well , and a couple of other minor factors ...
( queenie_b )
Heh , I wrote solitaire instead of studying for finals in college .
Exactly how much time and money has been wasted globally as a result of office workers playing Solitaire ?
( shavedchimp )
There was a global recession in 1991 / 1992 , just after Solitaire was released .
Thank you very much .
Oh , and you can't have your time back .
Have you ever been caught playing Solitaire in the office and passed it off as software testing ?
( DoomedMatt )
There was a " boss - key " which when pressed would display some random .C code .
Microsoft made me remove that .
I once went to see Rick Wakeman in concert .
I saw that his sound engineer was playing Solitaire practically all through the performance on his laptop .
Who 's the most famous person you know who plays Solitaire ?
( Loz )
I know Bill Gates has played it ( he said it was too hard to win ) .
Are there any cheats ?
What are they ?
( Turnip Boy )
Yup .
When playing Draw Three , you can hold down Ctrl - Shift - Alt and click on the deck to get one card .
That makes most games winnable .
Is there a way to change the speed of the card trail thing at the end ?
I 've found it at different speeds on different OS ' .
( DogsBollocks )
Yes , upgrade to a IBM 286 running at 16 m Hz .
That should slow it down right good .
Or install Norton Antivirus .
I 'll leave it to Mr. Moore and his law to make things faster .
Actually at the time I wrote Sol , I went through all kinds of hoops to get that final cascade as fast as possible .
Oh , and at one point , a computer magazine proposed a SolMark computer speed test :
The faster the cascade , the faster your computer .
The Vegas scoring mode :
1 ) How does it work exactly ?
2 ) Why is it so dang difficult ?
3 ) Why was it included ?
4 ) Do you know of anyone who actually plays Solitaire in Vegas mode ?
( PhilWal )
I 'm pulling this out of my bottom , which is pretty difficult because there 's this big ol ' world stuck there .
1 ) You pay $ 1 for each card ( $ 52 to deal ) and get $ 5 for each card placed up on the ace piles .
Also , you only get 3 runs thru the deck if playing draw 3 or 1 run if playing draw 1 .
2 ) You ever seen those casinos in Vegas ?
Bloody expensive !
3 ) I dunno , featuritis .
4 ) Me , I just did .
First time in about 10 years .
Do you play Freecell ?
( pip )
Bah !
I do n't play Solitaire either .
Freecell keeps a handy record of playing statistics
Why does n't Solitaire ?
I 'd like one .
( Mullet Over )
Answer 1 : Freecell Freecell Freecell , I 'm sick of hearing about how much cooler Freecell is ...
Answer 2 : Because your boss would fire you if he saw those statistics .
Is it true that there is an ' Easter egg ' embedded in Solitaire that pops up a picture of Bill Gates caught in flagrante delicto with a marine mammal ?
( Bouncy )
Yes .
Andrew Wyland has done some magnificent interpretations of the original Easter Egg ( Art Editors note : Wyland is a famous producer of new - age marine art - see here ) .
We used to use Borland to hack the game apart and change the card backs to rude things .
Does it annoy you when people do that ?
( K3rry )
Funny , I 've been vaguely annoyed for the last few years .
Thanks for letting me know why .
If toast always falls butter side down , and cats always land on their feet , what would happen if you strapped some toast to a cats back ?
( DogsBollocks )
You 'd get your eyes gouged out by a pissed cat .
What 's the best card to leave at a crime scene , you know , to taunt the detectives ?
( que )
A card saying " He went that - away → " pointing the opposite way I went !
Hooo hooo heee hooo haw !
Did you chose the card - back designs , and are the flappy bats your favourite ?
( Jadeviper )
Half the card backs were designed by my girlfriend Leslie Kooy .
Unfortunately she turned into a flappy bat , so we broke up .
No , really .
Which of those was you favourite design ?
I like the castle best .
How do you feel about the new ones ?
( Artamnesia )
The new ones are losergay .
And I mean that in the original 3rd grade sense when gay meant stupid , not people who prefer same sex partners .
My fave is the dealer with the Ace crawling up and down his sleeve ( which is a reference to a Grateful Dead song , " Doin ' that Rag " ) .
I can only win about 1 out of 4 games .
Am I crap ?
( rob )
I suggest redefining " winning " to mean " slacking at work " .
Do you play Minesweeper ?
What 's your high score ?
( dr_fonz )
I did .
I actually learned a strategy from Bill Gates to win at Minesweeper : Click as fast and as randomly as you can .
If you could choose someone who would be afflicted with only telling the truth for a day , who would you choose ?

Man , what an evil dude .
I wish I had another Solitaire game up my sleeve .
If so I 'd unleash it upon the world , causing another deep economic recession , leading a summary one term pruning .
If you consider how many millions of potential hours of constructive international office time your game has turned into mindless skiving , do you think you 've done a good thing or a bad thing ?
( I think good , so do n't feel like I 'm putting you on the spot )
( Zog )
The thing about time is they are always making more of it .
No harm done .
Have you ever been recognised ?
What did they say ?
( rob )
" Yes , officer , I 'm sure he 's the one who did it " .

I suggest a psychiatric evaluation STAT .
Are there any cheats ?
What are they ?
( Turnip Boy )
Yup .
When playing Draw Three , you can hold down Ctrl - Shift - Alt and click on the deck to get one card .
That makes most games winnable .
Why did n't you call it Patience in the English version ?
( the_fabulous_dancing_yak )
Because I speak English , and I call it Solitaire .
Tell us a joke .
( rob )
Three logs .
No wait , that 's not funny anymore .
Three rocks ?
What are your favourite websites ?

I like BoingBoing , Memepool and FakeOrNot .
If you could play a musical instrument which band would you avoid playing in ?

Record oil prices have made oil firms like BP attractive investments A China has spent £ 1bn buying a 1 % stake in BP , the UK 's largest company by market value .
The investment was made by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange , a unit of the Central Bank managing $ 1.6 trillion in foreign exchange reserves .
The move is the latest purchase by China of strategic stakes in leading European and US firms such as Total , Blackstone and Morgan Stanley .
Critics of this approach say China must be more open about its intentions .
Concerns
There have been growing calls for state - controlled sovereign wealth funds - which invest the surplus wealth of Asian and Gulf economies such as China , Singapore and Kuwait - to be more transparent about their motives for investing in individual businesses .
Particular concerns have been expressed about China 's recent drive into the global oil and commodity sectors , at a time when it is searching for fresh sources of energy and mineral resources to fuel its economic expansion .
KEY CHINESE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS
Morgan Stanley , Blackstone , Barclays , Total , Rio Tinto Chinese officials have insisted that such investments are long - term commercial arrangements and Beijing is not looking to influence the strategies of firms it invests in .
BP confirmed that the Chinese fund had joined its register of shareholders , saying that it was " not a stake that gives us any cause for concern " .
The Kuwait Investment Authority already owns a 1.7 % holding in the oil giant .
' Investment wave '
The British government is relaxed about Chinese investment in top UK companies and wants to make London the principal destination for Chinese investment in Europe .
It should n't raise any political concern as the Chinese are not gaining management control
Victor Shum , Purvin and Gertz Chancellor Alistair Darling is currently in Beijing where he is holding talks with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and Lou Jiwei , head of the separate China Investment wealth fund , about Anglo - Chinese commercial links .
One analyst said Beijing was interested in the sector because of the spiralling price of oil .
" It could be the beginning of a wave of investments in major oil companies as oil prices keep racing higher , " said Victor Shum , from energy consultants Purvin and Gertz .
" It should n't raise any political concern as the Chinese are not gaining management control .
It is passive . "

What are these ?
Kambakhsh told the appeals court the charges against him were ' lies '
An Afghan student journalist who was sentenced to death for blasphemy has told an appeals court that he confessed after being tortured .
Sayed Parwez Kambakhsh was convicted in January of insulting Islam .
But at the appeals court in Kabul the 24 - year - old insisted he was innocent of all the charges .
He said he was tortured into confessing that he had disrupted university classes by asking questions about women 's rights under Islam .
He was also convicted of distributing an article on the same subject , and adding three additional paragraphs .
He told the crowded , hour - long appeal hearing : " As a Muslim ... I never allow myself to do such a thing .
These are totally lies . "
Kambakhsh's death sentence was handed down during a closed - door trial , which drew condemnation from parts of the international community .
He was studying journalism at Balkh University in the northern Afghan city of Mazar - i- Sharif , and writing for local newspapers , when he was arrested in October .
Our correspondent in Kabul , Martin Patience , says critics accuse the fledgling Afghan justice system of being too religiously conservative .
The journalist 's appeal hearing was adjourned for a week , in order to give him time to prepare his written defence .
Randy Pausch 's new book , The Last Lecture , shot to number one on several online best - seller lists , including Amazon.com , after it was released last week .
Pausch , a terminally - ill Carnegie Mellon computer science professor , became a national celebrity last year after a talk he gave became a viral video sensation .
In September , when Pausch delivered the lecture , he believed he had less than six months to live , a fact which added gravitas to the spirited , pithy address about the merits of perseverance .
Pausch , it appears , takes his own advice .
He has outlived his prognosis by more than two months and expects to keep fighting his pancreatic cancer .
" I 've had spectacular medical care , and we 're clawing for every extra month we can get , " he wrote in an e-mail .
" Realistically , I hope to get two to four more months . "
The new book , which expands on the lessons of the lecture , is the culmination of Pausch 's amazing rise to stardom beginning with a Wall Street Journal article covering his talk back in fall of 2007 .
Video from the session began to circulate on the Internet , and soon Pausch found himself on Oprah .
The new book , fittingly , was co-written by Jeffrey Zaslow , whose original article broke the professor 's story .
In November , they reportedly received an advance of close to $ 7 million from Hyperion , a division of Disney .
Pausch was originally diagnosed with pancreatic cancer during the summer of 2006 .
After extensive chemotherapy and radiation , it appeared the cancer might be in remission , but it returned in August 2007 , spreading to his liver and spleen , leading doctors to tell Pausch he had between three and six months to live .
Since then , he 's been receiving palliative treatments .
Pausch tracks his experience with cancer with startling honesty on a day - to - day updates web page .
He is optimistic but unswervingly realistic .
In March , recovering from a brief hospitalization , he wrote , " The really good news is that ... the tumors are being very chivalrous and not taking advantage of this opportunity to run wild , before I 'm strong enough to fight back . "
Last week , Pausch qualified for a new treatment known as SIR - Spheres , in which tiny radioactive pellets are directly injected into his liver .
Approved by the FDA in 2002 , it 's not generally considered a cure , but it could extend his life .
" New treatments are always arriving , so although the odds are long ,
I remain optimistic new stuff will arrive just in time , " he told
Wired.com .
As for his book 's runaway success , the longtime professor 's hopes for the book have already been fulfilled .
" While everybody seems to be focused on the number of copies , I really only cared about the first three , which will go to my kids , "
said Pausch .
" I 've said my piece – my time now is entirely focused on family . "

Miami Basel
﻿ Talk of bursting bubbles and crashing markets has bled through the front page and into the art sections of today 's news .
And so , as crates of canvas arrive in Miami postmarked from around the world , the most coveted position available in today 's art world is that of the spectator .
Pockets will be substantially lighter at this year 's Miami Basel , but there will be no shortage of eye candy for those of us just coming to look .
As usual , Artkrush provides a tidy honor roll of our personal favorites , with special attention paid to Art Basel Miami Beach , as well as Scope and Photo Miami contributor Julia Fullerton - Batten , a London photographer whose studies of adolescence picture girls looming larger than life , suspended in midair , and lost in the uniform masses .
Meanwhile , Artkrush editor Paul Laster connects with the Campana Brothers in Brazil to discuss the latest installment in their sci- fi furniture design series TransPlastic , included this year in Design Miami / .
Across the bay from ABMB , we highlight the stylish counter - culture publications of PictureBox — exhibiting at Nada Art Fair Miami — before leaving the Sunshine State altogether to review Sze Tsung Leong 's photographs of Chinese suburbia in Los Angeles , and Roman Signer 's slapstick videos in the Netherlands .

On occasion , my colleagues and I are asked whether Credentica is working to ensure that our innovative technology for user - centric identity management will work with OpenID .
My short answer – “ No ” – is sometimes followed by the question “ Why not ? ”
Let me explain .
OpenID was designed as a lightweight solution for “ trivial ” use cases in identity management : its primary goal is to enable Internet surfers to replace self - generated usernames and passwords by a single login credential , without needing more than their browser .
Concretely , OpenID aims to enable individuals to post blog comments and log into social networking sites without having to remember multiple passwords .
( Of course , local password store utilities already do that ; more on this later . )
Beyond this , OpenID is pretty much useless .
The reasons for this are many : OpenID is highly vulnerable to phishing and other attacks , creates insurmountable privacy problems , is not a trust system , suffers from usability problems , and makes it unappealing to become an OpenID “ consumer . ”
Many smart people have already elaborated on these problems in various forums .
In the rest of this post I will be quoting from and pointing to their critiques .
SECURITY PROBLEMS
Let ’s start with the security problems of OpenID .
As Ben Laurie in a piece called “ OpenId : Phishing Heaven ” notes : “ The OpenID people [ have ] defined a standard that has to be the worst I ’ve ever seen from a phishing point of view . [… ]
I just persuade you to go anywhere at all , say my lovely site of kitten photos , and get you to log in using your OpenID .
Following the protocol , I find out where your provider is ( i.e. the site you log in to to prove you really own that OpenID ) , but instead of sending you there ( because , yes , OpenID works by having the site you ’re logging in to send you to your provider ) I send you to my fake provider , which then just proxies the real provider , stealing your login as it does .
I do n’t have to persuade you that I ’m anything special , just someone who wants you to use OpenID , as the designers hope will become commonplace , and I do n’t have to know your provider in advance .
So , I can steal login credentials on a massive basis without any tailoring or pretence at all !
All I need is good photos of kittens . “
Kim Cameron explains the phishing attack in greater detail and notes : “ The problem here is that redirection to the home site is under the control of the evil party , and the user gives that party enough information to sink her .
Further , the whole process can be fully automated . ”
Elsewhere , Kim points out “ think of what we unleash with OpenID …
It ’s way easier for the evil site to scoop the skin of a user ’s OpenID service because – are you ready ?
– the user helps out by entering her honeypot ’s URL !
By playing back her OpenID skin the evil site can trick the user into revealing her creds .
But these are magic creds , the keys to her whole kingdom ! “
Marco Slot in his “ Beginner ’s guide to OpenID phishing ” demonstrates the phishing problem by providing code samples .
Quoting : “ There ’s a new phish in town and it is big and easy to catch .
A single OpenID may be used for hundres of websites .
This alone makes OpenID more vulnerable as losing one password means you ’ve lost them all .
Moreover , each of those OpenID enabled websites is able to trick the user into giving away her password . [… ]
Would your grandma notice http://f5888d0b1.07e1c41c97a.be/a15 is not her real openid provider ? ”
Marc also explains why naïve attempts to solve this ( such as using cookies , identifying users by their IP address , bookmark login , and displaying personal icons ) do not work .
Eugene and Vladimir Tsyrklevich in a recent Black
Hat presentation furthermore point out that “ the phishing attack can also be carried out by the host that the site consults to retrieve the URL of the identity provider . “
On a note related to phishing , Kim Cameron says : “ How do I know I am looking at his web page or talking to his identity provider ?
By calling them up on DNS . [ … ]
OpenID is as strong , and as weak , as DNS .
In other words , it is great for transactions that wo n’t attract criminal attack , and terrible for those that will . ”
Similarly , Tim Anderson remarks :
“ The whole OpenID structure hinges on the URL routing to the correct machine on the Internet .
In other words , DNS .
Now do some research on DNS poisoning .
Scary . “
Then there are various browser vulnerability exploits that could have devastating consequences ( not just with regard to phishing ) if one were to rely on OpenID for anything beyond trivial uses with no real value at stake .
Quoting Petko D. Petkov : “ Cross - site scripting , also known as XSS , [ … ] works in situations in which attackers need to circumvent the browser security settings [ … ] to get access to unauthorized data using the browser as a proxy . [… ]
Cross - site scripting is an injection attack in which attackers supply malicious code as part of a GET or POST request .
It is sent to the attacked application and is then rendered as part of the remotely delivered HTML page .
This attack is perfect for stealing session identifiers or creating massive worm outbreaks [ … ] if [ users ] happen to visit a malicious website that contains an exploit of cross - site scripting vulnerability found on a page from the identity provider origin that is used by the user , attackers could inject malicious code within that scope and hijack the user ’s online identity .[… ] there are [ other ] threats such as the cross - site request forgery ( CSRF ) , which is an attack vector that also abuses the browser ’s same origin policies , but without the need to inject malicious code within the attacked website context .
CSRF attacks perform blind GET or POST requests to resources that are not protected by unique tokens .
Since the browser is configured to supply the necessary information , such as browser cookies and other settings to every request , attackers can perform actions on behalf of the user .
In this case , if the user is logged into the identity provider and visits a malicious page that executes a CSRF attack that causes a password reset , for example , attackers can hijack the user ’s identity again . “
On a similar note , Tom Allen Allen Tom in “ What ’s broken in OpenID 2.0 ″ says : “ [ A phishing site can ] spoof the realm using an open redirect server or by exploiting an XSS flaw on a trusted domain means that neither the user nor the OP knows what site that the user is signing into .
This leaves users vulnerable to being phished on the RP site because OPs , including AOL and MyOpenID , use the realm and return_to parameters to assert the identity of the RP to the user before redirecting the user back to the RP .
For example , it ’s pretty trivial for a phishing site to get the AOL or MyOpenID OPs to tell the user that they ’re signing into *.aol.com , *.microsoft.com , or *.go.com by exploiting redirect servers or XSS flaws on these trusted domains . [ … ]
Redirect servers , open reverse proxies , XSS flaws , and the like are widely known and eagerly circulated within certain communities , and without a doubt these bozos would be cranking out millions of SPIMs and SPAMS every hour if OpenID were to gain any traction in the mainstream . “
It does not stop here .
Alex Kuza says : “ [ There is a ] feature to set a site to be able to accept your credentials without you having to enter your OpenID password , and since your OpenID provider does not provide these details to the host , they do .
Of course , you still need to be logged into your OpenID provider , but since you ’re meant to be using this login for several sites , its not too much of a stretch to believe that you ’re going to be logged in all the time you ’re online – which is quite a large time frame . [… ]
This means that an attacker can log you into any site you decided to trust via CSRF attacks because the site cannot tell if you ’ve entered a password .
Now this might not seem important , but it is very important for both large and targeted attacks because the user no longer needs to be logged into the service you want to attack , but merely logged into the central service .
Even worse , this fact is completely misrepresented to users . [… ]
Another insecure ‘ feature ’ is the lack of need to enter a password to register for a site .
Out of [ … ]
3 OpenID vendors , only [ one ] asked users for a password when registering for a site , the other two had only CSRF protections .
This is admittedly not particularly serious because you still need an XSS ( or similar ) flaw in the OpenID provider ’s site before you can take advantage of the design idea , but it is rather worrying that people designing secure systems do n’t seem to want to implement defence in depth . “
As an example , the Tsyrklevich brothers at the recent Black Hat conference showed how using OpenID for online banking would allow attackers to wire money to their own account using a simple cross - site request forgery attack .
They also provided simple sample code for several hijacking , spoofing , and phishing attacks .
In sum , OpenID adds up to little more than simple password management with extra overhead and lots of security problems .
As Marc Canter stresses : “ if we ’re to stop phishing , and spoofing and ID theft – we need severe crypto , locked down , secure ID systems . ”
Ben Laurie elaborates as follows : “ The OpenID fanboys want OpenID to work on any old platform using only standard software , and so therefore are doomed to live in the world of broken authentication .
This is fine if what you protect with your OpenID is worthless , but it seems clear that these types of protocol are going to be used to authenticate for things of value . [ … ]
This is the root of the problem : if you want to protect anything of value , you have to do better than existing Web solutions .
You need better client - side software . [ … ] the best general way to handle this problem is through zero - knowledge proofs . ”
( Note : this is exactly what Credentica ’s technology does . )
PRIVACY PROBLEMS
Second , OpenID suffers from fundamental privacy problems .
For starters , Tom Allen in “ What ’s broken in OpenID 2.0 ″ points out the following privacy problem : “ In order to free up desirable userids , many large OPs recycle userids belonging to inactive accounts .
If an OpenID is recycled , the new owner will be able to access the previous owner ’s data if the RP is not aware that the OpenID has changed ownership .
This is a very problematic issue for mainstream OPs .
For example , if someone ( unknowningly ) uses a recycled OpenID to sign into Zooomr , the user may see the previous owner ’s private photos . “
Secondly , as Jan Miksovsky notes , OpenID ’s claim on their site that “ OpenID starts with the concept that anyone can identify themselves on the Internet the same way websites do — with a URI ” sounds “ dehumanizing and more than a little bit frightening . “
These issues may not be of grave concern to many users .
There is , however , a much more fundamental privacy problem with OpenID .
In the words of Ralph Bendrath : “ I have looked into it a bit closer now , and I just can say it sucks . [… ]
Your identity provider is able to track all websites you log into .
They even tell you it ’s a feature .
User profiling made easy ! [… ]
You have a unique identifier ( your OpenID uri ) for all relying parties , so you ca n’t choose between different cards or identities for different sites .
Cross - sites profiling made easy ! [… ]
The latter of course can be worked around if you use many different IDs .
But then you run into the usability problems that OpenID was meant to overcome in the first place – having to remember several logins , passwords and so on . “
As a blog commentor puts it : “ Is nobody of you guys concerned about the openid tracking capabilities ?
Who would wanna sign up with openid and let them know what websites you visit on a daily basis ? ”
The Tsyrklevich brothers sum it up as follows : “ the IdP can spy on the user ’s activity on the Internet as it is a central clearing place for all of the user ’s logins . ”
Or , in the words of a blog poster with the pseudonym Mordaxus , OpenID is “ a huge boon for anyone who wants to start tracking on the web . [ … ] if you want to steal from people or invade their privacy , OpenID is for you . “
In a piece called “ Why OpenID is going to destroy the Internet ” , Ilya Lichtenstein says : “ I ’m not the paranoid conspiracy - theorist type , but even I am terrified of what could happen if all of our actions on the Internet could be tracked to a single identity .
Imagine Big Brother coming across an offensive post you made on an anti-government website , and then tracking you through every book you bought , every comment you made , every song you listened to .
Do n’t say that this is already possible with an IP address - it takes a court order to get a name from an IP address , but your creepy neighbor could easily stalk you from your OpenID . [ … ]
Anonymity is one of the strengths of the Internet that allows for so much free expression - without it , the Internet loses one of its key strengths . [… ]
Imagine a key logger or trojan compromising your OpenID password because you logged in from an insecure public computer .
Now , the hacker controls every element of your digital life - so much for using different passwords on different sites for security .
Imagine an OpenID server being compromised - there go thousands of identities , full complete identities compromised with ease .
OpenID would be a ripe target for hackers . [ … ]
And , finally imagine what OpenID promises - all of your online identities , connected and unified .
Do you really want that ? “
Clearly , if OpenID were to be considered uses on a grander scale , the privacy implications would be enormous .
As the author of a blog post titled “ OpenID : A great thing … going amok ? ” puts it : “ More than anything else , privacy and free will would be my biggest concerns . [ … ]
What I do n’t like is being assigned an OpenID ( or anything else for that matter ) . [… ]
Personally , I was a bit peeved when WordPress turned this blog into an OpenID without ever asking me . [ … ]
Now , let ’s take that to another level : an entire nation requiring citizens to use OpenID .
The thought sets butterflies on a wild ride through my belly . “
So much for privacy .
Credentica ’s technology , in contrast , provides ultra-strong privacy guarantees that are provided by design .
These features , as do our multi-party security features , require more client - side intelligence than today ’s standard Web browser .
Even if OpenID were to embrace such client - side intelligence , however , its simplistic URL architecture would be fundamentally incompatible with privacy features such as untraceability , unlinkability , authenticated anonymity and pseudonymity , and minimal disclosure .
TRUST PROBLEMS
Third , there is the OpenID issue of trust ( or rather , the lack thereof ) .
The old OpenID site was quite explicit in this regard : “ What about trust ?
This is not a trust system .
Trust requires identity first . ”
As the author of a piece titled “ The OpenID Farce ” objects : “ Ummm , no .
Actually , Identity requires trust first .
Identity without trust is meaningless . [ …]
OpenID is Yet Another Identity Transport System … without trust . [ … ] an identity / trust system needs to convey that “ ‘ This is Steve ’ and I ’ll back that up with $ XX if I ’m wrong ” or “ ‘ This is Steve ’ by the authority of the State of California with all of the rights and responsibilities thereof ” . [… ]
If you ca n’t make that promise , do n’t talk to my about ID . ”
Or , in Jeremy Schoemaker ’s words : “ There ’s nothing stopping a fake Mark Cuban from creating a fake OpenID , or worse , a fake identity provider . “
Even for the trivial use cases that OpenID is used for today , this poses a major problem if OpenID were to gain in popularity .
By way of example , a commentor at Slashdot notes : “ Once this system is widely used , and spammers begin to register OpenIDs in huge numbers , how will site owners prevent spammy registrations ? [… ]
Blindly trusting OpenIDs and allowing them into a site , or giving them posting rights would be crazy . [ … ]
If [ this problem ] it is n’t solved we have a one - stop - shop for spammer IDs . “
USABILITY PROBLEMS
Fourth , OpenID suffers from usability problems .
Neil Cauldwell in a piece titled “ OpenID is too complicated ” says : “ I can log - in to any OpenID friendly site just by typing in ‘ NeilCauldwell.com ’ .
But do I ever use it ? [… ]
I ’m already signed - up with all the services I use on a regular basis , and have a password manager that handles the usernames .
In it ’s current state , OpenID is n’t going to do much for me [ … ]
Why sign - up to OpenID when your favourite sites are bookmarked by the browser , and authenticated by a password manager ? [… ]
Even if they have an OpenID , [ users ] still need to create and fill - out a unique profile within each service they use .
This means OpenID creates a double login procedure .
As we already know , once is bad enough . “
Jan Miksovsky notes : “ The process of selecting an OpenID provider will stump the average consumer . [… ]
Why would a site operator let anyone leave their site to perform a task from which they will never return ? [… ]
Currently , even those sites that do implement OpenID generally treat OpenIDs as a second - class form of identification .
They put their own proprietary means of signing in ( generally with a user name and password ) on their home page , and bury the OpenID sign in facility behind a link . [ … ]
And all this is for — what , exactly ?
To save me from having to pick a user name and password ? […. ]
I ca n’t imagine a sane business operator forcing their precious visitors through this gauntlet of user experience issues just for the marginal benefits that accrue to a shared form of ID . [ … ] there ’s no business of any size that can afford to direct their traffic down a dead end . “
ADOPTION PROBLEMS
Fifth , while lots of organizations are jumping in to become OpenID providers , there are virtually no OpenID consumers .
Dana Epp writes : “ I could care LESS if Six Apart or Technorati can be an OpenID provider .
I do n’t particularly have a lot of care or trust in them .
I want these sites to trust MY provider … which in this case is my own corporate authentication server . [… ]
I think that is getting lost with all these players . “
Nik Cubrilovic in a piece titled “ OpenID : Too many providers , not enough consumers ” writes : “ There have been a spate of announcements recently with a number of companies both large and small announcing that their products will ’ support ’ OpenID . [ … ]
All these OpenID support announcements and I am not getting anywhere with my OpenID . [ ….] it seems that while we have plenty of companies wanting to step up us providers ( easy ) and have their users use their OpenID ’s with other applications , we do n’t have enough companies stepping up as consumers of OpenID . [ … ] it seems that OpenID is flavor of the month and everybody is jumping on for the ride ( I could post ‘ Burger King Supports OpenID ’ and it would make the frontpage of digg ) . [… ]
It seems that most of the justification for the big companies and other apps not wanting to be providers is so that they can protect their customer base and maintain a hold . “
Microsoft ’s Dare Obasanjo points out that this reluctance to become an OpenID consumer may well be a fundamental problem : “ When you look at the long list of Open ID providers , you may be notice that there is no similar long list of sites that accept OpenID credentials .
In fact , there is no such list of sites readily available because the number of them is an embarassing fraction of the number of sites that act as Open ID providers .
Why this discrepancy ?
If you look around , you ’ll notice that the major online services [… ] all provide ways for third party sites to accept user credentials from their sites .
This increases the value of having an account on these services [ which ] increases the likelihood that I ’ll get an account with the service which makes it more likely that I ’ll be a regular user of the service which means $ $ $ .
On the other hand , accepting OpenIDs does the exact opposite .
It actually reduces the incentive to create an account on the site which reduces the likelihood I ’ll be a regular user of the site and less $ $ $ . “
Last , but not least , becoming an OpenID consumer means that another site ( potentially a competitor , now or in the future ) learns in real time which person is visiting at what time – potentially very valuable competitive information .
IMPERSONATION PROBLEMS [ this section added on June 3 , 2008 ]
As a consequence of the fact that an OpenID provider sees in real time which sites you log into , it also has the capability to log into any of these sites as “ you ” , possibly without you ever being able to find out .
This is particularly problematic in cases of sites that would give access to personal account information following login via OpenID .
Do you really want to give that much power to insiders at OpenID providers ?
Keep in mind that an “ insider ” may not just be unscrupulous management , but also a rogue employee , a virus , or a hacker with the proper privileges .
[ end of addition made June 3 , 2008 ]
AVAILABILITY PROBLEMS
Still another concern is pointed out by the author of a blog called Internet Duct Tape : “ The decentralization that is openID ’s strength is also it ’s biggest weakness .
If your openID server goes down then you ’re locked out of * all * of your other web accounts that used that login . [ … ]
In order to login to a web app with openID the web app needs to be working AND my openID server needs be working .
The greater number of interconnecting parts decreases my chances of getting everything to work together much more than the benefit of not having to manage multiple user accounts . [ … ] if you use someone else ’s openID server then you ’re screwed . “
PATENT PROBLEMS
What all of the above points at is that OpenID is lots of pain with little ( if any … ) gain .
If that is not enough reason for concern , then perhaps the following issue is .
This particular concern relates to OpenID ’s claim that it is an “ open , decentralized , free framework for user - centric digital identity : “
The issue here is not so much the one that Neil Cauldwell points out : “ If [ users ] sign - up to a service that only supports OpenID ’s from certain servers , OpenID is n’t even open .
At least with a proprietary sign - in process you be under no illusions that the username you created with service ‘ x ’ would work with service ‘y ’ .
But if the big players decide to mess about with server authentification , your OpenID may or may not work at another site .
This is where it becomes a complete mess .
No , the real issue is that various parties have made claims that OpenID is covered by their patents .
One patent is mentioned at the Wikipedia page on OpenID , which mentions a pending USPTO patent application with PCT priority from Denmark of March 9 2001 that “ covers the central aspects of OpenID . “
Other patents may apply as well .
Jeff Bohren says , “ Dave Kearns [ … ] talks about the patents that Sxip Identity has applied for which appear to cover OpenID .
He relates that Dick Hardt assured him that Sxip Identity will be issuing non-assertion statements on OpenID soon .
Of course I find it odd that a company would spend the time , effort , and money to pursue IP that they already do n’t intend to enforce . [ … ] the Sxip Patent Applications so far made public include [ … ] these . “
Chuck Mortimore , who used direct SXIP ’s engineering efforts , states “ I think its a gross mis-representation of the truth to say Open Id was based upon SXIP , ” but that is not necessarily an indication that the SXIP patents do not cover OpenID .
Even if one were to take the position that the abovementioned patents are pre-dated by tons of prior art and / or are “ obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art , ” that may hardly be reassuring for sites that establish themselves as OpenID providers or consumers – they risk being presented at any time in the future with litigation threat for patent infringement .
The “ pledges ” made by various players involved in OpenID that they will not sue for patent infringement do not prevent certain litigation scenarios from becoming a reality .
CONCLUSION
So , there you have it – why we ’re not working to ensure that our technology works with OpenID : there are simply irreconcilable differences between the two .
Now , mind you , it IS possible to do a drastic overhaul of OpenID so that it will be possible to provide multi-party security and privacy .
Doing so would amount in essence to discarding most of the OpenID work , keeping only the notion that in some cases it might be useful for individuals to facilitate “ identity provider discovery ” by providing a URL .
The reality is that at such a point we ’re not talking about an improved OpenID system anymore , as the use of a URL for IdP discovery would pretty much all that would remain .

I know what you 're thinking ; what the hell do dinosaurs have to do with Halloween ?
Normally , I 'd say not much .
You do n't see too many people running around in dinosaur costumes , you do n't see Dracula fighting a Tyrannosaurus Rex ( though that would make one hell of a good movie ) and you do n't normally see dinosaurs at pumpkin patches .
Well except for the prehistoric pumpkin patch that Count Pop visited a few years back ... go figure .
Well there 's something involving dinosaurs that I think fits right in with the spirit of Halloween .
I associate Halloween with horror .
I associate Halloween with gore .
Where am I going with all this ?
Topps once released a set of trading cards back in 1988 called " Dinosaurs Attack ! " which depicted dinosaurs attacking people in all kinds of horrific , extremely gory scenarios .
Frankly , I was amazed that Topps had the balls to release a set like this .
After all , 9 times outta 10 , kids would be the ones buying these things , not adults .
Sure , they had Garbage Pail Kids and other similar series , but none of them seem to hold up to the same level of utter disregard for human life that the Dinosaurs Attack !
cards so proudly put on display .
So the basic premise behind the cards is that they tell a story about dinosaurs being accidentally warped into modern times when a scientific experiment goes horribly wrong .
The dinosaurs then wreak havoc upon the world , killing everybody in sight in some of the most bizarre and blood - splatteringly brutal ways you could imagine .
The set has often been compared to the classic Mars Attacks trading cards from back in 1962 , but I still say Dinosaurs Attack ! has a far more unconventional and graphic storyline .
With that in mind , I 'd like to take you on a little tour of some of my favorite cards from the set just so you can see how truly " out there " it was .
Again , keep in mind that kids would be the ones collecting these things !
Let 's start off with this one :
Two Stegosauruses make their way into a police precinct and maul a bunch of the officers .
From the back of the card , " One swipe of a giant spiked tail tore a patrolman 's face to shreds , sending an eyeball flying and leaving his skull half - exposed .
Howling like a crazed animal in torment , he wandered about for a few moments before one of the creatures trampled him to death .
The walls of the station house were literally dripping with human organs and splattered blood , and what was once a proud symbol of power and security became a showroom of horror . "
And you were wondering why I thought this set was appropriate for the Halloween season ?
I rest my case .
Barney the dog gets squashed under the foot of a giant dinosaur while his youthful owner covers her eyes in terror .
Killing a little girl 's puppy ?
Nothing was taboo with these trading cards , and that 's why I love 'em so much .
Aside from the bride and groom being impaled on the dino 's horns , what I love about this card is that the back of it was made out to look like a wedding invitation and it 's splattered with blood .
' Til death do we part .
Here 's the back of one of the cards .
Some herbivorous dinosaurs attacked this band at their rock concert , mistaking their glam rock hair for the vegetation they used to feed on back in prehistoric times .
Another fantastic thing about this series is that it's one of the rare trading card sets where , quite often , the back of the cards were more entertaining than the front .
Another taboo they had no problem ignoring was depicting children being devoured by two Parasaurolophuses as their guts spilled out all over the place .
If only all field trips were that exciting .
As if having your building set on fire by dinosaurs is n't bad enough , these unlucky Londoners jumped from their burning homes only to land directly on the spikes of a Polacanthus that was passing by .
So not only were they on fire , they were impaled on top of it all .
Good times !
Another card back , this time it tells the tale of some hunters who were startled by a giant Duckbill dinosaur which capsized their boat and caused one of the hunters to accidentally shoot one of his pals .
Even the generally harmless dinosaurs find a way to kill humans in this card series .
Brilliant .
So not only did they work alien beings known as " Saurians " into the story , but they also managed to create some kind of ultimate evil that wants the dinosaurs to conquer the world .
I 'm sure you can guess what that ultimate evil is , but if not , do n't worry , we 'll get to it in a bit ...
About halfway through the story , mankind begins to fight back against the dinosaurs .
One of the greatest examples of this is a little girl who picks up a bazooka from a soldier who was just killed and uses it to blast a hole through a big Ceratosaurus .
The back of the card also states , " Splattered with the dinosaur 's blood , Melissa smiled triumphantly , then gave her little brother an enthusiastic ' thumbs up ' . "
Kids ... gotta love 'em .
Here 's another great " fighting back " card .
Looks like those weird old ladies who own hundreds of cats pack a lot of heat .
Another amusing thing from this particular card is that it says that the gunshot to the dinosaur " sparked a chain reaction which caused it to discharge electrical bolts and eventually self - destruct . "
SCIENCE !
What can I say , I just like this card because it features the dinosaurs , a lion , a gorilla and a guy squashed underneath it all while puking up blood .
If they could 've somehow worked a shark into the picture , it would 've been perfect .
Dinosaurs attacking all the nerds at the Comic - Con ?
Priceless .
I love how , even though people are being killed around him , the one nerd is running away with his comics still in hand because they 're really THAT important to him .
A few Pachycephalosaurs tear apart and crush some people at a picnic in one of the gorier cards .
One of the more absurd ( and inaccurate ) cards from the set .
Sorry pal , but if you can't fend off some Trilobites , you probably deserve to die .
That 's like being killed by Tribbles .
I love how , even though the world is under attack with people being killed left 'n right , the entertainment industry still sticks with its " the show must go on ! " credo .
The guy on the right there does n't even say anything , he 's just too shocked for words .
Never thought hear about a bunch of wrestlers in a ring taking on a dinosaur .
Nope , never thought I 'd hear about that ...
This beast materialized in the same space that Larry was standing in , and thus his atoms became fused with it .
SCIENCE !
Larry 's best friend , Sam , was nice enough to put Larry out of his misery by shooting him in the chest because that 's what friends are for .
Oh no !
Now who 's gonna report the news to us now ?
Kudos to these two for really getting into it .
You can tell some of the people they photographed for the cards did n't really wanna do it , but not these two guys .
They were ALL about being a part of the Dinosaur Attack !
trading cards set .
And here he is .
Satan .
Or perhaps a Satanosaurus ?
Whatever it is , this is the being that has been overseeing the dinosaurs ' destruction of the world .
It 's just grabbed Dr. Elias Thorne in hopes of stopping him from sending the dinosaurs back to where they came from .
But the doctor tells his wife , Helen , in the lab to finish the job because he 's already dead anyway as his flesh blisters and smokes in the hands of the Satanosaurus .
And so , Dr. Elias
Thorne makes the ultimate sacrifice to save mankind ...
Goddamn , that 's about as grim as you can get .
And these were cards they were selling to kids !
TO KIDS !
Yeah , we really had it made in the 80's .
Well , I suppose that was really about as much of a happy note as they could end the story on .
Dinosaurs Attack !
is truly one of the greatest non-sports trading card sets you could ever possibly own , and as a result of it being inexplicably uncelebrated by the general public , you can get a full set real cheap .
I got one for 5 bux a while back and you just can't beat a deal like that , so yourself a favor and pick up a set .
And if you like the cards as much as I do , you 'll probably want to grab the graphic novel which also includes four nice bonus cards that were n't included with the trading card set .
It was supposed to be a 3 - part series , but they only produced the one issue .
A damned shame really because it does tell the whole story with a little more depth than the cards have the room to do and it features some additional scenes of carnage that you wo n't want to miss .
Oh and if those bonus cards do n't sell you on the comic , perhaps this image I just scanned in from it will :
Why , why , WHY was n't this continued as a comic series !?
The comic book was produced by Eclipse Comics , a company whose intellectual property rights were bought by Todd McFarlane .
While I doubt they have any plans to release the 2nd and 3rd installments of this comic book , it can't hurt to try giving them a nudge in the right direction .
Contact McFarlane 's Publishing Department at this address and let them know you want to see a re-release of the original Dinosaurs Attack !
comic book from Eclipse Comics !
Furthermore , tell them you want to see issues 2 and 3 released to complete the story .
Alrighty , that 's all for Dinosaurs Attack ! , but before I go , I 'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bob Heffner for generously donating the pictures of the Dinosaurs Attack !
trading cards that he took the time to scan in .
If you would like to see the rest of the cards in the set , be sure to check out his site .
It 's a great memorial to what I consider to be one of the most bizarre , gory , artistic and hilarious trading cards sets of all time .

Microsoft will shutter its Windows XP line June 30 , as planned , ceasing sales of Windows XP Professional and Windows XP Home to retailers and direct OEMs , Microsoft confirmed to eWEEK April 3 .
The statement from Redmond executives ends weeks of speculation that Microsoft would extend the life of the operating system as users turn up their nose at Vista , the operating system meant to supplant XP , and OEMs argue lighter versions of desktops and notebooks do n't have the juice to run Vista .
Windows XP
Home and Starter editions will still be preloaded on ultra-low - cost PCs through June 30 , 2010 , or one year after the launch of the next version of Windows - whichever comes first , the company said .
" Last fall , our OEM partners asked us to extend sales of Windows XP to give their customers more time to transition to Windows Vista while we worked with other software vendors to expand application compatibility , " Michael Dix , the general manager for Windows Client , told eWEEK April 3 .
Windows Is Caught Between Linux and Mac
That decision was based on market feedback from customers and Microsoft's OEM and retail partners , and this decision not to extend that date is also based on their feedback , he said .
" They are telling us that they feel good about these dates and that the market is ready .
For those customers who actually want XP , we are providing enough time for them to actually get it and so we feel good about this being the right transition point , " he said .
Supporting ULCPCs / UMPCs
The decision to allow Windows XP on the ultra - low - cost PCs , or ULCPCs , reflected Microsoft 's commitment to ensuring that Windows was available for this new and growing class of low - cost , hardware - constrained computers that were originally intended for consumers in emerging markets , Dix said .
This also effectively offered OEMs choices based on their plans and assessments of what the market needed and wanted .
" They can elect to preload XP Home on these machines , a flavor of Vista or , in emerging markets , Starter Edition .
As this category is still in its infancy , we wanted to give OEMs flexibility , which is how we approached it , " Dix told eWEEK .
OEMs were considering a wide range of machine configurations in this category , and Windows Vista would be able to run on some of those .
But , at the very low end , in the range of 2 - and 4 - gigabyte flash devices , those would run XP Home , he said .
" But in the middle - and high - end , it is up to the OEM which operating system they choose to offer there , " he said .
But to Rob Enderle , the principal analyst for The Enderle Group , Vista just is too heavy for many of these devices and likely would not have been sold on them .
" For Microsoft , it was a choice of letting Linux go unchallenged in this segment or block it using XP , which provides a slightly better user experience and has some software compatibility advantages over most of the Linux implementations I 've seen so far , " he said .
" They wisely chose not to hand this market to Linux on a silver platter , but Linux will improve while XP wo n't , and some of the Linux stuff I 've seen lately is actually competitive with Apple . "
Microsoft was also publishing some formal guidelines to enable manufacturers to build extremely hardware - constrained machines with less than 4GB flash - based storage , and which can run Windows well and please customers , Dix said .
Many of Microsoft 's partners are now also offering affordable ULCPCs like Intel 's Classmate PC and Asus ' Eee PC in developed countries as well as in developing nations , he said .
Click here for eWEEK Labs ' take on shrunken notebooks such as the OQO 2 and the Eee PC .
Partner feedback and Microsoft's own internal research had found that customers preferred Windows on these machines as it was " a system they are familiar with , enables access to a vast ecosystem and provides them with a full operating system on these affordable PCs , " Dix said .
Asked if these machines could run both Windows and Linux , Dix said that was up to the discretion of the OEM , but " my guess is that they are going to be discouraged from doing that because of the hardware constraints they are working with .
Dual boot would require more space and partitioning an already small drive would be difficult to argue for , " he said .
Asked how the OLPC ( One Laptop Per Child ) played into this announcement , Dix said the challenge was that the OLPC 's XO machine was even more extreme in its hardware constraints than the typical ULCPC being shown on OEM road maps .
As such , Microsoft had a separate team of engineers working on a port of Windows to that machine , as this required a lot more development and focus than the traditional ULCPC , he said .

( c ) 2008 Lenore Costello for Gotham Gazette
Some call it a menace and an eyesore ; others consider it an expression of their first amendment rights .
Some of it has deep political meaning , while some is a word or two scribbled in permanent marker .
And it can be found all over the city : on rooftops , bridges , the walls of dilapidated buildings .
Graffiti and street art have been highly controversial forms of expression in New York for decades , disdained by art snobs and building superintendents alike .
The people who disparage it the most , however , are the city officials who clash with artists and taggers over their creations .
Interestingly , this battle has done nothing to diminish street art 's popularity .
And now , some experts say , that popularity could do what city official could n't : threaten the very essence of this ephemeral work .
The Eye of the Beholder
What exactly are street art and graffiti ?
For the graffiti artist , the goal is to " tag " the most places .
Extra respect goes to those who manage to emblazon their trademarks on hard - to - reach spots , like billboards and the tops of high buildings .
" If there are two graffiti artists , they will compete for fame .
They might never meet , but they compete because they see each others names so much , " said graffiti artist BG 183 of Tats Cru , a group of Bronx - based professional muralists .
Street art , on the other hand , usually has a political or social message and aims to encourage the viewer to think .
Although like graffiti , street art is usually illegal , many consider it an alternative art form , valuable to the community at large .
" Street art will only hit certain areas - rich areas -- next to museums or galleries where people with money will see and notice it .
They do n't go to tunnels , or the side of a highway .
They wo n't risk getting caught , " said BG 183 .
" Graffiti is used in the broader sense , and street art is sometimes classified as a subset of graffiti , " said Dave Combs , co-creator of the street art " Peel Magazine . "
But , he continued , " some people who do graffiti have an element of their motive being destruction or vandalism .
For the most part , people who do street art do it to create something new and meaningful and beautiful for the person viewing it . "
The Official View
City Council , though , does not share that view or distinguish much between street art and graffiti .
Some members claim both are a " public nuisance that degrades the quality of life in neighborhoods and communities across the city . "
To fight it , the council passed legislation in July , 2007 , forbidding anyone under 21 years old to carry materials that might be construed as graffiti instruments .
These include aerosol spray paint and broad - tipped indelible markers .
Some saw this as blatant age discrimination .
The council rejected that claim , citing studies that show most people believes those aged 18 to 21 are disproportionately responsible for graffiti .
Further , council members noted , there are other restrictions placed on those under 21 , including not allowing them to purchase and consume alcohol .

The legislation is not the only movement toward a crackdown on graffiti .
In October , Ellis Gallagher , a Brooklyn - based chalk artist , was arrested for drawing on the sidewalk in chalk , something he had been doing for years .
Gallagher 's arrest came only days after a summons was sent to a family in Park Slope , demanding that they remove the graffiti from their sidewalk or pay a fine of $ 300 .
The graffiti in question was also a chalk drawing , and the culprit was their six year - old daughter .
According to New York State penal law , graffiti is the " etching , painting , covering , drawing or otherwise placing of a mark upon public or private property with intent to damage such property , " a police department spokesman told a Brooklyn Paper reporter .
Given the impermanence of chalk drawings , they are a gray area in graffiti law but can still qualify as criminal mischief .
Into the Mainstream
While the city 's effort to combat street continue , its acceptance seems to be growing in the cultural world -- perhaps to the detriment of " real street art .
As its acceptance has grown , so has its proliferation .
There are books about the topic , and it is the main focus of magazines like " Overspray " and " Peel Magazine . "
Blogs , like The Wooster Collective and Streetsy display daily photos of street art from places all over the world .

Some artists have stopped limiting themselves using the streets as a canvas and begun using actual canvases , which then sell in galleries for thousands of dollars .
Artists , such as Swoon , have been featured in world - renowned museums like the Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum .
Certain major companies even commission graffiti artists to do advertisements for them .
Tats Cru has been commissioned by several name - brand companies , including Snapple and Nike , to create advertisements .
One of the artists , BG 183 , stated " For us , the way I look at it , we 're getting our name where regular artists can't go .
We 've been [ featured ] in museums , given lectures in college and traveled the world because of what we do .
I can teach other graffiti artists , but I do n't have to get caught and arrested .
How many people can say that they 're graffiti artists and make money from it ? "
James Cade ( professionally known as James Top ) , a former graffiti artist , currently teaches a 19 - week seminar at Hostos Community College in the Bronx entitled " Graffiti : The Art of Hip Hop . "
While many students were excited at the prospect of learning more about the taboo art form , Councilmember Peter Vallone claimed such a class would encourage vandalism .
Vallone , a leading opponent of graffiti , has introduced various bills concerning street crime and vandalism , including one to double the penalties for anyone convicted of graffiti .
Nonetheless , the class proceeded .
Artists vs. Street Art
As street art move more into the mainstream , some critics fear it will lose its essential edginess .
" The Splasher , " an unidentified person or group of people , splashed paint on a number of works by famous street artists from late 2006 to 2007 .
Next to the obliterated art they posted a wheat - pasted manifesto , whose awkward wording proclaimed street art to be a " fetishized action of banality " and that " representation is the most elemental form of alienation .
Art by representation is no exception . "
Believing that street art had become too commercial and mainstream , the Splasher felt the only way to counter it was through destruction .
Although no one is certain of the Splasher 's identity , 24 - year - old James Cooper was arrested for lighting a stink bomb at the gallery opening of well - known street artist Shepard Fairey on June 27 , 2007 .
The police and many street art enthusiasts suspect Cooper of taking part in the Splasher 's doings .
Two days after his arrest , a group gathered at another gallery opening and handed out 16 - page booklets , entitled " If we did it , this is how it would 've happened , " which indirectly claimed responsibility for the stink bomb .
The booklet 's wording was similar to that of the Splasher and included the various manifestos that the Splasher had posted .
There has been no sign of the group since .
" Street Art Blows " chooses pieces of street art it deems unworthy and places a sticker over them .
It states in bold red letters " Keep Your Art to Yourself Next Time . "
The group 's
Web site elaborates on this idea , claiming that street art and graffiti have great potential that is being squandered by the masses .
The site states : " Street art should be outside because it is necessary .
Street art should n't be important because it is outside . "
One of two Shepherd Fairey posters
commissioned by the Obama Campaign
But Street
Art 's movement toward the mainstream shows no sign of abating .
Consider the following : Shepard Fairey , one of the world 's most influential street artists , was recently commissioned by presidential candidate Barack Obama to design campaign posters .
The posters were sold at Barack Obama 's online store and quickly sold out .
In a letter to Fairey , Obama wrote : " I would like to thank you for the use of your talent in my campaign .
The political messages involved in your work and encouraged Americans to believe that they can help change the status - quo . "
As Combs stated , in reference to the poster : " There 's a kind of validation in that . "

Relationships end .
Although the resulting emotions are normal , too often the pain , anger , sense of betrayal , and rejection felt by the adults spills over into a desire to strike back .
Reaction , driven by raw emotion , replaces rational thought .
Unfortunately , too often any children born as a result of the relationship become caught in the crossfire .
Estranged parents use their children as objects of revenge , giving little thought to the affect on the child 's emotions or what the child is being deprived of .
Reactions created by those negative emotions have become increasingly volatile in recent years , leading to the deaths of custodial parents , children , or the entire family .
A large number of domestic dispute calls are the result of verbal threats or violence perpetrated by non custodial parents .
In other instances parents engage in a series of � get even ' tactics in response to actions each one takes against the other .
Several years ago I witnessed one example of that anger .
A mother was standing in a store parking lot arguing with the father of their son , who appeared to be about six or seven years old .
The father had failed to pick the child up for a scheduled weekend visit the previous Friday evening and had n't bothered to call .
This mother , with the child in tow , informed the father he " obviously did not really love his son . "
The boy 's father responded with a vulgar expletive and a remark about child support .
The father , who found out he had to work the weekend he was supposed to pick the boy up , should have called with the change of plans .
Perhaps arrangements could have been made with his ex-wife to pick the child up for dinner and an activity on that Friday evening .
Dad could have explained to his son , in person , the reason he would not be able to take him for the whole weekend and how much he was going to miss that extra time together .
Neither adult considered the effect their negative interaction with each other was having on their son .
The child was caught in the middle of a battle of words and thoughtless actions .
Driven by anger , and the need to get even , the mother thought only about how she had been put in a position of having to deal with her son's feelings when his father had neither shown up nor called , and how unfair that was to her .
By accusing her estranged husband of not loving his son she felt vindicated .
However , the adolescent was privy to the exchange and was left feeling rejected .
And , by not letting his son know he could n't pick him up , dad also made the young boy feel he had been forgotten .
The desire to place blame on the opposite party in a failed relationship has resulted in thousands of children having little , or no , contact with the non-custodial parent .
Fathers refuse to pay child support out of anger and a desire to punish the mother , without stopping to question whether the lack of extra financial support would create a standard of living that could impact the mother 's ability to feed , clothe , or get medical care for their offspring .
The parent retaining custody often punishes the non-custodial parent for issues that brought about the end of their relationship together .
Growing up in an unstable and combative environment , children are deprived of the emotional benefits that a relationship with both parents can provide .
This can impede a child 's ability to build and sustain strong , healthy romantic relationships later on in life .
There is also a chance that , as adults , children of divorced or separated parents will not have developed positive coping skills that will enable them to effectively deal with any failed relationships in their own lives .
Children , caught in the middle of a tug of war between adults who are angry and hurt , may translate discord into a belief that they caused their parent 's break up .
New questions then arise regarding the child 's own role in the family .
" Who should they love , is it okay to love both parents , and what if one parent gets mad because they think they are not loved equally ? "
The resulting upheaval makes life difficult for children when they should be focusing on school , friends , and enjoying their youth .
For the sake of their offspring , parents must deal with , and then set aside , any negative feelings and subsequent behaviors resulting from the break up .
Finding common ground is paramount .
A child 's emotional growth , along with their desire and need for the love and support of both parents , and the opportunity to know both parents equally , depends on that ability .
" Parents should try to overcome their differences and develop a relationship where they will be able to work as a team to provide guidance , structure , and love within their separate homes for their children . "
The keys to moving forwards are communication , understanding , compromise , and establishing neutral ground .
A different , yet positive , type of relationship between adults can grow from a desire and commitment to provide children with two loving and supportive parents .
Putting aside blame is a good first step , as is a promise to try and not talk about any negative feelings one parent has for the other , either in or out of the child 's presence .
Counseling is available to help estranged parents make a transition that works for both adults .
Some parents arrange an occasional meeting in the presence of their offspring in order to foster the idea that is okay for the child to love both adults openly , and that both parents will remain an integral part of their lives .
If a face to face meeting is too emotionally taxing for either adult , which is okay , too .
There have been cases where a parent chooses a neutral location where they can leave a child with a friend or family member .
This might be a park , or even a church or agency from which a non custodial parent can pick up and return the child following visits .
Another way to foster an atmosphere of family support and continuity is for both parents to attend some of their child 's functions together , agreeing to put aside any differences during shared outings .
Parent teacher association meetings at school , church confirmations , concerts , sports , scouts , local fairs , etc. provide plenty of space and a neutral atmosphere .
It is also important for parents to be able to sit down and discuss any issues that may arise regarding their children as each adult can bring a unique perspective to the table .
Many churches , schools , some Boys and Girls Clubs , civic organizations , and programs like Early Head Start and Head Start have � fatherhood initiatives ' that are designed to help , and encourage , fathers to get involved in the educational and social aspects of their child 's life , an opportunity they might not otherwise have .
Single , estranged , and teen fathers are all included as well as non-custodial fathers .
Some mothers have become more comfortable with the idea of letting children have a relationship with their father since there are usually supervised group activities and outings .
In the end , developing a wholesome although different type of relationship with the other parent is a win win situation for everyone .
Children get the time and emotional support they need from parents , as well as the unique talents and perspectives both can bring into their lives as they are growing up .
Adults learn how to move beyond the pain and anger , or sense of betrayal they feel .
Their relationship can rise to a new level as friends whose lives apart are centered around the child ( ren ) they had together .
This summer I am going to be studying for a comprehensive exam in political methodology ( statistics , game theory , formal modeling , simulations etc ... ) .
That is , I will be reading about math and statistics 2 - 4 hours daily for 104 days .
To break up the monotony and help get inspired , I am looking for books showing that mathematics / statistics is meaningful , important , and beautiful .
The books should be readable by a non -gifted , non -math major .
Any suggestions from the hive ?
Thanks !
Inspiring books about mathematics and statistics ?
Sadly ol '
Duke has n't left that era as Duke Nukem Forever has been in development since April of 1997 .
How much ass would it have kicked ?
Unfortunately for Duke Nukem Forever , its endless delays have rendered it a bit of a laughing stock .
Is it a practical joke by the developers ?
Or are they using the game as a front to launder money for the mob ?
And most importantly , why do people still care ?
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The reason is that the makers of Duke Nukem , 3D Realms , have a long and impressive track history .
As developers and publishers these guys had a huge hand in creating the entire first - person shooter genre , and their recent games have ranged from good to excellent .
If you want a game where you blow some shit up real good , these guys can deliver .
And the Duke Nukem games were n't bad in their day .
Also , these days
Duke would be free to be the towering monument to juvenile humor in a way that he could n't 10 years ago .
Do n't the 12 - year - olds of today ( or those still 12 - years - old at heart ) deserve this ?

So is there any chance it 'll come out ?
3D Realms seem to be stuck in some sort of time paradox where the more work they put into the game , the further it gets from being finished .
Here 's a trailer from 1998 ...
Holy shit !
Actual gameplay and plenty of it too !
Hell , this game looks near completion and by 1998 standards , pretty damn good .
Let 's move onto 2001 and another trailer for the game .
While it provided the splattered grey matter and blow - up doll women Duke Nukem connoisseurs demand , this trailer appears to be made up almost entirely of cut scenes with little actual gameplay on display .
What happened ?

Now let 's flash forward six years to a 2007 trailer :
Say goodbye to gameplay or even cutscene footage , say hello to a pre-rendered movie of Duke sitting on his ass amidst a black featureless expanse lifting a dumbbell .
A rather girlishly small dumbbell at that .
If 3D Realms does n't manage to escape this backwards paradox , by next year all they 'll have is concept art .
By 2010 if someone asks them about Duke Nukem Forever , they 'll scratch their heads in bewilderment , then demand to know what a " Duke Nukem " is and why retarded people were allowed to name it .

One of the biggest criticisms of Google ’s App Engine have been cries of lock - in , that the applications developed for the platform wo n’t be portable to any other service .
This morning , Chris Anderson , the Portland - based cofounder of the Grabb .it MP3 blog service , just released AppDrop — an elegant hack proving that ’s not true .
AppDrop is a container for applications developed with the Google App Engine SDK , running entirely on Amazon ’s EC2 infrastructure .
Just like Google ’s Appspot , anyone can use a modified SDK to deploy their App Engine apps directly to Amazon EC2 instead of Google , and they work without modification .
This proof - of - concept was built in only four days and can be deployed in virtually any Linux / Unix hosting environment , showing that moving applications off Google ’s servers is n’t as hard as everyone thought .
How does it work ?
Behind the scenes , AppDrop is simply a remote installation of the App Engine SDK , with the user authentication and identification modified to use a local silo instead of Google Accounts .
As a result , any application that works with the App Engine SDK should work flawlessly on AppDrop .
For example , here ’s Anderson ’s Fug This application running on Google App Engine and the identical code running on EC2 at AppDrop .
Of course , this simple portability comes at the cost of scalability .
The App Engine SDK does n’t use BigTable for its datastore , instead relying on a simple flat file on a single server .
This means issues with performance and no scalabity to speak of , but for apps with limited resource needs , something as simple as AppDrop would work fine .
I spoke to Chris this morning about his project and where he wants it to go .
“ AppDrop is open - source just like the Google SDK , so I ’m hoping someone will come along and take it to the next level , ” he said .
“ It would n’t be hard for a competent hacker to add real database support .
It would n’t be that hard to write a Python adapter to MySQL that would preserve the BigTable API .
And while that would n’t be quite as scalable as BigTable , we ’ve all seen that MySQL can take you pretty far .
On top of that , you could add multiple application machines connecting to the central database , and load - balancing , and all that rigamarole . ”
While this is only a hack , it demonstrates that App Engine developers do n’t need to live in fear of Google ’s reprisal .
“ The upshot is that if you put a lot of time into an App Engine app , and then run afoul of Google , you have alternatives , even if they are more work . ”
Update : Chris announced the project on his own blog , with some design notes .
April 20 , 2008 : Addressing concerns with data lock - in , Google announced that large - scale data import and export for will be coming soon to App Engine .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking shows that Hillary Clinton now receives 46 % of the support of Democrats nationally , compared to 45 % for Barack Obama , marking the first time Obama has not led in Gallup 's daily tracking since March 18 - 20 .

“ Most people who interpret their work take it as metaphorical , ” Professor Ihde added .
Lawrence Marek , a Manhattan architect who helped steer the house through the construction process , disagreed .
“ Arakawa does believe that if you build things the way he says to build them , life will be prolonged , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know if it will or not . ”
But , he added , “ the house has a way of making people happy  it ’s a feeling you do n’t get from many buildings  and we should be studying how that happens . ”

The couple also built nine reversible destiny  loft - style apartments in Mitaka , Japan .

ARAKAWA , who dropped his first name more than 40 years ago , grew up in Nagoya , Japan , studied medicine and art in Tokyo , and moved to New York in 1961 , when he was in his 20s .
In his pocket , he said , were $ 14 and the phone number of Marcel Duchamp , who was then living in Greenwich Village .
Duchamp , he said , became his patron .
Two years later he enrolled in art school in Brooklyn ( for the visa , he said , not the education ) .
There , he met Ms. Gins , a fellow student , who had grown up on Long Island .
At the time , she said , “ I was deeply alienated from society , which I did n’t see as having any answers . ”
Within days they had become a couple and begun making art together .
Over the next several decades , living in a loft building on Houston Street , they produced a body of work that includes poetry , philosophy , paintings and conceptual art .
From the start , Ms. Gins said , the central theme of their work was “ how to reverse the downhill course of human life . ”
One of their first built architectural projects , a park in central Japan called “ Site of Reversible Destiny , ” was completed in 1995 .
Made up of acres of warped surfaces , it offers visitors advice , in a handout leaflet , like “ Instead of being fearful of losing your balance , look forward to it . ”
( Several people who are said to have broken bones there might wish the name of the park were literally true . )
In 1997 the SoHo branch of the Guggenheim Museum put on a retrospective of the couple ’s works .
Roberta Smith , writing in The New York Times , noted that “ their philosophical or linguistic puzzles can stretch the mind in briefly pleasant ways , ” but did not applaud their efforts to build real - world buildings : “ Theoretical follies , one of the plagues of contemporary architecture , have their place , and it ’s on paper , ” she wrote .
For the couple , though , “ one building is worth a decade of theoretical exploration , ” Ms. Gins said .
In 1998 they won a competition , sponsored by the city of Tokyo , to build a vast housing project on 75 acres of landfill .
The project was never realized , but a group of supporters in Tokyo arranged to build nine loft - style units , which in many ways resemble the house in East Hampton .
More recently , they said , they have been trying to find backers  an effort that has included failed overtures to Russian oil billionaires  for a reversible destiny hotel .
Frontline ‘s " Bush ’s War " on PBS Monday and Tuesday evening was a nicely put - together rehash of the top players ’ trickery that led to the attack on Iraq , together with the power - grabbing , back - stabbing , and limitless incompetence of the occupation .
Except for an inside - the - Beltway tidbit here and there  for example , about how the pitiable former Secretary of State Colin Powell had to suffer so many indignities at the hands of other type - A hard chargers  Frontline added little to the discussion .
Notably missing was any allusion to the unconscionable role the Fourth Estate adopted as indiscriminate cheerleader for the home team ; nor was there any mention that the invasion was a serious violation of international law .
But those omissions , I suppose , should have come as no surprise .
Nor was it a surprise that any viewer hoping for insight into why Cheney and Bush were so eager to attack Iraq was left with very thin gruel .
It was more infotainment , bereft of substantive discussion of the whys and wherefores of what in my view is the most disastrous foreign policy move in our nation ’s history .
Despite recent acknowledgments from the likes of Alan Greenspan , Gen. John Abizaid , and others that oil and permanent ( or , if you prefer , " enduring " ) military bases were among the main objectives , Frontline avoided any real discussion of such delicate factors .
Someone not already aware of how our media has become a tool of the Bush administration might have been shocked at how Frontline could have missed one of President George W. Bush ’s most telling " signing statements . "
Underneath the recent Defense Authorization
Act , he wrote that he did not feel bound by the law ’s explicit prohibition against using the funding :
" (1 ) To establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq
" (2 ) To exercise United States control of the oil resources of Iraq . "
So the Frontline show was largely pap .
At one point , however , the garrulous former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage did allude to one of the largest elephants in the living room 
Israel ’s far - right Likudniks  and their close alliance with the so - called neoconservatives running our policy toward the Middle East .
But Armitage did so only tangentially , referring to the welcome ( if totally unrealistic ) promise by Ahmed Chalabi that , upon being put in power in Baghdad , he would recognize Israel .
Not surprisingly , the interviewer did not pick up on that comment ; indeed , I ’m surprised the remark avoided the cutting room floor .
Courage No Longer a Frontline Hallmark
Frontline has done no timely reportage that might be looked upon as disparaging the George W. Bush administration 
I mean , for example , the real aims behind the war , not simply the gross incompetence characterizing its conduct .
Like so many others , Frontline has been , let ’s just say it , cowardly in real time  no doubt intimidated partly by attacks on its funding that were inspired by the White House .
And now ?
Well the retrospective criticism of incompetence comes as polling shows two - thirds of the country against the Iraq occupation ( and the number is surely higher among PBS viewers ) .
So Frontline is repositioning itself as a mild ex-post - facto critic of the war , but still unwilling to go very far out on a limb .
Explaining the aims behind war crimes can , of course , be risky .
It is as though an invisible Joseph Goebbels holds sway .
Too Late
On Monday evening I found myself initially applauding Frontline ‘s matter - of - fact , who - shot - John chronology of how our country got lied into attacking and occupying Iraq .
Then I got to thinking  have I not seen this picture before ?
Many times ?
It took a Hollywood producer to recognize and act promptly on the con games that sober observers could not miss as the war progressed .
Where were the celebrated " weapons of mass destruction " ( WMD ) ?
Robert Greenwald simply could not abide the president ’s switch to " weapons of mass destruction programs , " which presumably might be easier to find than the much - ballyhooed WMD so heavily advertised before the attack on Iraq .
You remember  those remarkable WMD about which UN chief inspector Hans Blix quipped that the U.S. had one hundred percent certainty of their existence in Iraq , but zero percent certainty as to where they were .
Robert Greenwald called me in May 2003 .
He had read a few of the memoranda published by Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) exposing the various charades being acted out by the administration and wanted to know what we thought of the president ’s new circumlocution on WMD .
I complimented him on smelling a rat and gave him names of my VIPS colleagues and other experienced folks who could fill him in on the details .
Wasting no time , he arrived here in Washington in June , armed simply with copious notes and a cameraman .
Greenwald conducted the interviews , flew back to his eager young crew in Hollywood and , poof , the DVD Uncovered : The War on Iraq was released at the beginning of November 2003 .
So Frontline is four and a half years behind a Hollywood producer with appropriate interest and skepticism .
( Full disclosure : I appear in Uncovered , as do many of the interviewees appearing in Frontline ‘s " Bush ’s War . " )
Actually , the interviewing by Frontline occurred just a few months later .
I know because I was among those interviewed for that as well , as was my good friend and former colleague at the CIA , Mel Goodman .
I was struck that Mel looked four years younger on this week ’s Frontline .
It only then dawned on me that he was four years younger when interviewed .
Have a look at Uncovered , and see how you think it compares to Frontline ‘s " Bush ’s War . "
Safety in Retrospectives
It also struck me that producing a Frontline - style retrospective going back several years is a much less risky genre to work with .
Chalk it up to my perspective as an intelligence analyst , but ducking the incredibly important issues at stake over the next several months is , in my opinion , unconscionable .
The troop " surge " in Iraq , for example .
Only toward the very end of the program does Frontline allow a bit of relevant candor on a point that has been self - evident since Cheney and Bush , against strong opposition from Generals Abizaid and Casey ( and apparently even Rumsfeld ) , decided to double down by sending 30,000 more troops into Iraq .
A malleable new secretary of defense would deal with the recalcitrant generals and pick a Petraeus ex Machina of equal malleability and political astuteness to implement this stopgap plan .
Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist / author Steve Coll , with typical candor , put the " surge " into perspective :
" The decision at a minimum guaranteed that his [ Bush ’s ] presidency would not end with a defeat in history ’s eyes ; that by committing to the surge , he was certain to at least achieve a stalemate . "
Given this week ’s fresh surge of violence as the U.S. surge is scheduled to wind down , even a stalemate may be in some doubt .
But , okay , small kudos to Frontline for including that bit of truth  however obvious  and for adding the grim background music to its final comment : " Soon Bush ’s war will be handed to someone else . "
Rather Not , Thank You
Intimidation of the media is what has happened all around , including with Frontline , which not so many years ago was able to do some gutsy reporting .
Let me give you another example about which few are aware .
Do you remember when Dan Rather made his Apologia Pro Vita Sua , admitting that the American media , including him , was failing to reveal the truth about things like Iraq ?
Speaking to the BBC on May 16 , 2002 , Rather compared the situation to the fear of " necklacing " in South Africa :
“ ‘ It ’s an obscene comparison , ’ Rather said , ‘ but there was a time in South Africa when people would put flaming tires around peoples ’ necks if they dissented .
In some ways , the fear is that you will be neck - laced here , you will have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck . ’
" Talking to another reporter , Dan told it straight about the careerism that keeps U.S. journalists in line .
‘ It ’s that fear that keeps [ American ] journalists from asking the toughest of the tough questions and to continue to bore - in on the tough questions so often . ' ”
The comparison to " necklacing " may be " obscene " but , sadly , it is not far off the mark .
So what happened to the newly outspoken Dan Rather with the newly found courage , when he ran afoul of Vice President Dick Cheney and the immense pressure he exerts on the corporate media ?
We know about the lies and the cheerleading for attacking Iraq .
But there is much more most of us do not know and remain unable to learn if Rather and other one - time journalists keep acting like Bert Lahr ’s cowardly lion in The Wizard of Oz before he gets " the nerve " and courage .
For Dan Rather , the fear would simply not go away even after leaving CBS for HDNet and promising that , on his new Dan Rather Reports show , viewers would see hard - hitting and courageous reporting that he said he could n’t do at CBS .
Will it surprise you that Dan Rather can not shake the necklace ?
I refer specifically to a program for Dan Rather Reports , meticulously prepared by award - winning producer Kristina Borjesson .
The special included interviews with an impressive string of firsthand witnesses to neocon machinations prior to the U.S. attack on Iraq , and provides real insights into motivations  the kind of insights Frontline did not even attempt .
Nipped in the Bud by the " Dark Side "
Last year Borjesson ’s taping was finished and the editing had begun .
Borjesson ’s requests to interview people working for the vice president had been denied .
But , following standard journalistic practice ( not to mention common courtesy ) , she sent an e-mail to John Hannah in Cheney ’s office in order to give Hannah a chance to react to what others  including several of the same senior folks on Frontline last evening  had said about him for her forthcoming report .
At that point all hell broke loose .
Borjesson was abruptly told by Rather ’s executive producer that by sending the e-mail , Borjesson could have " brought down the whole ( Dan Rather Reports ) operation . "
The show was killed and Borjesson sacked .
For good measure , she was also accused of " coaching " interview subjects and taking their words out of context .
Since neither Rather nor his executive producer would provide proof to substantiate that allegation , Borjesson took the unprecedented step of sending her script and transcripts to all her interview subjects , asking them to confirm or deny that she had coached them or taken their words out of context .
Not one of them found her script inaccurate or said they were coached .
She has the e-mails to prove this .
This sorry episode and Frontline ‘s careful avoidance of basic issues like the strategic aims of the Bush administration in invading and occupying Iraq are proof , if further proof were needed , that the White House , and especially Cheney ’s swollen office , exert enormous pressure over what we are allowed to see and hear .
The fear they instill in the corporate press , and in what once was serious investigative reporting of programs like Frontline , translates into programs getting neutered or killed outright  and massive public ignorance .
Some consolation is to be found in the good news that , in this particular case , Kristina Borjesson is made of stronger stuff ; she has not given up , and was greatly encouraged by how many of the very senior officials and former officials she had already interviewed consented to be re-interviewed ( since the tapes belonged to the " Rather Not " folks ) .
Now who looks forward to being re-interviewed ?
Borjesson ’s original interviewees took into account her problems with the cowards and the censors  and her atypical , gutsy refusal to self - censor  and went the extra mile .
A tribute to them as well , and their interest in getting the truth out .
Borjesson is now completing the program on her own .
Look for an announcement in the coming months , if you ’re interested in real sustenance rather than the pabulum served up , no doubt under duress , by Frontline .

The WB brand , born as a broadcast network in 1995 and closed in 2006 , will return as an online video
Web site combining short original series with classic shows , the Warner Brothers Television Group announced Monday .
TheWB.com , and a complementary site for children called KidsWB.com , are part of a “ digital destination ” strategy by Warner Brothers , a subsidiary of Time Warner , to tailor Web sites to specific audiences .
In trying to compete for consumers ’ time , Warner Brothers and other media companies have sought new outlets for content , sometimes bypassing the traditional network structure and creating broadband Internet channels .
“ My 20 - year - old daughter and her friends are watching ‘ One Tree Hill ’ and ‘ Pushing Daisies , ’ but not on television , ” Bruce Rosenblum , the president of the Warner television group , said .
“ They ’re watching on laptops and cellphones .
Here ’s the interesting part  to them , that is television . ”
Rails 2.1 - Partial Updates May Create Invalid Records
Rails 2.1 will do partial SQL updates .
This will improve performance , but it has the potential to create invalid records .
Two update queries can each change an attribute that in combination makes a record invalid .
Prior to Rails 2.1 , the second update would change all the attributes , preventing this issue .
Here 's an arbitrary example .
Let 's say we have an Employee class .
Employees must have a salary of 1 , 2 , or 3 .
Managers must have a salary of 3 , 4 , or 5 .
Here 's the schema and the Employee class .
create_table : employees do | t | t . boolean : manager t . integer : salary end class Employee < ActiveRecord :: Base validate : validate_salary protected def validate_salary valid_salary_range = manager ? ? ( 3 .. 6 ) : ( 1 .. 3 ) unless valid_salary_range .
include ? ( salary ) errors .
add_to_base ( " Salary is not valid . " ) end end end
Let 's create an employee who is not a manager and has a salary of 3 .
employee = Employee .
create ! ( : manager => false , : salary => 3 )
Web requests come in to separate processes to update the employee .
Process 1 and process 2 each fetch the record before either process does an update .
update1 = Employee . find ( employee . id ) update2 = Employee . find ( employee . id )
The first process makes the employee a manager .
The salary stays at 3 , which is valid for a manager .
update1 . manager = true update1 . save !
The second process lowers the employee 's salary to 2 , which is valid for a non-manager .
update2 . salary = 2 update2 . save !
The two updates in conjunction make the record invalid .
Employee . find ( employee . id ) . valid ?
Here is the SQL from the updates .
UPDATE `employees` SET `manager` = 1 WHERE `id` = 1 UPDATE `employees` SET `salary` = 2 WHERE `id` = 1
Prior to Rails 2.1 , the SQL for the updates would have been :
UPDATE `employees` SET `salary` = 3 , `manager` = 1 WHERE `id` = 1 UPDATE `employees` SET `salary` = 2 , `manager` = 0 WHERE `id` = 1
This is only going to happen if two updates occur close to the same time , so it 's more likely on high traffic sites .
It also will only happen if a validation depends on the state of two or more attributes .

Advertisement Lorry drivers have staged a protest at the rising cost of fuel , at the same time as speculation mounted about a government rethink on road tax .
Hundreds of lorry drivers protested in London and a two - mile line of lorries crawled along the M4 towards Cardiff .
Hauliers say diesel prices topping 120 p a litre , plus the planned 2 p fuel tax rise , will drive firms " to the wall " .
Meanwhile , ministers said Alistair Darling was " listening " to fears over plans to raise vehicle excise duty .
The government is planning to increase road tax on older , more polluting vehicles , and next week the chancellor will meet Labour MPs opposed to the plan .
So far , 42 MPs have signed a Commons motion asking him to reconsider the policy on the grounds that it is retrospective and therefore " unfair " to people who have already bought their cars .
Blockades
While the chancellor cannot control global oil prices , hauliers want an " essential user " duty rebate on fuel of between 20 p and 25 p a litre to ease competition with foreign haulage companies .
UK'S CHEAPEST & MOST EXPENSIVE FUEL Cheapest unleaded : 108.9 p ( Mansfield )
Most expensive unleaded : 126.9 p ( Newport , Isle of Wight ) Cheapest diesel : 115.9 p ( Banff ) Most expensive diesel : 140.9 p ( Isle of Mull ) Latest figures from PetrolPrices.com
Car tax rates guide
In pictures : Fuel protests ' We can't carry on like this '
Mike Greene , leader of the protests in Wales , told the BBC that , unless the government agreed to the rebate within seven days , lorries would blockade refineries and ports .
Peter Carroll , from TransAction 2007 which organised the London protest , said he did not condone blockades , but found it " hard to condemn them " , given how much hauliers were suffering .
The BBC 's environment analyst , Roger Harrabin , said it was family - run , small and medium - sized firms that were worst hit .
See how UK petrol and diesel prices have risen
He said large companies were able to raise their rates to absorb higher fuel costs and could also more easily pass on the pain of price rises to consumers .
' Real crisis '
Organisers had hoped as many as 1,000 lorries would take part in the protest in London , but Peter Carroll , from TransAction , said the turnout was about 500 .
Police put the figure at 300 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We have a worldwide reputation for being an expensive country for fuel .
No wonder they call us ' treasure island '
Adrian , Chester
The lorries parked on the eastbound A40 closing the carriageway between the northern roundabout A3220 junction and Paddington from 1000 BST until 1600 BST .
Some drivers also joined a rally in central London before petitioning 10 Downing Street .
Mr Carroll said hauliers were being " murdered " by rising costs , and the public 's response to their plight had been " enormously positive " .
" We feel we could n't have put on a better or bigger display to show the government this is a real crisis , " he said .
" The acid test will now be whether they listen to us . "
In Wales , police said about 100 lorries took part in a 60 - mile convoy protest from Cross Hands , near Llanelli .
Other reports put the figure at about 170 .
Convoys have blocked the A40 and disrupted traffic on the M4 They had planned to hand in a petition to the Welsh assembly at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay , but police turned back many vehicles and diverted others to a service station west of the city .
Martin Arthur , who owns a haulage firm in Usk , Monmouthshire , said : " We have to make ourselves heard or people will keep walking all over us .
" People will have to stop working sooner or later because there 's no point working for a loss . "
Commons Transport Committee chairwoman Louise Ellman said ministers should acknowledge widespread concerns over soaring fuel costs but not be forced into policy decisions by protests .
" Everybody is feeling the impact of the increased cost of living , " she said .
" That 's something the government will have to think about . "
LONDON CONVOYS
Trucks from Cowbit , Lincolnshire head to A40 in London via M1 , A406 and Hanger Lane Gyratory Trucks from M2 Medway Services , Kent head to A40 in London via Vauxhall Bridge , Grosvenor Road , Chelsea Embankment , Finborough Road , Warwick Road , Holland Road and West Cross Route ( A3220 ) Coaches take drivers from parking on A40 to 1130 BST Marble Arch rally
All vehicles supposed to leave A40 by 1530 BST A Treasury spokesman said the government understood businesses and families were " feeling the pressure from high fuel prices " .
But they said the " immediate priority " was to encourage oil - producing countries to increase output , that a 2 p - per - litre fuel duty increase had been put back from April to October and fuel duty was " still 11 % below its 1999 level in real terms " .
The Treasury also defended its plan to increase vehicle excise duty for vehicles registered since 2001 that emit higher levels of pollutants .
Owners of the most polluting cars could face a rise of as much as £ 200 , but a spokesman said the policy was needed to " strengthen the environmental incentive to develop and purchase fuel - efficient cars " .
Business Secretary John Hutton told the BBC the chancellor was " listening to what people are saying about vehicle excise duty " .
He also said the government wanted UK hauliers to have " a fair deal " and the chancellor would have " to consider how he wants to go forward on this " .
Justice Secretary Jack Straw told the BBC he " fully understood " the hauliers ' concerns , but " government revenues have to come from somewhere " .
He said any decisions made about increased road tax would be made in the autumn statement .

先日学生に聞かれたんですよ。
「 下流工程は大変って聞きますが、上流は楽なんですよね？」
よろしい、君はよく勉強している。でも根本的に間違っている。下流工程が辛いのは、上流工程でちゃんと仕事ができなかったからだ*1。
というわけで、主に学生向きに話を単純化して語ってみます。これが普通だとか、一般的だとか言うつもりはなく、違う視点もあるかと思いますが、一つの考え方として。
SI でのシステム開発は、建設業にたとえられます。が。 顧客の希望を聞き、設計し、施工し、引き渡す。こういった工程を踏む仕事ということで、システム開発はよく建設業にたとえられます。実際に工程管理の手法なども似通っています。ところが、大抵の場合、耐震偽造をした建築物よりもシステムのほうが脆弱に仕上がります。何故でしょうか。
一つには、建物の図面を引くには建築士の資格が必要ですが、システムの設計に資格は必要ありません。
もう一つ、建物は、強度とかの内部構造はお客さんの知ったこっちゃない(建築基準を満たすことは義務付けられていますし)わけで、一方で設備とか間取りとかデザインは設計段階において目に見える形で提示されます。システム開発は、内部構造の基準もありませんし、目に見える部分もなんだかはっきりしませんよ。
さらに大きな違いがあります。建物は、建て始めちゃってから設計変更をするためには一回壊すことが必要ですが、システムは(一見)何も問題なく設計変更することができます。いや、できないんだけど、できます(ぉ
このような違いが悲惨な現場を生むのです。
上流工程のお仕事 というわけで、お客さんの要望を漏れなく汲み取り、あるいは常識的過ぎて忘れているものを思い出させてあげたり、インテリジェントな機能を提案したり、防犯対策や災害対策をきっちり考えたりすることが上流工程の仕事です。
上流工程が破綻する原因は色々ありますし、後になって気付く失敗もあります。
コンサルが出来ないことを出来ると言って仕事に仕立て上げた。「このビルは、空を飛べます！(嘘つきにもほどがある！ ) 」
営業が絶対出来ない予算で取って来た。「１億円あればできます！(土地代だけで１億超えるんだけど… ) 」
お客さんが何を作りたいか自分でもわかっていない。「うーんと、ほら、都庁みたいなアレ、アレが作って欲しいんだよ…(アレってなんだ？ ) 」
ディテールにこだわるけど肝心なことが何一つ決まらない。「ロビーは大理石で、ドアノブは全部ホテルタイプで…(それより階数とか部屋数を決めようよ… ) 」
絶対に必要なものを組み込むことを忘れていた。「( そういえば…トイレはどこ？ ) 」
業界では常識かも知れないけど一般的じゃなくて認識相違「客商売なんだから最後に４が付く部屋番号なんてダメに決まっているじゃないか！」
その他諸々 最初の二つはともかく、それ以降の話はSEの本分で、こういった問題を起こさず、何が必要なのか、自分の常識に囚われていないか、大事なものを見落としていないか、というのを探っていくのが仕事なのです。お客さんは基本的に素人ですから、システムに何が必要なのかを本当にはわかっていません。だから、目的をはっきりさせて、その実現方法をしっかり提示することが上流工程の仕事です。
でも、トイレいらなくね？ お客さんは、システムとして何が重要なのかわかりません。たとえ本来の目的(主に業務要件)ではなくても必要なもの(主に機能要件)というのはあります。これを忘れてしまうと大変なことになりますが、できるだけ安く作ろうということで、その大事なものがコスト削減の対象になっちゃったりします。いや、なくちゃダメなんだって。
その必要性をお客さんに認識させるのがエンジニアのコミュニケーションスキルの見せ所(そう、勘違いしてはいけませんが、SEに必要なコミュニケーションスキルとはお客さんと仲良くなることではなくて、大切なことを種々の手段で納得させることを指します)です。これがすごい大変。もう泣くほど大変。バカなお客さんも大変ですが、賢すぎるお客さんも大変です。あと、やたらこちらを信頼してくれるのはいいけどわからないことは教えてください…
というわけで、なんだかんだいって、トイレを図面に書くことが許されないこともあります。
配管工事くらいはしておこう 「 じゃあいいよいらないんだろ！」なんて逆切れしてトイレのない建物をお客さんに渡してみたいものですが、システムは納品のときに検収やユーザーテストというものがあって、そこで欠陥が発見されると「こんなもの使えるか！」みたいに拒否られてしまうのです。なんと理不尽な！。で、大抵トイレがない建物のダメさ加減は使ってみれば気付くわけです。さて、お客さん、どうするか。「トイレがない建物なんて使えるわけがないだろ！」もはや逆切れです。言った言わないの水掛け論。先に言質をとっておけばよいのですが、お客さんに「トイレいらないんですね！一筆書いてください」なんて言えないこともあります。ああ、立場が弱い僕達。
でも、あとで言われるのなんてわかっているじゃないですか。水周りの工事なんて、一度やったら直すことは困難ですから、事前に拡張性の高い設計をしておくことでリスクを最小限にすることができます。
ああ、お客さんの声が聞こえてきますよ。「なんでトイレがないんだー」はいはい、何とかしますから。
ここで追加料金が取れるのがいいお客さんです。そりゃそうだよ、要らないって言ってハンコ押してんだから。
たまに、どうしても予算が取れなくて、とか、全部システム屋側のせいにしてお金を出さない客もいます。でも、そこで無償で対応しちゃうとシステムなんてそんなものって勘違いされるんですよね。そして、頑張ってしまって出来てしまうと、「ほら、できるじゃん」といわれてしまうのです。いや、確かに出来たけど、地上３０階の非常口の向こうにロープを伝っていかないとたどり着けない空中トイレとか、行きます？
After nearly two months , the Federal Communication Commissions 700M
Hz spectrum auction has come to an end .
Bidding far exceeded the FCC 's preauction hopes of $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion , with the final tally coming in at $ 19,592,420,000 .
The auction ended this afternoon with a terse announcement by the Commission that there were no " bids , withdrawals , or proactive activity rule waivers " during round 261 .
" Therefore , Auction 73 has closed under the simultaneous stopping rule . "
The auction topped the $ 19 billion mark back in early February , so bidding since then has been slow , to say the least .
Of the two most closely watched chunks of spectrum in the auction , Blocks C and De , only C hit the FCC 's reserve price .
Block D fell over $ 800 million short of the FCC 's minimum .
Block C , which had some notable open access rules attached to it , passed the FCC's $ 4.638 billion reserve price on the final day of January .
A $ 4.744 billion bid pushed it past the threshold , but that was the final bid on the nationwide license for Block C. Afterwards , Block C bidding moved to regional licenses , which could be used separately or combined to form a single , nationwide network .
Block D never saw any action after an initial $ 472 million bid .
That chunk of spectrum was supposed to be used for both a commercial broadband service and a nationwide emergency communications network .
Frontline Wireless was expected to be a major player for Block D , but it dropped out before the auction began .
With the Block D reserve unmet , the FCC has the option of auctioning it off again with different rules or a lower reserve .
Rep. Edward Markey ( D - MA ) , Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet , called on the FCC rethink the reserve requirement for Block D , and whether the public safety spectrum model should be " retained or modified . "
Like the rest of us , Rep .
Markey is eager to find out who the big winners are .
" I also am eager to ascertain the extent to which new entrants have succeeded in obtaining licenses through this auction , " he said in a statement released after the auction closed .
One of those new entrants may be Google , which was one of the companies approved for participation in the auction .
It 's more likely that one of the major wireless players like Verizon will walk away with Block C ; however , the FCC is expected to release the identities of the winning bidders soon .
The spectrum itself will not become available until after analog television transmissions are ended in February 2009 .
Once the spectrum is freed up , it may take the winners some time to build out their networks .
' Primitive ' White House technology lost more than 1M emails over 1,000 days , former employee says Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday February 27 , 2008

Print This Email This Questions remain over Cheney 's missing Plame e-mails
The internal workings of the White House that caused it to lose perhaps millions of internal e-mails over several years is becoming clearer , but with that sharper focus comes diminishing hopes among Democrats and open - government activists that history will ever get the full picture of how the Bush administration operated .
At a Capitol Hill hearing yesterday , a former White House computer technician outlined the administration 's shortcomings in implementing a " primitive " e-mail archiving system that created a high risk the information would be lost .
Steven McDevitt , who worked for the administration from 2002 to 2006 , also doubled previously reported estimates of the number of days of missing e-mails .
Investigators for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee previously said e-mails were missing for 473 days ; McDevit said in written testimony to the committee that the number was closer to 1,000 days .
He also said at least 1 million e-mails were believed to have gone missing ; activists have estimated the number of missing e-mails is closer to 10 million .
The exact number of missing e-mails is unknown , but several days on which e-mails were not archived covered key dates in a Justice Department inquiry into the roles of Vice President Dick Cheney and his aides in leaking the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
As RAW STORY previously reported , no e-mails were archived on the very day the probe was announced and White House officials were ordered to maintain anything that could become evidence in the investigation that ended the conviction of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Cheney 's former chief of staff , on perjury and obstruction of justice charges .
As The Associated Press reports , Tuesday 's hearing shed some light on what happened to e-mails from the Vice President 's office , but many questions remain unanswered .
For the first time , a former White House computer technician went public with the details .
Steven McDevitt revealed in written statements submitted to Congress how a plan was developed to try to recover the missing e-mail for [ Special Prosecutor Patrick ] Fitzgerald .
Ultimately , 250 pages of electronic messages were retrieved from the personal e-mail accounts of officials in Cheney 's office , but whether that amounted to all the relevant e-mail is a question that may never be answered .
McDevitt made clear that it was a sensitive issue inside the White House .
" I worked with ... White House Counsel on efforts to provide an explanation to the special prosecutor , " McDevitt wrote .
" This included providing a briefing to the special prosecutor 's staff on this subject . "
Rep. Henry Waxman , the committee 's chairman , also said during Tuesday 's hearing that the Republican National Committee , which had hosted e-mail addresses used for official business by White House adviser Karl Rove and others , " has no intention of trying to restore the missing White House e-mails . "
The Washington Post provides some background : Administration officials have acknowledged that Rove and many other White House officials routinely used RNC accounts for government business , despite rules requiring that they conduct such business through official communications channels .
The RNC deleted all e-mails until 2004 , when it exempted White House officials from its e-mail purging policy .
About 80 White House aides used RNC accounts for official government business , committee staff members said .
Rove , for example , sent or received 140,000 e-mails on RNC servers from 2002 to 2007 , and more than half involved official " .gov " accounts , the panel has said .
The RNC dispute is part of a broader debate over whether the Bush administration has complied with long - standing statutory requirements to preserve official White House records -- including those reflecting potentially sensitive policy discussions -- for history and in case of future legal demands .
Whether historians will ever get a full picture of internal deliberations remains to be seen .
But Tuesday 's hearing went a long way toward exposing problems with the White House and RNC .
McDevitt , according to the Associated Press , also revealed that : _ The White House had no complete inventory of e-mail files .
_ Until mid-2005 the e-mail system had serious security flaws , in which " everyone " on the White House computer network had access to e-mail .
McDevitt wrote that the " potential impact " of the security flaw was that there was no way to verify that retained data had not been modified .
_ There was no automatic system to ensure that e-mails were archived and preserved .
The National Security Archive , which is suing the White House over its poor record keeping , said Tuesday that the hearing revealed incompetence on the part of the White House , which also ignored warnings that its e-mails were not being archived in accordance with legal requirements .
" The White House 's witnesses disclaimed knowledge and responsibility for the e-mail problem , " said Meredith Fuchs , the group 's general counsel , in a statement .
" The [ National Archives ] witnesses said that they are waiting for the White House to take action .
But no one is doing anything and time is running out . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Birds start singing in the spring because of a biological response to longer days , researchers said on Wednesday .

When birds are exposed to light for longer periods , certain brain cells trigger a series of hormonal reactions telling them to find a mating partner , which they do by singing , a team of Japanese and British researchers reported in the journal Nature .
“ While we knew what area of the brain was affected by seasonal change , until now we did not know the exact mechanism involved , ” said Peter Sharp , a researcher at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh , who worked on the study .
The researchers , led by Takashi Yoshimura of the Nagoya University in Japan , scanned 38,000 genes present in brain samples taken from Japanese quails to see which of the birds ’ genes were affected by varying degrees of light .
Genes in cells on the surface of the brain switched on when the birds received more light and began releasing a thyroid - stimulating hormone .
The genes activated 14 hours after dawn on the first day of sufficient length , the researchers said .
“ Such knowledge would have been impossible in the past , but advances in technology enabled us to scan thousands of genes so that we could work out which ones are affected by seasonal change , ” Sharp said in a telephone interview .
This hormone , previously associated with growth and metabolism , helped to stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete other hormones .
In turn this caused the birds ’ testes to grow , which eventually resulted in crowing to attract a mate .
The findings could also one day lead to better treatments for infertility because humans have the same cells in the same part of the brain , Sharp added .
“ It is sitting there and standing there with the same characteristics as in birds , ” he said .
“ The big question is whether these cells are involved in the reproductive system . ”
Yes .
Shocking .

The nightmare comes in different versions .
You show up for the first day of class , but it 's really the final exam .
You 're introduced to speak to a large audience and totally forget what you 're supposed to say .
For a politician , especially one running as a uniter for president of these 57 United States , it 's something else .
And just now it happened up in South Dakota which is right next to Iowa , which means they are different states .
The Democratic frontrunner Sen. Barack Obama of another state , Illinois , had an enthusiastic double - barreled stump introduction from two local luminaries , former Sens .
Tom Daschle and George McGovern , who was an equally enthusiastic supporter of Sen. Hillary Clinton until recently .
But he changed his mind .
McGovern knows a little about presidential races , having once been the Democratic presidential candidate himself way back in 1972 .
He lost though .
Both South Dakotans lavished all sorts of praise on Obama , according to reporters present , including The Times Nicholas Riccardi .
As the large , enthusiastic crowd of some 7,000 supporters roared and waved " We can do it " signs and Bruce Springsteen 's " The Rising " blared , Obama bounded onto stage , grabbed the microphone and said , " Thank you , Sioux City ! "
Trouble is , Obama was in Sioux Falls .
So was the crowd , which suddenly fell silent .
Where are those Southwest Airlines get - away flights when you need them ?
" I 'm sorry , " Obama quickly caught himself .
" Sioux Falls .
I 've been in Iowa too long . "
Now , that line may not go over too well in the Hawkeye State , which gave him his first big caucus win way back in January .
Obama went on to give yet another rousing stump speech , seeking support in the state 's primary June 3 , the last one along with Montana .
The Dakota crowd was enthusiastic .
And the freshman Illinois senator threw in several extra references to South Dakota for good measure .
On to who knows where now ?
More below .
And a hat tip to Cassy Fiano .

In its story today on Obama 's appearance and his geographic gaffe , the local newspaper 's website , the ArgusLeader.com , made its own gaffe with the initial headline : " Obama starts speech with a gaff " )

Interesting things happen when architects are hand - cuffed guided by local restrictions and client ’s desires .
A custom home design more often than not will look like a watered - down version of an original idea that might have stood for something spectacular if not ultimately designed by committee .
This F - 117 Stealth Fighter inspired house in Kronberg , Germany , is very much the exception to this rule .
Satisfying the needs of local authorities and incorporating the required pitched roof , designers Architect Meixner Schluter Wendt used this feature as a launch point for the rest of their design dubbed Haus F .
By segmenting the house in three parts ; the cellar ( located completely underground ) , a glass wrapped garden level ( includes the kitchen and family room ) and the “ Flying Form ” which houses the bedrooms and bathrooms , this design creates the illusion of a billion dollars worth of high - tech terror taking off for targets in Tikrit .

GARY , Indiana ( Reuters ) - White House hopeful Barack Obama on Thursday linked the dollar ’s steep slide to imbalances in the U.S. economy and Bush administration policies , which he said had put the country deeply in debt .

Obama , who is battling Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination , said Americans were buying more products abroad than they were selling to overseas markets .
“ We are spending all our money , spending overseas and spending dollars and nobody is buying things from us , ” Obama told a town hall event in Gary , Indiana , in response to a question .
“ What happens is Saudi Arabia ’s got a lot of dollars because they ’re selling a lot of oil .
In China , they have a lot of dollars because they ’re selling us all the things all the stuff we used to make right here in Gary , ” Obama said .
“ And at a certain point , they say you know , we have enough dollars , ” he said .
“ Our banks are full of them right now . ”
The dollar has lost roughly 40 percent of its value since 2002 .
In recent months , the pace of the dollar ’s drop has accelerated as investors around the world have lost confidence in the health of the U.S. economy .
Obama , who has taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago , used a professorial style to giving a longer version of the answer that modern U.S Treasury secretaries routinely offer when asked about the U.S. currency -- that its value reflects economic fundamentals .
But he went a step further in saying that President George W. Bush ’s policies have hurt the economy and therefore weakened the dollar .
“ We ’ve been borrowing money like nobody ’s business from China .
We ’re like that cousin who always comes over and never seems to have job .
You know that guy who always has new rims on his car , ” Obama , who is vying to be the Democratic nominee against Republican Sen. John McCain in the November election .
Obama said that the national debt has gone up sharply because of the Iraq war , which by the time it is over “ will cost us over $ 1 trillion . ”
At the same , Bush has given “ tax cuts to some of the wealthiest Americans who did n’t need it and were n’t even asking for it . ”
“ The point is , the way to strengthen the dollar is to strengthen the economy and the way to strengthen the economy is to invest in our infrastructure , invest in our information systems , roll back those Bush tax cuts , end this war , get our budget in balance , ” Obama said .
“ If we do those things then over time , the dollar will actually get stronger , ” he said .

Judge orders CIA to turn over 2002 torture memo Reuters
Published : Thursday May 8 , 2008
|
Print This Email This NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge ordered the Central Intelligence Agency on Thursday to submit to the court a 2002 memo said to specify harsh interrogation methods used on suspected terrorists held abroad .
The American Civil Liberties Union said the memo was written by the Department of Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel and sent to the CIA in August 2002 .
The ACLU described the memo as " one of the most important torture documents still being withheld by the Bush administration . "
In a copy of the order posted on the ACLU 's Web site , Judge Alvin Hellerstein told the government to produce the memo so he can determine whether it should be made public as part of a lawsuit the ACLU and other organizations filed in June 2004 requesting records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
Hellerstein has scheduled a review of the document for Monday .
" This memo authorized the CIA to use specific torture techniques -- including waterboarding , " Jameel Jaffer , ACLU 's national security project director , said in a statement .
" CIA agents waterboarded prisoners because this memo told them that they could , " he said .
" The memo is being withheld not for legitimate security reasons , but in order to protect government officials from accountability for their decisions . "
Waterboarding is a simulated drowning technique .
The ACLU said more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to its lawsuit .
Among those was a declassified 2003 memo , released by the U.S. Justice Department on April 1 , that justified the use of harsh interrogation methods for suspected terrorists held abroad .
A subsequent decision overruled the memo , which said President George W. Bush 's authority as commander - in - chief superseded international law regarding wartime interrogations .
The U.S. military has banned the use of waterboarding and other harsh methods considered by some rights advocates to be torture .
The U.S. intelligence community has not .
Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , but he has repeatedly insisted that the United States does not torture prisoners .
The CIA has said it used waterboarding during the interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who faces murder charges in the U.S. military court at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .

Dr. Nobody , Rep. Ron Paul , the libertarian - like Texan who 's a year older than McCain , raked in $ 6 million one slow Sunday last December from his motivated followers when everyone else was ...
But that means this interim run-up to the general election is a week longer .
And $ 15 lousy million ?
For the Republican who 's supposed to represent all the fat cats and big businesses ?
McCain folks tell fellow blogger Marc Ambinder that March was their best month and quarter ever .
And tonight McCain expects to take in $ 400,000 from a banquet in Washington .
To be sure , Sens.
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are still donating their millions to TV stations all over Pennsylvania and North Carolina contradicting each other in 30 seconds or less , which is worth something to the Arizonan with the GOP nod sewn up .
McCain is preparing to take maybe $ 85 million in public funds for the general election , which is a week shorter for the late - meeting Republicans .
How can the troublesome twin Democratic candidates raise $ 60 million between them last month and John McCain scrapes together barely $ 15 million , according to campaign sources .
And this is supposed to be so great ?
A successful month for this guy ?
thinking about Christmas .
And then the congressman , who all but 803,000 supporters who voted for him so far dismissed as never having a chance at the GOP nomination , outpaced all the Republicans for that fourth quarter with $ 20 million .
McCain is in some kind of financial trouble .
First of all , would - be Republican donors and voters are downhearted , apparently believing all the media hype and allegedly self - fulfilling polls about this being a Democrat year .
They 're voting less , caucusing less and giving less in state after state .
Additionally , there 's a price to being a maverick .
Over time , the folks you 've mavericked , say , the kind of folks who did n't like your McCain - Feingold campaign finance reforms or the ones who lost out on that lucrative aircraft contract , they sort of drift away .
But most importantly , McCain is a horrible fundraiser .
Always has been .
Nobody in the political business likes begging for bucks , but they do it because they must .
McCain hates it .
He 's not one of those canape - crunching , conversation - making , how - about - those - D'backs kind of small talkers , can you please help a poor candidate out with a couple grand ?
And he 's not been organized for it .
He 's especially not organized for small donor drives .
We saw the impact of this last spring and summer , when the alleged Republican front - runner 's campaign imploded in disarray and overspending and McCain ended up flying solo again on commercial flights , crammed into Row 22 F on US Air to South Carolina .
McCain over the years has proved particularly awful at organizing drives to tap small donors , not short people but the folks who give $ 100 here and there or $ 25 a month like Paul 's and Obama 's financial fans .
Those are the folks you can go back to .
Forty percent of Obama 's donors last month gave less than $ 200 .
The figure for McCain was 24 % ; for Clinton even worse , 23 % .
Obama 's donor list totals about 1.3 million now .
And he can reach every single one of them within the hour .
Last month Obama , who 's assembled $ 230 million total so far , took in another $ 40 million , less than his stunning $ 55 million in February , but still twice Clinton 's March donations .
McCain's February total was a measly $ 11 million .
That 's nearly $ 1.3 million a day for Obama last month , $ 900 every minute of every day all month , while McCain 's finance folks were collecting about $ 336 a minute .
More importantly , Obama got that money from 442,000 donors , 218,000 of them brand new givers at an average of $ 96 per person .
That 's a lot of people -- voters -- buying into his effort .
Who do you think they 'll vote for to make it all worthwhile ?
McCain sources bragged to Ambinder that $ 11 million of their $ 15 million came from large donors , big checks .
McCain needs help .
His former adversary , Mitt Romney , who spent more than $ 43 million of his own dough on his own campaign , has promised to raise another $ 15 million from Romney supporters later this spring .
So if you already gave to the former Massachusetts governor , watch for that e-mail or envelope in your mailbox soon .
To someone who endured 66 months of solitary confinement , loneliness and torture in a dank Vietnamese prisoner of war cell , a stunning seven - month political comeback like McCain 's in comfortable hotels may seem like a long vacation .
So no one would ever underestimate the former flier 's grit .
But to make a race of it in the fall , he 's still gonna need more dough in the spring and summer .

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush said on Tuesday that he would hold Iran responsible if it hit American ships and warned the Islamic Republic not to behave provocatively in Gulf waters .
“ If they hit our ships , we will hold Iran responsible , ” Bush told a small group of journalists .
“ They ’d better be careful and not be provocative . ”
Bush reiterated his threat of serious consequences if Iranian vessels confront U.S. war ships in the Gulf but insisted he had told Gulf Arab leaders on a regional tour that “ I want to solve this diplomatically . ”
Washington says its warships were threatened by Iranian craft in the Strait of Hormuz , a vital route for crude oil shipments from the world ’s biggest producing region .

For decades , conventional wisdom has held that daylight - saving time , which begins March 9 , reduces energy use .
But a unique situation in Indiana provides evidence challenging that view : Springing forward may actually waste energy .
Up until two years ago , only 15 of Indiana 's 92 counties set their clocks an hour ahead in the spring and an hour back in the fall .
The rest stayed on standard time all year , in part because farmers resisted the prospect of having to work an extra hour in the morning dark .
But many residents came to hate falling in and out of sync with businesses and residents in neighboring states and prevailed upon the Indiana Legislature to put the entire state on daylight - saving time beginning in the spring of 2006 .
Indiana 's change of heart gave University of California - Santa Barbara economics professor Matthew Kotchen and Ph.D. student Laura Grant a unique way to see how the time shift affects energy use .
Using more than seven million monthly meter readings from Duke Energy Corp. , covering nearly all the households in southern Indiana for three years , they were able to compare energy consumption before and after counties began observing daylight - saving time .
Readings from counties that had already adopted daylight - saving time provided a control group that helped them to adjust for changes in weather from one year to the next .
Their finding : Having the entire state switch to daylight - saving time each year , rather than stay on standard time , costs Indiana households an additional $ 8.6 million in electricity bills .
They conclude that the reduced cost of lighting in afternoons during daylight - saving time is more than offset by the higher air - conditioning costs on hot afternoons and increased heating costs on cool mornings .
In October 2006 , Hans Reiser , creator of the ReiserFS filesystem , was arrested under the suspicion of the murder of his wife , Nina , who had disappeared off the face of the earth after dropping their two children off at Hans ’ home .
The two were divorced , and fighting a legal battle over ownership of the Namesys company and the custody of their children .
Even though the body was never found , he has been declared guilty of first degree murder .
According to reports , the six - month trial culminated in a two and half day long deliberation .
The prosecutors presented a “ mountain ” of circumstantial evidence , such as emails in which Reiser called his wife and her family “ nazis ” , the fact he ripped out the carpeting and passenger seat of his car , and withdrew thousands of Dollars .
In addition , traces of Nina ’s blood were found in Hans ’ home , and Hans did not help in the search after her disappearance .
Hans Reiser ’s defence pointed to the lack of direct evidence linking him to the disappearance , and that there were normal explanations for his behaviour after the disappearance .
They also stated that since no body had been found , Nina might still be alive – although several people testified she would never leave her children .
Hans Reiser appeared shocked as the verdict was read .
DuBois , Reiser ’s attorney , said : “ We ’re disappointed , but we ’re not completely surprised . ”
There are a number of cases where public controversies remain in areas where the scientific community considers the existing body of evidence conclusive .
One such topic , which Ars has experience with , is the proposal that mercury - containing vaccines play a causative role in the development of autism .
Despite the fact that all evidence points against the existence of a link , some parents of autistic children have pursued both " cures " for mercury poisoning and lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers .
One of those lawsuits has now embroiled an autism blogger , Kathleen Seidel , and her attempts to stay out of it may wind up testing constitutional issues and the role of citizen - journalists .
The diagnosis of childhood autism typically coincides with the recommended time for childhood vaccines , leading many to speculate that there is a connection between the two .
One guess was the mercury used as a preservative in many vaccines .
Several countries have since discontinued the use of mercury in vaccines , however , and it has had zero impact on the rate of autism ; that , combined with the lack of a plausible biological mechanism , has caused the scientific community to reject this proposal and move on .
The public , however , clearly has not .
Siedel has described one such lawsuit aimed at her blog on the site Neurodiversity .
The parents of an autistic child initially sued manufacturers of several vaccines that used mercury , as well as Bayer , which makes an injection given during pregnancy .
As the vaccine charges have been thrown out , the suit has been expanded to include almost any source of mercury , including a company that runs coal - burning power plants .
( A PDF of the current complaint is available at Neurodiversity . )
Siedel 's post was almost exclusively focused on the legal maneuverings , although it did include the accurate statement that the fracas was the result of " the overwhelmingly discredited scientific hypothesis that autism is a consequence of mercury poisoning . "
Only the final paragraph veered towards editorializing , calling the suit , " a hydra - headed quest for revenge , for compensation , and for judicial validation of autism causation theories roundly rejected by the greater scientific community . "
That , apparently , was enough to draw the attention of the attorneys involved .
In late March , Siedel received a subpoena that seeks her appearance as part of the lawsuit .
Should the subpoena stand , Siedel would also have to produce documents regarding the financial operations of Neurodiversity and any contacts with the government or pharmaceutical industry , other members of the autism blogging community , or scientific journals .
Bizarrely , Siedel would also have to produce any " communication with any religious groups ( Muslim or otherwise ) " — this may be related to the fact that one half of the couple is an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church .
Siedel has obtained counsel and is attempting to quash the subpoena .
Part of her response points out just how easy it would be for a blogger to be intimidated into going along ; Neurodiversity is a money loser , and most of the " documents " relevant to it are already public somewhere on the site .
But the motion also gives a great picture of what 's at stake , including Siedel 's freedom of religious association and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure .
It also makes a strong claim that bloggers are journalists .
" The materials and information demanded in the subpoena are subject to the journalist 's privilege , " writes Siedel .
" Although I am unaffiliated with a traditional news organization , and am not compensated for my work except to the extent described above , I am a de facto citizen - journalist regularly engaged in the public dissemination of news and information , and the promotion of discourse and advocacy regarding issues of national importance . "
The subpoena has problems on so many grounds , that Siedel 's motion may be upheld without a ruling on constitutional grounds or the status of bloggers .
If the judge chooses to rule broadly , however the decision could help clarify what role the blogging community has in the public discourse .
Rick Davis , the manager of Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign , is a typical Washington insider in many ways , having long worked as both a lobbyist and a political operative along the intersection of politics , policy and money .
Now Mr. Davis is overseeing new lobbyist - related guidelines that the campaign has issued in an effort to safeguard Mr. McCain ’s reputation as an opponent of special interests .
The plan , among other things , bars “ registered ” lobbyists , those who must file disclosure reports listing their clients , from working on the campaign .
Mr. Davis , who last worked as a registered lobbyist in 2005 and took a leave from his lobbying firm in 2006 , appears to meet those guidelines .
Still , his own business dealings in recent years  roles that include consultant and investor  extend beyond lobbying and illustrate the limits of the guidelines in defining what it means to be selling expertise and helping to provide access .
Take Mr. Davis ’s involvement with one of his lesser - known lobbying clients , an Israeli company , Imagesat , which sells satellite imagery .
Along with lobbying for it , Mr. Davis became a consultant to a private investment firm that had a financial stake in it .
That connection opened the door for him to get in on the ground floor of other investments made by the firm , Pegasus Capital Advisors .

Push for urban parkland takes root
The housing market is tanking , but one kind of real estate is gaining value in major U.S. cities : parkland .
After years of infighting over what to do with the few remaining areas of open space in metropolitan areas , several communities are creating huge urban parks — several times the size of New York 's 843 - acre Central Park .
" We grew so rapidly in the '80s and '90s in the rate we were consuming land , people did become alarmed , " says David Goldberg , spokesman for Smart Growth America , a national coalition promoting green space .
" This desire for parkland and capitalizing on natural assets is really taking hold . "
It is spurred by several factors , including mounting environmental concerns , improved property values for park - side real estate , increased demand for green space from health - conscious people moving back to cities and a greater availability of vacant industrial land .
The parks development comes despite troubled public finances in many metro areas because of the housing and credit crunch .
Several ambitious urban park projects that are underway : • In Orange County , Calif. , a 1,347 - acre park is being developed on the site of the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station .
The federal government is retaining another 1,000 acres for a wildlife and wilderness area .
Residential , commercial and industrial projects will go up on another 2,400 acres .
" For so long , we 've neglected the public realm , " says Larry Agran , an Irvine City Council member and former mayor who chairs the Orange County Great Park Corp .
" The park is everyone 's backyard , and it enhances property values . "
• In Memphis , a final plan will be selected soon for the 4,500 - acre Shelby Farms — formerly a prison farm that was turned over to a group that will develop the park .
" Our work is really focused on the public realm , " says Alexander Garvin , a Yale University professor and park planner who is advising the Shelby Farms Park Conservancy .
" How do you use public property to shape quality of life in the city ? "
Most of the great urban parks were created in the 19th or early 20th century .
Garvin , who managed the Lower Manhattan design selection for the World Trade Center site , says Shelby Farms will represent what parks will look like in the 21st century .
• In Atlanta , " The BeltLine " will connect almost every city neighborhood to walking trails , trolleys and parkland .
It will add 1,400 acres of parks on 13 sites along transit lines .
• On New York 's Staten Island , the 2,200 - acre Fresh Kills Landfill , which became the storage place for the ruins of the World Trade Center after 9/11 , is set to become the largest park built in the city in more than a century .
The dumpsite is getting biking trails , boating and fishing spots , waterfront restaurants and art .
• In Alabama , U.S. Steel sold a 1,100 - acre tract atop Red Mountain in Birmingham to a land trust at a deep discount : $ 7 million for land valued at more than $ 16 million .
Red Mountain
Park will have 18 miles of trails , fishing ponds .
Not an easy sell For 35 years , prisoners were brought to Shelby Farms in Memphis to till fields and pick crops .
They produced food for inmates and sold the rest for the state .
It was acclaimed as an innovative way to rehabilitate prisoners .
It has n't been a penal farm for more than four decades , but a rehabilitation of a different sort is underway .
After a protracted tug of war over whether the county should turn the land over to commercial and residential developers , Shelby Farms is finally on the verge of being redesigned as an ecological showcase .
The county approved a conservation easement that allows park use but heavily restricts commercial development .
" It was a very courageous decision , " says Laura Adams , interim director of development of the Shelby Farms Park Conservancy .
" The county could 've made a different decision — to sell off 1,000 acres and develop a Wal - Mart . …
We would 've had office buildings , residential , commercial . "
Over the years , there were attempts to build shopping centers , golf courses and conference centers .
In the 1980s , a few bison were brought in to create a wildlife preserve .
The preserve did n't quite happen , but the buffaloes stayed .
There are 30 now .
The final plan for the park , which was unveiled last week , may incorporate aspects of several proposals , including trails that will connect across the city and county all the way to the Memphis Riverfront , a network of amenities showcasing the Mississippi River .
" It 's a real 21st - century park , " Adams says .
" It 's ecologically sound , environmentally sound and it possibly would generate its own energy . "
In Southern California , it took almost a decade and four ballot initiatives to finally get Orange County residents to agree to turn a former military base into the Great Park .
One of the early proposals : to build an international airport .
" A tremendous battle , " Agran says .
" But as the population grows , as land values increase , older urban areas and metropolitan areas are good candidates for better land use . "
About half of the 4,700 acres will be developed .
There will be three residential areas , one in a transit district around a train station .
" There 's a growing awareness of the importance of providing green space to cities around the country , " says Catherine Nagel , executive director of the City Parks Alliance and the National Association for Olmsted Parks ( named after landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted , one of Central Park 's designers ) .
" We 're seeing a renaissance of parks supporters . "
For the first time , her organizations have invited speakers from other countries to their urban parks conference this fall in Pittsburgh .
Growing green space " The environmental movement is looking to use as much of the landscape as possible to clean the air , provide natural drainage and do the kind of nature - friendly work that parks do , " says Garvin , who also works on the Atlanta BeltLine .
Concern over public health is another great motivator for cities to create parks and encourage outdoor activity , he says .
Since the 1970s , the U.S. obesity rate has doubled .
Diabetes eats up one of every $ 5 Americans spend on health care .
The more pragmatic incentive : Parks generate real estate development on their edges , Garvin says .
" If you look at Central Park , you can see what I 'm talking about . "

Did n’t anyone ever tell you that salt mines , shallow lakes and deep - earth drills should n’t mix ?
What started as a seemingly minor miscalculation resulted in a billion - gallon flood , unbelievable property damage and the upheaval of an entire ecosystem .
Amazingly , this catastrophe cost no lives though it remains one of history ’s most devastating engineering disasters .
On a fateful day in 1980 a group of oil drillers were working in a shallow lake in Louisiana probing for oil .
A miscalculation sent their drill straight into a large salt mine shaft below the lake ’s surface .
The hole started at just over a foot in diameter but rapidly widened as the water from the lake above washed away the salt around it .
What started out quite simply ended in disaster that no one could have predicted .
Workers above on the oil platform recognized something was wrong and ‘ jumped ship ’ before the entire platform disappeared below their feet in a growing whirlpool – all in what was supposed to be a shallow lake !
Meanwhile , in the salt mines below , workers made their way through flooded tunnels and all managed to ( in some cases narrowly ) make it out alive .
Despite all of the chaos , no one died above or below ground .
Before it was through , the surface whirlpool managed to suck down islands , barge docks , barges , trees , trucks , an entire parking lock and 3.5 billion gallons of water .
The flow of water normally leading from the lake into Vermilion Bay was reversed as the lake refilled itself , and also created the largest waterfall in Louisiana history ( over 150 feet ) as water poured back into the lake .
In the process , what started as a ten - foot - deep freshwater lake became a thousand - foot - deep saltwater lake !

WS - Deathstar for the REST of Us : A Story of Ruby , WSDL , and Salesforce May 5 , 2008
UPDATE : ( Jan. 13 , 2011 )
As so often happens in the Ruby world , this blog entry is out of date .
I ’ve heard reports about various SOAP libraries no longer working with Ruby 1.9 , but I have n’t had the need to test them out .
If you ’re working with Salesforce and Ruby , development dm - salesforce seems to have carried on , meaning that you wo n’t have to do most of these steps .
I ’m going to leave this up for posterity and to help anyone who may need to dig around in the undocumented parts of any of these libraries .
If you are one of those unlucky people , please understand that you have my condolences and best wishes for success .
Sooner or later it ’ll probably happen to you : WSDL .
SOAP .
WS - Deathstar .
The horror .
You say , “ I use Ruby !
We ’re all RESTful around here , man !
My webapp consumes and produces YAML and JSON with no angle - bracket residue ( it ’s better for the environment ) .
Our Kool - Aid ’s delicious ! ”
I know — it really , really is .
A long time ago ( yesterday ) , I thought I was safe .
Then I had to integrate an internal webapp with Salesforce .
Me : “ Do they have a way to do feeds ?
JSON ?
Anything ? ”
Internet : “ SOAP . ”
Me : “ That ’s for those Java and C# people !
Not hip cats like me . ”
Internet : “ Try our SOAP .
It ’s delicious . ”
It really , really was n’t .
Someone asked me , “ Why not use Activesalesforce ? ”
Sure , some of these problems could have been avoided that way .
However , my app does n’t use Rails or ActiveRecord .
I figured I was going enough against the grain that I should just strike out on my own .
And WSDL makes it easy ( or just possible ) , right ?
So , as half cautionary tale / half survival guide , I give to you my tale of SOA - WOE .
Presented below are the steps I went through to get Ruby and Salesforce ’s WSDL to play along … well , not nicely , but at least … well , let ’s just leave it at play .
… And before I get into it , let me preface by saying that a lot of my problems look silly now .
The answer are , of course , in the documentation .
But separating the wheat from the chaff requires knowledge that most people do n’t have when they ’re starting out tabula ras ( o ) a .
By the way , if you ’re reading this for generic Ruby / WSDL and not Salesforce information , you can skim the first three steps .
1. Signup
As all hip web developers have , I ’ve read Getting Real .
So I learned that you ’re supposed to lower the amount of effort it takes for a user to get on board .
Having to sign up just to see the API docs and wiki is not in that vein .
It ’s sort of the first signpost on the road that we ’re treading into unfamiliar territory .
Well , I guess them ’s the rules .
2. Get your Security Token
So yeah , here ’s another thing that is not necessarily straightforward , but I guess there ’s a reason in this case : you have to have a Security Token to append to your password when logging in through SOAP .
Overall , it ’s probably a good idea .
Did n’t notice that ?
Neither did I .
But do n’t feel so bad , neither did this guy .
To get your Security Token , go to the Setup link at the top of the page , find the “ My Personal Information ” section and click on the “ Reset your security token ” link .
It ’s around there somewhere .
3. Get your WSDL
Now look on the left column under “ App Setup ” .
Click “ Develop ” and find the “ Download your organization - specific WSDL ” link .
Look at all the choices !
Well , which one should you use ?
You could do what I did :
Stare at the options for a little while Say “ Awh , fuck it . ” at a volume that may or may not have been heard by my fellow cube - sters ( it probably was ) .
Download “ Enterprise WSDL ” .
Because I ’m feeling enterprisey .
4. Install the SOAP4R gem
From what I ’ve gleaned , SOAP4R is the same as the SOAP standard library .
By why not get up to date with the latest and greatest :
gem install soap4r
5. Run wsdl2ruby
The example linked above builds the SOAP driver at runtime , which can take awhile .
His method is good for playing around , but you should probably just go ahead an build them .
wsdl2ruby.rb --wsdl ~/Desktop/enterprise.wsdl.xml
-- type client
Change your paths accordingly .
This will produce 4 files in your current working directory : default.rb ( which does something ) , default Driver.rb ( which does something else ) , defaultMappingRegistry.rb ( which also does something , but not the same thing as the other somethings ) , and SforceServiceClient.rb ( which does nothing ) .
So you ’ve got these files .
Do n’t edit them !
Someday you will run that code generator again and you ’ll come to rue it .
Some even say do n’t version control them .
Instead they ’d put the wsdl under version control and add a Rake task to run wsdl2ruby ( this assumes that wsdl2ruby wo n’t break in the future and it installed on any future machines ) .
Choose for yourself .
Are we there yet ?
No , but it feels like we almost are , right ?
I was once like you .
Let me first give you some incomplete sample code :
require ' rubygems ' gem ' soap4r ' # require ' soap4r ' does n't work require ' soap / soap ' require ' defaultDriver ' # this is one of the generated files that does something .
# d = driver ; I used one letter names here because I 'm playing around in IRB .
d = Soap.new d.wiredump_dev = STDOUT # l = login result l = d.login( : username => your_username , : password => your_password + security_token ) d.getUserInfo ( " " )
Should work , right ?
Nope .
6. Reset the Endpoint URL
The first error this code will produce is this :
SOAP :: FaultError : UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION : Destination URL not reset .
The URL returned from login must be set in the SforceService
This is simple enough to fix : after the login result ( “ l ” ) is returned , add d.endpoint_url = l.result.serverUrl
7. Maintain the Session ID
Now here comes the really fun part .
The next error this code will produce is :
SOAP :: FaultError : INVALID_SESSION_ID : Invalid Session ID found in SessionHeader : Illegal Session
Most of the search results in the old Google say this has something to do with the “ Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originate ” box being checked ( which is located under “ Administration Setup ” -> “ Session Settings ” ) .
This might be your problem , but in my case it was just that I did n’t know how to set headers in SOAP4R .
SOAP4R uses “ header handlers ” to modify outgoing and read incoming headers ( and note that these are SOAP headers , not HTTP headers ) , so you ’ll have to write one of your own ( syntax highlighted version ) :
require ' soap/header/simplehandler ' class ClientAuthHeaderHandler < SOAP :: Header :: SimpleHandler SessionHeader = XSD ::QName.new (" rn:enterprise.soap.sforce.com " , " SessionHeader " ) attr_accessor : sessionid def initialize super( SessionHeader ) @sessionid = nil end def on_simple_outbound if @sessionid { " sessionId " => @sessionid} end end def on_simple_inbound ( my_header , mustunderstand ) @sessionid = my_header [ " sessionid " ] end end
I found this thread and and this presentation helpful in figuring this out .
Pulling it all together , here ’s the finished product ( syntax highlighted version ) :
require ' rubygems ' gem ' soap4r ' require ' soap/ soap ' require ' defaultDriver ' require ' client_auth_header_handler ' d = Soap.new d.wiredump_dev = STDOUT h = ClientAuthHeaderHandler.new # Create a new handler l = d.login( : username => your_username , : password => your_password + security_token ) d.endpoint_url = l.result.serverUrl # Change the endpoint to what login tells us it should be h.sessionid = l.result.session
Id # Tell the header handler what the session id is d.headerhandler << h # Add the header handler to the Array of headerhandlers d.getUserInfo ( " " ) #
Make an API call ; the empty String appears to be necessary
defaultDriver and client_auth_header_handler ( the code from above ) are assumed to be in the current directory .
More API calls can be found in the API docs .
Lastly , I want to point out another resource that helped out with this process that I did n’t find a good place to link elsewhere in the article : Getting Started with SOAP4R , by Mark Thomas .
Conclusion
Ok , so a lot of these problems are because I was impatient to get started .
There were API documents with Java examples I should have been reading !
Sorry , I thought we were working on the Web here , where HTTP is king .
I know HTTP .
I know a couple of serialization formats .
I should be good to go , right ?
If you ’re a seasoned SOA - type then a lot of what I ’m complaining about probably seems like old hat to you .
Sure , I ’m whiny .
Kids like me do n’t know how good they have it !
Still , I ca n’t help thinking that there ’s no reason for the extra overhead that comes with WSDL and SOAP .
It might be that I work with dynamic languages most of the time .
I miss my REST .
I miss my YAML and JSON .
I wanna go home .
The Clinton ’s Tax Records Show an Unusual Tie to Dubai
Much has been made about the Clinton ’s tax returns since they have been released , from the fact that the Clinton ’s made $ 109 million since Bill left office to the fact that they donated $ 10 million to their own foundation , thereby paying themselves and getting a $ 10 million tax deduction .
I wanted to write about another aspect of their tax returns that I have n’t seen much written about .
I am referring to this article .
Former President Bill Clinton has earned $ 15.4 million from billionaire Ron Burkle ’s Yucaipa Cos. investment firm since 2003 , according to tax documents released .
That may raise new questions about what services he performed for Los Angeles - based Yucaipa , whose investors include the ruler of Dubai , Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al- Maktoum .
Tax lawyers said the Yucaipa partnership income for Bill Clinton looks to be a form of salary .
Could Bill Clinton be in the back pocket of the ruler of Dubai ?
You remember Dubai , do n’t you ?
A Dubai company was looking to take over the security of the United States ports , yet there was outcry against this ally by Republicans and Democrats alike as both parties played politics with the potential deal .
Dubai withdrew their bid to take over the ports .
Now we find out that Bill Clinton may have dealings with the ruler of Dubai himself and we hear virtually nothing about it .
As the article questions , rightfully so , If Dubai is paying Bill Clinton $ 15 million and his wife may become president , what do they think they are paying for ?
What are they being paid for , and if it ’s the Sheikh of Dubai paying the husband of somebody who might be the next president of the United States , what do they think they ’re paying for ? ”
It seems to me that somebody should be asking these questions , yet the media remains silent on this .
Imagine if Goerge Bush was on the payroll of the ruler of Dubai .
I do n’t think that would go unnoticed .
Gordon Brown 's claim that an inquiry into the war in Iraq would be a " distraction " for Britain 's troops on the ground has been repudiated by some of the country 's former defence chiefs .
The Prime Minister said an inquiry should take place when the soldiers ' " work is over " , although ministers have denied that means when the last British soldier has left Iraq .
But a number of Britain 's former leading defence figures have rejected the Prime Minister 's warnings that to hold an investigation now would undermine the troops , and supported the demands for an urgent inquiry into the war .
Among them is Field Marshal Lord Bramall , who commanded British forces during the Falklands War .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Government defeated demands in the Commons by Liberal Democrats and Conservative MPs for an inquiry this week , although 12 Labour MPs rebelled .
Gordon Brown has promised an inquiry but said now was not the time .
Lord Bramall accused the Prime Minister of delaying it for political reasons .
" I do n't think having an inquiry now would be a distraction .
I think it is such a political hot potato the Government is not going to want it before the next election , " he said .
" There are two issues which people want to know about – why was there no planning for the aftermath of the war and how did we get involved in the first place . "
Lord Bramall , who was opposed to the war , said that the Prime Minister failed properly to consult the chiefs of staff or his cabinet colleagues before supporting President George Bush in going to war .
" We now know that the prime minister did n't consult anybody in his own Cabinet before we were committed to war , and the Americans decided it as a reflex action to 9/11 . "
Lord Craig of Radley , the former air marshal of the RAF , backed Lord Bramall 's demand for an immediate inquiry .
" I think it is very timely to have an inquiry before memories fade , " said Lord Craig .
" The fact that there remain some British troops still in Iraq – they are in an ' overwatch ' role and not actively engaged – should not delay it .

Lord Craig said he did not agree that an inquiry would prove a distraction .
" I would personally like to see an inquiry because I think there are lessons to be learnt .
I do not think that it would be a distraction at all .
The issue is about how we got involved in the war . "
He said any inquiry would not involve those now on the ground in Iraq .
" It would involve those who were involved in the decision at the most senior levels .
The issue is how did we get into it , and what arrangements were made for after the invasion ? "
The former head of the RAF rejected the assertion by Jack Straw , the Justice Secretary , that an inquiry now would affect soldiers " psychologically " .
" I do n't think an inquiry would have any psychological impact on the troops , " said Lord Craig .
General Sir Mike Jackson also supported an inquiry .
He said : " As I said in my book , it is a political decision at the end of the day but in the long run it would probably be a good thing . "
The Prime Minister 's official spokesman yesterday said that Mr Brown remained of the view that an inquiry now would be a " distraction " , in spite of the calls by the defence chiefs .
In a letter to the Fabian Society , which had earlier asked him to hold a public inquiry , Mr Brown wrote : " There will come a time when it is appropriate to hold an inquiry .
But while the whole effort of the Government and the armed forces is directed towards supporting the people and government of Iraq as they forge a future based on reconciliation , democracy , prosperity and security , we believe that is not now . "

I n college , I became fascinated with the Tao Te Ching , a book of poetry by the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu , who was the legendary founder of Taoism , the religion of yin and yang .
Lao
Tzu's verses teach simplicity , and inspired me to live in low - rent abodes , travel on cheap second - hand bikes , seek genuineness , and even eat lentil soup .
But look what else has happened , Lao Tzu !
Your philosophy has been hijacked by hundreds of American writers , all naming their books after yours .
A brief check of Books in Print yielded more than a hundred The Tao of . . . titles .
" Tao " ( pronounced " dow " as in " dowry " ) in Chinese means " the Way , " and in a rough translation of the book 's opening poem , Lao Tzu states , " The Tao that can be spoken of is not the real Tao . "
Perhaps he should have added another line : " The Tao that can be hucksterized by book publishers is not the real Tao . "
First of all , Lao Tzu in his poems preferred to seek truth from such things as rivers , valleys , clay , and " the myriad creatures " .
He did n't really talk much about sexual matters .
But a lot of current authors might have us believe he was the Dr. Ruth of the Chou Dynasty .
A host of modern books are available about the Tao of love and sex , especially sex .
Here 's a few titles :
The Tao of Sex : A Chinese Introduction to the Bedroom Arts
The Tao of Love and Sex : The Ancient Chinese Way to Ecstasy
The Tao of Sexual Massage
The Tao of Sexology : The Book of Infinite Wisdom
Apparently so does business advice .
The real Lao Tzu wrote , " Exterminate ingenuity , discard profit , and there will be no more thieves and bandits . "
But there 's quite a few titles about the Tao of profitable enlightenment :
The Tao of Money : Six Simple Principles for Achieving Financial Harmony
The Dao of the Dow ( Dow Jones of course ! )
The Tao of Tribute Money ( your guess is as good as mine )
The Tao of Management : An Age Old Study for New Age Managers
The Tao of Leadership : Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching Adapted for a New Age
The Tao of Personal Leadership
The Tao of Politics : Lessons of the Masters of Huainan
The Tao of Power

With the new PlayStation
Store now up and running and a strong summer season on the horizon , Sony is poised to make up some serious ground with the remaining months of 2008 .
Commenting about the company 's current momentum in this " year of the PlayStation 3 , " Sony Senior Vice President of Marketing Peter Dille has offered a broad preview of what 's to come in the remainder of the year .
In addition to a glut of good games , including the likes of LittleBigPlanet , Metal Gear Solid 4 , SOCOM Confrontation , and more , Dille noted that the PlayStation Network was a key area of focus for the company .
Reiterating that Home is on the way , Dille spoke on the commitment to improve the UI functionality with things like in - game XMB access , and he said that Sony would deliver more flexible Store payment options via pre-paid Network cards this spring .
The one new area that Dille discussed was the company 's plans to offer full - length TV shows and movies for download through the PlayStation Network .
The service is promised to be unique in a way that " separates the service from others you 've seen or used , " allowing users to " break through the overwhelming clutter of digital media to give [ them ] the TV , movies and gaming content [ they ] want . "
Dille promises that more info is coming " very soon . "
Sony 's new Store could very well be the catalyst which finally allows it to launch an on - demand video download service gracefully .
We 'll keep our ear to the ground for more information as it becomes available .

The top White House contenders are a lot richer than the rest of us .
Here 's where they got it ... and where it goes .
5 of 7 Obama 's money Net Worth : $ 1.3 million
Where he got it
After Harvard Law , Obama did n't exactly rake in the big bucks .
He led a voter - registration drive and then worked for a Chicago law firm that specializes in civil rights and employment discrimination .
He earned $ 60,000 as an Illinois state senator , plus another $ 32,000 as a lecturer in constitutional law at the University of Chicago .
Michelle Obama , however , worked for a while as a big - firm lawyer , leaving to take jobs in the nonprofit sector .
She wound up as vice president for community affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals , a position that paid nearly $ 317,000 a year .
She resigned in May and also left her post as lead independent director of Tree House Foods , a private - label food business .
According to the Obamas ' tax return ( Obama and Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut are the only candidates to release one ) , their income hit $ 1.7 million in 2005 and $ 991,000 in 2006 .
The big boost came from his writing , following the stirring speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention that made him famous .
First came a memoir , " Dreams of My Father , " and later " The Audacity of Hope , " which was on the New York Times bestseller list for 30 weeks .
Where it goes
Excluding Michelle Obama 's retirement plan , whose value need n't be reported , the couple has about $ 715,000 in investments .
All the money except for two very large checking accounts is in mutual funds .
About $ 350,000 is divided between Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund , a socially responsible fund , and Vanguard Wellesley Income , which has a mix of 60 percent bonds and 40 percent stocks .
How he could do better
The Obamas have about 40 percent of their money in cash - about right for now , says Jason Mirsky of RiskMetrics : " They may need that much cash to tide the family over without Michelle 's income . "
Later , however , the Obamas should ramp up their stock allocation to about 70 percent .
With their earning power , they can take more risk , adding small - cap and international funds .
They could also venture into real estate investment trusts or commodities .
They should start 529 college savings plans for their two girls .

An infectious diseases expert has cast doubt on claims that children from the Stolen Generations were used in medical experiments .
Aboriginal elder Kathleen Mills has told a Senate Inquiry in Darwin that early last century Indigenous children in the Northern Territory were used to test a leprosy serum .
But Warwick Britton from the University of Sydney says Ms Mills may be referring to a special treatment used on leprosy patients .
" There may well be an oral tradition of Aboriginal leprosy patients being injected , " he said .
" These injections with chaulmoogra oil were quite painful and they were given every month or two months and it is possible that this has been misunderstood as some kind of guinea pig therapy . "
Dr John Hargreaves , a doctor who treated leprosy in the Northern Territory for decades , also cast doubt on the claims .
He says he has already looked at the records and found no evidence of such treatment .
He agrees the confusion may stem from the use of chaulmoogra oil .
" It might have been confused or thought of as an experimental treatment , but it was not , " he said .
" It was in fact the only treatment that was available at that time . "
Immediate investigation
The Federal Government has ordered an immediate investigation .
Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon says it is the first time the Government has heard of the allegations and she is taking them seriously .
" I do n't know what the files will show us but what I want to do is make sure that we quickly find out anything that is on the Commonwealth 's Health Department records , " she said .
" We certainly want to be able to ascertain if there 's anything that 's been done by the Commonwealth or others that 's revealed in those records .
" It will be of course a very serious matter to take further . "
Meanwhile , the Federal Opposition has backed an investigation into the claims .
Opposition 's health spokesman Joe Hockey says it is possible that the claims are true .
" Given that apparently leprosy was rife in the 1920s and 1930s across all populations , anyone who is looking for a treatment for a significant disease would take advantage of anything that is offered , " he said .
During today 's hearing into the Stolen Generations Compensation Bill in Sydney , Tasmanian Senator Guy Barnett raised the issue of the leprosy testing allegations .
" It 's a deeply disturbing allegation and it's something that needs to be taken in the most serious manner , " he said .
If you are at a cocktail party , and someone asks you to compare and contrast the differences between batch and continuous flowing processes , calmly lower your martini , grab the nearest table napkin , and proceed to draw the following picture :
Suppose we were in the toy car manufacturing business and there were three stages to building a car : the body , the wheels , and the paint .
You decide the most optimal way to build the cars would be to batch them up into groups of ten , and send them from one stage to the next in one big batch .
If we assume it takes 1 min per car at each stage , then we would expect the following results :
Time to build first car : 21 minutes
Time to build first batch of ten : 30 minutes
Now , suppose we were to draw this picture on another napkin :
Only this time instead of manufacturing our cars in groups of ten , we build them one at a time in a one - piece continuous flow process .
Were we to do this , we could expect these results :
Time to build first car : 3 minutes
Time to build first batch of ten : 12 minutes
In the continuous flow example , the first car rolled off the assembly in in 3 minutes ( 18 minutes faster than the batch process ) .
All ten cars were built in 12 minutes ( an improvement of 18 minutes over the batch process ) .
To really impress your guests , you could then demonstrate your worldly knowledge and command of automotive history by explaining that this is precisely what Toyota figured out when it began competing with Ford ’s mass production system .
Toyota realized that a continuous one - piece flow process :
* increases productivity – more cars in less time
* builds in quality – easier to spot defective parts sooner
* is more efficient – less material lying around
* reduces costs – less inventory
By this time , other party goers will have no doubt picked up on your conversation , and you will most likely be the life of the party with everyone hinged on your every word .
You could excuse yourself .
You could change topics .
Or you could pickup a copy of Jeffrey Liker ’s excellent book , The Toyota Way , and prepare yourself for the next party .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton 's aides blasted Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign Monday after a major Obama supporter referenced the blue dress at the heart of former President Bill Clinton 's impeachment scandal .
Obama defended his church in a radio interview on the " Michael Smerconish Show " that aired Monday .
Gordon Fischer , a former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and part of Obama 's Iowa support team , also compared Bill Clinton unfavorably to Joe McCarthy .
McCarthy was a senator who was known for leveling accusations that people were Communists or spying for the Russians in the 1950s .
" When Joe McCarthy questioned others ' patriotism , McCarthy ( 1 ) actually believed , at least aparently ( sic ) , the questions were genuine , and ( 2 ) he did so in order to build up , not tear down , his own party , the GOP , " Fischer , wrote on his blog .
" Bill Clinton cannot possibly seriously believe Obama is not a patriot , and cannot possibly be said to be helping -- instead he is hurting -- his own party .
B. [ Bill ] Clinton should never be forgiven .
Period .
This is a stain on his legacy , much worse , much deeper , than the one on Monica 's blue dress . "
Fischer was referring to Bill Clinton 's comments over the weekend that a race between Sen.
John McCain and Hillary Clinton would be a contest between two people who love their country .
Some Obama supporters -- including former Air Force Gen. Tony McPeak -- have interpreted that statement as an attack on Obama 's patriotism .
Fischer , who endorsed Obama last fall , later removed the post from his blog and replaced it with an apology .
" I sincerely apologize for a tasteless and gratituous [ sic ] comment I made here about President Clinton .
It was unnecessary and wrong , " he wrote .
In a conference call with reporters Monday , Clinton aides said Fischer 's decision to attack the New York senator reflected " gutter tactics that [ the Obama ] campaign is now deploying . "
" This is now the Obama campaign 's primary message to the American people , " said spokesman Howard Wolfson .
" Not to build him up , but to tear Sen. Clinton down . "
He also dismissed Fischer 's apology .
" In my opinion the remarks of Gordon Fischer are very much in keeping with the campaign Sen. Obama is running .
So I do n't know why he would apologize . "
Clinton aides also distanced themselves from remarks made this weekend by Clinton supporter and CNN analyst James Carville .
Carville told the New York Times Saturday that New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson 's endorsement of Obama " came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out [ Jesus ] for 30 pieces of silver . "
On Monday , Carville defended his comments .
Watch more of Carville 's interview »
" That 's exactly what I said and ... I think the quote had the desired intent ... that people saw Richardson and saw somebody who is disloyal , " Carville told Wolf Blitzer .
" I 'm very satisfied with the response I gave . "
Carville also said he had n't spoken with Hillary Clinton about Richardson 's endorsement , but that he was outraged .
" I doubt if Gov. Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future , " he said , but " I 've had my say ... I got one in the wheelhouse and I tagged him . "
On Monday , Richardson said Democrats need to " stop the bloodletting " so the party can unify before the convention .
" We 're fighting each other , so we 've got to end this , " Richardson said on CNN's " American Morning . "
Richardson , a former member of the Clinton administration , said he almost endorsed Clinton right after her husband visited him to watch the Super Bowl .
Watch Richardson explain why he picked Obama »
Meanwhile , Clinton returned to the campaign trail Monday to take on the economy in a policy address in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
She said the country 's economic crisis " is , at its core , a housing crisis , " and called on President Bush to appoint an " emergency working group on foreclosures . "
Watch Clinton talk about a " crisis of confidence " »
Obama is in the middle of a three - day vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands , following the hit he took following the flap over his former minister , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Some of Wright 's old sermons came under fire after a news report this month turned some of his most controversial comments into a YouTube phenomenon .
In one , the minister said America had brought the September 11 attacks upon itself .
In another , he said Clinton had an advantage over Obama because she is white .
Watch a report on the role of politics in the pulpit »
In a radio interview on the " Michael Smerconish Show " that aired Monday in Philadelphia , Obama defended the church , saying it is " not some crackpot church , " and pointing out that Bill Clinton also had ties to Wright .
Clinton invited Wright to the White House when he was going through his impeachment crisis .

Police say the botnet skimmed millions from bank accounts
A New Zealand teenager accused of being the ringleader of an international cyber - crime network has been convicted .
Owen Thor Walker , 18 , admitted six charges of using computers for illegal purposes and will be sentenced in May .
Police allege the group infiltrated more than one million computers and used them to skim at least $ 20.4 m ( £ 10.3 m ) from private bank accounts .
He was detained last November as part of an FBI investigation into global botnets - networks of hijacked PCs .
Exceptional talent
A botnet can be controlled over the internet by a single computer .
It installs malicious software on PCs around the world to collect information such as login names , bank account details and credit card numbers .
Walker pleaded guilty to charges of accessing a computer for dishonest purposes , interfering with computer systems , possession of software for committing crime and accessing computer systems without authorisation , the New Zealand Press Association said .
New Zealand police said he had begun committing the crimes at school , and had designed an encrypted virus that was undetectable by anti-virus software .
It allowed him access to usernames and passwords as well as credit card details , and was used by others to commit the frauds .
Walker faces up to five years in prison for several of the charges , but Judge Arthur Tompkins indicated he was not considering a custodial sentence .
Walker was detained in New Zealand 's North Island city of Hamilton and is reported to have Asperger 's syndrome - a neurobiological disorder which can result in deficiencies in social skills .
Although patients have normal intelligence , some may have exceptional talent in a specific area .
Then , alluding to the Yangtze giant soft - shell , also known as the Rafetus swinhoei , she added :
“ This turtle will be next . ”
Surviving History ’s Tides
Fifty - one years ago , a traveling circus performed at the new zoo in Changsha , the capital of Hunan Province in southern China .
For a cash payment , the circus left behind a large female turtle .
Zookeepers slipped the turtle into a large pond , where for a half - century it hibernated in winters and poked its pig - like snout above the water ’s surface every spring .
The walls of the zoo became the equivalent of a time capsule .
Outside , the convulsions of modern Chinese history were scarring an already damaged landscape .
Under Mao , national campaigns were waged to kill birds and other animals perceived as pests .
Widespread famines in the late 1950s and early 1960s drove desperate people to hunt or gather anything deemed edible , even tree bark .
Since the 1980s , the pressure has come from the rapid push for economic development .
In recent years , turtle experts identified the Yangtze giant soft - shell as dangerously close to extinction .
Inside the Changsha Zoo , zookeepers had no idea that experts were scouring China for the species .
In fact , they knew very little about their female turtle .
“ We just treated it like a normal animal , ” said Yan Xiahui , deputy director of the zoo .
The species was first identified as distinct in the 1870s .
A British diplomat in Shanghai sent a specimen to the British Museum , where it was beheaded and pickled in a jar .
Some experts debated whether it was part of another species , and for years it received little attention .
“ It proceeded to be ignored by the world as if it did n’t exist for roughly 100 years , ” said Dr. Pritchard , the American expert , who has seen the specimen in the British Museum .
With its wide , flat shape and leathery dorsal shell , the giant Yangtze males can weigh more than 220 pounds ; females are usually smaller .
By the 1990s , a prominent Chinese herpetologist , Zhao Kentang , had realized the significance of the turtle and tried in vain to persuade different zoos to bring the turtles together for breeding .
By 2004 , after conducting field surveys in China and Vietnam , herpetologists concluded that six of the turtles were still alive .
Three were in Chinese zoos in Beijing , Shanghai and Suzhou ; two others lived in a Buddhist temple in Suzhou ; and a sixth lived in a famous Vietnamese lake in the center of Hanoi .
NEW YORK ( Reuters )  Warren Buffett , the world 's richest person , said Monday that the U.S. economy is in a recession that will be more severe than most people expect .
Buffett made his comments on CNBC television after his Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA , BRKB ) agreed to invest $ 6.5 billion in the takeover of chewing gum maker Wm Wrigley Jr ( WWY ) by Mars in a $ 23 billion transaction .
SWEET DEAL : Mars buys Wrigley for $ 23B with Buffett 's help " This is not a field of specialty for me , but my general feeling is that the recession will be longer and deeper than most people think , " Buffett said .
" This will not be short and shallow .
" I think consumers are feeling gas and food prices , " he added , " and not feeling they 've got a lot of money for other things . "
He was not immediately available for further comment .
Known for his frugality , the 77 - year - old Buffett has lived in the same 10 - room Omaha , house for a half - century , despite being worth an estimated $ 62 billion .
On Wednesday , the Commerce Department is expected to say how fast the economy grew in the first quarter .
Economists on average have projected that gross domestic product grew at an annualized 0.2 % rate in the quarter .
Two quarters of declining GDP is a traditional indicator of recession .
That last happened in 2001 .
Economists expect the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to cut a key lending rate for a seventh time beginning last September .
Berkshire is a $ 197 billion conglomerate best known for its insurance holdings , such as auto insurer Geico , but it owns more than 70 businesses .
Many of those businesses are tied to the housing market , including Acme Brick , insulation maker Johns Manville and the real estate brokerage HomeServices of America .
Others depend on consumers to spend more on discretionary items , such as Ben Bridge Jeweler and Borsheims Fine Jewelry .
" In the retail businesses ... if anything , they 've gotten a little worse , " Buffett said .
" Of course , things connected with housing , whether it's in brick or whether it's in carpet , those businesses have shown no uptick at all .
Jewelry had a bad Christmas ... and it stayed that way . "
Buffett sees no respite from the housing slump .
" I think this is going to be fairly long and fairly deep , but who knows , " he said .
In March , Forbes magazine pegged Buffett 's net worth at $ 62 billion , ahead of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim's $ 60 billion and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates ' $ 58 billion .
Gates is a friend of Buffett and a Berkshire director .

This is where men ’s fashion can be fun .

2. Business Attire : All About Looking Professional Yet Comfortable
Unless you work in an office with a strict business dress code , chances are , you do n’t need to wear a suit and tie every day .
But there are always situations wherein you are required to wear a business attire — whether it ’s a work interview , a corporate event , a business meeting , or a conference .
When it comes to men ’s fashion , deciding what to wear to a business event or even to work can be a tough call .
You need to impress and dress appropriately .
At the same time , you want to be comfortable in what you ’re wearing .
What to Wear to Work
Most offices and companies have a requirement or a dress code for employees .
The most common of which include business formal , business casual , smart casual , and casual .
Following the office dress code and dressing appropriately show that you are serious with the job and that you respect the company protocol .
Most often , those who want to advance in their career dress for the job that they want to have , not the job they already have .
Business Formal Certain industries and companies , such as law , finance , and government , require a business formal dress code at work .
This usually entails a suit , a jacket , dress shoes , and a tie .
Business Casual Business casual staples include trousers or dress slacks , a button - down shirt , dark socks , and dress shoes .
Ties and coats are optional .
Smart Casual Smart - casual dress code is more relaxed than business formal and business casual .
This allows more room for your personal fashion preference to shine through .
Think accessories , white sneakers , and colored coats .
Casual Casual dress code means dressing up in comfortable , informal , yet still professional clothing .
This relaxed dress code allows employees to wear whatever they want as long as it is still appropriate for work — meaning clothing that you would wear to the beach , club , or for lounging at home should be avoided .
3. Casual Ensemble : Let Your Personal Style Do the Talking
How do you dress when there ’s no dress code ?
Are you a jeans - and - T - shirt kind of guy ?
Or do you prefer chinos and button - down shirt ?
Is your closet full of designer clothes , or is it all about black jeans and leather jacket ?
Whatever you ’re comfortable wearing every day is your fashion style .
And your style is not just about what you wear .
It is about expressing yourself through your clothes .
It ’s about how you carry and present yourself to the outside world .
It has a lot to do with your lifestyle and personality .

A Gentleman ’s Guide to Shoes & Other Accessories
There ’s a saying that goes : you can tell a lot about a man by the shoe he wears .
And this is true .
Style is in the details , and a man who does n’t know a thing about fashion can easily ruin a nice suit by wearing the wrong shoes .
The same thing goes for the other men ’s fashion accessories .
Think of them as the icing on the cake .
They ’re really not necessary , but they can make or break an outfit .
Most often , they are the small details that complete the look .
And a man who has style knows how to use fashion accessories to his advantage .
1. Different Types of Men ’s Shoes
Besides telling something about a man ’s fashion sense , men ’s shoes say a lot about his personality .
A more laid - back , casual guy prefers sneakers .
The businessman has more dress shoes in his wardrobe , while the athletic dude prefers trainers .
Dress Shoes : Your Formal Footwear
Dress shoes are a must - have for every man .
It does n’t matter whether you ’re only going to wear them once a year .
You ’ll need dress shoes for formal events such as weddings , once - a - year charity gala , or even job interviews .
If you can only buy one pair , opt for a black leather as it is versatile and can complement any wardrobe and color .
The Open - Laced Derbies
The Derby is a type of dress shoes that have open lacing .
Unlike the more formal Oxfords , the Derby is more relaxed and laid - back .
If you ’re wearing a less formal attire or smart casual , then a pair of brown Derbies is your perfect option .
The Close - Laced Oxfords
The ultimate dress shoes , Oxfords are your go - to formal footwear .
Classic and elegant , black Oxfords are the finest shoes you wear to the finest of occasions .
These dapper pair calls for a black suit or tuxedo .
Unlike the Derby , the Oxfords have closed lacing and features eyelet tabs that are stitched across the bottom .
Casual Shoes : For Fashionably Laid- Back Days
Just because you ’re going to a casual BBQ party does n’t mean you do n’t need to dress up fashionably .
Shoes can make or break even the most laid - back of wardrobes .
Therefore , it ’s important to get them right .
Easy & Stylish Loafers
For less formal events such as BBQs or dinners by the pool , loafers are your perfect footwear of choice .
They ’re versatile and relaxed yet stylish enough to go hobnobbing with colleagues or potential business partners .
Loafers can also be dressed up or down , depending on the occasion .
Trendy & Versatile Sneakers
If you ’re wearing jeans and a shirt , then you can always opt for a pair of trendy sneakers to finish off your casual look .
You ’ll never go wrong with white sneakers — they ’re classic , trendy and fashionable .
What ’s more , they ’re versatile and can be worn with jeans , khakis or chinos .
Sporty & Comfy Trainers
For ultimate comfort and wearability , trainers are your best options .
It ’s even better if you ’re into fitness and you can easily go from coffee with friends to the gym without having to change your shoes .
Luckily , today ’s trend is all about comfort and versatility .
2. Men ’s Watches : A Man ’s Ultimate Accessory
Watches are men ’s ultimate accessory .
Since men have very limited options when it comes to jewelry and other accessories , they turn to watches to up their fashion game .
Hence , men usually have a different watch for different occasion or activity — from dress watch to dive watch .
Wearing a watch with style is easy .
It all depends on your personal style and lifestyle preferences .
A dress watch is your best accessory for formal events .
They ’re usually thinner than your usual watch , with a minimalist dial and a leather strap .
They ’re meant to be worn nicely under a dress shirt cuff without being bulky or too conspicuous .
From running to golfing and yachting , a man has to have a separate watch for his hobbies and sports .
This is understandable as these sports watches each have their own specific features meant to help and enhance the sport .
Aside from being a tool watch used for diving , dive watches nowadays are becoming a popular fashion accessory .
Let ’s blame James
Bond for wearing his dive watch with a tuxedo .
Dive watches are one of the most versatile timepieces you can own , as you can wear it for business or leisure .
3. Men ’s Perfume : A Manual for Smelling Nice
There ’s something about a man that smells nice .
Maybe because most men cannot be bothered about wearing a perfume or cologne that when you meet one who does , he somehow leaves a good impression .
Fragrance is an invisible aspect of your personality that affects how people perceive and remember you .
Not only that , on a personal level , smelling good also leaves you feeling good .
Different Types of Men ’s Fragrances
Wearing perfume can be tricky .
It ’s not about how fragrant the perfume is , it ’s about how the scent complements your own taste and personality .
Below are three of the most common types of scents that you can choose from .
A favorite of most men , woody scents have that warm and earthy fragrance that gives off a very manly smell .
Woody perfumes have leathery notes derived from nature , most commonly cedar and sandalwood .
Fresh fragrances remind you of that fresh - off - the - shower feeling .
They give off a lively scent that has hints of citrus and oranges , crisp smells , sea breezes , or freshly - cut grass .
The oriental scent is defined by exciting spices such as vanilla or patchouli that denote sensuality .
These scents are often musky and heavy , which is why not a lot of people can carry this scent .
4. Men ’s Belts : How To Cinch Your Style
Belts are an important men ’s accessory that are often overlooked .
Most men only think about belts for their function and not in terms of style .
Hence , some men only wear a belt when it ’s necessary , i.e. , when wearing loose pants .
However , this small accessory can have a big impact .
It can either pull your whole look together , literally and figuratively , or it can break the whole outfit .
Formal Belts : Choose Sophisticated & Understated
For a formal suit or a tuxedo , you certainly need to wear a belt .
Remember a formal belt or a dress belt should be a subtle yet sophisticated accessory to your outfit and should n’t distract the whole look .
Opt for an understated black leather belt with very minimal pattern .
Casual Belts : Opt for Simple Or Funky
In general , the rule is you should wear a belt with pants that have belt loops , especially if you ’re tucking in your shirt .
However , if you ’re wearing your shirt untucked , it ’s okay not to wear one if the pants fit perfectly .
Depending on the pants , you can either opt for a simple casual leather brown belt or go for funkier ones that go with your outfit or personality .
5. Men ’s Bags : Fashion at Arm’s Length
Have you ever met someone who was so impeccably dressed only to realize he was actually carrying a tattered backpack ?
You got it right , it ’s very common for men to neglect their bags when it comes to personal style .
They forget to realize that just like shoes or the inconspicuous belts , bags can make or break an outfit .
Do n’t get us wrong , you do n’t need to carry a briefcase if your job does not actually require you to own one .
But at least upgrade your backpack to something more fashionable and more grown up .
Backpacks are one of the best inventions in fashion .
They are convenient and easy to carry , and they ’re the most practical bag you can ever own .
As a grown man , however , you should carry a more grown - up type of backpack .
Think leather with a neutral color that has a more luxurious feel and appearance .
That way , you can get away with carrying it even if you ’re off to a business meeting .
On the other hand , avoid the more sporty and youthful kind with lots of different colors .
Save those for the gym or a weekend hike .
Just like a backpack , the messenger bag is convenient and practical , especially if you need to bring around your laptop every day .
This type of bag is more versatile than the backpack .
Depending on the material and design , you can either carry it with a casual outfit or with a more formal get - up .
Get a leather messenger bag for your business use and either a rubber or canvas one to go with your casual attire .
Now , if you need a bag for more formal business affairs , then get yourself a briefcase .
You do n’t have to carry this every day , though , as it ’s not very practical and convenient .
This has limited space compared to the messenger bag or the backpack .
However , the style factor makes up for the limited space and inconvenience .

How to determine your skin type ?

Cleansing is the most important step in your facial care regimen .
Washing your face is the first step to your face grooming .
In fact , it is the foundation of your face grooming routine .
If you do n’t cleanse your face properly , the dirt on your face will clog your pores that could lead to drying , excess oil and skin infections , including acne and pimples .
Shave regularly .
Shaving helps keep your face free of debris that cause acne and irritation .

Shaving helps to remove accumulated skin debris that causes acne .
Some men simply want a clean - shaven face .
Others prefer to grow a beard that they can style according to preference .
Add moisturizer to your regimen .
Moisturizing helps retain and replenish moisture .
It is a fact that men ’s skin is thicker and rougher than women ’s , and it develops wrinkles deeper than women ’s , too .
Hence , all the more that men need to moisturize their skin after washing .
Not only does a moisturizer help retain the skin moisture , but it also helps replenish the moisture that is lost from washing .
Do n’t be afraid to experiment with makeup .
Light cosmetics such as tinted BB creams are a good way to hide imperfections .
Male cosmetics , such as men ’s BB cream and concealer , may not be as big as women ’s , but there is a bigger market for it nowadays .
Being the last area of men ’s grooming to be finally accepted , albeit slow by society , men now have a lot of options for male cosmetics .
Male skincare companies are claiming sales growth of about 50 % every year .
They foresee makeup for men to grow at the same rate in the future .
3. Easy Body Care Routine for Men
Most men have their own everyday hygiene routine .
Unfortunately , some still believe that a bar of soap and water are enough to the job .
For their benefit , here is a simple guide to keeping your body clean and healthy .
Take a shower daily .
Taking a shower at least once a day proves to improve not just one ’s basic hygiene , but also one ’s mood .
Some dermatologists argue that it is not necessary to take a shower every day .
But this depends on the activities you ’ve done in a day .
In general , we take a shower to wash away dirt , sweat and dead skin cells , thereby preventing body odor .
If you ’ve had a long day or you have sweat it out at the gym , then it is necessary that you take a shower at least before going to bed .
Always moisturize after taking a shower .
Because men’s skin is drier and rougher than women ’s , all the more that you need to put on lotion .
If you ’re like most men , you probably do n’t bother to put on lotion either .
That is totally fine provided you have oily skin .
However , if you have naturally dry skin , it is better to use put on body lotion after every shower or bath .
You do n’t need to lather lotion all over your body .
You can apply it on areas that need moisture most , such as arms , legs , and shoulders .
Pay attention more to your knees and elbows as they tend to be drier .
Wear anti-perspirant or deodorant .
This practice helps prevent body odor .
Enough said .
Sweating is our body ’s way to pass waste out , especially through the underarms .
Although sweat by nature is not smelly , once bacteria breaks it down , sweat begins to stink .
Hence , the need to wear a deodorant — which contains antibacterial ingredients — to prevent body odor .
Consider manscaping .
As they say , it is the ultimate form of men ’s self - care .
Coined from the words ‘ man ’ and ‘ landscaping ’ , manscaping is the ultimate male body grooming , which involves trimming or totally removing hair on most part of a man ’s body .
We ’re talking about the hair on your chest , back , stomach , arms , legs , eyebrows , and your uhmm , private parts .
You can either shave , wax , pluck , tweeze , or laser the unwanted hair .
Some do it professionally , others do it themselves .
IV .
Finishing Touches
There you have it , gentlemen… a simple and effective guide to men ’s fashion and style .
Dressing well is not just about choosing which type of wardrobe to wear and how to wear them .
Most importantly , men ’s fashion is about how you present yourself to the world — all well - groomed , whether jeans - clad or suited up .

Wow .
George Stephanopoulos actually listened to us and asked John McCain some pretty tough questions today on This Week .
Who knew that George read teh blogs ?
McCain 's body language and facial expressions really belied his discomfort , but if you look closely , you can see it .
And I 've discovered a " tell " on the part of McCain when he 's really painted into a corner , see if you can find it .
Case in point : note this little exchange between Stephanopoulos and McCain over healthcare .
Elizabeth Edwards has been a vocal critic of McCain 's proposed healthcare plan in that it basically does n't help those who need it the most .
McCain 's response falls into the less than satisfactory category :
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What 's wrong with government -- what 's wrong with government - run health care ?
MCCAIN : And we continue to have these debates -- what 's wrong with it ?
Go to Canada .
Go to England and you can find out what 's wrong with it .
Governments do n't make the right decisions .
Families make the right decisions .
STEPHANOPOULOS : One of the points Mrs. Edwards made in the Wall Street Journal , she said that your whole life , you had government health care .
You were the son of a Naval officer , a Naval officer , now a member of Congress .
And her point is , why should n't every American be able to get the kind of health care that members of Congress get or members of the military get ?
MCCAIN : It 's a cheap shot , but I did have a period of time where I did n't have very good government health care .
I had it from another government .
( LAUGHTER )
So , look , I know what it 's like in America not to have health care .
We know that Americans are hurting there as well .
We 've got to make health care affordable and available .
The difference , again , between myself and the Democrats , and with all due respect , Mrs. Edwards , I want the families to make the choices .
They want the government to make the choices .
That 's a fundamental difference , and we will continue to debate that issue .
Actually , McSame , let 's look at England 's healthcare .
PBS 's Frontline did a fantastic program comparing healthcare in the US to five other capitalist democracies , including the UK .
While the UK 's program did have its drawbacks , the government has instituted policies to expand choice for the people and moreover , the government pays significantly less as a percentage of the GDP for healthcare than we do ( 8.3 % vs. 15.3 % ) and it covers everyone .
Hard to make facts sound bad , does n't it , John ?
Did you pick up the tell ?
Rather than respond intelligently to Edwards ' valid point that McCain has taken advantage of government health care his entire ( rather lengthy ) life , he pulls the " Hanoi Hilton " card .
Anyone think that calling attention to his POW days could be like Giuliani 's invoking of 9/11 ?
Not to detract from the traumas he experienced at the hands of the Vietcong , but what the heck does that have to do with healthcare ?
full transcript below the fold :
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me move on to health care .
That could be the biggest difference between you and the Democrats this year .
Democrats say your tax credit plan will not come close to covering everyone , and it especially wo n't help people with preexisting health conditions .
Here is Elizabeth Edwards , wife of John Edwards .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
ELIZABETH EDWARDS :
The truth is , a health care policy that covers everything but cancer does n't exactly do me a lot of good .
And John McCain and I have something in common -- neither one of us would be covered by his health care policy .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Now , she went on to say that both of you are going to be fine , because you have plenty of resources to pay for health insurance , but for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions , they wo n't .
Why not guarantee that anyone with a preexisting condition should be able to get health care ?
MCCAIN : We will , as part of our plan , have a special Medicaid trust fund set up to help care for those people who are -- who have preexisting conditions .
As you know , five chronic diseases consume 75 percent of the health care costs in America .
We 're not leaving anybody behind .
But what we 're not doing is we 're not going to have a big government takeover and mandates .
They 've tried that in other countries .
Both Senator Obama and Senator Clinton 's plans are big - government solutions .
But that 's true in everything that ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What 's wrong with government -- what 's wrong with government - run health care ?
MCCAIN : And we continue to have these debates -- what 's wrong with it ?
Go to Canada .
Go to England and you can find out what 's wrong with it .
Governments do n't make the right decisions .
Families make the right decisions .
STEPHANOPOULOS : One of the points Mrs. Edwards made in the Wall Street Journal , she said that your whole life , you had government health care .
You were the son of a Naval officer , a Naval officer , now a member of Congress .
And her point is , why should n't every American be able to get the kind of health care that members of Congress get or members of the military get ?
MCCAIN : It 's a cheap shot , but I did have a period of time where I did n't have very good government health care .
I had it from another government .
( LAUGHTER )
So , look , I know what it 's like in America not to have health care .
We know that Americans are hurting there as well .
We 've got to make health care affordable and available .
The difference , again , between myself and the Democrats , and with all due respect , Mrs. Edwards , I want the families to make the choices .
They want the government to make the choices .
That 's a fundamental difference , and we will continue to debate that issue .
But we can provide incentives .
You mentioned that it 's not enough , a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit for every family in America .
It 's a lot better than what they 've got today .
And if we can let them go across state lines , and get these inflationary aspects of health care under control , which we can do , then more Americans will have affordable and available health care .
We 've done a bad job of explaing this , but it is now basically mathematically impossible for either Clinton or Obama to win the nomination through the regular voting process ( meaning the super - delegates decide this one , baby ! ) .
Here 's the math .
There are 3,253 pledged delegates , those doled out based on actual voting in primaries and caucuses .
And you need 2,025 to win the nomination .
To date , about 55 % of those 3,253 delegates have been pledged in the voting process -- with Clinton and Obamb roughly splitting them at about 900 delegates a piece .
That means there are now only about 1,400 delegates left up for grabs in the remaining states and territories voting .
So , do the math .
If they both have about 900 pledged delegates so far , they need to win more than 1,100 of the remaining 1,400 delegates to win the nomination through actual voting .
Ain't gonna happen , barring a stunning scandal or some new crazy revelation .
So , they 'll keep fighting this thing out , each accumulating their chunk of delegates , one of them holding a slight edge and bothing finishing the voting process with 1,600 or so delegates .
And then the super delegates decide this thing .
That 's the math .
Nobody seems to have caught my last post about superdelegates .
And nobody has said anything about Belle 's post about the general disaster that is our electoral system .
But the fact is , things are messed up .
In my last post , I said that things were looking like the superdelegates are going to decide .
I 'm not alone in this opinion .
Here 's a Washington Post political commentator , with actual numbers :
Do you realize what this means ?
Seriously , .
Let 's have a show of hands .
Who even knows who the superdelegates are ?
[ Silence . ]
Who knows where you would go to find out who the superdelegates are ?
[ Silence . ]
Almost nobody .
The electoral college is an ugly problem , but at least people are aware of it .
The Supreme Court 's election theft is an ugly problem , but at least people are aware of it .
But let 's talk pragmatic politics for a moment here .
Assume , plausibly , that in a general Obama beats McCain beats Clinton .
Then the democratic superdelegates get to pick the next president .
Let 's say this again .
A bunch of random party shitheads are probably going to tell you who your next president is going to be ?
SAN FRANCISCO , March 27 ( Reuters ) -
If you ever thought it would be cool to have an Xbox laptop , or wished those old Atari games in your attic could be reborn on a retro handheld device , you might want to talk to Benjamin Heckendorn .
A screenshot of BenHeck.com , taken on March 27 , 2008 .
REUTERS /benheck.com
Better known as Ben Heck , the 32 - year - old Wisconsin native has attained legendary status among “ modders ” , hobbyists who tinker with video - game hardware to make it do things the original designers never intended .
Technology
Web sites enthusiastically track Heckendorn ’s latest projects , which are marked by workmanship that makes the finished products look they rolled off a factory line instead of a basement workbench .
“ That ’s the American way , right ?
Start in your basement , garage , or whatever .
You ’re supposed to get out of it someday , but I still have to listen to my clothes drier sometimes , ” Heckendorn said in an interview .
Heckendorn got his start eight years ago when he decided to fool around with an old Atari 2600 -- the classic console that popularized home gaming when it launched in 1977 -- and ended up reincarnating it as a handheld device .
“ I was shocked , I did n’t think anyone would care about it but they did , ” Heckendorn said .
In fact , they cared so much they began offering Heckendorn hefty amounts of cash to transform their cherished game devices into one - of - a- kind collectibles .
“ Ben Heck is basically the best .
His mods are as professional as the stuff you can get at Best Buy .
That ’s what makes him stand out from the other basement tinkerers , ” said Adam Frucci , a contributing editor to the popular tech blog Gizmodo , which has chronicled many of Heckendorn ’s creations .
“ Our readers are always excited to see whatever his newest project is , ” Frucci said .
“ He ’s clearly head and shoulders above anybody else . ”
Heckendorn keeps busy with a couple dozen projects each year , many updated on his Web site , www.benheck.com.
Fees range from a few hundred dollars to convert a clunky old console into a handheld , to more than $ 4,000 to make a laptop computer out of an Xbox 360 .
There are plenty of bizarre requests , too .
“ Often someone will ask me to combine five different video game systems in one box , which is of course ridiculous .
One guy wanted me to build an Xbox 360 controller attached to his rowing machine at home so he could row and play ‘ Uno ’ with his friends online .
It sounded so weird I did it . ”
Heckendorn ’s growing reputation is inching him closer to his dream of working on major retail products .
A couple years ago a soldier injured in Iraq asked him to make a game controller that could be operated with one hand .
Heckendorn did it and is now working with a peripheral maker to sell a packaged product .
“ There was such a large response to it .
Lots of motorcycle accidents , you would not believe it , ” Heckendorn said .
He hopes to donate some to wounded troops at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington .
His efforts have also gotten him noticed in the halls of major console makers such as Microsoft , Sony and Nintendo .
“ There are no offers to throw bundles of money at me but I do hear from them now and then , ” he said .
An electronics hobbyist as a child and trained as a graphic designer , Heckendorn learned basic machining skills working for a sign - making business .
“ I destroyed a lot of video - game consoles and burned my fingers a lot .
Now I know which end of the soldering iron to hold , ” Heckendorn said .
Where others might have a beloved old car they are lovingly restoring , Heckendorn ’s personal project is designing a pinball game based , oddly , on Bill Paxton , who has starred in movies such as “ Titanic ” and “ A Simple Plan ” .
One thing Heckendorn has n’t done much of , ironically , is play video games .
“ I did n’t used to play , but last year I went out of my way to play more video games , ” Heckendorn said .
“ I would probably maybe buy one game a year .
Last year I said you know what , this is ridiculous . ”
Churchgoers hailed the sun halo as a miracle
A halo around the sun startled people in Ethiopia during Sunday 's local elections , with many seeing it as a miracle or a sign from God .
The ring of light caused by sunlight refracted by ice crystals hung in the sky for almost an hour before it finally faded and disappeared .
Some Ethiopians say it last appeared in 1991 before a military regime fell .
But the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt in Addis Ababa says there is little chance it could augur change this time .
She says the overwhelming majority of candidates are from the government party .
Churchgoers who had flocked to see the visiting Patriarch of Alexandria , Pope Shenouda , acclaimed the phenomenon as a miracle , or at least a sign of a blessing from God .
Thank you , God , for revealing a sign
Abuna Paulos , Patriarch of Ethiopia Pope Shenouda himself believed it was a signal from above .
" We accept any sign from God to encourage us in our way , " he said , " and confirm that we are going right in our way . "
Abuna Paulos , the Patriarch of Ethiopia , added his voice to those who believe in signs from God .
" If God reveals himself from the sky , " he told a press conference , " we believers do not get surprised .
We only rejoice and double our efforts to thank God .
Thank you , God , for revealing a sign . "
Dictatorship
But others looked for more secular implications .
Older people in Addis Ababa remember seeing the ring around the sun once before - in the last days of the Derg , the despised military dictatorship , just before its leader Mengistu Haile Mariam fled to Zimbabwe .
But there is little prospect of the government falling in these elections .
The opposition winners of the controversial elections in 2005 in urban areas never took their seats and did not stand again .
The most successful of the other opposition parties pulled out , complaining of intimidation and our correspondent says the results are almost certain to consolidate the ruling party 's hold on power .
Results have not been published yet but an election official said turnout had been massive .

What are these ?
By Matthew Price
BBC News , New York
The pages are mottled and a little yellow .
Some look almost burnt around the edges .
A letter from Abraham Lincoln is said to be the auction 's centrepiece
Enlarge Image
The ink is blotchy in places , but the signatures are unmistakable , and magical .
You need a good imagination , but stare for long enough and you can picture the writers .
Abraham Lincoln for instance , perhaps stroking his beard as he writes from the " Executive Mansion , Washington , April 5 , 1864 . "
George Washington , sitting at his desk at Mount Vernon ( " in Virginia " he usefully adds on the top right - hand corner ) on 2 June 1784 .
Or John Brown , who for most of his life fought to free America 's slaves , writing from his prison cell after he was arrested for attempting to lead an armed slave insurrection .
" Your most kind and most welcome letter of the 8th inst reached me in due time , " he wrote to Reverend Herman L Vaill .
Due time indeed .
Two weeks after the ink had dried , he was executed by hanging .
Swollen mailbox Presidential manuscripts are set to be auctioned at Sotheby 's in New York on Thursday , the centrepiece of the sale being the letter from Lincoln .
It is said he received between 250 and 500 letters a day as president , most of which were dealt with by his staff .
According to Harold Holzer 's book , Dear Mr Lincoln : Letters to the President , Lincoln 's mailbag was swollen " to nearly unmanageable proportions " .
Lincoln could n't reply as he sometimes did as a bloodless lawyer and explain why the constitution did n't permit him to do this
Selby Kiffer
Sotheby 's " [ It contained ] pleas for pardons , requests for autographs , requests for passes through the line , ideas on prosecuting the war , [ and the ] inevitable ravings of seers , soothsayers , and mystics , and threats both violent and profane . "
Lincoln rarely saw the items , but no piece of mail - we are told - touched the president as much as a petition from a group of children in April 1864 .
It was devastatingly simple .
Some 195 boys and girls put their names to a document entitled " Children 's petition to the president asking him to free all the little slave children in this country . "
Lincoln 's reply " is a simple , heartfelt , almost fatherly letter , " says Sotheby 's American Manuscript Expert Selby Kiffer , as he wanders around a press preview ahead of the auction of Presidential and Other American Manuscripts from the Dr Robert Small Trust this week .
" Please tell these little people , " Lincoln wrote , " I am very glad their young hearts are so full of just and generous sympathy , and that while I have not the power to grant all they ask , I trust that they will remember that God has , and that , as it seems , He wills to do it . "
" Lincoln could n't reply as he sometimes did as a bloodless lawyer and explain why the constitution did n't permit him to do this , " Mr Kiffer explains .
" Here he essentially pledges to the children that through him , God will free the slave children . "
It is estimated the short letter will fetch between $ 3 m ( £ 1.5 m ) and $ 5 m ( £ 2.5 m ) .
Future souvenirs
Other highlights include a Lincoln autograph penned on the day of his famous Gettysburg Address on 19 November 1863 .
There is also a document from the sixth president of the United States , John Quincy Adams , foretelling the Civil War and a rare document signed by both of the American explorers , Meriwether Lewis and William Clark .
John Brown wrote this letter two weeks before he was executed
Enlarge Image
" What 's so intriguing about these letters is that they are n't souvenirs , " Mr Kiffer says .
" They were generated in the course of the lives and careers of these presidents and other people . "
So what , we are left wondering , will the successors of Mr Kiffer and his colleagues be auctioning in 150 years ' time ?
Will e-mail exchanges between Barack Obama and his campaign staff about ways to beat Hillary Clinton fetch such interest ?
What about a Word document typed out by John McCain ?
Mr Kiffer , you will not be surprised to learn , suspects it will not quite be the same .
" The trouble with e-mails is they can be reproduced , " he says .
" There are some notes that are handwritten by presidents , but now they tend to be done consciously as souvenirs .
You realise you 're taking a very busy person and making them do something they would n't normally do . "

What are these ?
San Jose , CA – During a fundraiser in Silicon Valley , John McCain said that despite his age he embraced technology and would be " the first President to declare war via Facebook . "
McCain did n't elaborate on who the target of military aggression would be , but many pundits believe it to be Iran .
McCain said he would expand government involvement in technology including developing Facebook applications that could be used to mobilize troops or launch missiles .
" We 've got applications that allow you to throw sheep at people .
Why not fighter jets ? " said McCain .
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have used technology more successfully during the 2008 campaign , but McCain said he was n't going to " cede the technologically savvy youth vote to the Democrats . "
The Arizona Senator surprised the crowd with his vast technical knowledge by giving a detailed argument in favor of Intel 's new Nehalem processor microarchitecture .

" I did n't realize he knew so much about technology , " said venture capitalist Brad Whitmer .
" When he outlined his plan for notifying those earning over $ 250,000 every time they earned middle class tax breaks via text message , I knew he was my guy . "
McCain also outlined plans to use Twitter to inform generals of new missions , and " Peace Rays " to melt terrorists and illegal immigrants .
He ended his remarks by quoting The Art of War , " I think it was Sun Tzu who said , ' keep your Facebook friends close and your MySpace friends closer . ' or something like that . "

* UPDATE *
untoon .
* UPDATE *
Hey all , I just wanted to clarify a bit .
Perhaps " untoon " is the wrong word for this but the exercise here was to take the exact cartoon proportions of Jessica and create her with realistic lighting and textures .
As was done with Homer and Mario .
I think because of her smooth skin the cartooniness definitely still comes through a lot more than Homer .
Here is a side by side of the source image I started with .
So this ended up taking quite a bit longer than the last 2 even though I had expected a pretty easy time with it .
I was able to complete the face relatively quickly but the real challenge was everything from her neck down .
Trying to piece together parts of a body from multiple photos on top of a highly disproportionate body was pretty difficult .
I considered only doing the face but I predicted pitchforks and torches if I chose that route .
Creating the sequins took a bit of time too .
I recently saw some camera effects in a music video I tried to duplicate too with the streaked brightness which I gave a shot here to add to the whole realism .
Anyway , I recorded the first hour of the creation of this one using Camtasia which includes all the face elements and the hair .
It 's not the complete process since this ended up taking a few hours longer than anticipated but I think it will help the curious get a general idea of how this was accomplished .
It 's sped up a bunch and so it only takes 10 minutes to view .
I have to edit together some of the footage but once I get that done i'll post it here in a few days .

Police are to use hundreds of airport - style and hand - held weapon detectors in the crackdown on knife crime .
Teams of 15 officers will be deployed across the 10 boroughs in London that have recorded the most knife crime .
Assistant Commissioner Tim Godwin , head of territorial policing in the capital , said officers would be deployed in areas blighted by stabbings to stop and search teenagers suspected of carrying weapons .
Police admit the “ in your face policing ” is expected to raise community tensions in some areas .
But they say they are getting significant support from communities desperate for them to crack down on the problem .
Officers will use contentious Section 60 powers to enforce effective “ no - go ” areas for people carrying knives .
The powers enable officers to stop people and search them without the need to have “ reasonable suspicion ” that they are engaged in wrong doing .
There has been criticism of the powers because research has found it hits black communities disproportionately .
Stop and search has been strongly criticised in the past but police say there is now more support for the action – provided it it is done with sensitivity .
A new analysis by the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies ( PEN ) indicates that European nations are investing nearly twice as much as the U.S. in research primarily aimed at addressing the potential risks of nanotechnology .
The analysis also highlights a substantial over - inflation of the federal government ’s nanotechnology risk - research investment figures for the U.S .
The new PEN assessment of nanotechnology risk - relevant projects identified by the federal government ’s National Nanotechnology Initiative ( NNI ) for fiscal year 2006 found that only $ 13 million was invested in projects highly relevant to addressing possible risks .
Over the same time period , the PEN analysis found European countries invested nearly $ 24 million in projects with the primary aim of addressing nanotechnology risks .
PEN evaluated research projects listed in the NNI research strategy — released in February 2008 but without specifics regarding the annual project budget or the applicability of each project to assessing potential hazards — by their relevance to addressing current and future nanotechnology risks .
Research was classified according to whether it was highly relevant to addressing potential environment , health or safety hazards , substantially relevant , having some relevance , or was only marginally relevant .
By collecting individual project budget data from publicly available sources , an estimate was made of funding levels for 2006 .
The assessment found 62 federally - funded projects that were highly relevant to understanding nanotechnology risk , with an estimated annual budget of $ 13 million .
In contrast , the federal government estimates $ 37.7 million was invested in highly relevant research in fiscal year 2006 .
According to PEN Chief Science Advisor Andrew Maynard , “ It appears the U.S. is guilty of wishful thinking in its assessment of research that will lead to the development of safe nanotechnologies .
It is trying to substitute research that might inform science ’s general understanding of possible nanotechnology risks for research that is focused on getting answers to direct questions being asked today — what makes a nanomaterial potentially harmful , how can it be used safely , and what happens when it is eventually disposed "
Both the U.S. government figure and the results of the PEN assessment show that less than 3 percent of the $ 1.4 billion federal nanotechnology research budget was spent on environment , health and safety research . ”
Draft legislation proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Science Committee Chair Bart Gordon ( D - TN ) would amend the NNI act to include a minimum 10 percent mandate for the nanotechnology federal research and development budget devoted to EHS research in the future , amounting to approximately $ 150 million annually .

The United States remains the world leader in scientific and technological innovation , but its dominance is threatened by economic development elsewhere , particularly in Asia , the National Science Board said on Tuesday in its biennial report on science and engineering .
The country ’s position is especially delicate , the agency said , given its reliance on foreign - born workers to fill technical jobs .
The board is the oversight agency for the National Science Foundation , the nation ’s leading source of funds for basic research in the physical sciences .
The report , available at www.nsf.gov/statistics/indicators, recommends increased financing for basic research and greater “ intellectual interchange ” between researchers in academia and industry .
The board also called for better efforts to track the globalization of manufacturing and services in the high - tech sector , and their implications for the American economy .

The Wall Street Journal on Friday said :
" The turmoil on Wall Street is beginning to rock a foundation of the financial system : the ability of institutions to make good on their many trades with one another .
" Today , a struggling bond insurer , ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. , will ask its trading partners for more time as it scrambles to unwind more than $ 60 billion of insurance contracts it sold to financial firms but can't fully pay off , according to people familiar with the matter .
The contracts were intended to protect Wall Street firms from losses on mortgage securities and other debt they own .
" The problem is that the insurer itself is teetering - with repercussions across the financial world . "
But that 's not the scariest part .
According to a fairly well - known financial analyst , ACA Financial is a small - time player .
However , he says that the world 's two largest bond insurers are also collapsing .
If he 's right , the effects on the bond market may be even more serious than the mortgage and stock market crashes .

ABC News ' handling of the Democratic debate on Wednesday generated thousands of negative comments from viewers and also excoriating critiques from members alternative and mainstream media alike .
In response , ABC News President David Westin has decided to release a transcript of the untelevised portion of the debate , which took place subsequent to the one Americans watched on Wednesday night .
Westin , speaking with The Wounded - Courier , said , " While I think , on the whole , Charlie and George did an admirable job , I believe the most substantive part of the debate occurred after the cameras were turned off . "
Westin added , " I 've decided to release this transcript to make clear ABC 's commitment to excellence in journalism .
We 're confident you 'll agree that the questions asked in these remaining minutes address substantive issues that are of the utmost concern to Pennsylvanians and every American . "
Courtesy of ABC News , here is the untelevised transcript in its entirety :
CHARLES GIBSON , ABC ANCHOR :
For the televised portion of this debate , we began segments with brief quotes from the Constitution apropos to what we would be discussing .
For the untelevised portion , we will move away from the Constitution and quote liberally in a wild card fashion from whatever source seems appropriate .
OK , so let 's continue .
" Sitting on a cornflake , waiting for the van to come .
Corporation tee - shirt , stupid bloody Tuesday .
Man , you been a naughty boy , you let your face grow long .
I am the eggman , they are the eggmen , I am the walrus , goo goo g'joob . "
GIBSON : That is a quote from The Beatles drug - inspired anthem " I Am the Walrus . "
Senator Obama , exactly how stoned were you the first time you heard this song ?
And did the bong hits , combined with the tabs of acid you ingested , make this song less or more enjoyable ?
SENATOR BARACK OBAMA :
You know , Charlie , I 've already addressed my slight dabbling with drugs when I was a confused youth .
I think I went through what many troubled youths go through when --
GIBSON : But how wasted were you the first time you heard " I Am the Walrus , " Senator , and did your psychotic drug binge -- which may have caused you to black out for days on end while committing unspeakable acts you do n't remember -- add or subtract from your listening pleasure ?
OBAMA : Again , Charlie , I 'm not sure how this helps get Americans health insurance , brings home our troops , or fixes the economy .
GIBSON : I 'll take your response as an admission that pot and acid do , in fact , make this song better .
But shooting heroin and the possible murders you committed during your unconscious fugue state detracted somewhat from the overall listening experience .
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS , ABC ANCHOR : Senator Clinton , if a tree falls in the woods but no one is there to hear it , did it make a sound ?
SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON : George , that is something which has been debated for centuries .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you admit there was no gunfire that day you landed in Bosnia ?
CLINTON : Well , you know , George , I 've already conceded that I misspoke on that issue .
If you 're campaigning as much as Barack and I have --
( STEPHANOPOULOS brandishes a revolver and fires a few feet above Sen. Clinton 's head . )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But you would 've remembered that , right ?
CLINTON : Of course .
OBAMA : Can I just say something ?
I do n't see where this is getting us .
George , you could 've just killed someone in here .
That 's not a toy you 've got in your hand there .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Right you are , Senator .
And that leads us to our next question .
Charlie ?
GIBSON : " I shot a man in Reno , just to watch him die . "
A line from Johnny Cash 's " Folsom Prison Blues . "
STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Obama , your childhood friend Jimmy Choi told us that as a six - year - old boy living in Honolulu , one day you were both engaged in a typical game of cops and robbers , running around your yard with plastic guns , when suddenly little Jimmy tripped and fell .
Before you helped little Jimmy back to his feet , you stood over him and said , " Pow ! Pow !
Pow ! " over and over again , seemingly taking great pleasure in unloading your fake gun into your supposed friend .
How can Democrats vote for a candidate who has shown , beginning at the age of six , to have such little regard for human life ?
OBAMA : You 're serious .
The FNI militia is accused of carrying out massacres of villagers in DR Congo The UN has covered up claims that its troops in Democratic Republic of Congo gave arms to militias and smuggled gold and ivory , the BBC has learned .
The allegations , based on confidential UN sources , involve Pakistani and Indian troops working as peacekeepers .
The UN investigated some of the claims in 2007 , but said it could not substantiate claims of arms dealing .
UN insiders told the BBC's Panorama they had been prevented from pursuing their inquiries for political reasons .
Gold and ivory The United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( Monuc ) is the global body 's largest , with 17,000 troops spread across the country .
It 's true they did , give us arms .
They said it was for the security of the country
' Kung - fu '
FNI leader
Meeting Kung Fu and Dragon Spotlight on India and Pakistan DR Congo : Key Facts
The BBC's Martin Plaut , who returned to DR Congo to follow up his initial investigation into the allegations , says they have managed to bring a measure of stability since they were first established by the UN in February 2000 .
They have also helped disarm the warring factions , run democratic elections and assisted with reconstruction .
But an 18 - month BBC investigation for Panorama has found evidence that : - Pakistani peacekeepers in the eastern town of Mongbwalu were involved in the illegal trade in gold with the FNI militia , providing them with weapons to guard the perimeter of the mines - Indian peacekeepers operating around the town of Goma had direct dealings with the militia responsible for the Rwandan genocide , now living in eastern DR Congo - The Indians traded gold , bought drugs from the militias and flew a UN helicopter into the Virunga National Park , where they exchanged ammunition for ivory The UN looked into the allegations concerning the Pakistani troops in 2007 .
It concluded that one officer had been responsible for dealing in gold - allowing traders to use UN aircraft to fly into the town , putting them up at the UN base and taking them around the town .
But the UN decided that " in the absence of corroborative evidence " its investigators " could not substantiate the allegation " that Pakistani peacekeepers supplied weapons or ammunition to the militia .
It did , however , identify " an individual who seemed to have facilitated gold smuggling " .
Ammunition boxes
But returning to eastern DR Congo , the BBC spoke to several residents of the mining town of Mongbwalu , who said they had seen the FNI re-armed .
One former militant told our correspondent he had witnessed seven boxes of ammunition being brought from the UN camp to re-supply the FNI during a critical fire - fight .
Two FNI leaders known as " Kung - fu " and " Dragon " , who have been jailed in the capital , Kinshasa , have stated publicly that they received help from the UN .
Pakistani peacekeepers have helped train the army in DR Congo The BBC managed to get into the maximum security jail and both confirmed this .
Kung
Fu , whose real name is General Mateso Ninga , said : " Yes , it 's true , they did give us arms .
They said it was for the security of the country .
So they said to us that we would help them take care of the zone . "
The FNI has been described by Human Rights Watch as " some of the most murderous individuals that operate in eastern Congo " .
The ethnic Lendu militia was involved in the bitter clashes with their Hema rivals in the Ituri district .
UN insiders close to the investigation told the BBC they had been prevented from pursuing their inquiries for political reasons .
Our correspondent says that in short , the Pakistanis , who are the largest troop contributors to the UN in the world , were too valuable to alienate .
Pakistan has said it has no means of influencing the UN and that there is no evidence that its troops were involved in an illegal gold trade or re-armed militia , describing the allegations as baseless .
The Indian Army told Panorama that an investigation by the UN watchdog had revealed that all but one of the allegations were based on hearsay or had no credible evidence .
' Interests '
The special representative of the UN Secretary - General in DR Congo , Alan Doss , told the BBC that any effort to re-arm militias " would be a great concern to us " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" After all , we 've lost lives fighting these militias - let 's not forget that , " he said .
Mr Doss dismissed the allegations of the militia leaders who said they had received weapons from UN troops based in the country .
" Militia leaders are militia leaders .
They always have their interests , " he said .
" All I can say is that this investigation did n't confirm that . "
Our correspondent says these are not the only allegations to have been brought against peacekeepers in DR Congo .
In December 2006 , then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Moroccan troops had been involved in widespread sexual abuse .

What are these ?
Do you speak Nerdic ?
Chances are you do – it's reportedly one of the world 's fastest - growing languages .
New " research " ( we 're still waiting on the white paper ) from Pixmania , one of Europe 's largest online retailers , claims that Nerdic is the fastest - growing language on the Continent due to its widespread use and adoption by all age groups .
Of course , it 's not really a language : Nerdic refers to the buzzwords and acronyms that describe technological techniques or advances that are becoming integrated into everyday conversation .
For example , consider the widespread use of terms like rickroll , mashup and googling .
" Technology has infiltrated our lives in many ways and at such a pace it 's natural that it has developed a language of its own , " said
Ulric Jerome , managing director of Pixmania.com , in an interview with U.K. newspaper The Telegraph .
Jerome said the language of geek speak should be officially recognized to " unite technology fans across Europe . "
" More than 100 new words were added to the evolving vocabulary in the last 12 months – more than three times the number added to the English language by the Oxford English Dictionary , " according to a * Daily Mail * story on the Nerdic phenomenon .
But as quickly as new words are adopted , outdated techie terms must be discarded .
So while words like UGC ( for user - generated content ) , RFID and WiMax are introduced , phrases referring to obsolete technology – like * floppy disc , VHS * and MiniDisc – should be discarded .
What words do you think qualify as Nerdic ?
Submit your suggestions below and vote .

While you can submit as many terms as you want , you can only submit one every 30 minutes .

It was definitely a product of much heated ethical and legal debate , but we ended up doing it .
My friend “ Taco Bell Big Box Lunch ” and I organized a Santa Monica Freeway ride from Cloverfield to Centinela ( on - ramp to off - ramp ) .
9 other riders showed up and we sped through automotive paralysis like water molecules through kidneys .
Post - ride epiphany = no less safe than riding on the PCH ( which spandex roadies do daily ) or any other surface street congested with gridlock .
Some amusing comments from the YouTuberz :
When asked about the trouble one could find themselves in , a user named voodmann responds :
NONE , when the cops finally pulled us over we just told them that “ it seemed like a good idea at the time . ” then we told them that “ life is full of wrong turns officer , and we just took one … two . ”
Then he let us leave and he took his police felt mountain bike out of the trunk of his car and rode off into the sun as it set across the western shoulder of the 405 freeway .
no ticket .
Responding to a comment proposing an exodus from Los Angeles , because the sprawl makes it impossible for people to commute via bicycles , the same user asks :
are you suggesting that the citizens of this glorious city displace themselves and move to NY ?
there ’s a large underclass here that can’t really afford that .
Vote for higher taxes for social services and maybe your dream can become a reality .
PS – I know …most of the people in cars do n’t belong to the underclass …it ’s still a paradigm .
In your mouth .

Sylvester Stallone , whose latest Rambo film takes him to fight baddies in Burma , today ripped into the junta 's handling of a devastating cyclone .
Stallone hoped that both the cyclone , which left more than 60,000 people dead or missing , and his latest Rambo film would intensify pressure on Burma 's ruling generals .
The cyclone " made clear how unprepared Myanmarese ( Burmese ) were and how much the military government is ignoring them and not supporting them " , Stallone told reporters in Tokyo as he promoted the latest Rambo film .
You might sort out two different kinds of important change .
The first kind is the sort of change that happens all the time – perennial change .
You are born .
You grow .
You get sick .
You get better .
Empires rise .
Empires fall .
Friends come .
Friends go .
These are the sorts of changes , along with a few thousand others , that characterize human life .
Philosophy , in its oldest sense , responds to and explores perennial change .
Originally , in ancient times , it was meant as a kind of therapy for dealing with life ’s perennial changes .
But then there are the changes that are more specific to our times – local change .
Carbon emissions are changing the climate .
Worldwide information transfer is immediate .
New forms of life and artificial intelligence are being created .
Economic and political events around the world are sensitively dependent on one another .
Many different kinds of intellectuals are thinking about these local changes , but so far philosophy has largely ignored them and has stuck to the more perennial changes .
Perennial changes are important , of course ; being able to navigate through them is what it is to be wise .
But philosophy , I believe , also has to start responding to local change , since the local changes we are experiencing have deep and significant consequences .
Indeed , our local changes might well change our perennial changes .
We need to think about the future of “ empires , ” and whether nation states will have anything to do with that .
We need to think about new life forms , and the ways biotechnology will challenge our understanding of “ human being . ”
Same goes for artificial intelligence – we need to think about moral obligations we will have to the conscious beings we will manufacture .
As world cultures meld together into politico - economic units , we need to think about the kinds of new obligations we will have to one another .
And throughout all these local changes , new pressures will be brought to bear upon our perennial existential questions :
Who am I ?
What is my life about ?
What is important ?
I call these new challenges for philosophy “ Philosophy 2.0 . ”
Of course , the “ 2.0 ” bit is a reference to Web 2.0 , which is what the web became when it started getting truly interactive .
Web 1.0 was basically like television with a million channels : click , watch , click , watch , click , etc .
But now , in Web 2.0 , you can put your own stuff on the web , or take stuff off and mix it up in your own way and throw it back out there , or use applications and programs that are on the web instead of loaded onto your own computer .
It is a profound change in the way we are entertaining ourselves ; a transition from a “ read only ” culture to a “ read / write culture . ”
That ’s another local change that may have perennial consequences .
Philosophy 2.0 is about getting interactive with local change .
Philosophy 1.0 , as we might call it , is occupied with perennial change , and it needs to keep chugging along , for as long as human beings are around .
But its “ product ” is about to get tweaked by Philosophy 2.0 .
Our philosophical thought about local change will impact our thought about perennial change .
This is a genuinely new situation for philosophy , since we do not have a luxury we have had in the past : time .
Normally , philosophers can wait until the dust has settled before looking back and making sense of where we have been .
But we are going to have to get used to looking through the dust , and making the best guesses we can , since ai n’t nothing gonna settle anytime soon .
We need direction and big - picture planning like never before , and it is the obligation of philosophers to join into that debate .
Besides , philosophers have unique knowledge and skills to contribute .
They are most in touch with the big pictures of the past ( from Plato to Heidegger ) , and so are in the best position to assess how the big picture is changing .
They are used to thinking in terms of systems , and local change is all about systematic change ( whether economic , environmental , or technological ) .
And they are more sensitive than most to all the complexities of moral , epistemological , and social issues .
Part of philosophy ’s romantic attraction to me has been its inherent Luddism .
Philosophy professors do n’t need overheads or PowerPoint or WebCT or any other gizmo ; they only need a piece of chalk and an empty afternoon .
But this image has to change .
Philosophers need to be up on the details of local change , and need to start thinking through them and responding to them .
That might not affect the pensive ambience of the philosophy classroom , but it will affect the lesson plans .
Many people have been working hard to distill the results of local change to the generally educated public ; philosophers need to make use of those efforts and get acquainted with the local world .
Things need to get messy .
We can not afford cleaving only to the relatively stable regions of perennial change .
What philosophers will bring to the table is a deep familiarity with perennial changes , and keen insight as to how local changes will change them and possibly be informed by them .
This is a dimension that is now either being neglected , or carried out by those who do n’t really know what they are saying .
We need Philosophy 2.0 now more than ever .

Why do I get the feeling that this is really a mob , just waiting for someone to say something they do not agree with ?

That 's the best description for the internet I 've ever heard
Even as a young man Humphrey Lyttelton , who has died aged 86 , always seemed a jazz patriarch , and throughout his life his arrival at any jazz event somehow raised the social temperature , like the entrance of royalty .
I do n't think this was the result of his very grand background ( few jazzmen can boast a member of the Gunpowder Plot as an ancestor ) , nor even his own hyper - traditional beginnings —
Eton college , Windsor , and the Brigade of Guards .
Jazz musicians in general are not prone to forelock - tugging , and Humph 's rare references to his past tended to be lightly ironic .
It is undeniable , however , that he had a natural authority .
I never heard anyone try to send him up or put him down , and this could have been due to the influence of his much - loved father George , an Eton housemaster ; his mother Pamela was a keen amateur musician , and he took up the trumpet at the age of 15 .
Before going to Eton himself , he went to Sunningdale school , Berkshire .
There was indeed a certain pedagogue - like side to Humph .
I was told by a member of one of his bands that he sometimes played unidentified records to his musicians and then shot questions at them .
" That boy at the back of the class , " he 'd snap , " who 's that on alto ? "
Politically , however , he was firmly , if surprisingly , on the left .
Prior to joining the Grenadier Guards in 1941 he was sent to work in a South Wales steel mill to find out if he had the makings of a " captain of industry " , but the experience , on the contrary , turned him into a lifelong , sometimes active , socialist .
It is in consequence very unlikely that he was never offered an honour , but equally in character that he should refuse it .
When it came to dealing with the press , Humph played his cards very close to his chest .
He would talk or write freely about his musical life and the quirks of the musicians he had employed or , in the case of Americans , accompanied , but when it came to his social origins , the area which naturally attracted journalists , he gave them nothing beyond three stories which , for want of anything else , were repeated in almost every article or interview .
They were : how he played hooky from the Eton and Harrow cricket match at Lord 's to buy his first trumpet in the Charing Cross Road ; how he waded ashore durng the allied landings at Salerno , south - west Italy , in September 1943 , brandishing a pistol in one hand and his trumpet in the other ; how on VE night , May 7 1945 , dressed in his officer 's mess uniform , he was wheeled round the West End in a handcart blowing lustily and finishing up outside Buckingham Palace .
Thin pickings , but positively Proustian compared with the way he guarded his private life .
His telephone number was predictably ex-directory , but if anyone found it out and rang him it was changed at once .
All information , bookings , or enquiries had to be filtered through his longtime manager , the fiercely protective but very likeable Susan Da Costa .
Perhaps he had not always been quite so reclusive .
He wrote once that during Graeme Bell 's Australian jazz band 's first visit to Britain in the late 1940s he'd had " Australians like some people have mice , " but that was early on .
In later years the metaphorical drawbridge of his house in Hertfordshire ( built , he claimed , with the money he made on his one unexpected appearance in the hit parades .
Bad Penny Blues ) was always up .
I can think of no more unlikely candidate for Hello ! magazine .
After demob in 1946 , Humph , like many ex-service men , took advantage of a grant to go to art school .
At Camberwell School of Art , south - east London , he met up with Wally " Trog " Fawkes , a fellow jazz - lover , clarinettist ( Humphrey too played clarinet well up to professional standard ) and brilliant cartoonist .
In 1949 , Wally was in a position to help his friend to get a job drawing " column breakers " for the Daily Mail , and to write for a time the storyline and balloons for Flook , Fawkes 's long - lived comic strip - yet it was musically that their partnership was to prove most fruitful .
By this time , through natural talent and rigorous application - he was self - taught musically - Humph 's playing had improved sufficiently for him to be welcome to sit in at various jazz - oriented West End nightclubs .
He had joined Wally as a member of the George Webb Dixielanders in 1947 , and a legend was born .
Jazz " revivalism " had taken hold during the war , a mysterious passion for the music played and recorded during the 1920s in Chicago by black New Orleans immigrants .
At first this enthusiasm was confined to discs , but eventually Webb , a tiny , somewhat aggressive South London piano player and factory worker , formed a band to reconstruct the music itself at a pub in Kent .
Then Humph and Wally came along and raised the whole thing from enthusiastic approximation to a level not far removed from the original .
A year later , the two of them left to set up on their own , but Webb obviously bore no permanent grudge .
Not so long after he joined Humph on piano .
The formation of the Lyttelton band coincided with , and led , a boom in revivalist jazz on a national scale .
There were tours and " house full " concerts , but Humph 's real home , after trying out various venues in the West End of London , was 100 Oxford Street , a shabby but enormous basement room , by day a cheap restaurant , and where twice a week there were queues round the block .
It was not only the music .
By this time Humph , following the example of the recent visit of the irreverent and relaxed Graeme Bell , had proscribed the seated pipe - smoking solemnity of the pre-war " rhythm clubs " , and dancing , as in the authentic early jazz days , was encouraged .
There were , by the beginning of the 1950s , many bands at various levels of competence playing in the same idiom , but there was no question as to who was king .
Although some of Humph 's rhythm sections suffered from our national failing , a certain sogginess , the front line , and particularly when it recruited the late Keith Christie on trombone , was outstanding by any criteria .
Those were euphoric nights .
Then , at the height of his success , but feeling that he was becoming trapped ( " play - acting " he once described it ) , Humph introduced the late Bruce Turner on saxophone and gradually moved the band 's idiom from the 1920s to the small - band " swing era " of the 1930s .
Not until Dylan went rock 'n 'roll was a change of musical policy greeted with such anger .
In Birmingham when Humph introduced Bruce in 1953 , a whole row of ex-fans raised a long banner reading " Go Home Dirty Bopper " .
His audience melted like snow .
Humph , who chose this moment to go professional ( and in consequence , lost Fawkes , whose first commitment was to cartooning ) was wryly amused by the accusation he had " gone commercial " , a concept , he once told me , that would have perplexed his agent and bank manager .
Yet , admirably true to himself as he always was , Humph was never totally dependent on music for a living .
He was at different times , as well as a cartoonist , a restaurant critic for Vogue , a regular columnist on Punch , and above all , a broadcaster .
For nearly 40 years , from 1968 till his last programme in March , he presented The Best of Jazz on Radio 2 on Monday evening and , simultaneously chaired , with immaculate timing and sharp , hard - edged wit , the comedy panel game I'm Sorry I Have n't a Clue on Radio 4 , from 1972 onwards .
He was also a brilliant after - dinner speaker .
Among his extramural interests were ornithology and , following his father 's example , the practice of calligraphy .
Yet it was always jazz that remained his true mistress , and at times she led him quite a dance .
From the middle 1950s on , among his many experiments were adding no fewer than three saxophones ( Go home dirty boppers ! ) , a fusion of jazz and Afro - Cuban music ( with Kenny Graham ) , and the formation in 1958 of a big band .
The outcome was not always happy .
His sometime flirtation with the near - avant - garde showed him , rather than his employees , out of his depth , and even as a mainstream player , the replacement of Louis Armstrong by the great Kansas City trumpet player Buck Clayton as a principal influence failed to ignite Humph 's own playing to anything like the same extent , or so it seemed to me .
Even so his change of direction did allow him to provide superb and suitable backing during the 1960s for touring American stars , including , among others , Clayton himself , the blues shouter Jimmy Rushing , and the gospel singer Sister Marie Knight .
Humph , while steering clear of the " trad boom " under his own banner , was not against guesting occasionally in this profitable company , and indeed toured Australia in a show Salute to Sachmo ( 1978 ) , with the late Alex Welsh .
Greatly to his credit and perception was his realisation that Helen Shapiro , a teenage pop star of the 1950s , had the potential to become a first - class jazz singer .
Towards the end of his career , he settled for quite a large band with an eclectic repertoire , and many of the fine musicians were featured in solos , a device which allowed him to rest his own lip , naturally not quite what it was after so many decades of hard blowing and no coasting .
Humph , always courteous but a little aloof in his early days , became much more relaxed and friendly in his later years , and that most moderate of men had even been known to down the occasional Irish whiskey .
However , he was never one to hang around .
He blew and , when possible , drove home ; he was never a night - owl .
His one constant source of irritation was the public 's refusal to move with him as he explored jazz history .
I met him once shortly after some anniversary at the 100 Club where , as far as possible , he had reconvened his original band , possibly including Wally Fawkes .
It was packed , he told me and " some old fool " had told him he should play there more often .
" I was here with my band , " Humph snapped at him , " last Thursday . "
A good point , yet , while I would never have been so tactless , I understood what " the old fool " meant .
Humph 's intransigence , his determination to " play as I please " was admirable : he was , like Ronnie Scott , the perfect ambassador for jazz , but , as another " old fool " , for me he will always be that Pied Piper on the cusp of the 1950s , beating in Snake Rag in a magic cellar when we were young and did n't even know it .
His marriage to Patricia Braithwaite in 1948 ended in divorce .
His subsequent marriage to Jill Richardson in 1952 ended with her death in 2006 .
He is survived by a daughter from the first marriage , and two sons and a daughter from the second .

Editor 's Note : Previously , Roland Martin wrote his opinion on what Sen. Hillary Clinton needed to do to win .
Click here to read that commentary .
( CNN ) --
Ask any boxing trainer and they 'll tell you that you can walk into the ring with a well - designed plan to beat your opponent , but as the fight progresses , you might have to alter your plans .
Roland S. Martin says it is hard for Obama to appear negative since he called for a different kind of politics .
After losing 11 straight races to Sen. Barack Obama , Sen. Hillary Clinton was faced with a tough scenario : Continue on the same path and keep losing , or shake up your fight plan to keep battling another day .
She accepted the " resignation " of her campaign manager , Patti Solis Doyle , brought in Maggie Williams ; paid more attention to her campaign finances , especially online fundraising ; focused intently on her economic message ; and went after Obama with a different line of attack that some have described as negative .
Frankly , the " 3 a.m. " ad that questioned his qualifications as commander - in - chief -- without overtly saying it -- should only be seen as negative based on the tone and tenor of this campaign .
But it will pale in comparison to the ads we will see in November .
That folks , is just smart politics .
So she wins three out of four states , staves off defeat , and now has a little pep in her step heading into the Wyoming caucus , Mississippi primary , and the big contest on April 22 , the Pennsylvania primary .
More importantly , she has forced Obama to question his campaign plan , and put the onus on him to go to his corner to get instructions from his trainer in order to win the next round .
Obama faces a tougher task because of his denunciation of the politics of old , which have sort of tied his hands .
He is expected to be Mr. Positive on the campaign trail , and not go negative against Clinton .
Yet there are ways in which he can better define Clinton that will not only not be seen as negative , but also better reposition him leading into the final contests .
For one , the Clinton campaign has successfully sold the media on the idea that the next important contest is Pennsylvania .
The day after her wins Tuesday , nearly every show was talking about what needs to happen April 22 , as if the Wyoming and Mississippi races were afterthoughts .
Obama must hit Clinton hard on being a " Big D " Democrat who does n't really care about the " Little D " Democrats .
Remember how she essentially brushed aside Obama 's wins in Utah , Idaho , Washington state and other places as nothing but red states they have no way of capturing in the fall ?
Her argument is that Democrats must win the big states -- California , New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Michigan , Florida and Ohio .
This plays to her advantage since she won them ( Sorry , I do n't include Michigan and Florida , and you already know why ) .
This falls in line with her " 50 - plus - 1 " strategy : Just win the same states as Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 , and then you flip Ohio or Florida to win the White House .
But Obama 's thinking is more in line with Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean : Create a 50 - state strategy to establish Democratic dominance on the federal level -- more of a supermajority -- but also on the state level .
By changing the discourse by suggesting she will only care about Democrats in large states , Obama will be able to speak to the hearts and minds of those small states , and more importantly , rally those superdelegates who felt put off by Clinton 's dismissive comments .
A key argument for Obama to make is that redistricting is two years away , and Democrats need control of governorships and state legislatures .
Only through targeting those places will that become a reality .
Second , jump right in her face on the foreign policy front .
She claims she was integrally involved in the release of Kosovo refugees and the Irish peace talks .
Fine .
So demand to know why if she was so involved in foreign policy , the Clinton administration failed in Rwanda and had a horrible plan on Somalia ?
There were clear international failures during the eight years of President Bill Clinton , and she needs to be forced to say what she did and did n't do .
Obama has used the cherry picking argument , but has been weak in selling it .
Nail it to try to nail her .
Finally , Professor Obama has to return .
One of the reasons he did so well in the Los Angeles , California , debate is that he chose to go head - to - head with her on policy .
Everyone said that 's her strength , but he held his own .
He needs to make a more convincing argument when it comes to the economy .
The economic plans they have are not overwhelmingly different .
What he has to do is come out of the podium and make it plain .
Speak to voters in Mississippi about the tragedy of the Gulf Coast ; tell voters there and in Wyoming why he will help their kids go to college ; present his urban and rural economic renewal programs to the voters in Pennsylvania .
Do n't concede any ground to her on these points .
Is this fight over ?
Absolutely not .
But Obama can't afford to look at his lead among pledged delegates and think he will maintain that and go to Denver and the superdelegates will fall behind him .
In Las Vegas , Nevada , every boxer is told to win it in the ring , and not depend on the judges .
This is now a 15 - round heavyweight match instead of 12 rounds .
Clinton has no choice but to brawl .
It worked Tuesday , so why stop doing it ?
Obama ?
He is sort of the boxer who is technically proficient and wants to showcase those skills .
But you can't dance all night .
Sometimes you 've got to slug it out in the middle of the ring .
That does n't mean being nasty or trashing your opponent .
But it does mean fighting hard until the bell rings in the final round and never letting your guard down .
Obama , you let your guard down before Tuesday .
Do n't do it again or you might just get knocked out of the nomination .
