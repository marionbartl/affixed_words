Racism allegations have dogged French police
French Interior Minister Michele Alliot - Marie called it " intolerable " behaviour that " totally contradicts police ethics " .
The men - in plain clothes and accompanied by two others - allegedly shouted " Sieg Heil ! "
The incident happened in the northern town of Amiens last Friday .
The bar owner reported their behaviour to police authorities .

The fuel of the Internet While bloggers and print journalists lock horns over media hierarchies and journalistic standards , Web 2.0 is making Google a noiseless fortune .
By Robin Meyer - Luch
Digitalisation is an inherently cyclical business .
It comes in waves .
Its domestication always follows the same procedure : a new bit of technology arrives which opens up a new realm of possibilities .
This uncharted zone is then hyped full of potential .
Its borders seem near indiscernible .
Eventually , experience fills the realm of possibility .
The technology 's comparative advantages gradually assume contours and initial assessments are reassessed .
In the end , what remains is a realistic picture of the new application .
In the late autumn 2007 , the realm of new possibilities known as Web 2.0 definitively entered verification phase in Germany .
One of clearest indication of this came in the form of editorials by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung publisher Frank Schirrmacher ( here ) and Bernd Graff in the Süddeutsche Zeitung ( here ) .
Both identified a sufficient waning in 2.0 euphoria to wager a vociferous swipe at any last traces of idealisation .
At the end of October , Frank Schirrmacher gave a speech that was intended as a hymn to the increase in value of print journalism , but actually focused principally on the journalistic inferiority of the Internet .
To Schirrmacher the web is a hotbed of journalistic haste , impassiveness , and superficiality .
Its " iconographic extremism " threatens the culture of writing .
From the depths of decentrality rises the " infection " of poor content .
The net is a looming hole in the institutional fabric of journalism , opening the doors to all and sundry and relativising the authority of traditional quality journalism .
Schirrmacher responded to the protests of online journalists by saying he merely wanted to express his preference for a coexistence of newspapers and the Internet ( here ) .
But he obviously also fancied himself as a juggler of culturally conservative resentments vis a vis the Internet as media .
In early December , the deputy editor - in - chief of the online edition of the Süddeutsche Zeitung , felt the unexpected need to unleash a tirade against the " destructive forces of the free - opinion market " on the Internet .
In the " faceless and characterless ' many - to - many ' communication on the web , " knowledge is " trampled into a grass - roots democratic mush . "
The " staggeringly unsuspecting public " has been taken in by the idiotic promises of decentralized information , when in fact web forums have little to offer except superficial knowledge , vulgar remarks , and slander .
Graff , however , gets caught up in a breathtakingly structural - conservative , know - it - all attitude , which prevents him from making any kind of sophisticated contribution to the debate .
For him , the reversibility and decentralization of the Internet are the breeding ground of brazen user - empowerment , serving solely as an end in itself and providing no sort of edification whatsoever – a kind of user - generated discourse delirium .
Graff , like Schirrmacher , is playing on the anxiety of journalism 's entropic death on the net .
They fear that " good journalism " could perish in the fever of participation , or , at the very least , lose its significance .
What is most certainly a difficult path to a new digital information economy is reformulated as a history of loss .
Such figures appear cyclically .
At the beginning of the 1990s , the American media critic Neil Postman got worked up over the deterioration of the " immune system of the information system , " which would result in society being flooded with context - free information ( technopoly ) .
By the end of the '90s , the German political scientist Bernd Guggenberger had conjured up the " digital nirvana , " in which " waste data " should be disposed of according to the principle of focusing solely on what is worth knowing .
Such information - economy anxieties eventually dissolve as new filters , new hierarchical systems and new coexistences establish themselves .
In the meantime , the discourse economy of Web 2.0 continues to trickle steadily into the public realm .
The net breeds clearly defined " issue publics " which might only be visible on second glance , or with a certain technological savvy .
For instance , within just a few weeks , a 21 - year - old reached over half a million viewers on YouTube with a video ( here ) expressing his views on misleading and false TV reporting on computer games .
By the time the mainstream media caught on , the video had already been viewed over 200,000 times .
In traditional media , content is first filtered and then published .
On the Internet , things are often the other way around .
The result is a complex and confusing plurality with a coherence that frays at the edges .
Such a media reality is sometimes difficult to endure and frequently seems psychotic .
Nonetheless , it will have to be endured .
The dilemma facing the new technological constellation is that it provides better and therefore also incomplete knowledge .
This cannot , however , be blamed on the medium , but is inherent in the logic of knowledge itself .
The extent to which the Internet has already changed our understanding of journalism was shown by the nomination of Stefan Niggemeier in his funtion as a blogger ( here ) as German " Journalist of the Year " .
The jury 's decision indirectly echoed the widespread message about the relationship between blogs and journalism , namely that a blogger well - versed in the profession can uphold the journalistic ideals of steeliness , perseverance , and single mindedness at least as well as his colleagues in traditional publishing .
It does n't make a difference if one earns little any or no money in the process .
It also does n't matter if it does n't reach more than 5,000 readers daily .
What matters are the results .
The decision has thrown the concept of journalism wide open , and rightly so .
And yet over the course of 2007 , there was clear drop in interest in Web 2.0 ideas – it has almost assumed an air of normality .
It is impossible to prevent a degree of boredom from setting in .
The big star of the web 's second wave remains Google .
According to the most recent figures from Allensbach , the search machine is now used by 27.6 million Germans per week , which constitutes around 55 percent of the population of 14 to 64 - years - olds .
The search machine – the mother of all aggregators – has thereby become one of the most wide - ranging media sources in Germany .
Only major television broadcasters have a larger audience .
By rough estimates , Google has made a turnover in Germany this year of around one billion euros – that makes 36.20 euros per user annually , or almost exactly 3 euros per user per month .
The most remarkable thing is that almost no user can imagine that Google earns any money from their Internet searches – let alone 36 euros a year .
Google 's business model for its end consumers is " noiseless , " to formulate it carefully .
The economic ideal to which Web 2.0 aspires is a " market for one . "
This means dealing in highly personalized goods , which possess the great economic advantage of having their prices individually determined by the readiness of the consumer to pay .
This allows for the optimal exploitation of a market .
This is what actually lies behind personalization and mass customization .
Correspondingly , every keyword ranking in Google has its own price for advertising customers .
This is technically achieved though the use of algorithms – the second great ideal of Web 2.0 .
Capitalism has been technically upgraded .
The technology journalist Nicholas Carr has written a very insightful text on the Google economy .
He analyses the search engine and the content it makes accessible as complementary goods .
There is a simultaneous demand for economic goods of this sort because they go together like fountain pens and ink or cars and petrol .
Typical for complementary goods is that the demand for one item decreases when the price of counterpart increases .
The manufacturers of a product , therefore , have a vested interest in maintaining low prices for their complementary products .
Correspondingly Google has an equally strong interest in freely available content on the net as the auto industry has in reasonably priced petrol .
Against this backdrop , the decision by both the New York Times and Spiegel to freely provide free access to their archives appears in a totally new light .

Hers may be a little on the high side
An Italian urologist and self - professed lover of the sexy shoe set out to prove that high heels were not as bad for women 's health as some suggest .
The shoe has been linked to a range of problems - from corns to schizophrenia .
But in a letter to European Urology , Dr Maria Cerruto said her research showed it was time to stand up for the heel .
She said her study of 66 women under 50 found that those who held their foot at a 15 degree angle to the ground - the equivalent of a two inch heel - had as good posture as those who wore flat shoes , and crucially showed less electrical activity in their pelvic muscles .
This suggested the muscles were at an optimum position , which could well improve their strength and ability to contract .
The pelvic floor muscles are an essential component of the female body .
As well as assisting sexual performance and satisfaction , they provide vital support to the pelvic organs , which include the bladder , bowels and uterus .
But they often weaken after pregnancy and childbirth , and as the woman gets older .
There are exercises to strengthen them , but Dr Cerruto hopes her findings may eliminate the need for these .
" Women often have difficulty in carrying out the right exercises for the pelvic zone and wearing heels could be the solution , " she said .
" Like many women , I like high - heeled shoes , " she added .
" It 's good to know they have potential health benefits . "
Gill Brook , a women 's health physiotherapist in Bradford , stressed the findings did not suggest that stilettos were a good thing for those keen on improving their pelvic floor function .
" But for women who like a slightly higher heel , these are reassuring findings - although we have n't yet done away with the need for regular exercises to maintain what is such an important part of the female body . "
Texas short on election workers for primary

With a record voter turnout expected in Tuesday 's primary , Texas is scrambling to find enough election workers to cover the polls .
Election Judge Mike Conwell even went door - to - door in Travis County on Saturday , looking for volunteers .
" I think it is an unusual step ... but I 'm kind of running out of options , " Conwell told Austin 's KVUE News .
" If the county does n't get enough volunteers by Tuesday , " KVUE reported , " precincts may be combined , which could create confusion for voters . "
There could be even greater problems facing Texas voters in some counties .
According to a blog at OpEd News :
" The lines at many Democratic Precinct Polling Places in Republican heavy counties may be frustratingly long .
Long lines and long waits at Democratic Polling places are likely to occur because Texas Secretary of State Phil Wilson ( R ) used 2004 primary voting pattern numbers to allocate Election Clerks and County owned Voting Equipment to 2008 Democratic Primary Precinct Polling places .
...
" Democratic precinct polling place skeleton crews of just one Election Clerk , in addition to one each Election and Alternate Judge , and only two voting booths likely will not keep pace with late day voting as people line up to vote after work , before polling places close at 7 P.M .
This may spawn long lines waiting to vote when the polls close at 7 P.M. , just when people are due to start arriving back at their respective polling places for the Democratic Precinct Caucus Conventions , scheduled to start at 7:15 P.M. ...
This means people may be voting for more than a hour after the polling place doors are locked at 7 P.M. "

ORLANDO , Florida ( Reuters ) - Banks may have to swallow reductions in the principal of some troubled home loans to ward off greater losses that could result from outright default , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Warning that mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are likely to rise , with more declines in house prices , Bernanke called for active measures from both the public and private sectors to stabilize housing markets .
“ This situation calls for a vigorous response , ” Bernanke said in a speech to the Independent Community Bankers of America , referring to government and private - sector initiatives to slow the rate of home loan failures .
“ Measures to reduce preventable foreclosures could help not only stressed borrowers but also their communities and , indeed , the broader economy , ” he said .
U.S. government bond prices shed early losses and turned higher , while stocks extended their declines and the downtrodden dollar touched another all - time low against a basket of currencies .
Market bets of a Fed rate cut at its March 18 meeting ticked down slightly to roughly a 66 percent chance of a cut in benchmark interest rates by three - quarters of a percentage point from the current 3 percent .
Bernanke ’s comments come as the central bank grapples with the twin dilemmas of a slowing economy and rising inflation .
U.S. economic growth slowed to a sluggish 0.6 percent at the end of 2007 and hiring declined in January .
But inflation rose 4.1 percent in 2007 , the largest 12 - month rise since 1990 .
Current housing difficulties differ from past housing market slumps because of the large number of homeowners who owe more on their loans than their homes are worth , Bernanke said .
“ In this environment , principal reductions that restore some equity for the homeowner may be a relatively more effective means of avoiding delinquency and foreclosure ” than reducing interest rates on troubled home loans , he said .
When a mortgage is “ under water , ” a reduction in principal may boost the chances of pay - off by avoiding default or foreclosure , he added .
Analysts said the Fed chairman was advising bankers that it was in their best interest to resolve mortgage problems quickly and to cut their losses .
“ The problems in the credit system and problems on consumer balance sheets are such that some of the losses will have to be socialized , either by the market or by the government , ” said Joseph Brusuelas , chief U.S. economist at IDEAglobal in New York .
“ And it ’s highly preferable that between the two , those losses be accepted by the market . ”
Bernanke also said government - sponsored mortgage finance enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could do more to address problems in housing and mortgage markets .
“ New capital - raising by the ( government - sponsored enterprises ) , together with congressional action to strengthen supervision of these companies , would allow Fannie and Freddie to expand significantly the number of new mortgages that they scrutinize , ” he said .
“ With few alternative mortgage channels today , such action would be highly beneficial to the economy . ”
Bernanke added that giving greater latitude to the Federal Housing Administration to set underwriting standards and risk premiums for mortgage refinancing would extend help to more borrowers in trouble .
Poisons are used on Kenyan battle arrows .
Accomplished runner Wesley Gnetich died from a poison arrow to the chest in Kenya earlier this year .
How extensively this enhancement is utilized , do n't know .
Using camouflage or earth - toned colors would be of little use on such open ground where a man-sized , quickly moving target will be easily spotted regardless of the colors he wears , no ?
Have n't been to Kenya , but the vegetation shown in the pics suggests cost - benefit ratios to favor short bows made from small - diameter stock .
Like , it takes several days of searching to find a stave fit for a long bow , whereas a 40 - incher can be quickly made anywhere .
Long arrows needed for the long bows compound the issue when making arrows out of open - ground bushes , where 20 " shafts may abound while 30 - inchers are a rare find .
Short bows vs. long bows revisited .
Short native bows are used for self - defence in many African cities .
The guys in the pics may well be men who need to be able to carry a bow with them anywhere , unobtrusively .
A bit hard with a 72 - incher .
Have never made full - speed downhill running shots myself but intuitively it seems to me that it 's much easier with a short bow and a short draw than otherwise .
Typical short draw shots are also quite a bit faster than typical long draw shots , a decided advantage in combat .
Prairie Man ,
having shot very short selfbows and arrows at distances up to 60 yards extensively , I find your comparison of them to snowballs quite amusing .
When armed with sharp broadheads of succifient mass ( as African arrows typically are ) , those puny stick shorties and unfletched twigs will kill a man dead at considerable distance .
Neither accuracy nor penetration is near as bad as many seem to think .

MOSCOW 
His election choreographed by the Kremlin , Dmitri A. Medvedev secured a predictably commanding victory on Sunday to become Russia ’s next president .
Still , though the results were never in doubt , Mr. Medvedev ’s future role very much is , given that the man who anointed him , President Vladimir V. Putin , intends to remain in the government .
Mr. Medvedev , an unassuming aide to Mr. Putin who has never before held elected office , portrayed himself during a relatively listless campaign as something of a reformer , vowing to crack down on endemic corruption and promote the rule of law .
He also seemed to take a less strident stance toward the West than Mr. Putin .
Mr. Medvedev ’s success at adopting this platform early in his tenure will represent an important indicator of whether Mr. Putin will allow him to be more than a figurehead .
The Zimbabwean opposition leader today called on the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , to stand down as a mediator and make way for a new initiative .
Morgan Tsvangirai has been pressing Mbeki to drop his approach of " quiet diplomacy " and put pressure on Robert Mugabe to give up power following his apparent loss in the March 29 presidential elections .
South Africa today hardened its position towards Mugabe when its government spokesman called for the prompt release of the election results .
" The most important thing is that the results need to be verified and released as soon as possible , " Themba Maseko said .
This , however , was too little , too late for Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , who claims to have won the presidential vote .
He told reporters he had asked the Zambian president , Levy Mwanawasa - who is also the chairman of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) - to launch a new initiative .
" President Mbeki needs to be relieved from his duty , " Tsvangirai told a news conference in Johannesburg , adding that Mugabe had " unleashed an orgy of violence against the people " after the election .
Mbeki has resisted calling Zimbabwe 's the post-election deadlock a crisis , and the US today criticised Africa for its lack of action on Zimbabwe .
" It is time for Africa to step up , " the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said .
" Where is the concern from the African Union and from Zimbabwe 's neighbours about what is going on in Zimbabwe ? "
Nevertheless , diplomats in Zimbabwe said they had been encouraged by tougher statements from South Africa and particularly from Jacob Zuma , the head of the ruling African National Congress party .
" There is a feeling that South Africa 's policy , which has been glacial , is finally changing , slowly , slowly , " a diplomat said .
Despite a tougher line from the South African government , Pretoria agreed to let a shipment of Chinese weapons go through its territory to Zimbabwe .
A Chinese ship , the An Yue Jiang , docked in Durban harbour after receiving approval from port authorities late yesterday .
The Beeld newspaper said the vessel was carrying nearly 3 m rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47 machine guns , about 3,500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1,500 rockets for grenade launchers .
South Africa said that as long as administrative papers were in order , it could not block shipments to its landlocked neighbour .
" We are not in a position to act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between two countries , " a government spokesman said , adding that there was no trade embargo against Zimbabwe .
China is one of Zimbabwe 's main trade partners and allies .
The EU today called for the immediate publication of the election results .
" Clearly , the publication of the results is needed , and it 's needed now , " a spokesman said .
" Further delays are unacceptable and would just be considered as stalling the democratic process . "
Foreign ministers of the G8 group of eight industrialised countries , including the UK , made similar calls as they met in Tokyo .
They stressed that violence and intimidation must have no place in the process .
The Zimbabwean justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , today accused Tsvangirai of treason .
" It is clear from the correspondence that Tsvangirai … is seeking regime change in Zimbabwe , and on the part of Tsvangirai this is treasonous , " Chinamasa , quoted in state - controlled media , said .
" There is no doubting the consequences for acting in a treasonous manner . "
Tsvangirai dismissed the claims as " outrageous " .

Imagine entire islands and vast building complexes eerily abandoned virtually in your own back yard .
This seemingly far - fetched scenario might be more real than you realize .
Complexes of more than 150 buildings and even small islands are located near the heart of major cities such as Houston and Washington DC .
You may know these 70 Wonders of the Ancient World but few consider how such ‘ wonders ’ become abandoned at all .
From insane asylums to military bases , hotels to theme parks and seminaries to silos here are 7 ( more ! ) abandoned wonders of America .
And see more in our collection of 100 +
Abandoned Buildings , Places and Property .
Abandoned Man-Made Military Island
Baltimore , Maryland has a number of interesting abandonments , but none so sizable and prominent as Fort Carroll .
Over a century old , this for was constructed in the middle of the 19th century though it never saw war .
In WWII it was briefly used as a firing range for the Army and a checkpoint for ships , but has been abandoned ever since .
Developers have failed to find uses for it and it has since become a habitat for numerous animals and the site of occasional urban explorations .
Abandoned Insane Asylum Complex
Long Island , New York is home to one of many now - abandoned institutions for the mentally ill .
The Kings Park Lunatic Asylum was established in 1885 and grew from a few wooden buildings into a vast complex of over 150 stone and brick structures housing over 9,000 patients .
Uses included a power plant , railroad spur and theater and more .
Currently only two of the buildings are still active , and there are no solid plans for redevelopment as just cleaning up the land would cost $ 80 million .
Abandoned Luxury Hotel Building
Mineral Wells ,
Texas is home to a grand old abandoned hotel with the first Olympic - size swimming pool in the United States .
Opened nearly 80 years ago , the 14 story Baker Hotel had visits from celebrities including Judy Garland , Clark Gable , Roy Rogers , The Three Stooges , Bonny and Clyde , Helen Keller and even Ronald Reagan before closing its doors .
As per a strange promise made to the public , the hotel ’s founder Earl Baker closed the hotel on his 70th birthday .
The hotel was auctioned and reopened under new ownership but in the late 1960s Baker had a fatal heart attack ( strangely enough ) in his own grand hotel ’s Baker Suite .
The hotel closed shortly thereafter for good , leaving behind only pictures of this wonder .
Abandoned Seminary and Finishing School
Washington , DC is known for many things , but relatively few know about the National Park Seminary which sits on its outskirts .
The first buildings on the campus were built in the late 1880s , starting and an inn and followed by bars and gambling .
More structures were added as the site became a finishing school for girls before the complex was converted to a military hospital during WWII .
Though they are currently still abandoned as shown in the photographs above , developers plan to turn these unique buildings into housing units in the near future .
Abandoned Amusement Park Complex
Houston , Texas was one of numerous locations where the Malibu Grand Prix entertainment company set up a theme park a few decades ago .
The complex included mini - golf , boat and go - kart racing as well as video games and other entertainment .
Two Grand Prix locations in close proximity were abandoned quite recently in part due to a scandal which erupted when three employees of were accused of murder ( two of whom received the death penalty ) and these photos do not do the locations justice .
Abandoned Cliff - Side Tourist Train
Provo Canyon , Utah features some amazing natural wonders including Bridal Veil Falls – a 600 foot waterfall .
The world ’s steepest aerial tram was built in the 1960s to connect visitors to the top of the falls but was destroyed over a decade ago in an avalanche .
With the closure of a local tourist train route , there was insufficient incentive to rebuild the tram which has been left to decay along with the eerily vacant tram buildings at both top and bottom as shown in the images above .
Abandoned Grain Silos and Structures
Minneapolis , Minnesota sits on the Mississippi River and was historically a center for mill work based on its banks .
Starting in the 1930s , however , Minneapolis lost its position as the wheat and wood milling center of the United States .
Many now - inactive mills sit idle despite occupying amazingly valuable property in the middle of the city .
Today , some of these mills have been turned into museums that can be visited while others are simply closed to all but the most intrepid urban explorers .

Blogs help spread the word about many subjects - such as unrest in Burma
The word was created by Jorn Barger to describe what he was doing with his pioneering Robot Wisdom web page .
The word was an abbreviation for the " logging " of interesting " web " sites that Mr Barger featured on his regularly updated journal .
A decade on and blog - watching firm Technorati reports it is tracking more than 70 million web logs .
Fast growth
While many people maintained regular journals or diaries before the word was coined , 1997 marked the point when they started to become a particular online pursuit .
For some time after Mr Barger coined the term , the numbers of people who could be said to be actually writing one was small .
Official numbers are hard to find but some estimate that the size of the blogosphere in late 1998 encompassed only 23 sites .
In 1999 the phenomenon took off as easy to use tools started to appear which made it much easier to write and maintain these sorts of websites .
Also in 1999 the word " blog " was coined as a shortened form of the original term .
Social sites such as MySpace have grown out of blogging
Many blogs , then as now , specialised in one subject and kept those interested up to date with new sites or up - to - date information about developments or breakthroughs in that field .
Many bloggers attach comments to the web links they post and many become well - known for their particular view of events or way with words .
Technorati , which keeps an eye on the blogosphere , estimates that there are now 120,000 new blogs being created every day .
Posts are being added to blogs at a rate of 17 per second - a total of 1.5 million per day , says the firm .
Not all blogs are now about what people find online .
Many people , artists , industry figures and professionals , use them to keep people up to date with their movements or thoughts .
The rising popularity of social network sites such as MySpace , Facebook and Bebo has arguably grown out of the blogging phenomenon .
MacroMan has a nice find , in a post aptly entitled Timmy Geithner , SIV Manager !?.
He points us to details of the " loan " being arranged by the Fed to support J.P. Morgan 's purchase of Bear Stearns .
It is not a loan at all .
The Fed and J.P. Morgan are creating an investment fund , to be managed by BlackRock .
The New York Fed will take , through a limited liability company formed for this purpose , control of a portfolio of assets valued at $ 30 billion as of March 14 , 2008 .
The assets will be pledged as security for $ 29 billion in term financing from the New York Fed at its primary credit rate .
JPMorgan
Chase will bear the first $ 1 billion of any losses associated with the portfolio and any realized gains will accrue to the New York Fed .
The money that the Fed and J.P. Morgan will provide is startup capital for the fund .
All of it is referred to as " loans " , but that 's facile .
Obviously , somebody will own these assets , bear the risk of carrying them , and realize any gains on the fund 's portfolio .
Specifically , J.P. Morgan is offering financing of $ 1 billion dollars that is loan - like in one sense — the maximum it will be repaid is its initial investment plus interest ( " the primary credit rate plus 475 450 basis points " , currently 7.25 7 percent ) — but equity - like in another sense — J.P. Morgan 's billion bears the first loss .
The Fed 's ownership stake will be $ 29 billion , ostensibly in the form of loans at " the primary credit rate , which currently is 2.5 percent and fluctuates with the discount rate " .
But , that is largely meaningless .
If the investment company 's assets turn out to be worth less than the principal and interest due the Fed , then the Fed 's loan wo n't be repaid .
If its assets appreciate , J.P. Morgan gets paid out , and the rest belongs to the Fed .
The only significance of the " interest rate " would be if , as the fund unwinds , asset values are high enough to make only a partial payment to J.P. Morgan .
In this case , the interest rate would help determine the split between the Fed and JPM .
Essentially , the Fed will own this investment fund and the Bear portfolio outright .
JPM 's position is basically a call option on the fund 's assets at $ 29B plus time - value whose value is capped at $ 1B plus time - value .
( JPM is long a call option and short the same option at a higher strike price . )
The Fed can deny all it wants that it is considering purchasing mortgage - backed securities .
That is the economic effect of this arrangement .
The Fed is buying up mortgage - backed securities and other unspecified assets at " the value of the portfolio as marked to market by Bear Stearns on March 14 , 2008 . "
But we already knew that .
I remain interested in precisely what sort of assets besides mortgage - backed securities this fund will hold .
I think that MacroMan used the term " SIV " advisedly .
The signal fact about SIVs is that , though they were formally off - balance sheet , limited - liability entities , in reality SIV sponsors bore downside risk beyond their legal obligations to the funds .
Reputationally , the banks who sponsored these " independent " entities could not just let them fail .
I have a simple question , one to which I think taxpayers deserve a simple answer .
Will this new " limited liability company " have contingent liabilities to any parties other than the Fed , J.P. Morgan , and BlackRock for ordinary management fees ?
Will its portfolio consist of any positions that would make the fund a counterparty , potentially with obligations to pay , not merely rights to receive , future cash ?
If the answer is no , a plain statement of that would be nice .
If the answer is yes , then do n't count on the " limited liability " of this investment company to provide taxpayers much protection .
It 's strikes me as implausible that a fund backed by the Fed would default on obligations to third parties .
We 've had central banks touted as lenders of last resort , market - makers of last resort , and fools of last resort .
We 'd better think very carefully before letting the Fed become a derivatives counterparty of last resort .
The very idea represents a subsidy to those we may not wish to subsidize .
There 's never been such a thing as a risk - free derivatives counterparty .
Every holder of a derivatives position has an implicit option to declare bankruptcy and not pay should circumstances move decisively against them .
Parties who retain an option to default while the other side of the contract is taken by someone who cannot are gaining something of value , something I 'm not sure we want to give .
Should counterparty risk move from a theoretical bogeyman to an actual crisis , the scale of sums at risk could be large , even on a portfolio whose current net value is only a few billion dollars , as those owing the Fed refuse to pay while Fed is obliged to cover " offsetting " positions from the public purse .
Update : The Fed has corrected the rate of interest to be paid on J.P. Morgan 's $ 1B stake .
It 'll be 4.5 % , not 4.75 % as originally reported .
( Hat tip Alea , WSJ ) Original values are struck and corrected in the text above .
The Ontario Court of Appeal yesterday approved the use of evidence obtained through flagrant police misconduct , saying any black eye caused to the justice system is outweighed by public interest in prosecuting a serious crime .
In a decision that even one of their fellow judges finds intolerable , a majority of the court upheld a trial judge 's decision to admit evidence of 35 kilos of cocaine found in Bradley Harrison 's rented SUV – despite the judge 's finding an OPP officer had no legal grounds to stop the vehicle , seriously infringed the Toronto man 's Charter rights and misled a court while trying to justify his actions .
The 2 - 1 ruling is the latest in a line of recent decisions in which the court has been accused of weakening Charter protections by refusing to exclude evidence obtained unlawfully .
In a case last fall involving a gun found in a backpack at Westview Centennial Secondary School , the court said throwing out reliable evidence because of Charter violations must be balanced against public concerns about escalating gun violence .
In their judgment yesterday , Associate Chief Justice Dennis O'Connor and Justice James MacPherson rejected defence lawyer Marie Henein 's contention that admitting the evidence obtained in violation of Harrison 's Charter rights would mean the judiciary is condoning police misconduct .
In weighing what 's worse – admitting tainted evidence or allowing serious crime to go unpunished – the majority concluded the public , at least in this case , is willing to put up with the significant Charter violations committed by OPP Constable Brian Bertoncello .
" We do not suggest that this is an easy case – far from it , " they wrote .
" This is a close call ... "
" We believe that , without minimizing the seriousness of the police officer 's conduct or in any way condoning it , it was open to the trial judge to find that reasonable members of the community could well conclude that the exclusion of 77 pounds of cocaine , with a street value of several millions of dollars , and the potential to cause serious grief and misery to many , would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than would its admission , " O'Connor and MacPherson said in their decision .
Bertoncello 's misconduct did n't result from any systemic problem , OPP policy or directions from a senior officer , which reduces the seriousness of the breaches of Harrison 's rights , they said .
But in a sharply worded dissent , Justice Eleanore Cronk accused the majority of hiding behind a " shield " of deference often accorded to trial judges by appeal courts .
Except , in this case , O'Connor and MacPherson are n't really yielding to Justice Norman Karam 's conclusions , Cronk charged .
In reality , they 're spinning or minimizing the trial judge 's findings , to make Bertoncello 's misconduct seem far less serious than it was , she suggested .
" I do not accept that police misconduct is reduced to constitutional insignificance , or that its effects are minor or de minimus , because only one police officer , acting on his own , knowingly violates a citizen 's constitutional rights , ' said Cronk .
" The protections afforded by the Charter are not limited to cases where systemic , institutional or premeditated police misconduct or state action is in issue , " she said .
Alan Young , a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School , said by assessing police conduct to see if Charter violations stem from any systemic failings , the court has now " set the bar so high " that exclusion of tainted evidence " will be a rarity . "
" There 's no question that this court and other courts are losing interest in the whole enterprise of excluding evidence , " he said .
Harrison , accompanied by a friend named Sean Friesen , was driving from Vancouver to Toronto when he was stopped near Kirkland Lake in October 2004 .
Bertoncello said he decided to pull over the SUV because it was missing a front licence plate , though he knew a front plate was n't required in Alberta , where it was licensed .
Bertoncello testified he went ahead and pulled the SUV over because the emergency lights on his cruiser were flashing and cars were behind him , he felt his " integrity " as a police officer was on the line .

Harrison could n't produce a driver 's licence , but gave Bertoncello his name and address .
Running them through a computer , the officer discovered Harrison 's licence was suspended , and arrested him .
Bertoncello then began a vehicle search , though he had no legal grounds for doing so .
He claimed he was looking for Harrison 's licence , but the court was told he did n't bother looking through clothes on the back seat .
He went directly for two boxes at the back , asking , the men if there were any drugs inside , again without grounds for doing so .
Bertoncello the officer testified he asked the question for " personal safety " reasons – he did n't want to get pricked by a needle or accidentally pull the trigger of a gun .
Inside the boxes were bricks of cocaine .

I know just as well as you do that we ’re approaching the fifth , not the sixth , anniversary of the moment when , on March 19 , 2003 , George W. Bush told the American people :
“ My fellow citizens , at this hour , American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger .
My fellow citizens , the dangers to our country and the world will be overcome .
We will pass through this time of peril and carry on the work of peace .
We will defend our freedom .
We will bring freedom to others and we will prevail . ”
At that moment , of course , the cruise missiles meant to “ decapitate ” Saddam Hussein ’s regime , but that killed only Iraqi civilians , were on their way to Baghdad .
I ’m perfectly aware that articles galore will be looking back on the five years since that day .
This is not one of them .
Think of this piece as in the spirit of Senator John McCain ’s recent request that Americans not obsess about the origins of the Iraq War , but look forward .
“ On the issue of my differences with Senator Obama on Iraq , ” he typically said , “ I want to make it very clear :
This is not about decisions that were made in the past .
This is about decisions that a president will have to make about the future in Iraq .
And a decision to unilaterally withdraw from Iraq will lead to chaos . ”
The future , not the past , is the mantra , which is why I ’m skipping next week ’s fifth anniversary of the Iraq War entirely .
Now , let me ask you a future - oriented question :
What ’s wrong with these sentences ?
On March 19 , 2009 , the date of the sixth anniversary of President Bush ’s invasion of Iraq , as surely as the sun rises in the East I ’ll be sitting here and we will still have many tens of thousands of troops , a string of major bases , and massive air power in that country .
In the intervening year , more Americans will have been wounded or killed ; many more Iraqis will have been wounded or killed ; more chaos and conflict will have ensued ; many more bombs will have been dropped and missiles launched ; many more suicide bombs will have gone off .
Iraq will still be a hell on Earth .
Prediction is , of course , a risky business .
Otherwise I ’d now be commuting via jet pack through spire cities ( as the futuristic articles of my youth so regularly predicted ) .
If you were to punch holes in the above sentences , you would certainly have to note that it ’s risky for a man of 63 years , or of any age , to suggest that he ’ll be sitting anywhere in a year ; riskier yet if you happen to live in those lands extending from North Africa to Central Asia that Bush administration officials used to call the “ arc of instability ”  essentially the oil heartlands of the planet  before they turned them into one .
It ’s always possible that I wo n’t be sitting here ( or anywhere else , for that matter ) on March 19 , 2009 .
Unfortunately , when it comes to the American position in Iraq , short of an act of God , the sixth anniversary of George Bush ’s war of choice is going to dawn much like the fifth one .
As a start , you can write off the next 10 months of our lives , right up to January 20 , 2009 , inauguration day for the next president .
We know that , last fall , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was considering bringing American troop strength in Iraq down to 100,000 by the end of George Bush ’s second term .
However , that was , as they evidently love to say in Washington , just a “ best case scenario . ”
Since then , the administration has signaled an end - of - July drawdown “ pause ” of unknown duration after American troop strength in Iraq , now at 157,000 , hits about 142,000 .
The President is clearly dragging his feet on removing even modest numbers of American troops .
As he leaves office , it seems likely that there will be at least 130,000 U.S. troops in the country , about the same number as there were before , in February 2007 , the President ’s surge strategy kicked in .
In addition , in the past year , U.S. air power has “ surged ” in Iraq  and continues to do so  while U.S. mega - bases in that country continue to be built up .
As far as we know , there are no plans to reverse either of these developments by January 20 , 2009 .
No presidential candidate is even discussing them .
Any official “ best case ” scenario for drawdowns or withdrawals assumes , by the way , that the version of Iraq created during the surge months  at best , an unstable combination of Sunni , Shia , Kurdish , and American plans and desires  remains in place and that Iraqi carnage stays off the front pages of American papers .
This is anything but a given , as British journalist Patrick Cockburn reported recently in a piece headlined , “ Why Iraq Could Blow Up in John McCain ’s Face . ”
Indeed it could .
Best Case Scenarios
If Senator McCain were elected president , the American position in Iraq on March 19 , 2009 will certainly be as described above  and , if he has anything to say about it , for many anniversaries thereafter .
But , when it comes to the sixth anniversary of the Iraq War , the truth is that it probably does n’t matter much who is elected president in November .
Take Hillary Clinton , she ’s said that she ’ll task the Joint Chiefs , the new Secretary of Defense , and her National Security Council with having a plan for ( partial ) withdrawal in place within 60 days of coming into office .
Since inauguration day is January 20th , that means ?
March 21st or two days after the sixth anniversary ; by which time , of course , nothing would have changed substantially .
Barack Obama has promised to remove U.S. “ combat ” troops at a one - to - two - brigades - a - month pace over a 16 month period .
So it ’s possible that troop levels could drop marginally before March 19 , 2009 in an Obama presidency , but again there is no reason to believe that anything essential would have happened to change that “ anniversary . ”
In addition , the stated plans of both Democratic candidates , vague and limited as they may be , might not turn out to be their actual plans .
Note the recent comments of Obama foreign policy advisor Samantha Powers , who resigned after calling Clinton a “ monster ” in an interview with the Scotsman during a book tour .
Since name - calling will always trump substantive policy matters in American politics , less noted were her comments in an interview with the BBC on her candidate ’s Iraq withdrawal policy .
“ He will , of course , not rely on some plan that he ’s crafted as a presidential candidate or a U.S. Senator , ” Powers said and then she referred to Obama ’s plan as nothing more than a  you guessed it  “ best - case scenario . ”
Similarly , a Clinton sometime - advisor on military matters , retired General Jack Keane , also one of the authors of President Bush ’s surge strategy , told the New York Sun that , in the Oval Office , “ he is convinced [ Hillary Clinton ] would hold off on authorizing a large - scale immediate withdrawal of American soldiers from Iraq . ”
And Clinton herself , though less directly , has certainly hinted at a similar willingness to reconsider her policy promises in the light of an Oval Office morning .
So let ’s face it , barring an Iraqi surprise , the next year in that country may be nothing but a wash ( and the lubricant , as in past years , is likely to be blood ) .
It will be  best case scenario  a holding action on the road to nowhere , another woefully lost year in what has now become something like a ghost country .
The Children of War
To put this in more human terms : Imagine that a child born on March 19 , 2003 , just as Baghdad was being shock - and - awed , will be of an age to enter first grade when the sixth anniversary of George Bush ’s war hits .
He or she will have gone from babbling to talking , crawling to walking , and will by then possibly be beginning to read and write .
Of course , an Iraqi child born on that day , who managed to live to see his or her sixth birthday , might be among the two million - plus Iraqis in exile in Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East , or among the millions of internal refugees driven from their homes in recent years and not in school at all .
( Similarly , a child born on October 7 , 2001 , when the President first dispatched American bombers to strike Afghanistan , will be in second grade in March 2009 ; of course , seven - and - a - half years after being “ liberated , ” an Afghan child , especially one now living in the southern part of that failed narco - state , is unlikely to be in school at all .
As with Iraq , we could take some educated guesses about the situation in Afghanistan a year from now and they would be grim beyond words . )
For those children , the real inheritors of the Bush war era that is not yet faintly over , the Iraq War has essentially been the equivalent of an open - ended prison sentence with little hope of parole ; for some Americans and many Iraqis , including children , it is a death sentence without hope of pardon .
All this for a country which , even by the standards of the Bush administration , never presented the slightest national security threat to the United States of America .
Only this week , an “ exhaustive , ” Pentagon - sponsored study of 600,000 captured Iraqi documents confirmed , yet again , that there were no operational links whatsoever between Saddam Hussein ’s regime and al - Qaeda .
With those children in mind , here ’s what ’s so depressing :
In mainstream Washington , hardly anyone has taken a step outside the box of conventional , inside - the - Beltway thinking about Iraq , which is why it ’s possible to imagine March 19 , 2009 with some confidence .
For them , the Washington consensus , such as it is , is the only acceptable one and the disagreements within it , the only ones worth having .
And here are its eight fundamentals :
* A belief that effective U.S. power must invariably be based on the threat of , or use of , dominant force , and so must centrally involve the U.S. military .
* A belief that all answers of any value are to be found in Washington among the serried ranks of officials , advisors , former officials , pundits , think - tank operators , and other inside - the - Beltway movers and shakers , who have been tested over the years and found never to have a surprise in them .
Most of them are notable mainly for having been wrong so often .
This is called “ experience . ”
* A belief that the critics of Washington policy outside Washington and its consensus are , at best , gadflies , never worth seriously consulting on anything .
* A belief that the American people , though endlessly praised in political campaigns , are know - nothings who could n’t think their way out of a proverbial paper bag when it comes to the supposedly arcane science of foreign policy , and so would certainly not be worth consulting on “ national security ” matters or issues involving the sacred “ national interest , ” which is , in any case , the property of Washington .
Like Iraqis and Afghans , the American people need good ( or even not so good ) shepherds in the national capital to answer that middle - of - the - night ringing phone and rescue them from impending harm .
( The very foolishness of Americans can be measured by opinion polls which indicated that a majority of them had decided by 2005 that all American troops should be brought home from Iraq at a reasonable speed and that the U.S. should not have permanent military bases in that country . )
* A belief that no other countries ( or individuals elsewhere ) have anything significant or original to offer when it comes to solving problems like the situation in Iraq ( unless , of course , they agree with us ) .
They are to be ignored , insists the Bush administration , or , say leading Democrats , “ talked to ” and essentially corralled into signing onto , and carrying out , the solutions we consider reasonable .
* A belief that local peoples are incapable of solving their own problems without the intercession of , or the guiding hand ( or Hellfire missile ) of , Washington , which means , of course , of the U.S. military .
* A belief that the United States  whatever the problem  must be an essential part of the solution , not part of the problem itself .
* And finally , a belief ( though no one would ever say this ) that the lives of those children of George Bush ’s wars of choice , already of an age to be given their first lessons in global “ realism , ” do n’t truly matter , not when the Great Game of geopolitics and energy is at stake .
Of course , the most recent Washington solution , involving the endless military occupation ( by whatever name ) of alien lands , can “ solve ” nothing .
The possibilities of genuine improvement in Iraq or Afghanistan under the ministrations of the U.S. military are probably nil .
And yet , because the only solutions entertained are variations of the above , little better lurks in our future at this moment .
Who would want to speculate on just how old those children of March 19 , 2003 will actually be before the Iraq War is ended ?
So here ’s my next question :
What ’s wrong with this sentence ?
On March 19 , 2010 , the date of the seventh anniversary of President Bush ’s invasion of Iraq , as surely as the sun rises in the East I ’ll be sitting here and we will still have …

We would like to thank Microsoft Windows Mobile for sponsoring mobile posting on Boing Boing .
In the coming weeks , we 'll be using the system to post audio , images , text , and video .
Here 's a little more information about the sponsorships and ads on Boing Boing :
— Boing Boing 's been running ads for years .
It 's a little surprising
that so many readers are only just now realizing it .
— This kind of sponsorship — in the immediate case , Microsoft
Windows Mobile — is structurally no different from sponsorships and
ads Boing Boing 's done in the past .
— In fact , Hewlett - Packard sponsored a series of audio posts just
last year , no one made a fuss about them , and they certainly did n't
affect what appears in Boing Boing ( aside from allowing some of it to
be an audio feed ) .
— In further fact , this kind of advertising and sponsorship has also
been going on for some time now in many other major weblogs .
We
repeat : it 's a little surprising that so many readers are only just
now realizing it .
— The presence of major advertisers and major advertising campaigns on high - traffic weblogs is not evidence of a conspiracy to somehow buy off the
online audience .
Those high - end ad campaigns exist because the weblog - reading audience is now large enough to compete with old - media
advertising venues like print magazines .
— Finally , and most importantly , no advertising or sponsorship has
ever had any effect on Boing Boing 's content or editorial policies ,
nor will it influence them in the future .
Our editorial content is

I do n't know about you , but any trailer that starts with the greatest gadget genius of all time having a morning whisky on the rocks , while traveling through the desert in a Humvee to the beat of AC / DC's Back In Black , says to me : BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER .
Which is precisely what you can see in the new Iron Man full trailer , along with everything you would expect Robert Downey Jr's perfect Tony Stark to do , from tinkering with his armor while mixing cocktails to playing with a multitouch holographic display to crashing through his amazing mansion on the edge of a cliff ( Bruce Wayne is a wimp ) to kissing the redheaded goddess that is Gwyneth Paltrow playing Virginia " Pepper " Potts , his personal assistant .
Best quotes ever and poll , after the jump .
Tony Stark ( to army driver ) : " Good God , you are a woman . "
Tony Stark : " Yeah .
I can fly . "
Computer : " Sir , the upgrade is complete " ( talking about the new armor )
Tony Stark : " Tell you what .
Put a little hot rod red in there . "
Tony Stark ( to Virginia Potts , while fitting his armor ) : " Let 's face it , this is not the worst thing you caught me doing . "

With Gigantic Melancholies and Gigantic Mirth
" Dog ! " cries Conan , as he advances on a lion .
There you have my favorite moment from Conan the videogame , released by Nihilistic Software for the PlayStation3 and Xbox 360 a few months ago .
I got a good laugh out of this doubly absurd outburst , as I 'm perverse enough to enjoy unintentionally funny , second - rate productions .
But perversities of this kind always disappoint a little .
Laughing at Nihilistic 's sloppy production , I have that familiar sinking feeling : " This is my life !
Hit with another stupid game !
Mirth and melancholy ! "
The stupidity of taunting a cat as you would a man is emblematic of the game 's stupidity in general , and the failings of Conan say much about the struggles of all videogames .
Nihilistic does n't understand Conan 's appeal .
They see him as an agglomeration of Conanisms , which they strew haphazardly through their game .
Conan hacks people up .
He guzzles grog and smashes stuff .
Bare breasts orbit him .
And , yes , he calls his opponents " dog " a lot .
All of these things appear in the various Conan media , but they alone have not kept the character popular for three - quarters of a century .
Just about all game developers take their inspiration from B - list entertainment , the rank into which Conan falls .
Amazingly , none of them seems to know why audiences love - not just like - Aliens or Star Wars or The X - Men . Developers tear off the skin of their source material but leave the flesh intact .
What makes B - grade entertainment so enjoyable does n't amount to a collection of explosions , semi-naked women and monsters rendered in eye - rending detail .
No , a searching intelligence draws all these elements together , making them both fun and compelling .
Behind every great pulp character stands a frustrated artist who tells us something important about the world , but has only swords and sorcery or lasers and lingerie at his disposal to do it .
Conan is the quintessential B - list hero : repulsively simple at first glance , but actually complicated and conflicted .
Videogames are a B - list oddity with unique difficulties .
Conan the game exemplifies these difficulties and shows how they may be resolved .
Conan And His Dog-Brothers
Nihilistic - and publisher THQ - marketed their Conan game as a return to the barbarian 's roots .
" The character we 're using in this game is the Robert E. Howard Conan , " said Nihilistic CEO and Conan Project Director , Robert Heubner , in a " making - of " video .
What 's so great about Conan as he originally appeared ?
What 's the cachet ?
Howard invented Conan in the golden age of pulp fiction .
The pulp magazines of the Great Depression ( Conan first appeared in Weird Tales in 1932 ) sold millions of copies every month .
They featured lowbrow entertainment : adventure stories , mainly , with salacious overtones .
In that day , pulp fiction and comic books provided decent return on investment .
Even though they cost very little , the books sold well enough to turn a profit .
Financial mediocrity , as well as an overall dearth of quality , distinguished the B - listers from their highbrow brethren , but so did their subject matter .
Barbarians ?
Spaceships ?
Super heroes ?
The stuff of the unwashed masses , and Conan was their champion .
( Special Report ) -
The biofuel industry , pushed by the Bush Administration as an environmentally friendly alternative has come under a lot of c - r - i - t - i - c - i-s -m lately .
But these criticisms have mostly centered on biofuels that use corn , soybeans , or sugar cane as sources .
What about other sources of biofuels ?
Using tires , agricultural waste , or switchgrass has been widely discussed , but a new source is entering the conversation : algae .
How efficient is algae biofuel ?
Algae energy is low cost / high yield .
Algae produces 30 times more energy per acre than other sources of biofuels like soybeans [ 1 ] .
The reason ?
Algae has a simple cellular structure , a lipid - rich composition and a rapid reproduction rate .
Also , algae can grow in salt water and other harsh conditions , while corn or soybean ethanol requires fertile land and fresh water ( 100 times the amount of fresh water algae needs ) .
Algae , like corn and soybeans , is photosynthetic , meaning it absorbs carbon dioxide .
And because algae can survive such harsh conditions , some have proposed putting the stuff in smokestacks to absorb released CO2 .
One other place algae could be grown is in sewage ponds ; in fact , it ’s already being done in New Zealand .
Another added bonus : if you replaced all of the diesel in the United States with soy biodiesel , it would take half the land mass of the United States .
In contrast , if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum used in the United States , it would only require an area about the size of Maryland . [ 2 ]
What ’s the catch ?
Yes , this is definitely not a catch free technology .
There are two strong criticisms of “ oilgae ” ( as it is sometimes called ) :
Although biofuels from algae grown in smokestacks reduce emissions at the factory , the CO2 is just emitted when it is burned in an automobile .
There is still a net benefit , as carbon dioxide is only emitted once , instead of twice .
The second problem is potentially more serious .
Ideally , algae biodiesel would be used as a transition technology ; the problem is , what ’s the incentive to develop solar or wind technology when current power plants can be cleaner ( but not completely clean ) for far less ?
Conclusion
Oilgae is an incredibly efficient biodiesel .
Nonetheless , there are serious drawbacks , and it would be harmful to overestimate the greenness of this up and coming technology .

Sewing Pin : The New Terrorist Threat
The world is at war with Terror .
The fear of suicide bombers and being kidnapped to nuclear weapons , we know there are dangers our there lurking .
The Nanboku subway in Sapporo , Japan , recently experienced that fear when a man reported finding a 5 cm sewing pin to officials early one morning .
Immediately the train was evacuated .
After an intense search found no additional sewing pins or threats , the trains were opened once more and things returned to normal .
No casualties were reported and no suspect was captured .

THE AERIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PROPAGANDA TO THE ENEMY :
A Report by Captain P. Chalmers Mitchell
M.I.7 b( 4 ) , 23rd February 1918
As this mode of distribution takes place within the Army Zone , it is a military operation and the responsible agent has been M.I.7.B. , a sub-section of the Directorate of Military Intelligence , acting in co-operation with the Headquarters Staffs and the various Branches and Departments in London which are engaged in the preparation of propagandist literature or in the consideration of inventions useful at the fronts .
1. METHODS
AEROPLANE .
From the mechanical point of view , the use of aeroplanes is by far the most satisfactory mode of distribution .
Relatively large loads of printed matter can be carried swiftly and distributed in bundles , packets , or single sheets with a high degree of accuracy and in a great range of weather conditions .
For some time this method was employed and in the end of 1916 and the beginning of 1917 arrangements were made for a great increase in the output and distribution of propaganda .
Early in 1917 , however , four captured English airmen were court - martialled in Germany for the dissemination of inflammatory literature , and although these were acquitted on a technical point of evidence , German Headquarters intimated through diplomatic channels , that the dissemination of inflammatory literature by airmen would be dealt with as an offence against the laws of war .
For sometime it was believed possible to discriminate between literature which might be regarded as inflammatory and , literature , to which this objection could not be taken .
With the exception of matter relating to the good treatment of Prisoners of War the duty of making the distinction was assigned to the War Office by G.H .Q. , France , and accordingly M.I.7.B. submitted to careful censorship all propagandist matter prepared here for distribution , or offered by other agencies , and took care to distribute by aeroplane nothing that contained any reference to the Enemy Army or its Officers .
In actual practise , however , it was difficult to draw a line , and aeroplane propaganda tended to become so colourless that its efficacy was doubtful .
Moreover , it was ascertained in conference with G.H.Q. , France that it was probable that the Germans in their efforts to suppress the distribution of Allied propaganda would not be punctilious in bringing charges against captured airmen .
The correctness of this opinion was made clear in December 1917 when two captured British airmen were sentenced to ten years penal servitude for the distribution of duplicates of letters written by German prisoners of war or captured in their possession .
It was accordingly decided that the method of distribution by aeroplanes must be abandoned .
2. BALLOONS
( a) FABRIC BALLOONS .
The question of the use of these was considered .
A type manufactured by Anderson of Bristol , costing £ 9.15 each , and carrying a load of 22 lbs. of propaganda was investigated .
It was necessary that the load should be liberated by a time fuse at regular intervals .
These balloons would carry a long distance but were very expensive for their load , and the total output was limited especially as many were required for other military purposes .
In connection with this investigation Cairo was consulted as to the possibility of using balloons for the distribution of propaganda in the Near East , Asia Minor and Mesopotamia , but replied that the weather conditions there were unsuitable for the balloon method .
( b) PAPER BALLOONS .
In October 1917 the Air Inventions Board was consulted with regard to the use of paper balloons and other modes of aerial distribution .
It was ascertained that the Munitions Inventions had the matter under consideration and the request was made that the Munitions Inventions should communicate with the War Office as soon as their experiments had led to some practical issue .
On account of pressure of work there was some delay , but early in February 1918 the Munitions Inventions informed the War Office that they now had some paper balloons and a new form of release ready for trial at the Front .
This was at once reported to G.H.Q. , France who had been sending over samples of German paper balloons and pressing for a supply .
It was arranged that samples of paper balloons should be sent out at once with an expert from the Munitions Inventions Board and an officer of M.I.7.B .
In the meantime , two officers from M.I.7.B. conferred with the Munitions Inventions , supplied samples of the German balloons and explained the requirements with regard to load and range of distribution .
They also visited the experimental ground at Imbercourt and saw the process of inflation , charging with propaganda and liberation of balloons and discussed the question of cost , and supply .
At the present time the Munitions Inventions have carried beyond the experimental stage two types of balloons made of doped paper , respectively of 16 and 20 feet diameter and carrying loads of one and two pounds .
They can be inflated with hydrogen or with gas , the former giving a lifting capacity of more than one and a half times that given by the latter , but not being so suitable for long distances as it diffuses through the doped paper more rapidly than does coal gas .
The process of inflation and liberation is extremely simple but it is advisable that it should he carried out in a screened enclosure .
The arrangement actually used was a square canvas enclosure about 14 feet high .
The release consists of an aluminium attachment with a spring clip passing through a hole punched in the propaganda sheets .
The spring is kept shut by a thin copper wire which passes into a celluloid cup .
Just before liberation , nitric acid is poured into the cup , and after an interval determined by the strength of the acid , the wire is eaten through , the spring is released and the propaganda released .
Experiments are in progress with larger types of paper balloons carrying heavier loads , four and eight pounds being - aimed at .
It is expected that these types will have passed the experimental stage in a few weeks .
There is no difficulty about the supply of these balloons in quantity and the cost is very little , running up to about fifty shillings including the release , for the larger types .
Experiments are also being made with a much larger balloon of oiled silk which is expected to cost not more than fifty shillings and to carry a load up to 25 lbs .
The latter type would be capable of going long journeys , up to hundreds of miles .
The Munitions Inventions hope to replace the present form of release by a cheap clockwork device which would liberate the propaganda continuously and so prevent the shocks given by the sudden release of relatively large proportions of the total load .
( c ) FIRE BALLOONS .
Professor Boys , F.R.S. , who has been advising the Munitions Inventions had great hopes of a device by which the actual fabric of the balloon should consist of propaganda sheets , separated by bands of touch - paper .
Such balloons would have no additional load to carry , and would be inflated and sent up by hot air .
On reaching their maximum height , the flame would set fire to the touch - paper and thus automatically separate and scatter the sheets .
Hitherto the device has not succeeded , as the dampness of the air has spoiled the touch - paper , but the Professor hopes to overcome this difficulty .
(3) KITE METHOD .
The Air Inventions Board undertook for the War Office the carrying out of experiments with distribution of propaganda from kites .
Box kites were sent up to varying heights ranging up to nearly two miles .
A folding winged carrier , improved from a device manufactured by Messrs .
Gamage , was then loaded with propaganda and sent up the wire until on reaching a stop on the wire fixed near the kite , it discharged its load and then automatically came down for another charge .
In actual experiments conducted in the presence of Officers of M.I.7.B. a load of ten pounds was sent up and successfully discharged .
The carrier took about ten minutes to ascend and a less time to return .
In a very light wind and from a height of under a mile a measured range of ten miles distribution from the liberation point was attained and the lateral scattering was very good .
G.H.Q. , France took much interest in these experiments and arrangements were made to conduct them on a larger scale and by night as well as by day .
There is no doubt as to the efficacy and economy of this method up to a range of at least twenty miles in a good wind , but the presence of the wire was regarded as dangerous to aeroplanes and the method was abandoned .
(4) MINOR METHODS .
The utility of various forms of rockets and mortar shells was investigated , but it was found that these were useful only for very short ranges , and that the discharges would have attracted unwelcome attention from the enemy .
(5) SUMMARY OF METHODS .
The use of paper balloons is at present the most practical method and it is estimated that six tons of propaganda could be liberated by this method at a cost of from £ 3,000 to £ 6,000 , the cost decreasing with the size of the units employed .
It is to be noted , however , that distribution by balloons must always be local and capricious ,
It is believed that if it were found practicable to employ aeroplanes , flying at at least ten thousand feet high and from six to eight miles behind the lines , a very extensive and complete wind - carried distribution could be attained .
(6) EFFECT OF AERIAL PROPAGANDA .
The various steps taken by the Germans to stop our distribution , such as the court - martialling of captured airmen and the diplomatic
Note are good evidence that our efforts are feared .
A German Army Order has been captured instructing all propaganda leaflets to be handed at once to superior officers .
(7) NATURE OF OUR PROPAGANDA .
M.I.7.B made preparations for a very large and continuous supply of propagandist matter for aerial distribution , but the impediments that have arisen in the course of the last year to the actual distribution have reduced the output far below that for which arrangements were made .
Actual Output from January 1st to December 31st , 1917
Reproductions of captured letters and post cards : 594,000 of 83 letters and 7 postcards .
( These letters and postcards have been selected from actual documents sent by G.H.Q. , France and the Postal censors in London ) .
Photo Postcards of German Prisoners of War in England : 90,000 of 17 Postcards .
Leaflets , Surrender Notices , etc : 388,200 .
( Material supplied by G.H.Q. , France or by M.I.7.B ) .
Prisoner of War Photo - Books : Large edition - 85,000 .
Miniature edition - 25,000 .
Photo Sheets - 20,000 .
( These have been supplied by Wellington House ) .
Le Courrier de l’ Air : 250,000 copies of 50 weekly issues .
( This is a news sheet written by officers of M.I.7.B and translated into French for distribution in Belgium and in occupied France ) .
War Pictorial and Diary of the War ( in German ) : 20,000 .
( These are prepared and supplied by Wellington House ) Large Books and Pamphlets : 9,160 .
( These have been supplied by Wellington House ) .
Pamphlets prepared by M.I.7.B for Balloon distribution : 12,500 .
A sub-section of M.I.7.B in charge of an officer who had previously spent a year in studying the Library of German Propaganda in the possession of M.I.7.B , is occupied with the selection of articles from all sources suitable for aerial distribution with the preparation of actual articles , and with the selection of extracts from the German Press that would be useful to distribute .
A large amount of material of this kind is at present in type and awaiting the final selection of a mode of distribution .
As examples there may be mentioned the Prime Minister ’s Speech and the Neukolln Memorial .
It was ascertained that the German newspapers omitted large portions of the Prime Minister ’s speech .
M.I.7.B had it translated in full with the omitted passages underlined and a note calling attention to this .
The Neukolln memorial was found in a suppressed edition of the Vowarts and was reprinted at length .
(8) CO - OPERATION WITH THE FRENCH AT G.H.Q. Copies of the French propagandist efforts are received by M.I.7.B and those that seem suitable are utilised , but to secure greater unity of action , it is proposed to appoint a propaganda officer one of whose duties will be to keep in constant touch with the French efforts and modes of distribution .
(9 ) AERIAL PROPAGANDA IN THE EAST .
There is continuous co-operation between M.I.7.B and G.H.Q. , Cairo which acts a centre for the East , M.I.7.
B keeps them acquainted with the results of experiments as to modes of distribution , supplies propagandist material , and receives examples of all the material prepared there .
A suggestion has recently been put forward that extensive subversive propaganda should be conducted by the use of specially trained Bulgarian deserters .
This proposal has been communicated at length to Salonica for their observations .
( 10 ) GERMAN PROPAGANDA .
The Germans use paper balloons in large quantities .
Samples of the balloons they employ have been obtained by G.H.Q. , France and submitted to the Munitions Inventions by M.I.7.B .
It can not be said that there is any evidence as to the efficacy of German propaganda amongst the British troops .
Samples of it are sent over from G.H.Q. , France and examined by M.I.7.B .
They consist of flysheets in bad English announcing German successes on other fronts , pictures of the happy fate of prisoners of war in Germany , boasts of the results of the U - boat campaign and copies of the Continental Times .
Propaganda specially destined for the French is more effective .
The chief effort is the Gazette des Ardennes , a weekly newspaper written in French and with occasionally an illustrated supplement .
It is distributed both by aeroplane and by balloon .
It is cleverly conducted , containing much inflammatory political matter , ex parte statements as to the progress of the war , attacks on the English , news of individual French prisoners , lists of French and Belgians alleged to have been killed by the action of Allied Airmen .
From a propagandist point of view , it is much more unscrupulous and probably more effective than our Courrier , but this is due to the fact that a special effort has been made to exclude " nflammatory " matter from the Courrier .
Were a suitable method of distribution in operation , the Courrier could very easily be greatly strengthened from the propagandist point of view .
It is of interest , however , to note , that even in its present mild form it is of comfort to the Belgians .
A letter written from Brussels in May 1917 contains the remark “ Shall I tell you that the rare appearance of an Allied Airman sufficed to gladden us for several days , such simple visits showing the population that the Belgians outside do not forget those at home .
What would it be if periodically they came to give us precise , certain , authentic news " .
That at least the Courrier has dome for those parts of Belgium it reaches .
Consumers spend over three hours every day on their mobile devices .

Are you thinking about expanding your company ’s digital reach with mobile advertising ?
Smart move !
More businesses are now taking their advertising online to expand their reach .
Businesses who are n’t advertising online , however , are losing their competitive edge .
Do n’t let competitors snag all your customers !
Instead , keep reading for our comprehensive guide on mobile advertising .
With this guide , we ’ll cover everything you need to know as you develop your mobile strategy .
Let ’s dive in !
What Is Mobile Advertising
Mobile advertising involves displaying ads on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets that are using a wireless connection .
Mobile ads can range from SMS text ads to the banners you see on your favorite mobile websites .
They even appear in apps and games .
Today , many businesses are using platforms such as Google and Facebook to create their ads .
Mobile advertising allows these companies to target customers based on their location , demographics , and even their browsing history .
Since mobile ads appear on smaller screens , it ’s not always effective to duplicate the same ads used for print advertising .
Rather , these ads require concise messaging .
Otherwise , you ’re missing out on an opportunity to reach potential customers .
When done correctly , mobile advertising can create a seamless experience between a customer ’s phone and your store .
Different Types of Mobile Advertising
Mobile advertising used to only involve banner ads .
Now , there are many different types of mobile advertising formats you can choose from to engage customers !
Here are a few to get you started .
Native Ads
Native mobile ads appear within an app ’s natural flow .
Using a native app will allow you to avoid disrupting the user ’s experience .
These ads also have the same overall appearance as the main app , so they look natural .
In order to create the most effective native ads , you ’ll need to include your brand name and logo .
You ’ll also need an eye - catching headline , description , and your website ’s URL .
These are the ads you ’ll often see in apps like Facebook and Instagram .
You can also use mobile geofencing so these ads appear when customers are in close proximity to your store .
Using geofencing can help you attract mobile and foot traffic , so you can boost sales .
Full - Screen Ads
Instead of a tiny mobile ad , full - screen ads stretch to fill a phone ’s screen .
These ads are an effective way for companies to demand attention .
Otherwise , users might scroll right past your ad .
These ads are often used during transition points within an app .
For example , users might see this ad when they ’re transitioning to a new level in a game .
While these ads disrupt the user ’s experience , they also dominate screen space .
It ’s important to remain wary about using full - screen ads .
Since they ’re disruptive , they can sometimes can a negative user experience .
Gamified Ads
Make your mobile ads a little more exciting .
With gamified ads , consumers can interact with your ads to give products a test drive .
For example , many mobile apps now use gamified ads , allowing users to play a demo of their games .
Gamified ads allow companies to interact with their customers .
In addition to catching the user ’s attention , you can also gain more qualified leads .
As you enhance customer engagement , you ’re also boosting conversions and improving your ROI .
Gamified mobile advertising is an effective strategy for driving interest online .
Video Ads
Video ads are a great way to grab someone ’s attention , tell a story , and immerse customers in your brand .
Video content delivers rich , detailed visuals that are easy for consumers to digest .
As a result , they can increase brand awareness and help you attract more leads .
Benefits of Mobile Advertising
Mobile advertising grew from $ 7 billion in 2013 to $ 70 billion in 2018 !
As more companies invest in mobile advertising , they ’re also reaping these benefits ( and more ) !
Accessibility
While we do n’t sit in front of a computer all day , we almost always have our phones on us .
Mobile advertising allows companies to reach potential customers whenever , wherever they are .
Instead of hoping someone looks up in time to see your billboard , you can improve brand awareness with mobile ads .
These ads can also generate more excitement and engagement .
Since these ads link to your website , you can also encourage viewers to complete a sale within seconds after seeing your ad .
With traditional advertising methods , such as flyers , you lack this convenience .
Time Relevance
One of the major benefits of advertising on mobile devices is timing .
You can set mobile ads to appear when a consumer searches for a specific product or service .
At this point , they ’re already thinking about making a purchase .
When your ad appears , it ’s relevant to the buyer ’s needs .
Timing your ads to appear when the timing is right for your consumers can increase sales .
You can also create ads with time - sensitive language .
If you ’re hosting a sale this weekend , you can advertise the event easily .
You can also use the fear of missing out ( FOMO ) and urgency to drive people to make a purchase before the sale ends .
Cost Efficiency
Other advertising channels such as TV or radio ads are n’t always cost - effective .
You can spend thousands without experiencing your desired return on investment .
Mobile advertising , on the other hand , is ideal for companies with a tight budget .
You can set how much you want to spend , and make changes on the fly .
Instead of wasting money , you can improve your ROI .
Personalization
Using mobile advertising , you can tailor messages for your customers , creating a sense of intimacy .
Instead of a single , blanket message , you can even create different ads for different buyers .
That way , you can connect with your customers and improve customer loyalty .

Chandler , the uber - PIM project from the Open Source Applications Foundation , has had a major life event .
Many people are calling it the end of the project , and it may well be .
People are still working on it , but the funding is cut , and the future is very very unclear .
This is too bad , it was an ambitious and idealistic project , perhaps too much so .
I do n’t really know what was going on over there .
I have n’t read Dreaming in Code , I do n’t read the mailing lists , I have n’t even looked at their software in years .
Remarkably , Carlos Perez blames it on Python .
His piece is really something , because he starts by admitting that he suspected from the beginning that Python was n’t up to the task , and now he ’s pretty sure his suspicions have been confirmed .
Except that he does n’t do any analysis of what actually went wrong at Chandler .
He repeats his biases against dynamic languages , and concludes that they are to blame .
He comes to this conclusion even as he points out how strange it is that Python is only used in the client , and the server is Java !
The consensus seems to be , and it seems right , that the problems with Chandler were :
Organization : too many heavy - hitters heading in their own directions .
See the previous point about Python at the client and Java at the server .
Lack of focused target : replacing people ’s email infrastructure , while at the same time re-thinking how those activities are accomplished is a huge challenge .
Carlos ’ viewpoint will probably perservere .
Chandler was in some ways seen as a poster child for Python , and its demise I ’m sure will cause at least a minor meme along the lines of , “ We ca n’t use Python , look what happened to Chandler . ”
This is too bad .
I think the choice of language matters to a project , but not nearly as much as we techies often think .
So many other things matter a great deal more .
Carlos points to Eclipse as an example of what can be accomplished with Java .
Eclipse is an amazing achievement , but it is n’t Java that did it .
There ’s a huge amount of effort that goes into the focus and support that makes Eclipse what it is .
As an example , have you ever read their release notes ?
These are amazing !
No project in the history of the world has had such thorough , helpful , and well - crafted release notes .
That ’s got nothing to do with Java , and everything to do with the care and work that the Eclipse organization puts into producing and supporting their software .
So here ’s to Chandler , a ( nearly ) departed friend .
I hope that it continues in some meaningful form .
Here ’s to good craftsmen ( and their kibbitzers ) not blaming their tools .
Here ’s to using your language of choice as just one tool in your tool set .

Zebras are one of the few members of the Equidae family that have n't been fully domesticated .
Zebras belong to the genus Equus , and as such they can crossbreed with other Equus species .
The resulting hybrid is almost always sterile .
The three species of zebras have between 44 and 62 chromosomes , donkeys have 62 , and horses have 64 .
In case you do n't recall what they look like , here are typical zebras .
A crossbred zebra is known as a zebroid or zebra mule .
Zebroids were originally bred as pack animals in Africa for practical reasons .
They are more resistant to certain diseases , such as sleeping sickness , than horses or donkeys .
Zebroids for domestic use are bred for the look of a zebra , tempered by the domesticated nature of a horse or donkey .
The crossbreed is often shaped like the non-zebra parent , which makes finding a proper saddle simpler than trying to ride a zebra .
Zebra stripes tend to show up on at least part of the hybrid 's body .
Zony
A zony is a cross between a zebra and a pony .
This zony 's name is Ziggy ; he lives at a farm in Knights Ferry , CA with his camel friend .

Zebret
Alex is a foal with a zebra mother and a donkey father .
This cross is called a zebret or zebrinny ( image credit : Chris Brandis / AP )
Zedonk
A zebra stallion bred with a female donkey would be called a zedonk or zonkey .
The exact parentage of the petting zoo zebroid pictured here is uncertain , but it is a donkey / zebra cross .
Zorse
This photograph caused many people to cry " Photoshop ! " 
Eclyse is a zorse , meaning her father was a zebra , and her mother was a horse .
Her markings are unusual even for a zorse .
In most animal hybrids , you see a gradual blending of traits from each parent .
In this case , there is no question about which body part came from each parent !
Z.J. is a more typically - colored zorse , sired by a zebra stallion with an American Paint horse .
Hebra
A zebroid with a horse for a father and a zebra mother is called a hebra .
They are much rarer then zorses , and look very different from a zorse .
This hebra lives at the Colchester Zoo in England .

Quagga
The quagga looks like a cross between a zebra and some other animal , but it was a type of zebra .
The word " quagga "  was used interchangably with " zebra "  when Europeans colonized Africa .
The quagga was identified as a seperate species in 1788 , but that did n't stop hunters and settlers from killing them for meat , hides , and to preserve grazing land .
The quagga became extinct when the last one died in captivity on August 12 , 1883 .
DNA analysis of the preserved remains of several quaggas revealed that it was not a separate species after all , but a subspecies of the Plains zebra .
The Quagga Project is selectively breeding Plains zebras with DNA similar to the quagga in order to bring the quagga back and reintroduce it to protected preserves in its former habitat in South Africa .
Okapi
This animal looks like a cross between a zebra and a giraffe !
But it 's more of a red herring here .
The okapi is an African rainforest relative of the giraffe that just happens to have zebra-striped legs .
Although known to locals , the okapi was considered a mythical animal among Europeans until it was classified in the twentieth century .
Okapis are neither descended from nor related to zebras .

Instead of swishing fins , feet or flippers , alligators surprisingly move their lungs around inside their body to dive , surface and roll in water .
This newly discovered strategy may be one that many animals have been employing for millennia to maneuver and avoid creating ripples in the water — helping them sneak toward prey or away from predators .
Up until now , it was a mystery as to how gators " manage to maneuver so gracefully without the fins and flippers used by fish , seals and other adept swimmers , " said researcher C.G. Farmer , a biologist at the University of Utah at Salt Lake City .
The researchers noticed alligators seemed to have a lot of muscles devoted to breathing .
" They really did n't need all those muscles for breathing , so we wanted to see what else they might be doing with them , " said researcher T.J. Uriona , also a University of Utah biologist .
Farmer and Uriona investigated five American alligators ( Alligator mississippiensis ) , each 2 years old , from Louisiana 's Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge .
The gators were just 15 to 20 inches long .
In comparison , adults can reach 15 feet .
Electrodes were implanted on sets of muscles in the alligators so their activity could be monitored while the reptiles maneuvered in warm water in 100 - gallon tanks .
The researchers also duct - taped weights made of buckshot pellets under the reptiles ' jaws or at the base of their tails that totaled about one - fortieth of each gator 's weight , providing a bit of added stress to help the electrodes better detect how the muscles worked .
" Gators are surprisingly easy to work with — they 're not very aggressive animals , and tend only to bite out of self - defense , " Uriona said .
Farmer and Uriona focused on special muscles the alligators used to manipulate the position of their lungs .
Until now , it was believed these muscles evolved to help gators breathe and run at the same time , Uriona said .
" It may be that instead of these muscles arising for breathing , they arose for moving around in the water and later were co-opted for breathing , " he explained .
The lungs act as flotation airbags .
By moving the lungs around , the muscles alter the center of buoyancy of the alligators .
The researchers found moving the lungs toward the tail helped the gators dive ; toward the head helped them surface ; and toward one side or the other helped them roll sideways .
The tail also helped the reptiles roll .
Scientists had assumed that alligators maneuvered in water simply by controlling how much air they breathed in .
" If they wanted to sink , they 'd just take in less air ; if they wanted to surface , they 'd take a big breath , " Uriona said .
" Sometimes things get overlooked . "
The crocodilian ancestors of alligators — slender , cat - sized animals that initially lived only on land — may have developed these muscles when they became amphibious about 145 million years ago .
By shifting their lungs around , these reptiles could then silently maneuver without disturbing the water .
" This is probably really important while they are trying to sneak up on an animal but do n't want to create ripples , " Uriona said .
Sneaky maneuvering could also help the gators from getting eaten themselves .
Similar muscles are found in crocodiles , turtles , African clawed frogs , certain salamanders and manatees .
The researchers are now investigating whether these animals use their lungs to orient in the water like alligators do .
" People typically think of lungs as just sacs of air , as a way of keeping in oxygen , but our findings show animals can use that air when in the water to manipulate their position in space , " Uriona told LiveScience .
Uriona and Farmer detailed their findings online March 14 in the Journal of Experimental Biology .

I wrote yesterday about discrepancies in the results reported by Sequoia AVC Advantage voting machines in New Jersey .
Sequoia issued a memo giving their explanation for what might have happened .
Here ’s the relevant part :
During a primary election , the “ option switches ” on the operator panel must be used to activate the voting machine .
The operator panel has a total of 12 buttons numbered 1 through 12 .
Each party participating in the primary election is assigned one of the option switch buttons .
The poll worker presses a party option switch button based on the voter authorization slip given to the voter after signing the poll book , and then the poll worker presses the green “ Activate ” button .
This action causes that party ’s contests to be activated on the ballot face inside the voting booth .
Let ’s assume the Democrat party is assigned option switch 6 while the Republican Party is assigned options switch 12 .
If a Democrat voter arrives , the poll worker presses the “ 6 ” button followed by the green “ Activate ” button .
The Democrat contests are activated and the voter votes the ballot .
For a Republican voter , the poll worker presses the “ 12 ” button followed by the green “ Activate ” button , which then activates the Republican contests and the voter votes the ballot .
This is the correct and proper method of machine activation when using option switches .
However , we have found that when a poll worker selects the lower of the two assigned selection codes , followed by pressing an unused selection code and then pressing the green “ Activate ” button , the higher numbered party on the operator panel has its contests activated instead while the selection code button for the original party stays active on the operator panel .
Using the above example with the Democrat Party as option switch 6 and the Republican Party as option switch 12 , the poll worker presses button 6 for Democrat .
The red light next to button number 6 lights up and the operator panel display will show DEM .
The poll worker then presses any unused option switch .
The red light stays lit next to option switch 6 and the display still says DEM .
Now the poll worker presses the green “ Activate ” button .
The red light stays lit next to button number 6 , but the operator panel display now says REP and the ballot in the voting booth will activate the Republican party contests .
In each and every case where a machine displays the party turnout issue at the close of the polls , this is the situation that would have caused it , and it can be duplicated on any machine .
In addition , for this situation to have occurred , the voter that was in the voting booth at the time of the poll workers action would have voted the opposite party ballot instead of telling the poll worker that the incorrect ballot was activated and the machine would not allow them to vote the party they intended .
If they had informed the poll worker , they could have made the party selection change and the voter would have then voted the correct ballot style .
Several points are in order .
First , it ’s obvious from this description , and from the fact that this happened on so many machines across the state , that even if Sequoia ’s explanation is entirely correct , there was some kind of engineering error on Sequoia ’s part that caused the machines to misbehave .
Sequoia has tried to paint the anomalies as poll worker error , but that ’s not plausible in light of Sequoia ’s own explanation .
Consider the scenario described above : there is a moment when the red light next to the DEM button is lit , the operator panel displays DEM , then the poll worker presses the Activate button – and the Republican ballot is activated .
No competent engineer would design a system to work that way .
No competent engineer would design this system to ever display REP in the operator panel while simultaneously lighting only the DEM light .
No competent engineer would design this system to ever activate the Republican ballot when the poll worker had pressed the DEM button but had not pressed the REP button .
Sequoia ’s own explanation makes clear that they made an engineering error that caused the voting machine to behave incorrectly .
Second , this does n’t look like fraud , only error .
A malicious attacker who had access to a machine would have had much more powerful , and much less detectable , options at his disposal .
Third , Sequoia seems to avoid saying that what they describe is the only possible cause of such errors .
Note the careful wording , “ In each and every case where a machine displays [ an error ] , this is the situation that would have caused it … ” ( emphasis added ) .
They do n’t say this “ did ” cause the errors ; they say it “ would have ” .
The sentence is either clumsy or artfully worded .
Fourth , Sequoia ’s explanation involves a voter seeing the wrong party ’s ballot being activated , and not complaining about it .
Assuming ( as press accounts say ) that the problem happened about sixty times in New Jersey , one would expect that many voters noticed and complained .
And one would expect that in at least one of those cases , a poll worker would have noticed that the operator panel was displaying REP and DEM at the same time .
Yet there do n’t seem to be reports of such behavior .
Fifth , Sequoia does n’t characterize fully the cases where this problem might occur , so election officials do n’t know , for example , which past elections might have been affected .
The bottom line is clear .
An investigation is needed – an independent investigation , done by someone not chosen by Sequoia , not paid by Sequoia , and not reporting to Sequoia .
Beyond “ Guilty ” or “ Not Guilty ” : Giving Special Verdicts in Criminal Jury Trials
The following Note was published in Winter 2003 by the Yale Law & Policy Review ( 21 Yale L. & Pol ’y Rev. 263 ) .
It has since been cited by the United States Court of Appeal for the Third Circuit , United States v. Hedgepeth , 434 F.3d 609 , 613 ( 3d Cir. 2006 ) ( link to pdf opinion ) , and the North Carolina Supreme Court , State v. Blackwell , 361 N.C. 41 , 47-48 , 638 S.E.2d 452 , 457 ( N.C. 2006 ) ( link to html opinion ) .

I. Introduction
“ Special verdicts are generally disfavored in criminal trials . ”
This statement appears so often in judicial discussions of jury verdicts , it is nearly a platitude .
1
The reason for the disfavor is quite simple : A true special verdict is one where the jury does not render a general verdict of guilty or not guilty , but simply finds certain facts and leaves the rest to the court .
2
True special verdicts are almost never used in criminal cases , 3 because by taking away the jury ’s power to render a verdict , 4 they violate the Sixth Amendment “ right to have a jury make the ultimate determination of guilt ” 5 — leading directly to the sentiment behind the opening quotation .
However , sentiment no longer matches reality .
Today , juries commonly return information beyond a simple “ guilty ” or “ not guilty ” in a wide range of criminal cases .
6
Though these are often called “ special verdicts , ” they are not true special verdicts :
They provide additional information that accompanies , but does not replace , the general verdict .
7
This additional information can be fairly specific , such as the special designation “ guilty but mentally ill ” 8 or a verdict of criminal forfeiture , 9 or more general , such as expanded verdict forms that list lesser - included charges or special interrogatories about facts underlying the verdict .
Though current practice stops short of employing true special verdicts , it still raises the constitutional issue of interfering with jury deliberations .
The increased use of special verdict forms and special interrogatories raises a number of questions which appear to have escaped academic attention , judging from the infrequent discussion of special verdicts in the literature .
10 Further , the judicial doctrines governing use of special verdict forms and special interrogatories have developed piecemeal and have not yet been synthesized into a general analysis .
This Note ’s goal is thus twofold : to describe the possibly unrecognized extent and variety of current practice , and to offer practitioners and courts a more comprehensive analytic framework for deciding whether to request and give special verdicts .
It begins with an overview of jury deliberation principles that are relevant to special verdicts .
It then discusses current practice , to lay the foundation for the next Section , a description and critique of how courts decide whether to employ special verdicts .
It concludes by summarizing the functional aspects of special verdicts and recommending that courts consider these functions , and not narrow , self - imposed categories , in evaluating whether special verdicts are appropriate in a particular case .
II . General Principles About Jury Deliberation
There are two areas in which special verdicts have particularly important implications for jury deliberations .
The first is the psychological and sociological processes of deliberation , where the question is whether special verdicts aid jury deliberations and affect general verdicts .
The second is jury nullification , where the question is whether special verdicts restrict the jury ’s power to nullify .

A. Psychological and Sociological Research
Social science offers some fairly well - tested and accepted observations about how juries deliberate .
These observations inform the question of special verdicts .
To put it simply , juries are good at facts but bad at law .
Thus , mock trials find that juries make errors of fact less often than other kinds of errors , and that errors of fact are more likely to be corrected during deliberation .
11
In contrast , errors in properly recalling the judge ’s instructions are much more common and tend to be reinforced during deliberation .
12 A number of studies corroborate these mock trial results , “ often showing correct response rates of 75 % or thereabouts ” 13 in recalling case facts , but showing correct recollections of judges ’ instructions only about half the time .
14
Only a few studies have been done on the effects of special verdicts on jury comprehension .
A survey of civil and criminal jurors found that
in trials where special verdict forms were used , the jurors reported feeling better informed , more satisfied that their verdict was correct , more confident that their verdict reflected a proper understanding of the judge ’s instructions , and more satisfied that the prosecutor was helpful .
Furthermore . . . jurors found the use of special verdict forms to be the most helpful for dealing with large quantities of information .
15
An experiment found that in a mock civil trial , the use of special verdicts did not affect the general verdicts .
16
The researchers hypothesized that the effect of a particular answer was obvious to the jury , allowing their overall impressions of the parties , which were highly correlated with the results , 17 to affect their answers .
18 While the jurors who were given special verdicts understood better the legal question of burden of proof , they did no better than the control group in applying that knowledge to fact patterns .
19 Though this data is scarce , it suggests an empirical basis for thinking that special verdicts can help jurors manage unfamiliar or complex information .
B. Nullification
The Sixth Amendment concern over true special verdicts , discussed in the Introduction , is related to the perennial debate over jury nullification , that is , the jury ’s power to ignore the law when rendering a verdict .
Under well - settled Supreme Court precedent , jury nullification is merely a power of the jury , not a constitutionally permissible right .
20 However , as the highly influential case United States v. Spock 21 shows , nullification is inextricably linked to the jury ’s power to render a general verdict without explaining itself .
In Spock , the defendants were charged with a conspiracy to burn draft cards .
Sua sponte , and over the defendants ’ objections , the trial judge put ten questions to the jury at the close of trial .
The First Circuit gave a sample :
Question No. 1 . Does the Jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants unlawfully , knowingly and wilfully conspired to counsel Selective Service registrants to knowingly and willfully refuse and evade service in the armed forces of the United States in violation of Section 12 of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 ?
22
Parallel language was used for the alternate means of violating the statute ( aiding and abetting ) .
Four of the five defendants were convicted .
23
The court overturned the convictions , arguing that the general verdict was a necessary safeguard on the jury ’s independence .
24
In its analysis , the court took a tour of the history of disapproval of special verdicts ; its language reflected the delicate balance courts attempt to strike between lauding the jury as a protector against arbitrary exercises of government power ( which may require ignoring the law ) and deploring lawless nullification 25 :
There is no easier way to reach , and perhaps force , a verdict of guilty than to approach it step bystep . . . .
By a progression of questions each of which seems to require an answer unfavorable to the defendant , a reluctant juror may be led to vote for a conviction which , in the large , he would have resisted . . . .
Uppermost of [ our ] considerations is the principle that the jury , as the conscience of the community , must be permitted to look at more than logic . . . .
The constitutional guarantees of due process and trial by jury require that a criminal defendant be afforded the full protection of a jury unfettered , directly or indirectly .
26
The court reached this conclusion even though , on the one hand , the jury was directed to answer the questions after it came to a general verdict , 27 and on the other , the questions rephrased the indictment 28 and thus might have been expected to lead to an “ accurate ” verdict .
This strongly suggests that the court was willing to subordinate accuracy to nullification , or at least the possibility of nullification .
Today , Spock stands for the prohibition on questions that shape or lead the jury ’s deliberations , 29 as well as for the general disfavor of special questions in criminal cases .
30
Most courts have adopted Spock ’s approach of attempting to walk the line between jury independence and jury nullification , asking whether the form of the verdict impermissibly directs the course of the jury ’s deliberation .
31 A few courts have gone further than that and explicitly approved of jury nullification , and in doing so , have thrown the relationship between special verdicts and jury independence into even sharper relief than in Spock .
As the Kansas Supreme Court put it :
In view of the differences in our civil and criminal statutes relating to verdicts [ , ] it is apparent the legislature intended to preserve the time honored power of the jury to return a verdict in a criminal prosecution in the teeth of the law and the facts .
Therefore we hold that special questions may not be submitted to the jury for answer in a criminal prosecution .
32
The Indiana Supreme Court came to a similar conclusion in Seay v. State , 33 a case involving sentencing defendants as habitual offenders , which greatly increases the possible penalty .
34 The court looked in part to a state constitutional provision 35 to hold that :
If the legislature had intended an automatic determination of habitual offender status upon the finding of two unrelated felonies , there would be no need for a jury trial on the status determination .
In this case , what was at issue was the jury ’s ability to find Seay to be a habitual offender ( or not to be a habitual offender ) irrespective of the uncontroverted proof of prior felonies .
The jury was judge of both the law and facts as to that issue and it was error to instruct the jury otherwise .
36
Since “ the policy of a trial by jury for habitual offender charges ‘ even sanctions exercise of the jury nullification power , ’ ” 37 the court required that special verdict forms on habitual offender status permit nullification .
38 Lower courts , however , have not interpreted Seay as requiring that the jury be explicitly informed of its nullification power .
39
As these cases show , special verdicts are inextricably connected with jury independence and nullification .
On the one hand , for practical purposes jury nullification is irrelevant , since nullification is generally not allowed .
On the other , the line between jury nullification and jury independence can be a fine one , and a court can undoubtedly constrain a jury ’s independence by having it explain itself in a special verdict .
As a result , determining the appropriate uses for special verdicts is a problem similar to determining the amount of discretion permitted the jury .
This problem , and how courts have addressed it , will be addressed further in Part IV.E .
C. Implications for Special Verdicts
Social science indicates that juries are good at facts , and law makes juries the judges of fact .
Taken together , this suggests that special verdicts would be useful in playing to this strength by exploring the jury ’s factual determinations .
Indeed , this use of special verdicts appears to have drawn little fundamental controversy .
40 Questions may be raised as to which cases and what facts , but the basic premise seems well - accepted : A jury ’s province is the facts , and it is good at them , so it is allowed to provide the court with the benefit of its expertise .
However , social science also indicates that juries are bad at law ( or at least worse at it ) , and this does not so neatly lead to a clear rule .
If juries have trouble understanding or remembering the judge ’s instructions , one logical response would be to tailor special interrogatories to track the judge ’s instructions and the elements of the statute .
41 After all , if the judge is going to instruct the jury , why should n’t the instructions be useful , step - by - step directions that the jury could have in front of it and follow ?
In a different system , they might be .
But in the United States , such special questions would replicate the situation in Spock , and thus would impermissibly infringe on the jury ’s independence .
So questions cannot be directly targeted at making sure the jury gets the law correct while deliberating ; indeed , the system ’s acceptance of independence , and its resulting grudging tolerance of nullification , means that the jury cannot be forced to get the law right in its verdict .
Questions might , on the other hand , be targeted at determining if the jury got the law correct .
For instance , a jury could indicate which theory of the crime it relied upon , to benefit an appellate court reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence .
Courts have found a number of situations in which it is useful to know more than a general verdict and perhaps some facts ; 42 special verdicts could assist in this .
However , additional care should be taken when questioning a jury about more than just the bare facts , for fear of becoming entangled in the ever - contentious nullification debate .
43
Thus , the question of jury nullification and the observations of social science lead to two hypotheses and one caveat about the constitutionality and practical use of special verdict forms and special interrogatories .
First , juries should be able to make findings of fact .
Second , juries may be able to specify a legal theory or finding .
However , because of the constitutional right to a determination by an independent jury , juries should not be subjected to questions that could lead or otherwise influence their thinking .
The rest of this Note attempts to refine the way courts should apply these principles when deciding whether and how to give special verdicts .
III .
Current Areas of Use
Special verdicts are currently used in a wide variety of areas .
This Section gives a comprehensive overview of current practice , both to illustrate the prevalence of special verdicts and to provide background for the subsequent discussion of the decision to give special verdicts .
The uses can be divided into two broad categories : facts alone , and facts mixed with law .
A. Facts Alone
Overall , factual special interrogatories are most often used in sentencing cases .
This category of use has fluctuated considerably in the federal courts , a process that continues to the present .
Miscellaneous non-sentencing questions make up a minority of factual special interrogatories .
The spectrum of factual cases begins with the least controversial , most firmly established uses .
In treason cases , the Constitution requires that a conviction be supported by “ the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act , or on Confession in open Court . ”
44 Thus , interrogatories were used to determine which overt acts the defendant committed in the most recent treason conviction reviewed by the Supreme Court .
45 Similarly , the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allow the use of special verdicts in forfeiture cases , 46 as do at least one state court ’s rules .
47 Forfeiture , at least on the federal level , is considered part of sentencing , 48 and sentencing is the broadest category in which special verdicts are used .
An example of this sentencing use is death penalty cases , where statute or case law commonly require juries to use special verdict forms to specify aggravating circumstances , or mitigating circumstances , or both .
49 This is nicely illustrated by Oklahoma ’s practice .
Its state constitution prohibits true special verdicts , 50 but its statutes require juries to write down the aggravating circumstances that underlie their recommendation of a death sentence , because sentencing issues do not touch upon the general verdict .
51 Aggravating and mitigating circumstances will sometimes become particularly important because of unusual circumstances .
For instance , Washington state will permit the execution of an accomplice to first - degree murder , but because the verdict of “ guilty of first - degree murder ” does not capture the full extent of culpability for an accomplice , the jury must be more specific on special verdict forms before an accomplice may be executed .
52 Washington ’s approach to capital accomplice liability is similar to the broader use of special interrogatories in sentencing , determining a key fact about culpability that is not captured by the general verdict .
Further , the use of special interrogatories in death penalty cases may be increased by the Supreme Court ’s recent ruling that juries , not judges , must find the aggravating circumstances necessary for imposing the death penalty .
53
Until recently , federal narcotics cases were one of the most common examples of special interrogatory use in sentencing .
A few courts initially approved of their use to find the quantity of drugs at issue , 54 but the advent of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in late 1987 quickly had courts holding that they were not bound by the jury ’s determination .
55 A similar pattern appeared regarding the object of a narcotics conspiracy , such as marijuana or cocaine ; courts originally held that the object had to be submitted to the jury , if the object would make a difference to the sentence .
56 After Edwards v. United States , 57 judges cut back on their use of special interrogatories , since they now may rely on their own determination of the object of the conspiracy unless different statutory maximums are involved .
58 In this sense , narcotics cases are a microcosm of the federal approach toward special interrogatories and sentencing after the implementation of the Sentencing Guidelines .
59 If a fact is solely relevant to sentencing within the Guidelines , the court may give a special interrogatory , but it is not required to and does not have to heed the jury ’s determination even if it allows the jury to make one .
60
Apprendi v. New Jersey , 61 recently decided by the Supreme Court , may signal a partial revival of the use of special interrogatories for federal sentencing purposes .
Apprendi held that if any fact increases the statutory maximum sentence a defendant is subject to , that fact must be submitted to the jury to decide beyond a reasonable doubt .
62 Some circuits have interpreted Apprendi as requiring , or at least recommending , special interrogatories in specific narcotics cases .
63 Other courts have not gone so far as to recommend special verdicts , but have noted that their use helped avoid reversals for possible Apprendi errors .
64 A number of state courts have had similar reactions .
65
Some courts consider it a truism that drugs and guns go together ; 66 whether or not they do , guns are also often the subjects of special interrogatories .
In the federal courts , they are treated as drugs generally are , as part of the sentencing procedure , and therefore special interrogatories about them are discretionary .
67 Again , as with drugs , the states vary in their treatment of firearms interrogatories .
Florida ’s Supreme Court requires that a sentence enhancement based on firearms be supported either by a special finding or a reference to a firearm in the charging instrument , 68 and Hawaii ’s has imposed a similar requirement .
69 An Iowa rule requires that any minimum sentence for use of a firearm be supported by a special interrogatory ; 70 a West Virginia statute has a similar requirement for the ruling out of probation .
71 However , New Jersey ’s Supreme Court explicitly stated that interrogatories are not required because firearms are only relevant to sentencing .
72
In addition , courts in Colorado , 73 Missouri , 74 Texas , 75 Washington , 76 Wisconsin , 77 and Wyoming 78 have all mentioned that lower courts used interrogatories to determine if weapons were used in particular crimes .
Another common sentencing enhancement is based on the defendant ’s prior felony convictions .
The federal courts have not used special interrogatories for this purpose , since even prior to the Supreme Court ’s specific blessing of prior felonies as a sentencing factor , 79 they had “ almost uniformly ” interpreted it as such .
80 However , state courts have often used interrogatories for their habitual offender sentencing determinations .
For instance , as discussed previously , Indiana ’s Supreme Court used a habitual offender statute to emphasize that jury nullification plays a role in evaluating special interrogatories .
81 Other state courts that have mentioned using special verdict forms include Arkansas , 82 Colorado , 83 Iowa , 84 North Carolina , 85 Ohio , 86 and Washington .
87
Special verdicts have also been used in sentencing for a number of miscellaneous culpability questions .
For instance , juries have been asked , or should have been asked , to determine the amount of a theft , 88 the proximate cause of a death , 89 whether a crime was one “ of violence , ” 90 which of several potential offenses the verdict reflected , 91 the dangerousness 92 or mental retardation 93 of the offender , the heinousness of a murder , 94 whether serious bodily injury resulted from a carjacking , 95 and on what theory a murder conviction relied .
96 More generally , they have been asked to find aggravating factors for crimes other than murder .
97
A variety of facts unrelated to sentencing have also been the subject of special interrogatories .
For instance , the Ninth Circuit requires special verdicts “ when a court permits facts which pose a genuine possibility of juror confusion to go to the jury . ”
98 Occasionally , special verdicts have addressed defenses that turn on a specific fact , 99 or on a confession ’s voluntariness .
100
And there are some facts that simply cannot be described as other than “ miscellaneous ” : age , 101 alien status , 102 how far from a school a drug sale took place , 103 whether property was rented in an arson case , 104 whether minors were depicted as engaging in sexually explicit conduct , 105 and whether a fire marshal ’s orders were followed .
106 Undoubtedly there are more that appear in unreported cases .
The cases dealing with non-sentencing factual interrogatories spend little time discussing why a special interrogatory was given , making it difficult to discern any underlying theory or pattern .
However , in most of the “ miscellaneous ” cases , the specific fact is built into the statute as an extra condition — in other words , not just arson , but rental property arson ; not just selling drugs , but selling drugs near a school .
Special interrogatories might thus be seen as a way of making sure that the jury considered this additional and unusual requirement .
This rationale might also cover cases with special verdicts about defenses , since defenses are another item for juries to consider .
B. Facts and Law
There are some uses of special verdicts that combine facts and law .
The most common and widely recognized such use is in RICO and continuing criminal enterprise ( CCE ) prosecutions , collectively known as “ compound - complex cases . ”
They are also used when there are alternate grounds for conviction before the jury , to assess defenses with legal components , and for a few underlying legal questions .
In RICO and CCE cases , special verdicts are often used to specify which predicate acts the defendant committed in furtherance of her criminal course of conduct .
The determination of predicate acts straddles the line between facts and law because it is , in some sense , a mini-verdict .
The jury must ask if the act happened and if the act is chargeable or indictable , as required by the RICO statute , 107 or a felony , as required by the CCE statute .
108
This use garnered notice with United States v. Coonan , 109 in which the Second Circuit approved the use of special interrogatories as to RICO predicate acts , over the prosecution ’s petition for a writ of mandamus .
Initially , the district judge suggested employing a true special verdict .
110 However , at oral argument , the Second Circuit panel recommended instead that the jury return a bifurcated verdict ; first , the jury would determine whether the defendants had committed any RICO predicate acts , and second , the jury would consider the general RICO violation , after being instructed that two predicate acts were necessary to sustain a RICO conviction .
111 The prosecution objected , arguing that the jury should be told how many predicate acts are required for a conviction before it considered the predicate acts .
112 The Second Circuit took an extremely dim view of this argument , characterizing the government as “ seeking to protect . . . the possibility of its obtaining guilty verdicts through prejudicial spillover from the numerous violent and otherwise criminal acts before ” the jury and claiming to have “ a right , enforceable by mandamus , to prevent any and all use of special interrogatories separately from a general verdict no matter how necessary they may be to the protection of a defendant ’s rights . ”
113 The court argued that the “ traditional distaste for special interrogatories ” existed to protect the defendant , a concern not present here ; accordingly , the court refused to issue the writ .
114 The trial court eventually used the Second Circuit ’s procedure instead of a true special verdict .
115
Both before and after Coonan , courts used special interrogatories in RICO and CCE cases to determine upon which predicate acts juries relied .
Several federal circuits do so , 116 as does at least one state , New York .
117 The use of special interrogatories in compound - complex criminal statutes was given a potential boost by the Supreme Court ’s decision in Richardson v. United States .
118 The CCE statute ( sometimes called the “ drug kingpin ” statute ) requires that a defendant be engaged in a “ continuing series of violations ” of the drug laws ; 119 the Court required that juries be unanimous in their determination of which violations support the CCE conviction , since each violation was an element of the offense .
120 The Court did not address the potential use of special verdicts in these cases , but it seems likely that some courts will turn to this tool of ensuring unanimity .
121 In addition , similar predicate act questions are raised by statutes that implicate ongoing sexual abuse .
122
Special verdicts are also used to determine on which of available alternative grounds the jury convicted .
This might anticipate a potential appellate review for insufficient evidence , as Justice Blackmun once suggested , 123 or for legal error , such as where part of a statute might be challenged .
124 Unlike the compound - complex cases , these juries are not giving an intermediate step in their reasoning , but are simply being more precise about their general verdict .
The most common situation is where alternate theories of murder are charged , and the jury is asked to determine whether the defendant is guilty of felony murder or premeditated murder .
125 Similarly , lesser included offenses sometimes prompt the use of a special verdict form .
126 As discussed previously , courts had once inquired as to the objects of narcotics conspiracies , before the Supreme Court held that unnecessary .
127 There have been a handful of other cases in which alternative means of committing a crime were alleged and special verdicts were used or recommended , such as driving under the influence , 128 assault , 129 sexual assault , 130 and perjury .
131 Courts do not always give reasons for the use in these cases , but when they do , they use common justifications such as unanimity , jury confusion , and appellate review .
Defenses are perhaps the major category of law - related special verdicts that do not come within those previously discussed .
Insanity is the most prominent of these , 132 and entails judgments about a person ’s mental state and whether it can bear moral culpability 133 — surely one of the fundamental questions of the legal system .
134 To a lesser extent , other defenses , such as entrapment , have been the subject of special interrogatories , where there was evidence to support the theory .
135 Georgia uses special verdicts to provide for a potential future defense in non-support cases :
If the defendant is acquitted on grounds of non-paternity or maternity , as stated in the special verdict , then all further support proceedings are barred .
136 In a somewhat related area , North Dakota requires special verdicts in cases where the defendant raises double jeopardy as a defense .
137
Special interrogatories are sometimes had on legal matters that underlie the verdict .
In Texas , defendants have the right to special interrogatories on whether evidence was legally acquired , if the facts are in dispute .
138 Whether a witness is an accomplice 139 or whether the crime occurred within the jurisdiction 140 are both factual questions in part , yet are also legal prerequisites independent of the elements of the crime .
These may be analogous to special interrogatories on miscellaneous facts , being additional conditions that might be overlooked by jurors as they discuss the meat of the crime .
Finally and uniquely , North Carolina allows special verdicts as a sort of hypothetical for juries , where a defendant challenges a statute ’s constitutionality on grounds not in the record .
141
In summary , special verdict forms and special interrogatories have been used in all these varied circumstances , by all of the Circuits , and by forty - six of the states .
142
Yet courts do not merely determine the category they find themselves in — RICO case or gun case or what - have - you — and mechanically approve or disapprove of the use of a special verdict .
Instead , the current jurisprudence shows that courts use a number of guidelines in their decision - making .
The next Part catalogs and analyzes these themes .
IV .
Giving Special Verdicts : Functions and Rules
A review of the case law indicates that courts currently consider a number of questions when deciding whether to put a special verdict form or special interrogatory to the jury .
Courts look inward , toward the law , and consider if the requested special verdict is mandatory or discretionary , and if the subject of the special verdict must be unanimous .
They look outward , toward the jury , and consider if the jury might be confused or swayed by a special verdict ’s presence or absence .
Finally , they look upward , toward reviewing courts , and consider whether the special verdict would facilitate appellate review .
This is a useful framework of analysis , but courts too often look only in one of these directions .
Put another way , although courts may not mechanically approve or disapprove of special verdicts based on the type of case , they often appear to fall into a similar trap by mechanically applying rules derived from a particular perspective , ignoring the relevance of others .
This Part will document and evaluate these perspectives and the functions they serve .
A. Mandatory or Discretionary
The first question for a court when faced with a procedural request is whether there is a decision to make at all :
Is the procedure mandated , discretionary , or forbidden ?
This question is generally settled by statute or rule , if it is addressed at all — there are very few cases mandating or forbidding the use of special verdicts in criminal cases .
As noted earlier , on the federal level , special verdicts are required in treason and criminal forfeiture cases .
143
They are also required by many states in death penalty 144 and insanity 145 cases .
North Dakota , in its Rules of Criminal Procedure , requires special verdicts in treason , insanity , and double jeopardy cases , and “ when a defendant interposes any other defense which cannot be reflected in a general verdict , and evidence of the defense is given at trial [ ; in such a case , ] the jury , if it so finds , shall declare that fact in its verdict . ”
146 Iowa is the state with the most extensive use of special interrogatories ; it requires that the jury determine whether a defendant used a firearm , in cases where the firearm use would subject the defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence .
147 A few other states have similar firearms requirements .
148 New York requires courts to separately submit predicate acts to the jury under its enterprise corruption statute .
149 A few courts have mentioned in passing that special verdicts should be given for sentencing , without elaboration .
150
On the other end of the spectrum , Kansas ’s Supreme Court has prohibited having the jury answer any special questions because of concerns about jury power and nullification , as discussed previously .
151 Louisiana ’s Supreme Court has expressed similar concerns .
152 Nebraska ’s Supreme Court has simply noted that there is no authority that authorizes special verdicts .
153 Virginia ’s courts appear to have not confronted the question .
154
The trend is to leave the matter to the judge ’s discretion .
Oklahoma enshrined this principle in its Constitution .
155 The First and Fourth Circuits implicitly embraced it in their adoption of abuse of discretion standards of review .
156 Iowa , despite its extensive use of special verdicts and the apparently mandatory language of the Rule in question , also vests discretion in judges in non-firearms cases .
157 As seen earlier , special interrogatories in the federal sentencing context are subject to an uneasy form of discretion : Judges are allowed to give special interrogatories , but if they rely too much on them , the sentence may be overturned on appeal .
158
Courts sometimes draw on the analogy of jury instructions when deciding whether a special verdict is required .
159
This is a reasonable analogy , as a special verdict is certainly an instruction to the jury , and both can raise concerns about clarity and invading the jury ’s province .
160 However , the information provided by a special verdict runs both ways : to the jury , to direct them in their deliberations ( at the least , to tell them how to fill out the form ) , and from the jury , in the form of their answers .
Jury instructions can only run one way , to the jury .
Thus , courts should be wary of placing too much emphasis on the jury instruction analogy .
The information received from the jury may make special verdicts desirable , but it is not considered in jury instruction precedents .
B. Unanimity
Special verdicts are useful in ensuring that juries are unanimous on relevant components of the verdict .
161 Indeed , this is one of the justifications most frequently offered for their use .
By requiring that the jury clearly address a particular issue , special interrogatories can ensure that the issue did not get lost in the shuffle during deliberations and can explicitly require that the jury ’s answer be unanimous .
162 The miscellaneous fact interrogatories may be an example of this effort .
163 Interrogatories may contribute to judicial economy by confirming the jury ’s unanimity and thus avoiding a retrial .
164 Indeed , one court held that the use of special interrogatories was not an error — despite their being generally disfavored — in part because they ensured jury unanimity .
165
The unanimity requirement is generally thought to protect defendants .
166 For instance , where the state offers numerous potential bad acts to support a conviction , special interrogatories can force the jury to focus on specific acts , mitigating prejudice from other bad acts introduced at trial 167 or reducing the chance that some jurors might agree on one act but not on another .
168 Crimes that involve a continuing course of conduct , such as sexual abuse 169 or criminal enterprise , 170 are particularly vulnerable to this problem .
The law of when juries must be given specific unanimity instructions is complex and evolving , and appellate courts have been willing to let individual judges decide whether special interrogatories should accompany specific unanimity instructions .
171 However , courts should consider the ability of special interrogatories to clarify the record for review , as will be discussed shortly .
172
Unanimity does not necessarily protect defendants , however , and courts should also be sensitive to the risks of using special interrogatories to explore the jury ’s position on defenses .
The Supreme Court recognized this danger in Mills v. Maryland 173 and McKoy v. North Carolina , 174 in which it held that the jury ’s consideration of mitigating circumstances in a death penalty case could not be constrained .
As a result , it overturned death sentences that resulted from special interrogatories that either implied 175 or required 176 unanimity as to mitigating circumstances .
177 A similar problem arose in United States v. Wilson , 178 in which the defendant offered an insanity defense .
The following interrogatories were given :
Question No. 1 . Do you unanimously find that the defendant Joyce Wilson suffered from a mental illness on May 29 , 1979 ? . . .
If you have answered Question No. 1 yes . . . then you must answer Questions 2 and 3 .
Question No. 2 . Do you unanimously find that the mental illness of the defendant Joyce Wilson on May 29th , 1979 was such as to prevent her from knowing the wrongfulness of her act ?
Question No. 3 . Do you unanimously find that the mental illness of the Defendant Joyce Wilson on May 29th , 1979 , was such as to render her substantially incapable of conforming her conduct to the requirements of the law she is charged with violating ?
If you have answered both Question No. 2 and Question No. 3 no , you should disregard the defense of insanity and limit your consideration to the other issues described in these instructions .
If you have answered either Question No. 2 or Question No. 3 yes , you should render a verdict of not guilty because of the defendant ’s lack of criminal responsibility .
179
The court held that the wording of these questions could have precluded a hung jury on insanity , since “ the word “ unanimous ’ could easily mislead the jury into believing that unless all twelve found that defendant was insane , no one could so find . ”
180 This shifted the burden of proof to the defendant to prove that she was insane , instead of the government having to prove sanity to rebut her prima facie case .
181 While one is not entitled to a unanimous jury , 182 one is entitled to a jury that has not had its opinions unduly influenced , perhaps away from a defense .
183
The line to be walked on special interrogatories and unanimity is a delicate one , but well within the capacity of courts .
Of course , juries need not be unanimous on everything when arriving at a verdict .
The usual formulation is that juries do not have to agree on the means of a crime ’s commission — even up to and including whether a person died as a result of the commission of a felony or because she was intentionally killed .
184 Juries do , however , have to be unanimous on the elements of a crime , even though determining which parts of a statute are elements can be a difficult business for courts .
185 Courts have tended to see the sets of “ unanimity not required ” and “ special interrogatory not required ” as fully congruent .
In other words , a court ’s analysis can often be reduced to this line of reasoning :
This particular portion does not need to be unanimous , therefore no special interrogatory needs to be given .
186 Indeed , one court has described special verdicts as the “ logical progression ” of a broad specific unanimity requirement .
187
And yet these syllogisms are overly pat and may lead courts to ignore other functions of special interrogatories .
For example , a CCE defendant must be proved to have supervised five or more people in the course of her narcotics enterprise .
188 The Supreme Court ’s interpretation of the CCE statute in Richardson left open the question of whether the jury must agree on which five people were supervised .
189 Lower courts have come to differing resolutions of the question , and accordingly have given or not given special interrogatories .
190
Yet the sufficiency of the evidence as to a person may be challenged , just as the sufficiency of a predicate act may be .
Indeed , the Ninth Circuit reversed a CCE conviction for just this reason .
In United States v. Delgado , 191 the sufficiency of the evidence on three people was uncontested .
However , the rest of the people offered by the prosecution as supervisees — two named people , and their unnamed customers — were challenged by the defendant on appeal .
The court noted that since
no unanimity instruction regarding the five people was given . . . different jurors could count different people as among the five , and the jurors were allowed to count Fernandez and Fajardo and their customers toward the five persons managed by Delgado .
The conviction . . . can stand only if Fernandez , Fajardo , and their customers could properly be counted .
192
The court held that the additional people could not be counted , and reversed the conviction .
In Delgado , the court found that all of the challenged people were ineligible , and therefore there was no way that the magic number of five could be reached .
However , since the court did not know on which persons the jury relied , if even one of the persons was ineligible , the same result would follow :
The entire verdict would have to be overturned .
193
If a special interrogatory had indicated that none of the jurors relied on the ineligible person , however , the reversal and potential retrial could have been avoided .
194 Further , the dangers of confusion and prejudicial spillover may be as serious for the persons allegedly supervised as for the claimed predicate acts .
The question of whether the jury has to be unanimous on the people supervised fails to recognize these other interests , any one of which might well lead a judge to give a special interrogatory .
195
As with the jury instruction analogy , courts should resist the temptation to blindly follow self - imposed rules .
C. Confusion and Complexity
Another factor sometimes weighed by courts is that facts are the jury ’s special province and expertise .
196
As a result , when a case becomes very complex or confusing , courts will sometimes turn to special interrogatories as a way to clarify to juries what questions are before them .
Indeed , one circuit requires them “ when a court permits facts which pose a genuine possibility of juror confusion to go to the jury . ”
197
This is one of the best - known arguments for special verdicts , which arose in the complex - compound criminal statutes context ; 198 however , confusion and complexity are not limited to these cases , making this a reason with potentially wide application .
There is no clear line on how big a trial has to be before special interrogatories should be given .
In United States v. Palmeri , the Third Circuit upheld special interrogatories in a case where “ five defendants were tried on a twenty - three count indictment alleging forty - six acts of racketeering and numerous other violations of federal law . ”
199
The court specifically cited the possibility of jury confusion , as well as prejudicial spillover , in permitting the interrogatories .
200 Special interrogatories also have been given in less complex cases .
In United States v. Korando , the defendant was charged with the following : 1 ) a RICO violation , based on seven predicate acts ; 2 ) conspiracy to violate RICO ; and 3 ) committing a violent crime in aid of racketeering ( a murder that was one of the predicate acts ) .
201 Though the court did not discuss why the interrogatories were given , and there were considerably fewer predicate acts at issue in Korando than Palmeri , the interrelationship of the charges still made special interrogatories prudent .
202
United States v. Ogando 203 is an interesting example of the potential for jury confusion in complex cases .
This was a CCE case in which the defendants requested special interrogatories on the predicate offenses and persons supervised , but insisted that the jury should be given just a blank form to write in their findings .
The judge refused , “ concluding that the case was too complex to give the jury blank - form interrogatories without accompanying instructions as to who or what could be inserted as answers . ”
204
The judge offered two variants , 205 both of which were rejected by the defendants ; as a result , the jury was asked to return only a general verdict .
The Third Circuit approved of the trial judge ’s actions , noting that the six - week trial included twenty - five prosecution witnesses , that the jurors were not allowed to take notes , and that the jury was never told , “ This is an alleged series act . ” 206 Since the blank - form interrogatories would have required “ a recall of Homeric proportions ” on the jury ’s part , the proposed interrogatories were perfectly proper .
207
This rejection of the blank - form interrogatories is an excellent — though perhaps inadvertent , given the stress put on the trial court ’s discretion 208 — example of the argument for using well - drafted special interrogatories in complex cases .
Special verdict forms can also be useful when there are multiple charges or several lesser included offenses for the jury to consider .
As the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized ,
Most of the risks inherent in the use of special interrogatories are not present in special verdict sheets that have been properly prepared and submitted to the jury with appropriate instructions .
Special verdict sheets that list only the charges and lesser - included offenses under an indictment , and do not list the elements of the offenses , are unlikely to be confusing or have any coercive effect on the jury .
When multiple offenses are submitted to a jury , special verdicts are often helpful to an orderly deliberative process . . . .
If , as in the present case , a charge . . . is submitted to a jury on multiple theories of liability under a single indictment or count thereof , a special verdict greatly facilitates merger determinations .
209
While there currently appears to be little case law discussing the application of these principles , this does point out that special verdict forms can assist the jury even in the absence of predicate acts or complex conspiracies .
D. Appellate Review
As the previous sections have suggested , one of the broadest justifications for special verdicts is to facilitate appellate review .
Indeed , the current use of special verdicts to determine on which of alternate grounds a jury relied , 210 or which predicate acts 211 or persons 212 underlie a RICO or CCE conviction , speaks directly to this rationale .
Their use for miscellaneous items seems to be implicitly motivated , at least in part , by the needs of appellate review .
213 Once again , it has potentially wider application .
Special verdicts can be a useful tool when parties are attempting to test the law .
For example , State v. Wassil , 214 a Connecticut case , considered whether someone could be guilty of manslaughter by “ delivery of narcotics ” or by “ assisting in administering the narcotics . ”
215 The defendant was convicted of manslaughter via delivery , but acquitted of administering the narcotics ; he used these results to argue that , as a matter of law , his conviction should be overturned because the jury found that the victim administered the narcotics to himself .
216 His argument was rejected .
217 In State v. Stratton , 218 the jury was asked to determine whether the defendant was guilty of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor ( OUI ) as either a principal or an accomplice .
In upholding the conviction , Maine ’s Supreme Court noted that the question of whether one could be an accomplice to OUI was one of first impression in the jurisdiction .
219
These cases are in part alternate - theory cases , but more significantly , the special verdicts make it clear that the jury convicted on a novel theory , allowing the courts to give definitive answers on the acceptability of these theories .
220
Other special interrogatories even more clearly allow the appellate courts to pass judgment on novel theories of law .
To take a simple example , a jury in Idaho found in response to an interrogatory that a boot , not a firearm , was the deadly weapon ; the conviction was affirmed over the defendant ’s argument that a boot could not be a deadly weapon under the instructions given to the jury .
221 A more complex problem arose in a New Jersey case , where the defendant was charged as both a principal and an accomplice in employing a juvenile to distribute a controlled dangerous substance .
The parties disagreed over whether , under the accomplice theory , the age of the co-defendant had to be proved ; as a result , “ the judge decided to “ change the verdict sheet and break it down as accomplice or principal in case this becomes an issue on the appeal . ’ ”
222
The verdict form allowed the reviewing court to reverse the conviction on the narrow basis of the sufficiency of the evidence , rather than deciding the statutory question , which was “ not without difficulty of resolution . ”
223 Statutory interpretation was also at issue in a North Carolina case , where special interrogatories were used to overturn a sexual offense conviction ; the court stated that
On the peculiar facts of this case in which the jury found defendant not guilty of rape and not guilty of second - degree sexual offense on a person who was “ physically helpless ” [ by special interrogatory ] , and in which there is no evidence of actual physical force or of constructive force which could reasonably and understandably generate fear in the prosecuting witness , we have determined that the trial court erred in denying the defendant ’s motion for nonsuit .
224
This special interrogatory was used to probe the subtler question of whether a particular set of facts , at first glance covered by the concept of sexual offense , fit within the statute ’s language and the legislature ’s intent .
The use of special verdicts to facilitate appellate review might raise eyebrows among those worried that this is just another way to make it harder for defendants to win on appeal , instead of having a conviction reversed because its basis could not be determined .
Although a thorough empirical study is outside the scope of this Note , an examination of the cases collected during this research suggests that the appellate outcomes of special verdict cases are not one - sided .
The cases can be divided into four categories : upheld because of a special verdict ’s result ; upheld even without a special verdict ; overturned because of a special verdict ’s result ; and overturned because of the lack of a special verdict .
Of the cases that could be catalogued , the smallest category is “ upheld even without a special verdict ” ( 16 % ) ; no category had a majority .
More specifically , just over one - third of lower court decisions were upheld because of a special verdict ’s result ; about one - fifth were overturned because of a special verdict ’s result ; and just over one - quarter were overturned because a special verdict was not given .
225 Again , this is not a scientific or comprehensive survey ; it is merely a categorization of cases already being examined for this Note .
The concern that special verdicts might further stack the deck against defendants deserves to be taken seriously .
However , the lack of special verdicts can also have negative effects for defendants .
The ultimate disposition of the above cases cannot be determined ; it seems likely , however , that at least some of the cases that were overturned because of the lack of special interrogatories were retried instead of dismissed , putting the defendant through the burden of another trial and prolonging the time that a non -bailed defendant spends in jail .
Some defendants may also value certainty more than others .
Further , these special verdicts should make the criminal justice system more efficient , perhaps freeing up resources for other defendants .
Thus , the cost - benefit analysis to defendants is not overwhelmingly against special verdicts .
Combined with the potential benefits to the system ’s other participants , the ability of special verdicts to facilitate appellate review should be a plus , not a minus , in the decision to give them in appropriate cases .
E. Interfering with Jury Deliberations
Defendants should be concerned about the potential for special verdicts to confuse , mislead , or otherwise interfere with the jury ’s independent deliberation .
Spock still casts a long shadow over the field , and United States v. Wilson 226 suggested one way that a court might continue to fall afoul of its principle .
Unlike the prior considerations , this one reflects mostly on how to give a special verdict , though it could affect the decision to give one , if for instance the court felt that it could not give a suitably neutral interrogatory in the particular case .
Spock ’s overall concern , that special verdicts could inexorably lead a jury into convicting , 227 shows itself most clearly in cases that also involve a progression of questions .
Thus , in State v. Surette , 228 the jury was given a set of special interrogatories that ( much like those in Spock ) broke down the elements of the charged crime of burglary .
The jury was directed to answer each of four questions “ yes ” or “ no , ” and was told that “ If any question is unanimously answered ‘ No , ’ you must find the defendant not guilty of burglary . ”
229
The court overturned the conviction , holding that “ the special findings form . . . set the tone of the deliberations by directing the jury down a path towards a guilty verdict . ”
230 Since the charged crime was hardly so complicated as to require more aid than jury instructions , 231 the court ’s interrogatories were overly intrusive and fell afoul of the same problem as those in Spock .
Isom v. State 232 was a particularly obvious example of interrogatories improperly setting the tone of deliberations .
There , the jury told the judge at eleven o’clock at night that it was deadlocked .
The judge read them this special question :
Do you unanimously agree that the defendant is guilty of either murder or manslaughter according to the instructions given and that the killing of Frankie Shaw was not in necessary self - defense according to the instructions ?
If your answer is “ yes , ” then you are authorized to return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter .
233
Unsurprisingly , given the blatant hint conveyed by the tone of the question and the timing , the judge ’s actions were held to be reversible error ; they “ in effect . . . peremptorily directed the jury to return a manslaughter conviction without regard to their personal conviction [ , ] and to this extent interfered with the deliberative process of the jury . ”
234 If Allen charges are criticized as potentially encouraging jurors to abandon their principled positions , 235 this should be even more so .
Spock , Surette , and Isom are fairly rare specimens , in that most cases do not involve such blatant attempts to push the jury ’s deliberations down a predetermined path .
Subtler situations , all the same , have also been found objectionable .
For instance , New Jersey ’s Supreme Court described the “ singular vice ” of special interrogatories as the “ subtly coercive effect [ they ] can have upon the course of a jury ’s deliberations .
They can constitute a form of mental conditioning which is antithetical to the untrammeled functioning of the jury . ”
236
The court was provoked to this strong language by the use of special interrogatories to determine whether a defendant ’s alleged acts took place within the statute of limitations .
However , the interrogatories were given in a bifurcated trial ; they thus asked the jury to assume , at the very start , that the offenses had been committed 237 — before going on to decide if the defendant was guilty in a general verdict .
The court noted that special interrogatories are usually upheld when they “ relate the special interrogatories to the jury ’s overall deliberations and its general verdict . ”
238 Since these focused on a particular issue , even before deliberations on the general verdict , and used highly prejudicial phrasing , the conviction had to be overturned .
239
In contrast to its prior case of Spock and the other cases above , the First Circuit offered an example of special interrogatories that did not require reversal .
In United States v. Southard , 240 the jury was given only two questions .
The verdict sheet asked whether the defendant was guilty of a particular crime ; the instructions on the sheet were to consider the second question , whether the defendant was guilty of aiding and abetting , only if the answer to the first question was “ no . ”
241
The court found that the number of questions minimized their leading potential ; 242 each question was also directed at a different offense , though the court did not cite this as a reason .
243
In addition , the timing of the questions — answerable only after the jury had reached at least one general verdict — may have contributed to this decision .
Similarly , in State v. Sheldon , the North Dakota Supreme Court found that a special interrogatory was “ not designed to coerce the jurors into rendering a guilty verdict ” because it was “ necessary to distinguish whether Sheldon was guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor ” ; 244 again , the court did not refer to the timing of the instruction , but it seems implicit in its reasoning .
Other courts have explicitly stated that the timing of a special verdict can be critical to its propriety .
Judge Jon O. Newman , in his thorough and much - cited concurrence in the influential case of United States v. Ruggiero , noted :
It may be worth considering an instruction to the jury . . . that the interrogatory . . . is to be answered only in the event that the jury has agreed upon a general verdict of guilty .
This approach enables the jury to perform its generalized task first , responding to the interrogatory thereafter only if a guilty verdict reflects that the jury has found all the elements of an offense established .
245
The New Jersey Supreme Court later agreed with Judge Newman , specifically noting that the “ step - by - step ” problem could be “ much minimized ” by using this order ; 246 California ’s highest court has suggested a similar rationale .
247 However , Spock specifically rejected the idea that this instruction made any difference to the coerciveness of its interrogatories , 248 indicating that the order of the consideration is not a cure - all solution for overly intrusive interrogatories .
The most extreme solution would be to actually bifurcate deliberations by only handing the jury the form after they state that they have come to a verdict , thus forcing the jury to follow the court ’s wishes as to the order they do things .
249 However , this would lose any benefit of reminding jurors not to overlook miscellaneous factual predicates , for instance .
250
This is simply another example of how special verdicts must walk a fine line between clarifying and assisting deliberations , on the one hand , and compromising the jury ’s independence , on the other .
An instruction that the jury should only fill out the verdict form after a general verdict is reached may be appropriate , but should be expected to play only a minor part in keeping a special verdict from overly influencing jury deliberations .
Special verdicts can break up jury deliberations in ways besides their timing .
A general concern about special verdicts is that they can artificially fragment a trial , causing the jury to give too much weight to certain portions of the case .
251 The Fifth Circuit noted this problem in United States v. Bosch , stating that “ allowing a conviction to flow from a jury ’s verdict which has been limited by judicially fashioned blinders to a single specified fact issue ” is “ fraught with danger for the defendant in particular and for the system in general . ”
252
In that case , there was another unresolved fact issue , and the verdict was reversed .
253
As already discussed , the jury ’s deliberations can be tainted if the special verdict shifts the burden of proof to the defendant .
The Sixth Circuit , which decided Wilson , 254 later confronted a similar issue in an unpublished opinion .
In United States v. Stone , 255 the trial court gave the jury a special interrogatory on drug quantity , and then withdrew it when the jury stated that it was having a hard time answering the question .
256 The Sixth Circuit reversed the conviction , because it feared that the withdrawal suggested to the jury that it could convict on a lower level of proof .
257
In its way , this seems as disruptive as the additional special interrogatory in Isom .
258 Once the jury begins deliberating , the judge should avoid altering the information before the jury .
Courts must consider the fine details of proposed special interrogatories , such as the wording , as well as the structural aspects of the questions .
For instance , in Surette , the court also objected to the special verdict form ’s direction that “ If any question is unanimously answered “ No , ’ you must find the defendant not guilty of burglary . ”
259
It stated that this “ suggested that if all answers were “ yes , ” the defendant was guilty and the verdict must follow accordingly . ”
260 In Leonard v. State , 261 the jury was given a verdict form that was alleged to be suggestively worded ; unlike the above forms , this one was parsed more generously by the Nebraska Supreme Court .
The form read , in part :
The mitigating circumstances we have found above :
Are sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances found .
Yes
Are not sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances found .
Yes
We therefore unanimously set the penalty at death .
We decline to impose the death penalty .
262
The defendant argued that because the “ therefore ” followed the option that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient , the form took away the jury ’s chance to avoid the death penalty , regardless of the balance of aggravating and mitigating factors .
263
The court rejected this argument , saying that the position of the “ decline to impose the death penalty ” option , together with the jury instructions , indicated to the jury that they still had a final option — life .
If the decline option had been placed second , the defendant ’s argument would have had more logical force .
264
The court ’s reasoning seems sound , and the entire question could have been avoided if the verdict form had excluded the “ therefore ” or included the jury instructions on discretion .
In another case considering the wording of a verdict form , the issue was again whether the form precluded the jury from reaching a particular verdict .
In State v. Myers , 265 the form consisted of several questions , going down the scale of lesser - included offenses as to the alleged assault of two people .
The jury was asked to answer “ yes ” or “ no ” to each question .
266
The defendant objected , as the form did not give “ not guilty ” as an option .
The court agreed that it was the “ preferred practice ” to submit “ not guilty ” as a possible verdict , but held that any prejudice was negated by the fact that “ guilty ” did not appear on the form , either .
267
It is possible that the trial judge was attempting to simplify the form by using “ yes ” and “ no ” instead of “ guilty ” and “ not guilty ” ; however , the difference seems so small as to make the more formal , and arguably more accurate , choice the wiser one .
Kentucky ’s Supreme Court recently came to a similar conclusion .
268
There are a number of potential pitfalls that special verdicts may fall into , resulting in interference with the jury ’s deliberations .
If special verdicts are short or have only a few questions directed at each offense , are answered after the jury comes to a general verdict , and are carefully worded , then they are likely to avoid these pitfalls .
Jurisdictions that commonly use special interrogatories should consider creating pattern ones , similar to pattern jury instructions .
269
V. Conclusion
As this examination has shown , special verdict forms and special interrogatories are presently being used for a number of different purposes in a wide variety of criminal cases .
However , the jurisprudence of special verdicts has not been developed with a depth that matches the breadth of current use ; although courts consider a number of factors in deciding whether and how to give special verdicts in different cases , they do not usually consider more than one factor in any given case .
However , when special verdicts are used properly , they can play several functions in the criminal justice system .
These functions , and not narrow judicial categories , should provide the framework for courts to analyze whether to give special verdicts .
First , special verdicts can assist the jury .
In complex or confusing cases , special verdicts can help the jury remember the case , keeping any number of things — charges , acts , even defendants — straight .
They can also remind the jury not to overlook an important piece of the case , such as an unusual factual requirement or a legal prerequisite like jurisdiction .
Second , special verdicts can assist other participants in the system , sometimes more than one at a time .
For instance , a special verdict can ensure unanimity on an element of the crime , protecting the defendant ; it would also ease appellate review , as do special verdicts on novel theories of law and alternate grounds of conviction .
A special verdict can also provide information for the judge to consider in setting the grade of the offense or in sentencing the defendant .
Obviously , a special verdict can serve many functions at once ; a special interrogatory asking whether the defendant committed various predicate acts makes the case less confusing for the jury , protects the defendant by ensuring unanimity and lessening prejudicial spillover from various bad acts alleged at trial , may provide the judge with information relevant to sentencing , and clarifies the record for appellate review .
Because special verdict forms and special interrogatories serve more than one function , courts should not limit themselves to only one consideration when deciding whether to give a special verdict in a case , or when reviewing a lower court ’s decision .
Instead of a formalist approach of forcing cases into categories ( i.e. , unanimous or not , complex or not , jury sentencing or not ) , courts should adopt a functional approach : Would using a special verdict provide a significant benefit in this case ?
Special verdicts are obviously neither necessary nor desirable in every case , so courts should consider the default to be a general verdict , only using special verdicts where there is a clear and articulable benefit to be gained from changing procedure .
Courts must then ask what detriment , if any , the defendant will experience if the special verdict is used .
In many cases , the special verdict will be to the defendant ’s benefit , if not at her request , but the legacy of Spock should not be dismissed lightly .
If there would be serious harm to the defendant , harm that could not be allayed by carefully wording the verdict form and the jury instructions , then the court should not give the special verdict , even if the benefit would be great .
In other words , the test should not be a simple balancing ; because of the presumptions of innocence and in favor of the general verdict , any harm to the defendant should be given more weight .
On the other hand , this does not mean that any benefit to the defendant should outweigh harm to another actor ; United States v. Ogando is an excellent example of the absurdities to which that could lead .
270 Throughout this entire analysis , courts should use the considerations they currently do , but as tools to focus on the functions of special verdicts .
Hopefully , attorneys will use a similar functional analysis in deciding whether to seek or oppose special verdicts .
The following list of questions is an example of this functional analysis that may be of use to practitioners .
The analysis should begin by determining whether a special verdict would be useful .
Would a special verdict form or special interrogatories assist the jury in its deliberations ?
Is the case complex or confusing with regard to defendants , charges , or acts ?
Comment : Not all forms of complexity lend themselves to special verdicts .
In order to avoid potentially leading the jury towards a guilty verdict , special verdicts should only be used when the potentially confusing elements are separable charges , defendants , or acts .
Does the case involve an important legal prerequisite or factual requirement that might be overlooked by the jury ?
Comment :
This might include jurisdiction ( if the location of the crime is at issue ) , whether the statute of limitations has expired , or whether a witness is an accomplice .
Would a special verdict form or special interrogatories help protect the defendant ?
Do unusual circumstances make the unanimity requirement of particular concern ?
Comment :
This inquiry is related to the complexity inquiry , since complexity is one reason why unanimity could be a problem for the jury .
However , jurors must be unanimous on all of the elements of a crime , not simply the confusing ones .
As a result , unanimity poses additional considerations such as the sufficiency of the evidence and ease of appellate review .
Could the defendant be exposed to prejudicial spillover from evidence of other bad acts , whether alleged to have been committed by the defendant or by other people ?
Comment :
This is also closely related to , but not congruent with , the complexity inquiry .
Does the jury play a role in sentencing ?
Comment : Death penalty cases are the most obvious example of this , since the jury must find the aggravating factors necessary to impose the death penalty .
However , special verdicts should be considered strongly in any situation where the jury finds facts that are directly relevant to the defendant ’s sentence .
Would a special verdict form or special interrogatories facilitate appellate review ?
Are any of the parties advancing a novel or contested theory or interpretation of the law ?
Comment : A special verdict could ease appellate review by revealing whether or not the jury relied on the controversial theory .
Could the jury reach a verdict on alternate theories ?
Comment :
This raises problems of determining both the sufficiency of the evidence and jury unanimity .
Are there any other circumstances that would make a special verdict form or special interrogatories useful ?
If there is no significant benefit to using a special verdict form or special interrogatories , then the inquiry should be at an end because of the general preference for general verdicts .
If there is a significant benefit , then a further question must be asked : Would a special verdict form or special interrogatories be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant ?
Could the special verdict improperly focus the jury ’s attention on one area , causing it to give less weight to other considerations ?
Comment : Special verdicts separating out charges , defendants , or acts should generally not pose a problem in this regard .
However , special interrogatories that claim to involve factual or legal prerequisites should receive close scrutiny .
Could the special verdict have the effect of improperly shifting the burden of proof to the defendant ?
Comment : Defenses are the most obvious area where this might be a problem , since the interrogatories could imply that the jury has to be unanimous on the defense .
Do the proposed questions contain language that is confusing or could be perceived as coercive or restricting the jury ’s deliberations ?
Comment :
This inquiry will generally not prevent a special verdict from being used , since it will likely be rare that a special verdict could not be worded in a way that does not invade the jury ’s province .
Instead , it may result in offered questions being reworded .
Are there any other circumstances that would make use of a special verdict prejudicial to the defendant ?
If the special verdict would be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant , then it should not be given .
Special verdict forms and special interrogatories are a growing part of the criminal jury trial .
This Note has attempted to illuminate some of their benefits and their risks .
If courts and attorneys keep in mind that the basic functions behind jury deliberation are fact - finding and applying the independent conscience of the community , then they should be able to balance the benefits and risks of special verdicts to improve the jury system to everyone ’s benefit .

Federal law requires a jury to unanimously specify any aggravating factors it finds , and permits any jury member to specify mitigating factors , when deciding whether to impose the death penalty .
18 U.S.C. 3593 (d ) ( 2001 ) .
The states vary on whether mitigating factors must be specified .
States that make no explicit provision for special interrogatories on mitigating factors , while requiring that aggravating factors be found , include California , Cal. Penal Code 190.4 ( 2001 ) ; New Mexico , State v. Henderson , 789 P.2d 603 , 610 ( N.M. 1990 ) ( holding that this means that harmless error analysis cannot be applied to invalid aggravating circumstances ) ; and Oregon , Or. Rev. Stat. 163.150 ( 1999 ) .
Connecticut requires that both be found in special verdicts .

States that make the use of special verdicts optional include Delaware , Sullivan v. State , 636 A.2d 931 , 945 ( Del. 1994 ) ( both mitigating and aggravating , as part of jury ’s advisory role ) ; Florida , Jackson v.

July 8 , 2002 ) ( Pariente , J. , concurring ) ( discussing questions raised by Ring as to the constitutionality of Florida ’s death penalty statute , and noting that “ the question also arises as to whether any or all of these problems could be solved by requiring the use of a special verdict ” ) .
54 . E.g. , United States v. Buishas , 791 F.2d 1310 , 1317 ( 7th Cir. 1986 ) ; United States v. Pforzheimer , 826 F.2d 200 , 206 ( 2d Cir. 1987 ) ( following Buishas ) .
55 . E.g. , United States v. Jacobo , 934 F.2d 411 , 416-17 ( 2d Cir. 1991 ) ( remanding for the district court to make independent findings ) ; United States v. Rey , 923 F.2d 1217 , 1223 ( 6th Cir. 1991 ) ; United States v. McKenzie , 922 F.2d 1323 , 1327-28 ( 7th Cir. 1991 ) .
56 . E.g. , United States v. Owens , 904 F.2d 411 , 413-15 ( 8th Cir. 1990 ) ( different Guidelines calculations ) ; Newman v. United States , 817 F.2d 635 , 637 ( 10th Cir. 1987 ) ( different statutory maximums ) ; United States v. Dennis , 786 F.2d 1029 , 1038 -39 ( 11th Cir. 1986 ) ( different statutory maximums ) .
57 . 523 U.S. 511 , 514 ( 1998 ) ( holding that the object of the conspiracy was a sentencing consideration like the quantity ) .
58 . E.g. , United States v. Rhynes , 206 F.3d 349 , 380 ( 4th Cir. 1999 ) ( “ With these general verdicts , it is thus impossible to determine on which statutory object or objects — sale of heroin , cocaine , cocaine base , or marijuana — the conspiracy conviction was based .
Accordingly . . .
Edwards prohibited the district court from imposing a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum for the least - punished object on which the conspiracy conviction could have been based ” ) ( emphasis added ) ; United States v. Conley , 92 F.3d 157 , 165 ( 3d Cir. 1996 ) .
However , a sentence within the statutory maximums , based on the Guidelines , does not require special verdicts .
United States v. Brown , 148 F.3d 1003 , 1010 - 11 ( 8th Cir. 1998 ) ( overruling Owens ) ; Conley , 92 F.3d at 168 .
59 .
The change wrought by the Guidelines is neatly encapsulated by two cases concerning changes to the sentencing rules during a conspiracy .
In United States v. Ogull , 149 F. Supp. 272 ( S.D.N.Y. 1957 ) , the district court judge stated that he could not “ constitutionally make the factual determination [ as to whether the conspiracy continued past the statute ’s effective date ] . . . .
The appropriate arm of the court for this purpose is the jury , and history and common sense authorize it to perform this function . . . .
I feel justified in submitting the special questions . ”
Id. at 278-79 .
Thirty - four years later , United States v. Devine , 934 F.2d 1325 ( 5th Cir. 1991 ) , upheld a trial court ’s refusal to give a nearly - identical interrogatory on whether the conspiracy continued after the effective date of the Guidelines .
Instead of a constitutional problem , the Fifth Circuit found that the question would amount to simply a “ determination from the jury on a question related to sentencing , which was clearly not within the province of the jury to decide . ”

Minnesota has not followed the federal trend .

60 . United States v. Romo , 914 F.2d 889 , 895 ( 7th Cir. 1990 ) ; cf. United States v. Morgano , 39 F.3d 1358 , 1369 ( 7th Cir. 1994 ) ( permitting a situation in which , despite the jury ’s finding that the defendants did not commit certain predicate acts , the judge found they did for sentencing purposes , because of the different standards of proof ) .
61 . Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 466 ( 2000 ) .
62 . Id. at 490 .
Facts that raise statutory minimums , however , may still be found by the judge .
Harris v. United States , 122 S. Ct. 2406 , 2420 ( 2002 ) , aff ’g McMillan v. Pennsylvania , 477 U.S. 79 ( 1986 ) .
As Ring v. Arizona held , see supra note 53 , Apprendi applies to death penalty cases .
However , Ring is unlikely to increase the use of interrogatories in federal court , since federal juries were already required to specify aggravating factors when imposing the death penalty .
Supra note 49 .
63 . E.g. , United States v. Vazquez , 271 F.3d 93 , 116 ( 3rd Cir. 2001 ) ( Becker , C.J. , concurring ) ( including as an appendix “ a special interrogatory on drug quantity prepared by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and used without incident or problem by the judges of the district court since Jones , ” id. at 114 ) ; United States v. Promise , 255 F.3d 150 , 157 n.6 ( 4th Cir. 2001 ) ( en banc ) ( citing state cases using special verdict forms ) ; see also United States v. Neuhausser , 241 F.3d 460 , 471 n.8 ( 6th Cir. 2001 ) ( “ While we hold that there was no ambiguity . . . in this case , we do not wish to discourage the Government or the trial court from using separate counts , special verdict forms , or more specific instructions in future cases involving multiple - object conspiracies . ” ) .
But cf. Derman v. United States , 298 F.3d 34 , 42 n.4 ( 1st Cir. 2002 ) ( “ This does not mean that a jury need return a special verdict . . . .
It is enough that the jury supportably determines , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the conspiracy involves a drug quantity that surpasses the threshold amount needed to trigger the relevant ( higher ) statutory maximum .
See , e.g. , United States v. Patterson , 292 F.3d 615 , 623 ( 9th Cir. 2002 ) ( finding no Apprendi error when jury returned a guilty verdict after being instructed on only a threshold quantity ) . ” ) .
64 . E.g. , United States v. Trennell , 290 F.3d 881 , 890 ( 7th Cir. 2002 ) ( holding that a special verdict and proper jury instructions made any Apprendi error in the indictment harmless ) ; United States v. Flaharty , 295 F.3d 182 , 196 ( 2nd Cir. 2002 ) ( same ) ; United States v. Borders , 270 F.3d 1180 , 1184 -85 ( 2001 ) ( noting that use of a special verdict contributed to Apprendi ’s requirements being satisfied ) ; see also United States v.

United States , 785 A.2d 672 , 686 n.10 ( D.C. 2001 ) ( noting that “ in some instances , [ Apprendi ] may cause the trial judge to utilize special interrogatories or a special verdict form ” in life without parole cases ) ; see also State v. Watson , 788 A.2d 812 , 820 ( N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2002 ) ( “ However , until [ Apprendi ’s application to the Graves Act , which provides for mandatory parole ineligibility for firearms use , is decided ] , we urge trial judges to try Graves
Act cases as if [ the jury was required to find the factors relating to the parole disqualifier ] .
In other words , if use or possession of a firearm is not an element of the offense , a special verdict should be presented to the jury on that issue . ” ) .
66 . E.g. , United States v. Howard , 106 F.3d 70 , 75 ( 5th Cir. 1997 ) ( quoting a line of cases indicating the Circuit ’s “ frequent acknowledgment of this more and more obvious fact [ :] firearms are “ tools of the trade ’ of those engaged in illegal drug activities ” ) .
67 .
The leading case is United States v. Sims , 975 F.2d 1225 , 1235-36 ( 6th Cir. 1992 ) .
18 U.S.C. 924 ( c ) imposes minimum sentences for the use of firearms in a variety of federal crimes ; the sentences vary by type of firearm .
The court held that a district judge must make sure that “ no defendant will be convicted on more than one gun count relative to the one drug trafficking offense , ” and that special interrogatories were a permissible , though not mandatory , way of accomplishing this .

Subsequent cases have emphasized the district court ’s discretion .

This falls into two categories .
The first is felony - murder .
State v. Phillips , 46 P.3d 1048 , 1054 ( Ariz. 2002 ) ( noting that the jury found both felony and premeditated murder in response to a special interrogatory ) ; Commonwealth v. Raymond , 676 N.E.2d 824 , 834 ( Mass. 1997 ) ( holding that special interrogatories avoid the imposition of a sentence for an underlying felony that merged with a felony - murder conviction ) ; State v. Colvin , 548 A.2d 506 , 514 ( Md. 1988 ) ( same ) ; cf. Schad v. Arizona , 501 U.S. 624 , 645 ( 1991 )
( “ We do not , of course , suggest that jury instructions requiring increased verdict specificity are not desirable , and in fact the Supreme Court of Arizona has itself recognized that separate verdict forms are useful in cases submitted to a jury on alternative theories of premeditated and felony murder .
We hold only that the Constitution did not command such a practice on the facts of this case . ” ) ( citation omitted ) .
The second is where killing is considered first - degree murder if the victim is a law enforcement officer , where the defendant knew or reasonably should have known the officer was performing her duties .
State v. Hoffman , 804 P.2d 577 , 602 ( Wash . 1991 ) ; see also Chandler v. State , 421 S.E.2d 288 , 293 ( Ga. Ct. App. 1992 ) ( finding special verdict forms deficient in an assault case , because they did not inquire as to defendant ’s knowledge regarding the victim ) .
97 . People v. Whitaker , 32 P.3d 511 , 518-19 ( Colo. Ct. App. 2000 ) ( holding that special interrogatories were permissible , but not mandatory , under special offender sentencing enhancement statute for drug crimes , Colo . Rev. Stat . 18-18-407 ) ; Garringer v. State , 909 P.2d 1142 , 1150 ( Haw. 1996 ) .
Though Garringer was a firearms case , the court spoke broadly of the need for special interrogatories , stating , “ the circuit court should instruct the jury , by special verdict interrogatories , to make any and all findings relevant to the imposition of enhanced sentences where the requisite aggravating circumstances are intrinsic to the commission of the crime charged . ”
See also Pope v. State , 737 N.E.2d 374 , 379-80 ( Ind. 2000 ) ( rejecting a requirement of written findings , but finding no fundamental error in the provision of forms for the jury ’s recommendation in life without parole case ) ; State v.

Petra Nemcova 's Racy Lingerie Photo Shoot - Tres Jolie
is featured in a new ad campaign for Tres Jolie , a French lingerie manufacturer .
The gorgeous photos show the 28 year old in a winter wonderland setting
Rumors have run rampant that the supermodel is dating Sean Penn .
She was photographed with the 47 year old actor at a post Oscar party given by Elton John .
They have also been spotted together at Los Angeles club Villa earlier this month .
Nemcova has downplayed any romance with the actor .
Penn recently split with his wife Robin Wright , ending an 11 year marriage .
Check out the rest of the photo shoot after the jump .
Lenovo's buttoned - up Thinkpad X300 ultraportable notebook computer may not have the MacBook Air 's superslim Spartan style , but after firing up the X300 , it 's hard to not love this laptop .
From rock - solid construction to piled - in perks , this biz - centric beast provides just about everything that matters to the modern road warrior .
The Air and X300 do have some similarities .
They both have crisp 13.3 - inch displays ( although the X300 has a higher resolution - - 1440 - by - 900 pixels vs. 1280 - by - 800 ) , and both offer 64GB solid state drives ( An SSD comes standard with Lenovo 's machine , but tacks about $ 1,000 onto the Air 's price tag ; if you equip them similarly , the notebooks cost about the same ) .
Whether you 're afraid of dropping your laptop at the airport or accidentally spilling some coffee on the case , the X300 is built like -- and resembles - - a black box recorder .
The keyboard is spill resistant , and the textured carbon - and glass - fiber exterior is supposed to protect the innards ; it feels good to the touch , too .
Now , technically , the X300 is a little chunky side for a true ultralight - a little over an inch thick and 3.4 pounds ( 4 pounds with AC adapter ) as opposed to the Air's 3 - pound heft .
Then again , you can pop a disc in the ThinkPad 's paper - thin , three - ounce DVD drive and actually watch movies as opposed to trying to stuff an external drive in with the Air in that manila envelope .
( You CAN remove the drive , which leaves you with a machine weighing just 3.1 pounds )
The X300 has a decent amount of power for an ultralight notebook -- in fact , it scored surprisingly well against other ultralights .
With a 1.2GHz Core 2 Duo L7100 processor and 2GB of RAM , it scored a 64 , outpacing the MacBook Air by a healthy 7 points in WorldBench 6 Beta 2 tests .
On the other hand , the X300's performance is exactly average compared to the broad field of ultraportables we 've tested .
It posted an average score in our battery life tests too , lasting 4 hours and 22 minutes on a charge .
Another thumb in Apple 's eye is the X300's many features .
Here you have a notebook not much thicker than Air but , not only does it manage to slot in a DVD drive , it also has three USB 2.0 ports , a VGA - out port for an external display , a webcam , headphone and microphone jacks , and an ethernet port .
The Air has a webcam , but it has only one USB port , and you have to use an optional adapter to connect via ethernet .
Speaking of options , the X300 is probably the only ultraportable PC that gives you both a touchpoint and a trackpad .
Obviously it boils down to personal preference , but at least you can choose .
As is often the case with ThinkPads , the keyboard feels great .
There 's enough tactile feedback on the full - sized keys to allow quick , accurate typing .
To make life even easier is the one shortcut key to rule them all -- the ThinkVantage button .
Most notebooks have some sort of shortcut to helpful utilities or a " For Dummies ... " version of the control panel .
However , this is by far the most helpful , complete , and concise collection of them .
You can use the button to access a backup utility , to set security protocols , or to find a wireless data connection , and if your computer wo n't boot , the button will make the computer boot a small non-Windows OS from a hidden hard drive partition , after which you can diagnose problems and even download drivers , if necessary .
And when you do start searching for wireless connectivity options , you are fully covered with the X300 .
Among the highlights , this notebook has built - in support for 802 .
11a/b/g/n , Wireless WAN , Wireless USB , Bluetooth , and the " gee - whiz " feature of the month : GPS ( an army of travelling salesmen are cheering somewhere with that addition ) .
I have one minor concern :
The hidden OS and drive image for bringing it back to factory defaults reside on the notebook 's hard drive .
The X300's meager 64GB solid - state drive will probably fill up quick , and between Windows , your applications , and the hidden image , you 're left with precious little room for your files .
But otherwise , while it does cost a fair amount , Lenovo proves that you can cram everything you need into a tiny package .
Python image processing

A computer language can allow to be compiled to very fast programs .
While Python does n't shine in that regard , it 's very good for its flexibility and its large availability of third party libraries ( many are present into its standard library too ) .
The availability of good external libraries is sometimes even more important than the language itself .
Python flexibility allows explorative programming , that can be quite useful for certain purposes , like certain kinds of data / text / signal / image processing .
The following is a Jpeg image that is masked with some random white and black pixels :
With the help of the Python Imaging library PIL ( and few other things ) , it 's very easy and fast to explore ways to filter the image .
This image filtering problem is easy , because it 's rather easy to tell the noise from the signal , but it 's not immediate either because the original image is in a compressed Jpeg format , so those white points are noisy because of the lossy nature of the Jpeg compression , and around them there are more Jpeg artifacts .
A face is a very easy subject , because the human visual system needs only a little data ( probably as little as an 13x13 image , in 8 greys , that 's less than 64 bytes ) to tell them apart .
In a short time I have written the following code , it contains few wrappers that help reduce the processing code to a minimum , allowing a faster exploration of image processing ideas :
from random import choice from colorsys import rgb_to_yiq import Image # Python PIL from select import median # my libs import psyco ; psyco . full ( ) class InImage : def __init__ ( self , filename ) : self .
inim = Image . open ( filename ) self .
nx , self .
ny = self .
inim .
size self .
inmat = self .
inim . load ( ) def __getitem__ ( self , ( x , y ) ) : return self .
inmat [ x % self .
nx , y % self .
ny ] def all_coords ( self ) : for y in xrange ( self .
ny ) : for x in xrange ( self . nx ) : yield x , y def neigh ( self , x , y , lenx = 3 , leny = 3 ) : assert lenx & 1 and leny & 1 for posy in xrange ( - leny / 2 + 1 , leny / 2 + 1 ) : for posx in xrange ( - lenx / 2 + 1 , lenx / 2 + 1 ) : yield self [ x + posx , y + posy ] def neigh33 ( self , x , y ) : return [ self [ x - 1 , y - 1 ] , self [ x , y - 1 ] , self [ x + 1 , y - 1 ] , self [ x - 1 , y ] , self [ x , y ] , self [ x + 1 , y ] , self [ x - 1 , y + 1 ] , self [ x , y + 1 ] , self [ x + 1 , y + 1 ] ] class OutImage : def __init__ ( self , in_image ) : self .
nx , self .
ny = in_image .
nx , in_image .
ny self .
outim = in_image .
inim . copy ( ) self .
outmat = self .
outim . load ( ) def __setitem__ ( self , ( x , y ) , value ) : self .
outmat [ x % self .
nx , y % self .
ny ] = value def save ( self , filename , * args , ** kwds ) : self .
outim .
save ( filename , * args , ** kwds ) def luminance ( ( r , g , b ) ) : return rgb_to_yiq ( r / 255.0 , g / 255.0 , b / 255.0 ) [ 0 ] def main ( ) : m1 = InImage ( " face_part.jpg " ) m2 = OutImage ( m1 ) K = 0.8 lastPixel = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) for x , y in m1 .
all_coords ( ) : # m2[x , y ] = sorted ( m1.neigh33( x , y ) , key=luminance ) [ 4 ] # 3x3 median # m2[ x , y ] = max ( m1.neigh33( x , y ) , key=luminance ) # 3x3 max # m2 [ x , y ] = min( m1.neigh33( x , y ) , key=luminance ) # 3x3 min if luminance ( m1 [ x , y ] ) < K : lastPixel = m1 [ x , y ] else : nonwhite = [ ( luminance ( p ) , p ) for p in m1 .
neigh33 ( x , y ) if luminance ( p ) < K ] if nonwhite : lastPixel = median ( nonwhite ) [ 1 ] m2 [ x , y ] = lastPixel m2 . save ( " face_part_elab.jpg " , quality = 99 ) main ( )
In the code m1 is the input image , and m2 is the output one .
The OutImage copies the whole input image ( that is a fast operation , because it 's done in C ) , so you can skip plotting the pixels that you do n't change .
The luminance ( ) uses the really easy color conversion functions of the Python std lib , using the Y is rough , but it 's enough for this simple processing .
I have wrapped both __getitem__ and __setitem__ so it uses modular coordinates , this is a slow but high - level way to solve the border problem that most neighborhood filters have .
To speed up the exploration I have cut a small pice of the original image ( using jpegCrop , it 's a lossless operation because no Jpeg DCT is recomputed ) :
Now it 's really easy to use Python to do some of the usual image processing , like a median on a 3x3 neighborhood :
m 2[x , y ] = sorted ( m1.neigh33( x , y ) , key=luminance ) [ 4 ]
Minimum in the same 3x3 neighborhood :
m 2[x , y ] = min( m1.neigh33(x , y ) , key=luminance )
Max 3x3 :
m 2[x , y ] = max ( m1.neigh33( x , y ) , key=luminance )
The filtering algorithm that can be seen in the code is quite simple .
if a pixel is n't very bright , then skip it , because probably it 's not noise .
Otherwise among its 3x3 neighborhood take only non-white pixels , and plot their median , sorting them according to their luminance again .
If all pixels are white , then it uses the color of the last plotted pixel ( you can see it on the nails ) .
This is the result on the whole image :
The algorithm can be improved to take care of the few black dots present in the original image .
Some zones are gray , maybe because around the white pixels the Jpeg did n't encode the two color channels much .
To fix that problem you can color them by hand with a painting program in few minutes , or you can find the saturation & value in some neighborhood of the pixel ( using a good enough chromatic transform , but the CIECAM97 may be overkill for this job ) .

UTSIRA , Norway ( Reuters ) - Giant turbines the size of jumbo jets bobbing on the North Sea may soon become as common off Norway as oil and gas platforms .
An artist 's rendering of a giant turbine the size of a jumbo jet which may soon become as common off Norway as oil and gas platforms is seen in this undated handout illustration .
Norway 's government is contemplating licensing " blocks " for offshore wind generation , and Norwegian oil company Statoil Hydro aims to start work next year on a floating turbine project near the site of the first North Sea oil discovery 40 years ago .

At least that is the ambition of Norwegian authorities and industry , eager to splash some green on their oily image and use their offshore expertise to corner a potentially lucrative new market -- floating wind farms in deep sea waters .
Norway ’s government is contemplating licensing “ blocks ” for offshore wind generation , and Norwegian oil company Statoil Hydro aims to start work next year on a floating turbine project near the site of the first North Sea oil discovery 40 years ago .
“ We are the best place in Norway if you love wind , ” Mayor Jarle Nilsen said of Utsira , a North Sea island of just 6 sq km ( 2.3 square miles ) and home to 210 people who already get most of their power from two onshore turbines .
“ We had wind every day except one last year , ” he told Reuters , thrilled by the prospect of two experimental offshore wind projects anchoring in nearby waters .
With Europe ’s second - longest coastline after Greece , Norway is hard hit by winds blowing off the Atlantic and , along with Britain , well placed for wind energy projects .
Offshore turbines can be twice as powerful as land - based units due to stronger , more sustained winds at sea .
Out of sight from the coast , such wind farms could use modified , more efficient turbines because limiting noise , a key concern for land - based wind farms , is not as critical offshore .
The technology is not tested and costly offshore repairs could quickly drive up costs , analysts say .
The price of wind electricity produced will also probably stay above that of conventional fossil fuel - based power for years to come , meaning that state subsidies play a major role .
“ We have been very clear in saying that there are exciting prospects in offshore wind and indeed floating wind , ” said Deputy Energy and Petroleum Minister Liv Monica Stubholt .

“ But we also acknowledge that experts advise us to ‘ hurry slowly ’ because there are still considerable technological hurdles that need to be hopped . ”
FURTHER , DEEPER
Windpower is growing and set to top 100 gigawatts in installed global capacity in 2008 in a push for alternatives to coal - or gas - powered plants , which emit heat - trapping gasses .
Still , wind accounts for only 1 percent of the global power mix .
About 98 percent of that capacity is at land - based turbines but new technology and the benefits of pushing windfarms away from populated areas are strengthening the offshore market -- presently led by Britain and Denmark .
The Brussels - based Global Wind Energy Council has forecast that the world ’s wind market will reach 240 GW by 2012 , with a growing share coming from offshore .
Britain has an ambitious goal for 35 GW in installed offshore wind capacity by 2020 .
The floating turbine concept allows wind farms to wade further out to sea .
Anchored to the seabed , they can be built in deeper waters where the sea floor would be too soft for standing turbines .
StatoilHydro ’s project , expected to get an official go - ahead soon , will be a 2.3 megawatt turbine , with a diameter of 107 meters and jutting nearly 80 meters above the water .
A further 120 meters of the floating concrete hull will be submerged .
The “ Hywind ” project , which includes German Siemens ’ wind power unit , will test the technology and look for ways to cut operating and maintenance costs for the giant turbines to be located in water depths of up to 700 meters .
If the demonstration project succeeds , more may come early next decade to provide supplemental electricity for places such as some North Sea platforms or coastal Norwegian towns .
“ It also has global potential in places with the proper sea and wind conditions , a suitable market size and the right price incentives , ” said Jan -Fredrik Stadaas , head of wind energy project development at StatoilHydro .
Such markets could include the United States , Canada , Spain and Portugal , France , Japan and Britain , Stadaas said .
TILTING INTO THE WIND
Another project , led by Norwegian utilities Statkraft and Lyse and including StatoilHydro and Shell , seeks to build wind turbine towers that tilt against the wind to withstand severe North Sea conditions .
A full - scale 5 MW prototype of the “ Sway ” turbine is planned in 2010 .
The Norwegian government is providing cash to both projects but the real test of its resolve will come in its offshore wind regulations , which may mimic the country ’s oil and gas rules .
Deputy Minister Stubholt said Norway may offer offshore wind power licenses in specific blocks , along with incentives .
She said Norway was slow to embrace wind energy because most of its electricity already comes from clean hydropower , limiting demand for more renewable energy .
Industry officials hope the state aid plans include investment - based subsidies or feed - in tariffs , where offshore generators would be given a steady price for their electricity , as well as link - ups to existing grids .
“ Given concerns about reliability of untested technology and a virtually non-existent market for offshore wind installation and maintenance , these projects require an active role by the state to lower some of the risks , ” said one industry official .
A team of German scientists say they have cracked the encryption of a device widely used in keyless entry systems that electronically secure cars , garages and office buildings .
The finding by the scientists from Ruhr University in Bochum , Germany , means it is now relatively straightforward to clone the remote control devices that act as the electronic keys that unlock these restricted areas .
In a paper published earlier this week , they demonstrated a method they say completely breaks the encryption used in the Keeloq security system , which is used by manufacturers of cars , garage door openers and other devices .
The hardware - based block cipher is made by US - based Microchip Technology and is used by Honda , Toyota , Volvo , Volkswagen and other manufacturers to securely transmit access codes that are transmitted using radio frequency identification technology .
The scientists from Ruhr 's Electrical Engineering and Information Sciences Department were able to defeat the Keeloq 's security because it relies on poor key management , in which every key is derived from a master key that 's stored in the reading device , according to Timo Kasper , a PhD candidate who worked on the paper .
Moreover , it uses a proprietary algorithm that had already been shown to generate cryptographically weak output .
The algorithm was kept secret for most of the two decades it 's been in use .
That changed about 18 months ago , when an an entry on Wikipedia published the cipher .
The research team almost immediately spotted weaknesses .
" If they had made it public they would have found out 20 years ago that it 's insecure , " Kasper said in an interview .
" Now it 's a little bit too late , because it 's already built into all the garages and cars . "
Microchip officials would n't be interviewed for this story .
They issued a statement that stated : " The most recently published German paper on theoretical attack requires detailed knowledge of the system implementation and a combination of data , specialized skills , equipment and access to various components of a system , which is seldom feasible .
These theoretical attacks are not unique to the Keeloq system and could be applied to virtually any security system . "
The paper describes a two - step approach to the crack .
The first is what 's known as a side - channel attack to deduce the master key that manufacturers build into each car lock , garage door opener or other access device that is equipped with Keeloq .
One side - channel technique uses an oscilloscope to map how much power is used at precise time intervals while the Keeloq - based access device derives a new key .
A similar method analyzes electromagnetic radiation .
Because most access devices are publicly available , it 's not too hard for attackers to get their hands on one to perform the analysis .
The hack requires about $ 3,000 worth of equipment and a fair amount of technical skill , but once the unique master key for a particular model is available , it works universally , Kasper said .
Read on for the second step in the attack .

Right in the middle of the Statuary Hall service for the late Tom Lantos , a Republican went to the floor — just steps from the solemn proceedings — and called a procedural vote , apparently out of pique .
Now that ’s mature .
And a fine display of “ family values . ”
The incident has led to a game of “ but they started it . ”
Martin Kady II :
Minority Leader John Boehner ’s spokesman Michael Steel has put out a statement blaming Democrats for the chaos during Lantos ’ service .
“ This morning , during the memorial service for Tom Lantos — a public servant beloved on both sides of the aisle — the House Democratic leadership violated an agreement and called the House back into session , ” Steel said .
“ They took this action despite clearly understanding that it would trigger a series of procedural motions .
This cheap , cynical political move seems to have been designed to shut down one of the few procedural tools that can be employed by the minority party in the House .
Playing this sort of game during the memorial service of a great and good man is beneath the dignity of this House and should be beneath the dignity of Democratic leaders . ”
Either way , the disruption of Lantos ’ service looks tawdry .
Jonathein Stein has videos of the incident and reports Florida ’s Lincoln Diaz - Balart was the Republican in question .
Here you can watch C - SPAN interrupt their coverage of the memorial because “ the House has been gaveled back into session . ”
The juxtaposition of the ongoing memorial and the procedural vote is rather chilling as well :
Warning :
The latter also contains the unconscionable butchering of the Beatles song “ All You Need is Love . ”
Which , under the circumstances , is as ironic as the rendition is awful .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Saturday vetoed legislation passed by Congress that would have banned the CIA from using waterboarding and other controversial interrogation techniques .

Lawmakers included the anti-torture measure in a broader bill authorizing U.S. intelligence activities .
“ Because the danger remains , we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists , ” Bush said in his weekly radio address .
He added that the vetoed legislation “ would diminish these vital tools . ”
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats would try to overturn Bush ’s veto and said U.S. moral authority was at stake .
“ We will begin to reassert that moral authority by attempting to override the president ’s veto next week , ” Pelosi said .
Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts called Bush ’s veto “ one of the most shameful acts of his presidency . ”
It is unlikely that Democrats , the majority party in Congress , could muster enough votes to overturn Bush ’s veto .
The bill passed the House and Senate on partisan votes , short of the support needed to reverse the president .
The House approved the legislation in December and the Senate passed it in February despite White House warnings it would be vetoed .
CIA Director Michael Hayden told Congress last month that government interrogators used waterboarding on three suspects captured after the September 11 attacks .
The simulated drowning technique has been condemned by many members of Congress , human rights groups and other countries as a form of illegal torture .
The U.S. Army Field Manual prohibits waterboarding and seven other interrogation methods and the bill would have aligned CIA practices with the military ’s .
In a message to CIA employees on Saturday after Bush ’s veto , Hayden said the CIA would continue to work strictly within the law but said its needs were different from that of the U.S. Army and that the CIA needed to follow its own procedures .
“ There are methods in CIA ’s program that have been briefed to our oversight committees , are fully consistent with the Geneva Convention and current U.S. law , and are most certainly not torture , ” Hayden said .
In his remarks , Bush did not specifically mention waterboarding .
But he said : “ The bill Congress sent me would not simply ban one particular interrogation method , as some have implied .
Instead , it would eliminate all the alternative procedures we ’ve developed to question the world ’s most dangerous and violent terrorists . ”
97 percent of US death toll came after ' Mission Accomplished ' Agence France - Presse

Print This Email This BAGHDAD ( AFP ) 
The death toll of US soldiers in the five - year Iraq conflict has hit 4,000 in what the US military said Monday was a " tragic " loss of lives after four troops were killed in a Baghdad bombing .
The four soldiers died when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb while on patrol late Sunday in southern Baghdad , bringing the overall toll to 4,000 , according to an AFP tally based on independent website .
Another soldier was wounded in the attack , a military statement said .
The chaotic and brutal conflict which is now in its sixth year has also wounded more than 29,000 American soldiers , according to icasualties.org .
At least 97 percent of the deaths occurred after US President George W. Bush announced the end of " major combat " in Iraq on May 1 , 2003 , as the military became caught between a raging anti-American insurgency and brutal sectarian strife unleashed since the toppling of Saddam .
140 American servicemembers died before May 1 , 2003 , out of a total 4,000 .
Despite the losses , Bush on the eve of the war 's fifth anniversary defended his decision to invade Iraq , vowing no retreat as he promised American soldiers would triumph despite the " high cost in lives and treasure . "
US military spokesman in Baghdad , Rear Admiral Gregory Smith , said the loss of every soldier was " tragic " .
" No casualty is more or less significant than another ; each soldier , marine , airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic , " Smith told AFP .
" Being in the military means we are willingly in harm 's way to protect others in order to bring hope and a sustainable security to the Iraqi people . "
According to icasualties.org , 81.3 percent of the soldiers killed have died in attacks by Al - Qaeda in Iraq fighters , Sunni insurgent groups loyal to Saddam and radical Shiite militias .
The remainder died in non-combat related incidents .
Roadside bombs caused most of the casualties , with small arms fire the second biggest killer .
Around 40 percent of those killed were struck by roadside bombs , according to the website , making these weapons the main cause of fatalities .
Others died variously in car bombings , small arms fire , helicopter crashes , ambushes , rocket attacks and suicide bombings .
American soldiers interviewed by AFP in Iraq expressed sorrow over the casualties but insisted the conflict was justified .
" It 's sad that the number is that high .
It makes you wonder if there is a different way of approaching things .
Nobody likes to hear that number , " said senior Airman Preston Reeves , 26 , from Birmingham , Alabama .
" Everyone of those people signed up voluntarily and its a shame that that happens , but tragedies do happen in war . "
Reeves said it was depressing that the support back home was receding .
" It 's a shame you do n't get support from your own country , when all they want you to do is leave Iraq and all these people will have died in vain , " he told AFP .
The military death toll is one of the key elements of the US 2008 presidential elections for Democrat candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , who are calling for the withdrawal of troops .
The deadliest war for the US military , aside from the two world wars , has been Vietnam , with 58,000 soldiers killed between 1964 and 1973 , an average of 26 a day .
On average , just over two US soldiers die every day in Iraq .
The icasualties.org statistics reveal that the deadliest year for the military in Iraq was 2007 when it lost 901 troops on the back of a controversial " surge " , which saw an extra 30,000 soldiers deployed in a bid to break the stranglehold of violence that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis .
This figure compares with 486 deaths in 2003 , the first year of the conflict , 849 in 2004 , 846 in 2005 and 822 in 2006 .
Since the start of 2008 , 96 soldiers have died .
US military commanders in Iraq acknowledge that putting extra troops on the ground also exposed them to more attacks .
In recent months the military has begun withdrawing the surge troops as violence levels fall across the country , with US and Iraqi officials reporting a 60 - percent drop in attacks since June .
Most of the attacks in the past five years have been staged in four of Iraq 's 18 provinces .
The western Sunni province of Anbar witnessed most overall casualties , with 1,282 losses since the US - led invasion , according to icasualties.org , followed by Baghdad with 1,255 , Salaheddin with 376 , and Diyala with 238 .
In Anbar and Salaheddin the military faced a strong anti-American insurgency , while in Baghdad and Diyala it has been caught in a three - way fight involving Al - Qaeda , Sunni groups loyal to Saddam and Shiite militias .
But for the past year attacks against US troops have fallen sharply in Anbar after local Sunni Arab groups joined forces with the US military to fight Al - Qaeda in Iraq .
According to the website , November 2004 remains the deadliest month for the US military in Iraq .
It lost 137 troops that month when it launched a massive assault to take back the Anbar city of Fallujah , then a Sunni insurgent bastion .
The US state of California has borne the brunt of American losses , with at least 426 soldiers killed in the conflict .
The US military is also searching for four of its soldiers missing in Iraq .
Two of them were captured in May last year after insurgents ambushed their patrol south of Baghdad in an attack which killed four other soldiers and their interpreter .
Al - Qaeda in Iraq in a later Internet message said it had kidnapped and killed the soldiers .
The military says it is still searching for them .
Apart from deaths due to hostile fire , 145 soldiers have died due to " self - inflicted wounds , " the website said , indicating a large number of suicides .
The death toll also includes 102 female service members .

Good timing .
Just as Nick was mentioning how astronomers might be able to detect vegetation on extrasolar planets , we get this discovery : a ground based observatory has measured the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet for the first time .
That holy grail of detecting the atmosphere on an Earth - sized world is getting closer and closer .
In a new journal article published in an upcoming issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters , astronomer Seth Redfield and colleagues report on their discovery .
The planet they ’re studying orbits star HD189733 , located about 63 light - years away in the constellation Vulpecula .
It was originally discovered back in 2004 .
Unfortunately , this planet is n’t anything like the Earth ; it ’s actually about 20 % more massive than Jupiter , and orbits its parent star 10 times closer than Mercury .
Needless to say , it ’s a hot world .
From our perspective here on Earth , HD189733 b passes in front of its star on each orbit .
As the planet “ transits ” across the star , it dims the light slightly .
Furthermore , sunlight passing through its atmosphere can be measured distinctly from the star itself .
The planet blocks about 2.5 % of the star ’s total light , and the atmosphere blocks an additional 0.3 % .
And this was the technique that Redfield and his team used to measure the atmosphere .
“ Take a spectrum of the star when the planet is in front of the star , ” explains Redfield .
“ Then take a spectrum of the star when itâ€™s not .
Then you divide the two and get the planetâ€™s atmospheric transmission spectrum .
Each time the planet passes in front of the star the planet blocks some of the starâ€™s light .
If the planet has no atmosphere , it will block the same amount of light at all wavelengths .
However , if the planet has an atmosphere , gasses in its atmosphere will absorb some additional light . ”
The atmosphere of an extrasolar planet has only been measured once before , using Hubble ’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) .
Unfortunately , this instrument broke shortly after the previous detection .
Without the help of Hubble , Redfield and his team needed to come up with another solution , so they switched to the Hobby - Eberly Telescope .
In the end , they made hundreds of observations spread out over a year taken under various conditions .
They were able to remove the contamination of the Earth ’s atmosphere from their observations , and come up with a good analysis of the planet ’s atmosphere .
This is great , but it ’s just a start .
The real prize will come with astronomers are able to spot Earth - sized planets orbiting other stars , and measure their atmospheres .
If they find large quantities of oxygen in the atmosphere , that ’s a good candidate for life .

Denied access to his three children after his divorce , Mark was jailed for standing outside his house to wave to them .
It took ten years and 133 hearings before they were reunited .
How CAN the Government insist cases like his are kept secret ?
Every day there is some reminder of what Mark Harris calls ' the lost years ' .
It could be his daughter 's reference to a particular birthday party or a family holiday .
It could be talk of exams sat , dentists visited or pop stars worshipped .
Each time it happens , he feels a stab of regret .
' I missed so much , ' he reveals , with understandable bitterness .
' They took my daughter 's childhood , her formative years , from me .
Lisa is 20 now .
I did n't see her between the ages of ten and 16 .
An awful lot happens in a child 's life in that time , and I missed it all . '
Scroll down for more ...
Lisa missed a lot , too .
She sits by Mark 's side as he talks , a beautiful and assured young woman , but one still coming to terms with the fact that her father simply was n't there when she needed him - and for an entire decade she did not know why .
' There were times when I needed a father figure - for reassurance and advice , ' she says , with quiet restraint .
' There just was n't one there . '
But the story of what happened to the Harris family is n't just another tragic case of broken homes and estrangement .
Mark , Lisa and her two younger sisters were wrenched apart by the state .
Mark was not a feckless , irresponsible father .
He did not walk out of his children 's lives .
Rather , he was ordered out by the family courts , and when he objected - insisting it was his right to see them - he was dealt with in a scandalous way .
Mark Harris went to prison for his girls .
He was jailed for waving to them after a court order demanded he sever all contact .
It was the most shameful chapter in an extraordinary ten - year custody battle .
He has now ' won ' - today , two of his daughters live with him - only because they shared their father 's determination to re-establish their relationship .
He has lived every father 's worst nightmare , and every miserable step is etched on his face .
' It took ten years , 133 court appearances before 33 different judges , two prison sentences and a hunger strike before I was given permission to be with my daughters again , ' he says quietly .
' What happened to my family is unforgivable .
And that it was all sanctioned - ordered - by a system that is supposed to help families is outrageous . '
The controversial family court system has much to answer for in this case .
Mark Harris is n't the first father who has questioned how it operates .
Family court proceedings are notoriously secretive , and campaigners have long appealed for the proceedings to be more open and judges more accountable .
That is not to be , however .
Last week the Lord Chancellor ruled that proceedings must remain secret - something that horrifies Mark and his girls .
So angry is he about his experiences that he has written a book , Family Court Hell .
' Surely my story is evidence enough that the system needs to change .
' If it does n't , the family courts are open to abuse by unaccountable judges and social workers with their own agendas , whose word is taken as law and who almost invariably favour the mother .
' It 's a scandal which has left hundreds of fathers like me in desperation .
The only solution is to have a court system that 's transparent .
Otherwise it is simply not fair to fathers or , more importantly , to the children it is supposed to protect . '
When Lisa was born in 1988 , Mark felt ' like the happiest man alive ' .
He had been married to his wife - whom we cannot name even now for legal reasons - for three - and - a - half years , and he had longed for fatherhood .
Over the next four years , two more daughters followed .
MARK says : ' I remember thinking how lucky I was because I had a job that I could organise around the children .
I 'm a driving instructor , so my work was flexible .
I loved the time I spent with Lisa .
Not every father could read their children stories , bath them or take them out for walks in their pram . '
Mark thought he had a happy marriage , too .
The only difficulty was his strained relationship with his mother - inlaw .
Yet it did n't concern him much .
' Looking back , we rowed constantly about my mother - in - law , but I never thought it would lead to drastic action , ' he says .
Perhaps he will never know exactly what was wrong in his marriage , but his wife was clearly unhappy .
One day in 1993 , Mark returned from a football match to find the house ' looking as though it had been ransacked ' .
Almost all the furniture had disappeared .
So , too , had his wife and children , and he had no clue where they had gone .
' I went to the police , ' he says .
' I was beside myself , distraught .
They said my
wife was in a rented house nearby , but that I should n't go round until the next day .
When I did , she told me she no longer loved me , but said I could see the children whenever I wanted .
I was bereft .
' I took the children home for a few hours and they spent the time crying - they were only six , four and two , and it must have been horrific for them to see their parents like that .
They wanted to know when we'd all be at home together again , and I did n't know what to say .
I was as shocked and bewildered as them . '
Over the next few weeks , Mark stumbled through life in a daze .
He saw his girls every day he was n't working , but his anger towards his wife was building up .
Two months after she left , she asked if he would take her back .
Mark was too hurt to contemplate that .
Instead , he launched divorce proceedings .
' At that point , it did n't even occur to me that access to the children would be an issue .
I was granted unrestricted access - but later I discovered that even then my wife was seeing a solicitor , with a view to having my time with them reduced .
She said it was confusing for them to see me . '
THE FAMILY court agreed , and his access was reduced to three times a week , then to once a week and finally to once a fortnight .
Mark was stunned to discover he was powerless to resist .
' I petitioned the judge every time , but there was nothing I could do , ' he says .
A year after they had separated , the couple divorced .
Again , Mark made a bid to see more of his girls , and asked the court if they could live with him .
His wife retaliated , claiming that seeing him at all was unsettling them .
The court 's reaction ?
It banned him from any contact at all with his daughters .
' I was just floored , disgusted .
On my wife 's word , the judge simply severed all my rights of access .
When I protested , no one listened .
I was devastated , but there was no way I was going to turn my back on my children .
How could a court order stop me from being a father ?'
Every morning , while he waited for a court date to argue against this judgment , Mark saw his children being driven past his house to school by their mother .
He 'd wave - angry that he could n't say hello , but grateful for their smiles .
Then his former wife was granted an injunction stopping him even gesturing to his children as they passed .
' It was incredible .
She said it was harassment , and the court believed her .
But I carried on waving .
I was looking for a job and I 'd walk to the Jobcentre every morning - knowing how to time it so they would come past .
' I was damned if I was going to be prevented from waving at my own children .
Naively , maybe , I assumed the whole business would be cleared up at the next court hearing .'
It was n't .
Instead ,
Mark left that courtroom in handcuffs , sentenced to four months , having been told that waving was tantamount to stalking his ex .
He could n't believe what was happening .
' On my first night in jail I shared a cell with a murderer , ' he says .
' It was so intimidating .
The next few weeks just blurred into one long nightmare .
Every waking hour I pined for my girls , wondering if I would ever see them again .
' When I got out , the nightmare continued .
It took another year for me to convince the courts I should be allowed to see them at all .
Life was an endless round of court hearings .
It was a wretched existence .
Time and again I 'd be facing a new judge and having to re-tell the story .
To me , it was a matter of life and death , but to them , it seemed I was just another pushy , undeserving father who was trying to interfere in his former wife 's life .
' I was so messed up by it all that I had a vasectomy to ensure I could n't find myself in that position again . '
Finally , five years after the separation , Mark was granted permission to see his daughters .
He was excited about the planned date - but devastated - when Lisa did n't turn up .
' By then I was livid at the system .
It was destroying my life .
I know it was a foolish thing to do , but I started picketing the homes of the judges who had denied me contact , hoping they would take pity on me . '
His protests were to no avail .
Instead , in 2001 , he was sentenced to ten months in prison for contempt of court for driving past his girls ' house to catch a glimpse of them .
By then spiralling into depression , he went on hunger strike .
For two weeks he refused food and water .
' I stopped only when I realised that if I died I would never see my precious daughters again , ' Mark says .
Who knows how this desperate fight to be a father would have ended had Lisa , then 16 , not intervened .
' After a row with her mother , she called Mark and told him she and one of her sisters wanted to live with him .
' I got this call saying they had packed their bags and were at a bus stop .
Would I pick them up ?
In breach of all court orders , I got in the car and brought them home .
Seeing Lisa again , for the first time in six years , was incredible .
I did n't know how to speak to , or look at , this young woman before me .
She was wearing make - up .
She had her 6ft boyfriend in tow .
It was surreal , but in the end we fell into each other 's arms and sobbed . '
It was only then that the family court system seemed to consider Mark 's rights .
He called the High Court emergency hotline and eventually spoke to a ' decent , humane judge ' .
Ten minutes after their conversation - he was faxed a temporary residency order .
In court the following week , every previous court order was set aside .
' It took ten minutes to put right and ten years of injustice , which made me realise just what power those judges have , ' says Mark .
The ruling meant that Lisa and her sisters could choose which parent they lived with .
Lisa and her youngest sister - who , again , we can't name for legal reasons - now live with him .
Lisa is studying to be a legal secretary .
Her story is even more poignant .
She tells of the confusion that has blighted most of her life , and you cannot help but wonder what long - term damage has been inflicted on her and her sisters .
' One minute we were normal children .
The next we were in a rented house with Dad hammering on the door demanding to be allowed to see us , ' she says .
' We were scared .
None of it made sense .
Sometimes we'd be allowed to see Dad regularly , then there were times with no contact at all .
' When Dad disappeared out of our lives , we just thought he had stopped loving us .
I was certain I 'd done something wrong .
' The first time we saw him waving to us as we went to school , I was thrilled .
I remember thinking : " He still cares . "
' Every morning , Mum would tell us we should n't look at him - that he was a bad man - yet we could n't help but grin when we saw him .
It made our day . '
It was impossible for Lisa 's mother to go a different route .
WHEN her father went to prison , no one explained to Lisa why .
' Mum said : " You see - I told you he was bad . "
I was ten years old .
As far as I knew , you had to do something pretty awful to go to prison . '
She turned against her father , telling social workers she did n't want to see him .
Yet with hindsight she explains she was simply trying to gain control over the horrific situation .
' There was this endless pantomime with social workers wanting to know what I thought .
All I wanted was to be allowed to love both my parents , but I knew that was never going to happen .
' Mum 's hatred for Dad was so deep that to keep her happy , and to get them off my back , I said I would n't see him .
Turning love to hate made that easier .
I told myself that my dad had been wicked , so he deserved it . '
When the courts finally granted access , Lisa was so tortured that she often did n't turn up to see her father .
She thought she was protecting her mother by siding with her .
However , when she fell out with her mother during a phase of teenage rebellion , it was to her father that she fled - and when she discovered he had never stopped loving her , she was left reeling .
' I 'd never forgotten Dad 's number .
I know I was only ringing him then to get back at Mum , but when I heard his voice , I wanted to cry .
I told him I loved him and that I wanted to see him .
Everything just flooded out .'
The first meeting was as hard for her as it was for him .
' The last time I 'd seen him I 'd been ten and carrying a skipping rope .
When I walked into my old bedroom - and saw it was as I had left it - I wanted to sob .
I did n't dare do so , though , because I knew if I did I 'd never stop . '
Four years on , Lisa and Mark are only just beginning to rebuild their relationship .
Every day , more gaps are filled , and more trust regained .
Meanwhile , Lisa rarely sees her mother , and she is angry at her mother 's behaviour .
It is a desperately sorry story , with no real winners .
But then , as Lisa points out , it was never supposed to be a contest .
' I wish to God that my parents had avoided the courts from day one , and simply shared us , the children they created together , ' she says .
' Instead , complete strangers were allowed to get involved in our lives to such an extent that everyone lost sight of the needs of us children .
' I love both my parents ; I always will .
But I will never get my childhood back .
It is gone for ever . '
2008 -05 - 20 : Fixed some breakage due to changes to the latest Tamarin Tracing source , and updated more recent timing .
I attended the Tamarin Tech summit at Adobe on Friday .
My main interest for attending was to learn more about the tamarin - tracing project .
The goal of Tamarin is to produce a high performance ECMAScript 4 implementation .
' Tamarin Tracing ' is an implementation that uses a ' tracing jit ' .
This type of ' just in time compiler ' traces code executing during hotspots and compiles it so when those hotspots are entered again the compiled code is run instead .
It traces each statement executed , including within other function calls , and this entire execution path is compiled .
This is different from compiling individual functions .
You can gain more information for the optimizer to operate on , and remove some of the overhead of the calls .
Anytime the compiled code makes a call to code that has not been jitted , the interpreter is called to continue .
Apparently the JIT for Lua is also being written using a tracing jit method and a post by Mike Pall describes the approach they are taking in some detail and lists references .
A followup post provides more information and mentions Tamarin Tracing .
' Tamarin Tracing ' is open source and can be obtained from the mercurial repository :
$ hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-tracing/
To build the source you create a directory to hold the build files , change to it , and run the configure script :
$ $ mkdir mybuild $ cd mybuild $ ../ tamarin - tracing / configure -- enable - shell $ make
The ' enable - shell ' option is required to produce the ' avmshell ' binary that executes the bytecode .
At the end of the build you 'll see the avmshell binary in the shell subdirectory :
$ shell / avmshell avmplus shell 1.0 build cyclone usage : avmplus [ options ] scripts [--] script args - Dtimeout enforce maximum 15 seconds execution - error crash opens debug dialog , instead of dumping - suppress_stdout do n't emit anything to stdout ( debug messages only ) - interp disable the trace optimizer and nanojit - Dnoloops disable loop invariant hoisting - Dnocse disable common subexpression elimination - Dnosse disable SSE2 instructions - log send verbose output to < script>.log
' avmshell ' operates on files containing bytecode not JavaScript .
To use it you 'll need to have a front end that compiles JavaScript to the ' abc ' bytecode format it uses .
The bytecode is the ActionScript bytecode .
You 'll need a compiler that generates this .
This can be obtained from the Flex SDK .
This is a free download from Adobe .
You can also use any other tool that generates the correct bytecode .
Included with Tamarin Tracing is the source for ' esc ' .
This is a work - in - progress implementation of an ECMAScript 4 compiler written in ECMAScript .
It generates the ' abc ' bytecode but is ( I think ) not quite ready for prime time .
In this post I 'm using the ' asc ' compiler from the Flex 2 SDK on Linux .
This compiler is written in Java and is in the ' lib / asc.jar ' file in the SDK .
A quick test that the avmshell program works :
$ echo " print ( ' hello world ! ' ) ; " >>hello.as $ java - jar asc.jar hello.as hello.abc , 86 bytes written $ shell / avmshell hello.abc hello world !
' avmshell ' has a number of debugging options that are only available when configuring the build with ' - - enable - debugger ' .
This allows you to get some information about the trace jit .
Here 's the build process with a debug enabled build and the available options :
$ mkdir mybuild $ cd mybuild $ ../ tamarin - tracing / configure -- enable - shell -- enable - debugger $ make $ shell / avmshell avmplus shell 1.0 build cyclone usage : avmplus [ options ] scripts [--] script args -d enter debugger on start - Dnogc do n't collect - Dgcstats generate statistics on gc - Dnoincgc do n't use incremental collection - Dastrace N display AS execution information , where N is [ 1..4 ]
- Dverbose trace every instruction ( verbose ! )
- Dverbose_init trace builtins too - Dverbose_opt_exits trace optimizer exit instructions - Dverbose_opt_detail extreme optimizer verbosity - Dquiet_opt disable verbosity for optimizer - Dstats display various optimizer statistics - Dsuperwords dump basic block usage to stderr ( use with - interp ; 2 > to save to file , then superwords. py ) - Dtimeout enforce maximum 15 seconds execution - error crash opens debug dialog , instead of dumping - suppress_stdout do n't emit anything to stdout ( debug messages only ) - interp disable the trace optimizer and nanojit - Dnoloops disable loop invariant hoisting - Dnocse disable common subexpression elimination - Dnosse disable SSE2 instructions - log send verbose output to < script >.log
To demonstrate some of the output I 'll use a simple fibonacci benchmark .
This is the contents of fib.as :
function fib( n ) { if ( n <= 1 ) return 1 ; else return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) ; } print ( " fib 30 = " + fib ( 30 ) ) ;
A comparison of times with and without the tracing jit enabled :

There 's a lot of other interesting stuff in the Tamarin Tracing source that I hope to dive into .
For example :
the interpreter is written in Forth .
There are .fs files in the ' core ' subdirectory that contains the Forth source code .
Each ' abc ' bytecode is implemented in lower level instructions which are implemented in Forth .
The tracing jit operates on these lower level instructions .
The system can be extended with Forth code to call native C functions .
The compiler from Forth to C++ is written in Python and is in ' utils / fc.py '
The jit has two backends .
One for Intel x86 32 bit , and the other for ARM .
See the ' nanojit ' subdirectory .
The complete interpreter source can be rebuilt from the Forth using ' core / builtin.py ' .
This requires ' asc.jar ' to be placed in the ' utils ' subdirectory of Tamarin Tracing .
At the summit there was an in - depth session of the internals of the Forth code and how to extend it .
I 'll write more about that later when / if I get a chance to dig into it .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
He 's only 5 ½ years old , and yet he 's practically memorized the entire New York subway grid .
Gwenyth Jackaway started to wonder if Donor - X passed on a genetic component to her son , Dylan , who is autistic .
He reads at the fourth - grade level , plays two - handed piano compositions and is better versed than most adults about the Fibonacci code , a complex mathematics sequence .
Dylan loves Italian music and draws pictures that artist Jackson Pollock would be proud of .
He also happens to be autistic .
Gwenyth Jackaway , Dylan 's mother , is a professor at New York 's Fordham University .
She 's single but had always wanted to have a child .
So she contacted California Cryobank , one of the largest sperm donor banks in the country .
Cryobank does n't reveal the identities of donors but allows people to choose based on the traits they 'd like their child to have .
Jackaway decided on " Donor X " because he appeared philosophical and intelligent on paper .
He liked music , loved to travel and had a high IQ and a degree in economics .
What she could n't know then is that her son would have autism .
So she started to wonder whether Donor X might carry a gene that could have contributed .
Dylan tells Randi Kaye how to take subway back to work »
The cause or causes of autism are not known and are hotly debated .
Most experts believe that genetics are a component , making a child predisposed to autism or responsive to an environmental trigger .
" It 's a combination of being genetically vulnerable and then having some kind of social or toxicant exposure that tips you over , " according to Dr. Gary Goldstein of the Kennedy Krieger Institute .
Unraveling the mystery Meet Dylan on Anderson Cooper 360° at 10 p.m. ET .
Then , Dr. Sanjay Gupta shows us how autistic people experience the world in " Finding Amanda " at 11 p.m. ET .
Watch AC360° , 10 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Researchers have found some genetic areas associated with autism , but it could take years before the gene or genes that cause autism or contribute to it will be determined .
Until then , Geri Dawson , chief science officer for the Manhattan - based advocacy group Autism Speaks , says there 's no way to screen for those genes and prevent them from being passed to a child .
" We would n't be able to screen a donor for autism because we do n't yet know the specific genes that are contributing to autism , " Dawson said .
" But there is a lot of research going on , and I would say in the next five to 10 years , we will have identified between five and 10 genes that we know raise the risk for autism . "
Once the autism gene or genes have been identified , it would theoretically be possible to screen for those genes , according to Dawson .
Jackaway says she went into a period of mourning when Dylan 's autism was diagnosed at age 2 .
" When you 're handed a diagnosis of some sort of developmental disorder , you have to let go of the child you thought you were going to have , " Jackaway said .
" There 's a sense of loss of the child , a grieving process .
There 's denial , there 's rage , and then there 's the tremendous sadness , and hopefully you get to a place of accepting . "
Jackaway says she had to accept that " I do n't have that child I thought I was going to have .
But I have this child instead , who 's right here in front of me . "
Through a Web site called Donor Sibling Registry , she reached out to other women who used Donor X .
She found six families who had used the same donor .
Two years ago , she visited Theresa Pergola in the New York area ; she had given birth to triplets using sperm from Donor X . Just minutes into their meeting , Jackaway noticed Pergola 's son , Joseph , 2 , exhibiting some of the same behavior as her son .
" He was walking on his toes ; he was flapping his hands .
There seemed to be eye contact issues , " recalled Jackaway , who immediately suggested screening Joseph for autism .
" She told me that she saw characteristics of autism , and it was very upsetting to me at that time , " Pergola said .
" I did n't know what to expect from that point on .
I know I was scared , and she was there to let me know that it was going to be OK . "
Pergola says she was afraid because she had an image of autism in her head and believed her son would be " in the corner and rocking and not talking . "
She says Jackaway reassured her that would n't be the case .
One month later , a test confirmed what Pergola already knew : Joseph was autistic .
The diagnosis brought her to tears , and now these two women whose sons share a father were immediately connected by another bond : autism .
" She was terribly upset , " Jackaway remembered .
" That moment is a terribly frightening moment .
You get handed a diagnosis , and you get handed an entirely new future . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Autism
In six families Jackaway contacted that had used Donor X , three of the children are autistic , and one is showing signs of autism .
But would Jackaway be happier today if there had been a way to screen Donor X for an autism gene ?
" I 've done a lot of thinking about this , and to say yes to that is to say that I wish Dylan is n't Dylan , " Jackaway said .
" I love my son and everything about him , and that means loving his autism also .
Loving your children means loving everything about them .
Our children do n't have autism ; they are autistic .
It 's part of who they are . "
There is currently no way to screen for autism , and in a statement , the company said in part :
" There is no current genetic test to detect autism .
California Cryobank ( CCB ) employs one of the most thorough and rigorous donor screening processes in the industry , with less than 1 % of all applicants actually becoming donors .
The standard CCB procedure for screening donors involves extensive physical , genetic and health screening ... "
Since the discovery of autism in some of the families that used Donor X , Cryobank had this to say about his samples :
" ... per CCB policy , the donor 's samples were removed from the general catalog .
These vials may only be sold to a client who has previously used specimens of this donor and is interested in ordering additional specimens .
In this case the client is made aware of the new medical information and potential issues ... "
The families do n't blame the sperm bank .
In fact , Theresa Pergola says she 's still uncertain about an autism screening process , if and when it ever becomes available .
" It can go either way , on the one hand it could be helpful so that people could make choices about what risks they want to take , " says Pergola .
" On the other hand it 's like , what else are they going to screen for , you know ?
Are they going to screen for certain personality traits ?
It 's hard to say .
It 's really hard to say . "

An extensive pipe network will bring water to Beijing from the provinces
The official , An Qiyuan , from Shaanxi province , told the UK's Financial Times newspaper that people in north - western provinces should be compensated .
He warned of social upheaval and environmental harm because of the strain put on local water supplies .
China is building a huge network to divert water to the north .
The project will divert water from rivers in the south via tunnels , dams and canals to cities in the north where consumption is at an all - time high .
Part of the massive project was brought forward to provide water for the Olympics in the summer .
Mr An , a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Committee in Shaanxi , said the diversion of water supplies would have a severe effect .
Factories closed
" In order to preserve the quality of Beijing 's water we have to close all our factories , " he said .
" But we still need to live .
So I say the government needs to compensate Shaanxi . "
Mr An , formerly Communist Party chief in Shaanxi , was also critical of the huge Sanmexia Dam , constructed in the 1950s .
The project is blamed for the Yellow River silting up and causing flooding - something it was meant to avoid .
" It was so stupid , stupid , " said Mr An .
Correspondents say it is unusual for a leading communist official to be so openly critical of government policy .
National network
Shaanxi and Hebei province are being required to pump clean water to Beijing in time for the Olympics .
Much of the extra water for Beijing will come from the Yellow River
They are on the northern stretch of a much larger water transfer project designed to bring supplies from the Yangtze River in the south to thirsty northern industrial areas , including Beijing .
The entire project , costing tens of billions of dollars , is due for completion by 2010 , but the authorities in the capital are hoping the northern leg of the network will be ready in time for the Olympics .
Experts say water demand could rise to 30 % above average in the city as thousands of visitors arrive for the games .
Hebei
Hebei province , which lies next to Beijing and supplies most of its water , is suffering from severe drought , the official Hebei Daily reported on Tuesday .
Officials in the province were quoted as saying the drought , caused by a lack of rain and snow , meant the " conflict between water supply and demand has been dramatically exacerbated " .
Hebei province is being asked to provide an extra 300 m cubic metres of back - up supplies to Beijing 's 16 million residents as the Games approach .
Several hundred kilometres of pipe and channels are being constructed in the province to supply the capital .
But farmers complain that lack of water is already severely undermining agricultural land .
The Hebei Daily reported that 33,000 sq km ( 12,740 sq miles ) of farmland was now affected by drought , while a quarter of a million residents were facing problems with drinking water .
A study led by Brown University biologist Casey Dunn uses new genomics tools to answer old questions about animal evolution .
The study is the most comprehensive animal phylogenomic research project to date , involving 40 million base pairs of new DNA data taken from 29 animal species .
The study , which appears in Nature , settles some long - standing debates about the relationships between major groups of animals and offers up a few surprises .
The big shocker : Comb jellyfish -- common and extremely fragile jellies with well - developed tissues -- appear to have diverged from other animals even before the lowly sponge , which has no tissue to speak of .
This finding calls into question the very root of the animal tree of life , which traditionally placed sponges at the base .
" This finding suggests either that comb jellies evolved their complexity independently from other animals , or that sponges have become greatly simplified through the course of evolution .
If corroborated by other types of evidence , this would significantly change the way we think about the earliest multicellular animals , " said Dunn , assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown .
" Coming up with these surprises , and trying to better understand the relationships between living things , made this project so fascinating . "
Charles Darwin introduced the idea of a " tree of life " in his seminal book Origin of Species .
A sketch of the tree was the book 's only illustration .
Nearly 150 years after its publication , many relationships between animal groups are still unclear .
While enormous strides have been made in genomics , offering up a species ' entire genome for comparison , there are millions of animal species on the planet .
There simply is n't the time to sequence all these genomes .
To get a better grasp of the tree of life -- without sequencing the entire genomes of scores of species -- Dunn and his team collected data , called expressed sequence tags , from the active genes of 29 poorly understood animals that perch on far - flung branches of the tree of life , including comb jellies , centipedes and mollusks .
The scientists analyzed this data in combination with existing genomic data from 48 other animals , such as humans and fruit flies , looking for the most common genes being activated , or expressed .
The aim of this new approach is to analyze a large number of genes from a large number of animals -- an improvement over comparative genomics methods which allow for a limited analysis of genes or animals .
The new process is not only more comprehensive , it is also more computationally intensive .
Dunn 's project demanded the power of more than 120 processors housed in computer clusters located in laboratories around the globe .
Dunn and his team :
unambiguously confirmed certain animal relationships , including the existence of a group that includes invertebrates that shed their skin , such as arthropods and nematodes ;
convincingly resolved conflicting evidence surrounding other relationships , such as the close relationship of millipedes and centipedes to spiders rather than insects ;
established new animal relationships , such as the close ties between nemerteans , or ribbon worms , and brachiopods , or two - shelled invertebrates .
" What is exciting is that this new information changes our basic understanding about the natural world -- information found in basic biology books and natural history posters , " Dunn said .
" While the picture of the tree of life is far from complete after this study , it is clearer .
And these new results show that these new genomic approaches will be able to resolve at least some problems that have been previously intractable . "
The study team included Andreas Hejnol , David Matus , Kevin Pang , William Browne , Elaine Seaver and Mark Martindale from the University of Hawaii ; Stephen Smith from Yale University ; Greg Rouse from the University of California -- San Diego ; Matthias Obst from Kristineberg Marine Research Station in Sweden ; Gregory Edgecombe from The Natural History Museum in London ; Martin Sorensen and Reinhardt Kristensen from the University of Copenhagen ; Steven Haddock from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ; Andreas Schmidt - Rhaesa from the University of Hamburg in Germany ; Akiko Okusu from Simmons College ; Ward Wheeler from the American Museum of Natural History ; and Gonzalo Giribet from Harvard University .
The National Science Foundation funded the work through its Assembling the Tree of Life ( AToL ) project .

Morgan Stanley has swept up 11,000 properties from homebuilder Lennar Corp. for $ 525 million .
Special Report
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) --
In another sign of the collapse of the market for new homes , builder Lennar Corp. has dumped a portfolio of 11,000 properties for 40 percent of their previously - stated book value .
Lennar ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's largest builder in terms of revenue , is selling the properties to a joint venture it has established with the real estate arm of Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Morgan Stanley will own 80 percent of the joint venture , while Lennar will own 20 percent .
Lennar announced the deal late Friday as its fiscal fourth quarter came to a close .
It is selling the properties for $ 525 million , even though it said their book value as of Sept. 30 stood at $ 1.3 billion .
Lennar also will receive fees for continuing to manage the properties , which include mix of raw land as well as partially and fully developed homesites .
The shares of most major home builders were up in early afternoon trading Monday , with Lennar gaining nearly 4 percent , while Morgan Stanley shares were off 1 percent .
The nation 's home builders , including Lennar , have been hammered by the problems in the mortgage securities market and the downturn in housing .
Last week , the government 's report on new home sales reported a record glut of completed new homes for sale , and the biggest year - over - year drop in the median price of a new home in 37 years .
Most builders have had to take large charges against their earnings as they revalued their holdings and walked away from options to buy additional land .
But the deal also suggests that bargain hunters on Wall Street might be willing to step in and try to grab some prime properties at a fraction of their previous value .
" I think this is really starting to show some of the desperation , " said Hugh Moore , a principal at Guerite Advisors , a research and financial advisory firm .
" The problem is that these national builders came in and overpaid at the top of the market .
It was a land rush mentality .
And Lennar had the reputation for being one of the more careful buyers . "
Mike Larson , a real estate analyst with Weiss Research , said there are a number of so - called vulture investors out there looking to make big purchases in distressed real estate , and that a deal of this size could help spur more of these types of purchases .
" You 've got a benchmark to use now , " Larson said .
The 60 percent discount paid by Morgan Stanley does n't mean that homeowners looking to sell their own homes are facing that kind of discount , he said .
" For sellers holding out for unrealistic prices , it should be a wake up call . "
The biggest discount in prices might be in undeveloped land and in condos in vacation and retirement markets such as Florida where overbuilding was rampant , according to Moore .
" It 's important to remember that all real estate is local , " he said .
" I do n't think you 're going to find en masse suburban single family homes selling for 50 cents on the dollar .
But I would n't be surprised if you can find some for 75 cents on the dollar . "
For Morgan Stanley , which manages $ 88.3 billion in real estate assets on behalf of its clients , the Lennar deal represents a relatively small bet .
It also has not been as badly hit by the subprime problems as some of its rival firms , such as Merrill Lynch ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , which took much bigger than expected subprime charges that resulted in the departures of their chief executives .
" This transaction provides us with increased liquidity and flexibility at an opportune time , " said a statement from Stuart Miller , Lennar 's president and CEO .
As a part of the transaction , Lennar has options and rights of first offer , giving it the chance to purchase certain finished homesites at current market values .
It also could receive extra revenue if the joint venture exceeds financial targets on the sale of the properties .
The sale raised the possibility that Lennar 's results in the just closed quarter could again be hit by a large charge for the reduced value of its holdings .
Lennar took a $ 847.5 million third - quarter hit for valuation adjustments and writeoffs of options , a move that plunged the company into a loss more than six times what had been forecast by analysts .
Analysts had been forecasting that its fourth quarter loss would be only a $ 1.00 a share in the just completed period , which would be an improvement from the $ 1.24 a share it lost a year earlier an the $ 3.25 a share it lost in the third quarter .
But as glut of new homes on the market continues to push prices significantly lower ,
Charges due to reduced land and home valuations have caused most builders to report larger than expected losses in recent quarters .
In October , credit rating agency Moody 's downgraded the debt of Lennar , No. 2 builder Centex ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and No. 4 Pulte Homes ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) to junk bond status .
Last month Hovnanian Enterprises ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's No. 7 builder by revenue , reported that the sales pace during October " significantly deteriorated " in most of its markets , and its preliminary results also showed a sharp rise in cancellations .
D.R. Horton ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the No. 3 builder , reported a smaller - than - expected loss last week , but that followed a quarter with a much larger - than - forecasted loss .
Toll Brothers ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) is due to report results Thursday , and the luxury home builder is forecast to report a 46 cent a share loss , its first loss of the current housing slump .
“ We explained the reason , that we were flying in the winter between two cities notorious for delays in bad weather , so we always pack more .
She said , ‘ I ca n’t make an exception ; it ’s too much food for a flight that ’s 2 ½ hours , ’ ” Dr. Soni said .

“ Evidently the woman had 10 bottles of premixed baby formula and 9 bottles / pouches of baby food , ” a spokeswoman for the T.S.A. , Ellen Howe , said , reading from a report the Chicago officers filed afterward .
Dr. Soni said the officers ’ report exaggerated the quantity .
The parents “ mistakenly believed they were entitled to bring on unlimited quantities , which is not what we say , ” Ms. Howe said .
“ We say you can bring a reasonable amount for your trip , and obviously the officer has some discretion on defining what that would be . ”
According to Dr. Soni , the T.S.A. officers said they would need a “ doctor ’s note ” to bring on all of the food .
He said he pointed out that he and his wife were doctors , and then offered to get a pediatrician colleague on the phone .
The sensible thing to do in this kind of situation is to file your complaint and move on to make your flight , which is what Dr. Soni said he and his wife did .
The T.S.A. officers confiscated some of the food .
“ They divided it up .
They took a jar of prunes and one of bananas , and I think a bottle of formula , ” he said .
Dr. Soni said he was raising the objection publicly because “ I feel the message needs to be put across .
I do n’t think the T.S.A. has the training to exert judgment on what the nutritional needs of a baby are ” for a 2 ½ hour flight , not to mention a possible long delay .
Alcoholism : A disease of speculation
" In 1976 , the writer Ivan Illich warned in the book , Limits to Medicine , that ' the medical establishment has become a major threat to health ' .
At the time , he was dismissed as a maverick , but a quarter of a century later , even the medical establishment is prepared to admit that he may well be right .
( Anthony Browne , April 14 , 2002 , the Observer ) "
History and science have shown us that the existence of the disease of alcoholism is pure speculation .
Just saying alcoholism is a disease does n't make it true .
Nevertheless , medical professionals and American culture enthusiastically embraced the disease concept and quickly applied it to every possible behavior from alcohol abuse to compulsive lecturing and nail biting .
The disease concept was a panacea for many failing medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies , adding billions of dollars to the industry and leading to a prompt evolution of pop-psychology .
Research has shown that alcoholism is a choice , not a disease , and stripping alcohol abusers of their choice , by applying the disease concept , is a threat to the health of the individual .
The disease concept oozes into every crevice of our society perpetuating harmful misinformation that hurts the very people it was intended to help .
Remarkably , the assumptions of a few were accepted as fact by the medical profession , devoid of any scientific study or supporting evidence .
And soon after , the disease concept was accepted by the general public .
With this said , visiting the history of the disease concept gives us all a better understanding of how and why all of this happened .
The disease concept originated in the 1800s with a fellow by the name of Dr. Benjamin Rush .
He believed those who drank too much alcohol were diseased and used the idea to promote his prohibitionist political platform .
He also believed that dishonesty , political dissension and being of African - American descent were diseases .
The " disease concept " was used throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s by prohibitionists and those involved in the Temperance Movement to further their political agenda .
Prior to c.1891 , the term alcoholic , referring to someone who drank too much alcohol , did not exist .
Before that , alcohol was freely consumed , but drunkenness was not tolerated .
Many sociologists contribute its non-existence to the very stigma that the disease concept removes .
Drunkenness was not so much seen as the cause of deviant behavior - in particular crime and violence - as it was construed as a sign that an individual was willing to engage in such behavior . "
( H.G. Levine , " The Good Creature of God and the Demon Rum , " in Alcohol and Disinhibitition , eds. R. Room and G. Collins . )
During this period of time social ties and family played a much more influential role in an individual 's life .
Therefore , deviant behaviors were undesirable and less likely to occur .
It was not until industrialization began , when the importance of social and family ties diminished , that alcoholism became a problem .
We now live in a society that encourages binge drinking as a social norm , but at the same time , we live in a society that discourages it .
The " recovery " community 's adoption of the disease concept began with an early AA member named Marty Mann .
Her efforts , combined with a somewhat dubious scientist named E.M. Jellinek , began national acceptance of the disease concept .
It was Jellinek 's self - proclaimed " scientific " study that opened the door for the medical community ’s support .
E.M. Jellinek 's study was funded by the efforts of Marty Mann and R. Brinkley Smithers .
And , like so many other circumstances involving Jellinek and Mann , the study was bogus , if not outright fraudulent .
The surveys Jellinek based his conclusions on were from a handpicked group of alcoholics .
There were 158 questionnaires handed out and 60 of them were suspiciously not included .
His conclusion was based on less than 100 handpicked alcoholics chosen by Marty Mann .
Mann , of course , had a personal agenda to remove the stigma about the homeless and dirty alcoholic or " bowery drunk " in order to gain financial support from the wealthy .
By removing the stigma , the problem becomes one of the general population , which would then include the wealthy .
The first step was Jellinek publishing his findings in his book " The Disease Concept of Alcoholism , " which was based on selected subjects who fit the criteria supporting Mann ’s preconceived conclusions .
Later , E.M. Jellinek was asked by Yale University to refute his own findings .
He complied .
E.M. Jellinek 's The Disease Concept of Alcoholism did not stand up to scientific scrutiny .
Early in the 20th Century , the validity of the disease concept was often debated in medical circles .
However , in 1956 the American Medical Association ( AMA ) proclaimed alcoholism an " illness . "
Then , in 1966 , the AMA proclaimed alcoholism a disease .
The decision was embroiled in controversy .
Historically , Marty Mann had her hand in much of this and manipulated information and doctors into agreeing with the disease concept .
Marty Mann used her position as founder of the NCA ( National Counsel for Alcoholism ) to promote the disease concept through Jellinek and the founder of the NIAAA ( National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse ) whose founder worked with Marty Mann during the institute 's early development .
The founder of NIAAA , R. Brinkley Smithers , was a major contributor to , and promoter of , the disease concept .
It was his money that actually funded Jellinek 's work at Yale .
Smithers was also responsible for gaining insurance coverage for patients in treatment ( hence the 28 day program . )
Smithers was certainly not altruistic in his efforts .
At that time he had already launched a treatment program for which he was lobbying for insurance payments .
Acceptance by the medical community was the only way this could happen ; alcoholism had to be a medical problem in order for medical insurance to pay for programs .
We can see the influence of these " advances " everyday in treatment programs .
Today , the treatment industry is a multi-billion dollar industry , with insurance paying the lion 's share of the costs .
[ Author ’s note :
In 2008 , insurance companies paid for approximately 40 % of those who underwent alcohol and drug treatment .
By 2008 " the lion ’s share " of the cost of drug and alcohol treatment was paid by private payers . ]
While it can be argued that Smithers ' efforts played an important role , it was Jellinek 's study that was such a monumental turning point for the supporters of the disease concept .
The disease model was , in part , developed and promulgated by Jellinek and various other partial participants , all with personal agendas .
Today ( 2009 ) , Jellinek 's " Stages of the Alcoholism " is still widely used to diagnose substance abuse .
Jellinek 's Stages of Addiction
But , these stages are based on a corrupt study that the author , himself , later refuted .
Jellinek not only published a fraudulent study , he defrauded members of his academic community , and apparently lied about his educational background to gain acceptance .
Nonetheless , it was Jellinek 's " Stages of the Alcoholism " that led to diagnosing alcoholism as a disease and eventually to the medical acceptance of alcoholism as a disease .
Astoundingly , the inception of the disease theory and treatment for substance abuse is based on fraud .
While many advocate for its benefits , the disease concept has proven to be far more damaging to substance user then anyone could have predicted .
Therapists claim the disease concept helps the patient to understand the seriousness of [ his / her ] problems .
But in reality , this idea backfired .
The disease concept stripped the substance user of personal responsibility .
A disease cannot be cured by force of will ; therefore , adding the medical label transfers the responsibility from the user to caregivers .
Inevitably , the users become unwilling victims , and just as inevitably they take on that role .
In retrospect then , the disease concept has effectively increased alcoholism and drug use .
Furthermore , its only benefit has been vast monetary reward for the professionals ' and governmental agencies responsible for providing recovery services .
Specifically , it has not offered a solution for those attempting to stop abusive alcohol and drug use .
Baldwin Research Institute , Inc. interviewed 545 self - acknowledged substance users .
Out of the 545 , 454 of them had been to at least one conventional , disease - based treatment facility prior to the interview .
Some had been to as many as 20 or more conventional , disease - based treatment facilities prior to the interview .
Of the total 545 substance abusers , 542 never thought they had a disease .
Rather , they thought they had made poor choices regarding their substance use .
Three thought they had a disease , and it should be noted that those three were continuing to use substances .
For those who did not think they had a disease , more than 400 of them falsely stated during conventional treatment that they believed they had a disease .
The pressure to conform to the treatment rhetoric and the built - in excuse to relapse were the primary reasons given by treatment clients for saying they had a disease even when they believed wholeheartedly that it was not true .
Many , perhaps most , substance users embrace any excuse to be insincere and abdicate responsibility for themselves , even if they know in their heart , it 's a lie .
In a recent Gallup poll , 90 percent of people surveyed believe that alcoholism is a disease .
Most argue that because the American Medical Association ( AMA ) has proclaimed alcoholism a disease , the idea is without reproach .
But , the fact is that the AMA made this determination in the absence of empirical evidence .
After reviewing the history of the decision , it is reasonable to suggest that the AMA has been pursuing its own agenda in the face of evidence refuting the disease theory of alcoholism .
While the AMA has made contributions in the mental health field , the AMA is not outside the box and many of its mental health contributions have been dubious , at best .
The AMA is a part of the capitalist paradigm that is necessary for our society to function .
The promulgation of the disease concept , in conjunction with AMA approval , has created a multi-billion dollar treatment industry that contributes billions to the health care industry .
But , even with the AMA 's lofty status , mistakes in classifications can and has resulted in disastrous consequence .
While the AMA 's classifications for the most part are accurate , the organization is not without error .
Since its inception the AMA has made classifications of varying " deviant " behaviors without scientific research to validate its claims .
And , for whatever reason , the definition of a disease , as set forth by the AMA , is a malleable and all inclusive definition allowing for the inclusion of almost every behavior , deviant or otherwise .
As a result , every unwanted behavior can be medicalized and medically treated , thereby providing professionals with more patients and more income .
With respect to alcoholism , it is beyond the grasp of logic for medical professionals to prescribe 12 - Step type meeting attendance as a remedy for an " incurable " medical ailment , not to mention a contradiction to the supposed nature of the problem .
Medical professionals are admittedly incapable of helping drug addicts and alcoholics so they pass the buck to organizations outside of the medical community .
But , because of recidivism rates and treatment failure , the buck is passed right back .
Patients in search of help , pay , on average , over $ 18,000 ( BRI , 2003 ) to attend programs based on principals promulgated by 12 Step groups .
After an array of varying forms of " therapy " the patient is released with a prescription for lifelong attendance to AA or NA meetings .
In treatment and 12 Step groups , the individual is told that they can only live " one day at a time . "
Additionally , they are told that they should never be fooled into believing they can be cured , and if they do n't attend meetings they will inevitably fall prey to their " disease doing push - ups in the parking lot . "
The disease , as described by 12 Steppers , is all powerful ; it is a separate entity and without meetings it will destroy them .
But , with some thought one realizes that these ideas are oxymoronic .
To point out the obvious , if someone is " powerless " they would , by definition , not be able to control themselves , not even one day at a time .
The absurdities do not stop with 12 Step groups ; professionals contribute their own set of absurdities .
For example , the AMA 's definition of alcoholism is : " Alcoholism is an illness characterized by preoccupation with alcohol and loss of control over its consumption , such as to lead usually to intoxication if drinking ; by chronicity , by progression and by a tendency toward relapse .
It is typically associated with physical disability and impaired emotional , occupational and / or social adjustments as a direct consequence of persistent excessive use . "
A natural assumption would be that the classification of a disease requires that characteristics and symptoms can be measured or observed .
While the majority of diseases fit this requirement , substance abuse does not .
The contradiction to these requirements lies within the defined nature of " alcoholism . "
This supposed disease 's symptoms are only discovered after the consumption of alcohol .
The health risks , dangerous behaviors and repercussions only materialize after the alcohol is consumed and not before .
In comparison , the diagnosis for cancer comes after symptoms surface or cancerous cell are discovered .
There are physically visible anomalies that can be measured .
This measurement does not exist with alcoholics .
The majority of time , the diagnoses of alcoholism is a guess , if indeed such a diagnosis actually exists .
There is little question that a person exposed to enough carcinogens or radiation will eventually get cancer .
With alcohol it is questionable if a person will become a problem drinker if exposed to alcohol .
While cancer is a separate entity of its own within the body that first exists without the knowledge of its host , over consumption of alcohol , a substance consumed by choice , is necessary before a diagnosis can be made .
That is to say that one must choose to create the condition before the condition can exist and subsequently be diagnosed .
Furthermore , consider the following taken from CNE Health .
" From doctors and patients to drug companies and the media , there are relentless pressures to classify any condition as a disease .
Richard Smith , the British Medical Journals editor , wrote : ' Doctors , particularly some specialists , may welcome the boost to status , influence and income that comes when new territory is defined as medical .
International pharmaceutical companies have an apparent interest in medicalising life 's problems .
Dr. Iona Heath , head of ethics at the Royal College of General Practitioners , warns that there could also be clear downsides : ' Alternative approaches - emphasizing the self - limiting or relatively benign natural history of a problem or the importance of personal coping strategies - are played down or ignored .
The disease - mongers gnaw away at our self - confidence .
Inappropriate medicalization carries the dangers of unnecessary labeling , poor treatment decisions , economic waste , as well as the costs that result when resources are diverted from treating or preventing more serious disease .
At a deeper level , it may help to feed obsessions with health .
" ( CNE Health )
Then , there is the DSM IV criterion for diagnosing alcohol abuse .
It also does not include physically measurable symptoms .
It only requires social and / or legal problems .
The DSM IV criterion for diagnosing alcohol dependence requires only one physical symptom that is a result of drinking too much , which is alcohol withdrawal .
Following this logic , if a person smokes cigarettes they do not have a problem , but , when they stop smoking and go through nicotine withdrawal , they are then diseased .
Yet , most treatment professionals seem oblivious to these blatant contradictions .
( Keep in mind that cigarette smoking is not a disease according to DSM IV , although it causes far more health problems than does the use of alcohol and all other drugs combined . )
Sociologist and psychologist have long since been aware of the dangers of medicalizing deviant and normal behaviors .
Most encourage extreme caution when diagnosing mental illness because of the potential for damage in doing so .
People , who are labeled , usually conform to the standards that labels indicate , whether the diagnosis is correct or not .
It ’s dangerous ground that is commonly tread upon by professionals today .
What 's even more disheartening is that a large percentage of diagnoses are not made by doctors , but by unqualified " drug counselors . "
Treatment and AA are recommended by counselors as a way to " nip it in the bud . "
But , these recommendations do far more damage to the individual than if they had just been left alone ( which will be discussed later . )
It should be pointed out that there is a major conflict of interest among drug counselors , a conflict of interest that cannot , and should not , be ignored .
The majority of counselors are , themselves , members of 12 Step groups and are believers in AA doctrine .
These non-professional " professional " counselors have been manipulated into believing 12 - Step propaganda .
And , like the AMA , their " professional " status allows counselors to convince patients that the patient needs help because they are sick .
And , if this 12 Step nonsense is not harmful enough , misinformation abounds .
Consider that attempts to prove a genetic link for alcohol and drug use , most studies only provide roundabout evidence of a predisposition , not a cause for alcoholism .
With this said , we should point out that the predisposition can only prove a difference in bodily processes , not a difference in thinking .
'' Knowing the sequence of individual genes does n't tell you anything about the complexities of what life is , '' said Dr. Brian Goodwin , a theoretical biologist at Schumacher College in Devon , England , and a member of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico .
Goodwin goes on to explain single gene mutations are not accountable for , and cannot explain , complex behaviors .
Genes produce proteins they do not guide behaviors .
The truth is a predisposition for substance abuse , if it does exist , has no bearing on subsequent behaviors .
Chemical processes do not make a person an alcoholic .
The person makes the conscience choice .
Altered processing of alcohol in no way determines choice or behaviors .
Obsessive drinking is not a reaction to bodily processes , but merely a choice .
The amount consumed is determined by the individual , not by the body .
Nevertheless , news stories surface every year proclaiming discoveries of the genetic sources of emotional and behavioral problems while ignoring the mountains of evidence that refutes such preposterous assertions .
In the study a genetic marker was found in 69 percent of 70 cadavers who had died from alcohol related deaths .
But , the cadavers only represented 5 percent of the American population .
According to the study , 25 percent of the population has the " alcoholism gene marker " or genetic predisposition .
The actual alcoholic population is 10 percent .
It was then found that only 1/5 of the 25 percent that have the marker would develop alcoholic drinking that fit the parameters of those involved in the Blum - Noble study .
Therefore , the results failed to demonstrate any increased vulnerability to alcoholism .
In later articles , it was revealed that the genetic marker appears to have little to do with becoming alcoholic .
Not surprisingly , the AMA supported the faulty findings with limited investigation .
The two members of the team who reported the false discovery of the gene were not without bias .
Ernest Noble is the former director of the NIAAA and Blum , a Pharmacologist for Texas University , markets his own remedy for the malady in the form of supplements .
Subsequently , a team of three genetics researchers summarized the results of research on the Blum and Noble " alcoholism gene : " excluding results from studies Blum himself conducted , the frequency of the A1 allele at DRD2 is 0.18 in alcoholics , 0.18 in controls ( random population and nonalcoholic ) , and 0.18 in severe alcoholics .
Blum et al. reported allele frequencies for their alcoholics that are significantly different from the combined allele frequencies reported by a total of seven other groups of investigators for alcoholics ( p < .001 ) . "
( J Gelernter , D Goldman , N Risch , The A1 allele at the D2 dopamine receptor gene and alcoholism : A reappraisal , JAMA , 1993;269:1676 )
Looking at the situation objectively , if alcoholism is passed through genes , the abnormality must be relatively new .
As stated previously , alcoholism did not exist in the early colonization of America .
In fact , it did not exist until the late 1700's .
Some would argue that the residents of the United States are largely immigrants and , as a result , the alcoholism gene was introduced later in history .
Meaning , the " new " citizens are not of the same family tree as those of the 1700s .
But , it ’s important to point out , many cultures outside of the United States do not even know what alcoholism is ; they do not have a word for it .
People with different cultural backgrounds do not have different genetic make - ups .
America 's arrogance has led the population to believe that we are scientifically more advanced than other cultures ; therefore , we know the truth and they do not .
But this is far from true .
In a country where we claim to " know the truth " , the City of Los Angeles has more addicts than all of Europe .
While professionals strive to obscure the stigma surrounding alcoholics , they are , in essence , removing the social unacceptability of the act .
By removing the stigma , they are encouraging this socially unacceptable behavior to continue .
Today , the AMA reports that while there is no " alcoholic personality , " it does not seem unreasonable to believe that there may be " some combination of personality traits which are contributive to the development of alcoholism . "
They assert that emotional immaturity and strong dependency needs are commonly seen in alcoholics .
While researchers work hard to prove the disease concept sound and verifiable , repeatedly studies refute the impact of genetic predispositions .
Strangely , cultural groups that do n't believe they can control their drinking have higher rates of alcoholism than those who believe they can .
The NIAAA ( National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse ) found that 1 in 4 children in the US have been exposed to a family member who was / is an alcoholic before the age of 18 .
In 1974 an estimate was developed by Booz - Allen Hamilton based on the ratio of problem drinkers in the United States , and the average number of children a family has .
This method was then applied by the Children of Alcoholics Foundation in 1984 , and it is estimated that 6,600,000 adolescents were children of alcoholics ( Keep in mind that there are 195,000,000 people in the United States , so even though 6,600,000 looks large , compared to the total population , it is not . )
Another estimate , using the 1980 population census , puts the number of COA 's ( Children of Alcoholics ) at 22,000,000 .
It has also been found that children exposed to the idea that they will inevitably become alcoholic drinkers should they decide to drink , and those who enter support groups , have lower self - esteem and increased feelings of depression , two characteristics of every substance abuser .
Similar to treatment for substance abusers overall , children entering support groups as a result of familial problems are more likely to develop the same or similar problems themselves .
Furthermore , it has been shown in numerous studies that COA 's are only 6 percent more likely to become problem drinkers .
Like the need for a war on drugs , the idea that COA 's will inevitably become alcoholics , is pure propaganda .
Teaching children they will face inevitable consequence upon the consumption of substances , for many , actually creates the problem .
It seems that self - proclaimed treatment professionals , blinded by intention , ignore the overwhelming evidence that contradicts the very principles they teach .
True scientist and medical professionals know , beyond all reasonable doubt , the truth about alcoholism and substance use .
The truth being : all substance use is a conscious choice .
The rise of pop-psychology has clouded reasonable thought on the subject .
Self - help groups , treatment , " therapy , " counselors , and groupers are severely damaging the very people they whole - heartedly try to help .
Twelve - Step dogma and treatment misinformation contradicts empirical evidence and rational thought , in essence , stripping patients and members of their inborn abilities of spontaneous recovery .
While the NCADD ( National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence ) , formally the NCA , claims to " fight the stigma and the disease of alcoholism and other drug addictions , " its happy - go - lucky explanations of alcoholism and its nature are insultingly unsound .
The NIAAA and the NCADD are two adamant supporters of the disease concept and 12 step therapies .
But , as previously stated , they are not altruistic in their efforts .
These two organizations fund most of the treatment research that goes on in the United States .
And , like Marty Mann of old , they pick and choose studies that fit their agendas , or they manipulate and reinterpret the outcomes in their own favor .
Thus , they receive funding to preserve themselves .
This fact is applicable across the board for all certifying governmental organizations and institutions .
In truth , whether intentional or not , it is pure genius .
By filtering the facts , these organizations have " created " the necessity for themselves .
They have created a public perception that they are needed by controlling and manipulating substance abuse information .
It has been estimated that 5.5 million Americans are in need of help for substance abuse issues .
In 1988 , 10.5 million U.S. residents could be diagnosed with alcohol dependency as set forth by the AMA and DSM IV , and 7.2 million more abused alcohol .
Estimates among the general population indicate that 6 - 12 % have substance abuse problems .
The population of substance abusers has slowly increased since the 1930's coinciding with the spread of the disease theory and governmental interference in individual freedoms .
What is interesting is that since the 1970's substance abuse has increased dramatically and proportionately with the popularity and prevalence of the drug treatment industry .
The question is : if the multi-billion dollar war on drugs and the multi-billion dollar treatment industry have been growing , why does the drug problem continue to get worse ?
Irrefutable empirical evidence has shown that organizations and institutions that promote , and adhere to , the disease concept , fail when trying to help people with substance use problems .
Alcoholics Anonymous has successfully promoted itself as the only hope for alcohol abusers .
The public perception is that Alcoholics Anonymous works , but reality is something quite different .
In 75 years , Alcoholics Anonymous has become a part of our social structure .
Its tenets have led the medical establishment and been used to diagnose patients with alcoholism while simultaneously giving birth to dozens of spin - off anonymous meetings .
Its most outstanding accomplishment has been successfully promoting a fictitious disease , as fact , and to be absorbed into the very fabric of our society .
But , while Alcoholics Anonymous has accomplished the unthinkable , its accomplishments have damaged the society .
Although its intentions are synonymous with help , the organization 's lies and manipulations have damaged society as a whole , costing taxpayers billions of dollars and costing families the lives of their loved ones .
In 1990 , the Alcoholics Anonymous General Services Office or AA GSO , the governing organization overseeing all " autonomous " meetings , published an internal memo for the employees of its offices .
It was an analysis of a survey period between 1977 and 1989 .
The results were in absolute contrast to the public perception of AA .
" After just one month in the Fellowship , 81 percent of the new members have already dropped out .
After three months , 90 percent have left , and a full 95 percent have disappeared inside one year ! "
( Kolenda , 2003 , Golden Text Publishing Company )
That means that , in under a year , 95 percent of the people seeking help from Alcoholics Anonymous leave the program .
While this only speaks for attendance , it has further implications .
For the most part , those who study the efficacy of Alcoholics Anonymous do not include dropouts in their sobriety failure statistics , which is deceptive , if not outright dishonest .
When studies include AA GSO dropout statistics , " ... the total averages of sobriety for the total AA membership become 3.7 percent for one year [ of sobriety ] , and 2.5 percent over five years . "
( Kolenda , 2003 , Golden Text Publishing Company )
It 's important to understand that 95 percent of all substance abuse treatment centers in the United States are 12 - Step based programs .
Thus , the failures of Alcoholics Anonymous are also the failures of treatment .
Repeated studies have shown that the average person , who could be diagnosed with a substance abuse problem , will discontinue use on their own 20 to 30 percent of the time .
But , those who are exposed to AA and treatment and who are taught the disease concept have a drastically decreased chance of achieving sobriety .
While treatment professionals are aware of program failure , governing organizations support and promote the adoption of 12 - Step tenets into treatment programs for substance abusers .
Families pay tens of thousands of dollars to help their loved ones only to place them in programs that follow guidelines of a documented failed program .
Any program based on a program that fails will inevitably fail .
For most , 12 - Step has become synonymous with failure .
In contrast , programs that teach personal responsibility and choice are far more successful than programs that teach the disease theory .
While conventional treatment methods result in a 3 percent success rate after five years , programs that do not teach the disease concept , and instead teach choice , have success rates of more than 60 % percent after five and even 10 years ( Baldwin Research Institute , 2003 ) .
In conclusion , after reviewing the available research from both sides of the debate , the belief in the disease of alcoholism ( addiction ) , causes the disease .
Organizations and institutions that promote the disease theory are , in many cases , doing irreparable harm to the individual and performing a disservice to the population as a whole .
Geneticists are aware that a predisposition does not dictate subsequent behavior , and treatment professionals are aware that the programs they offer , fail .
It is an outright injustice when faced with the facts .
Stripping human beings of their ability to choose is damaging , whereas giving them back the power of their own volition is essential for recovery .
Alcoholism is a choice , not a disease .

Yes , I was quite curious as well what progress she was citing and the story fails to mention anything specific .
Of course , this is because there is no progress to cite but do n’t tell that to whoever coughed up the headline .
Afghanistan has drifted for years and now we have a resurgent Taliban , increased poppy production , dropping investments and a government who stands idle while a journalist is found guilty of downloading a report on women ’s rights .
No wonder they ca n’t cite a damned thing .
Scientists in the US report being one step closer to designing a miniaturised , portable PCR machine that could be used for applications such as point - of - care diagnostics .
The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a technique for copying specific DNA sequences .
The three basic steps in the process - splitting a DNA template into its two single strands ( denaturation ) ; adding short segments of complementary DNA called primers to initiate replication of a chosen DNA sequence ( annealing ) ; and adding DNA polymerase to synthesise the complementary strand ( extension ) - are repeated again and again to amplify the sequence .
Each of these steps occurs optimally at a different temperature , so heating and cooling is carried out with an instrument called a thermocycler .
Standard thermocyclers are generally slow and consume a great deal of energy .
A new device described in a forthcoming issue of Angewandte Chemie amplifies DNA by PCR but costs about $ 10 ( ? 5 ) to make , is battery operated , and can fit in a pocket .
’ It seems too simple to even work , ’ said project leader Victor Ugaz , a chemical engineer at Texas A&M University .
’ But it works quite well , ’ he told Chemistry World .
’ You can get fast performance with a miniature device while using the same reaction sizes you would normally use . ’
In previous work1 , Ugaz and colleagues showed how a temperature gradient could be used to create a circulatory flow ideal for carrying out chemical reactions that require thermal cycling , such as the PCR .
One limitation of their lava - lamp - like device was controlling the amount of time the PCR reagents were in each temperature zone .
In the latest study2 , Ugaz ’s team attempted to fix this problem by creating a loop system with a unidirectional flow .
The device consists of three aluminium blocks held together by screws .
When one block is heated and maintained at the denaturing temperature , the screws , which have different thermal conductivities , transfer heat to the other blocks , which attain the temperatures needed for annealing or extension .
PCR reagents are added to a tube , which loops around the blocks to form a rectangular path .
Adjusting the size of the blocks and the length of the tubing optimizes the amount of time the reagents are at a certain temperature .
’ It ’s very clever , ’ said Kevin Dorfman , a chemical engineer at the University of Minnesota , Minneapolis - St. Paul .
’ This is really significant proof that a cheap , simple , and portable PCR device is possible . ’
The next step for Ugaz and colleagues is to show that their device can be used to detect PCR products in real time rather than by gel electrophoresis .
A self - contained amplification and detection system is ideal for the rapid identification of infectious diseases in locations with limited access to laboratories .

FDIC Highlights Bank Strategies for Encouraging Low - and Moderate - Income Households to Save
FDIC Quarterly Also Reports on Feasibility of Raising Insurance Coverage for Municipal Deposits
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 19 , 2008 Media Contact :
Andrew Gray ( 202-898-7192 )
In the current issue of FDIC Quarterly , released today , the FDIC examines the challenges that lower - income households face in increasing personal saving , incentives banks have for encouraging these households to build assets , and strategies for banks to broaden their relationships with these customers .
The FDIC also reports on the results of a congressionally mandated study on the feasibility of increasing insurance coverage for municipal deposits .
In the article " Building Assets , Building Relationships : Bank Strategies for Encouraging Lower - Income Households to Save , " the FDIC explains that banks already have account relationships or other connections with many low - and moderate - income households .
Because banks have incurred the fixed costs of acquiring these customers , their challenge is to increase the profitability of these relationships while providing consumers with opportunities to build assets .
" In light of a very low national saving rate and the more recent decline in home equity , I am particularly concerned about the ability of lower - income households to plan for their financial futures , " said FDIC Chairman Sheila C. Bair .
" I am , however , encouraged that a growing number of banks are beginning to view these consumers as a long - term business opportunity .
I have asked the FDIC Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion – which convenes today – to consider the issues surrounding asset - building opportunities , and I look forward to the Committee 's feedback . "
The article describes several strategies that banks have used to develop asset - building programs for lower - income households .
These include " doing no harm " by offering reasonably priced products and services , expanding direct deposit options , partnering with outside organizations , leveraging tax refunds into savings , and linking saving to credit and other bank products .
In the article " Increasing Deposit Insurance Coverage for Municipalities and Other Units of General Government : Results of the 2006 FDIC Study , " the FDIC examines the pros and cons of raising coverage for these entities and considers whether private sector options provide a viable alternative to traditional public deposit collateralization programs .
This issue of the FDIC Quarterly also includes fourth quarter industry results from the Quarterly Banking Profile released on February 26 , 2008 .
The FDIC Quarterly is available online at the FDIC's Web site at : http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/quarterly/index.html.
###
Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to restore public confidence in the nation 's banking system .
The FDIC insures deposits at the nation 's 8,534 banks and savings associations and it promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions by identifying , monitoring and addressing risks to which they are exposed .
The FDIC receives no federal tax dollars – insured financial institutions fund its operations .

We Have Chosen Shame and Will Get War .
Site Home : Research : One Article
" Owing to the neglect of our defences and the mishandling of the German problem in the last five years , we seem to be very near the bleak choice between War and Shame .
My feeling is that we shall choose Shame , and then have War thrown in a little later , on even more adverse terms than at present . "
HTML -- the worst of both worlds
Do n't hold your breath .
The basic idea of the Web goes back at least to 1969 .
Douglas Engelbart , the inventor of the mouse , developed an integrated system for computer - supported cooperative work and demonstrated it to 2000 people in a San Francisco hotel ballroom .
One corner of the display contained a live video image of his collaborator , sitting at a computer terminal 30 miles away .
The computer combined input from the two men's keyboards and mice to build hypertext documents and graphics .
Although the system was implemented on a timesharing mainframe computer , Engelbart showed his ARPAnet interface and distributing the collaborators across the network was the obvious next step .
[ Reference : Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference 1994 videotape , ACM ]
Academic computer scientists reimplemented Engelbart 's ideas numerous times in the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s , but none of them caught on .
Either the code did n't really work , the researchers concerned themselves with publishing a journal paper rather than making a useful system , the system required a particular brand of computer , or there were n't enough people on the Internet to make it worth trying .
A reimplementation of Engelbart 's ideas by a group of C programmers at CERN , a physics lab in Switzerland , grew into the World Wide Web fad .
The Web caught on like wildfire after the release of NCSA Mosaic , a program that made Web pages with pictures viewable on several different kinds of computers .
The fact that we'd lost all of Engelbart 's collaboration tools did n't bother anyone ; where he had vector graphics we now had bitmap graphics ( sort of ; see below ) .
The syntax of Hyper Text Markup Language ( HTML ) , the lingua franca of the Web , is derived from Structured Generalized Markup Language ( SGML ) , which facilitates information exchange among databases .
The fundamental idea of SGML is that instead of a document only a human can read , you mark up your document with machine - readable tags , i.e. , sematic markup .
For example , a corporate earnings report might look like this
< revenue >4,700 </ revenue > < expenses >4,400 </ expenses > < profit>300</ profit >
< product > blue jeans </ product > < priceUSD>25</priceUSD >
blue jeans < b >$ 25</b>
What 's wrong with that ?
There are plenty of formatting languages , e.g. , PostScript , and nobody complains that they do n't have semantic markup .
Maybe that 's because most formatting languages allow you to format documents readably .
A naive mind might assume that HTML was designed by a bunch of people who sat down with 100 documents of different types and said " let 's not leave the table until we 've put enough richness into this language to capture the authors ' and designers ' intent for at least 98 of the documents . "
Ever since the advent of the programming language C , however , this is not how software is designed .
Instead of asking " how can we fulfill user requirements ? "
C programmers ask " how many of the features that were commonly available in 1970 can I add to my program without it crashing ( too often ) ? "
The result ?
A formatting language too wimpy even for a novel .
Crack open a copy of The English Patient [ Ondaatje 1992 ] .
Although its narrative style is about as unconventional as you 'd expect for a Booker Prize winner , it is formatted very typically for a modern novel .
Sections are introduced with a substantial amount of whitespace ( 3 cm ) , a large capital letter about twice the height of the normal font , and the first few words in small caps .
Paragraphs are not typically separated by vertical whitespace as in most Web browsers but by their first line being indented about three characters .
( This makes dialog much easier to read than on the Web , by the way , where paragraph breaks cut huge gaps between short sentences and break the flow of dialog . )
Chronological or thematic breaks are denoted by vertical whitespace between paragraphs , anywhere from one line 's worth to a couple of centimeters .
If the thematic break has been large , it gets a lot of whitespace and the first line of the next paragraph is not indented .
If the thematic break is small , it gets only a line of whitespace and the first line of the next paragraph is indented .
The English Patient is not an easy book to read in paperback .
It would become , however , a virtually impossible book to read on the Web because neither the author 's nor the book designer 's intents are expressible in HTML .
Two $ 30,000 workstations talking to each other over a $ 10,000 T3 link can't deliver a document to a reader as well as the simplest word processor .
HTML 's designers respond to these criticisms by saying " It 's a structure language , not a formatting language .
Users can set up their browsers to format documents however they like .
Besides , we 've been thinking about coming out with style sheets for several years now . "
If HTML really were a structure language instead of merely having the appearance of one , there would be a " thematic break " tag that would let browsers format documents readably .
Even if there were enough structure in HTML , is it really efficient for each of 20 million people to spend five minutes designing a document badly when one professional could have spent a few days doing the job right ?
As for the style sheets and rest of the evolving " standards " from the Web committees , it remains to be seen whether anyone will be speaking standard HTML in the long run .
Less than a year after the Web emerged as a consumer service , the crippled nature of HTML 2.0 lead to a Tower of Babel .
Scientists added hyperlink anchors to TeX so that they could transmit formulae and view their documents with custom browsers .
Document experts escaped into Adobe 's PDF format .
Netscape added private extensions HTML to facilitate graphic design and advertising so now one can't look at most Web sites without using the Netscape browser .
HTML is where the Web starts and probably where it will end .
The decision to choose a structure language would have been OK even if it meant pathologically ugly pages .
We would have been paid back in convenience and automated systems doing our work for us .
But the Web was doomed when the C programmers at CERN forgot to add any structure tags .
They chose shame and got war .
If you thought the text was bad , just look at the pictures
Computer monitors have a non -linear response to the input voltage .
If you regard an image color as a number between 0 ( black ) and 1 ( white ) , a typical monitor behaves as though it exponentiates the color to the power of 2.5 before displaying it .
Thus , a medium grey of 0.5 in an image turns into 0.5 ^2.5 = 0.177 , almost black , on the screen .
It is very easy to correct for this .
You just adjust the input pixels by exponentiating them to the power of 1/2.5 before feeding them to the graphics system .
This is known as gamma correction and is done by every Macintosh or Silicon Graphics computer .
Most Unix boxes and PCs do n't bother with this frill though .
They figure that you paid $ 20,000 for a machine that can't do word processing or $ 4000 so that you could run Microsoft software and therefore you probably are n't smart enough to notice that half of your pictures are lost in black shadows .
Professional graphic artists generally produce Web sites on Macintoshes .
They slave over the images until the mid-tones look just right , mid-tones that will be mapped almost to black on a typical Sun workstation or PC .
The solution to this problem is trivial : a gamma= field in the IMG HTML tag .
Given the gamma for which the image was originally targeted and the characteristics of the display on which the image is being displayed , the adjustment process is speedy and easily implemented , even in C .
Why did n't the designers of the Web bother to insert the one line in the standard that would have facilitated this ?
Because they were C programmers and C programmers are so cheap now that their employers do n't feel like spending the extra money to buy them 24 - bit displays ( " be glad you have a job ; if you complain , we 'll hire a Bangladeshi over the Internet to replace you and pay him 2 bags of rice / week " ) .
These poor souls had never seen an image look good on a computer screen and hence thought that standards did n't matter .
You might think that these are the ravings of an aesthete , someone who labors under the misconception the Web was built for displaying high - quality art to a discerning audience .
What does it matter if a few artistic photos are distorted when what the Web is really about is cramming product brochures and catalogs down peoples ' throats ?
Well , catalog merchants go to extraordinary lengths to ensure color and tone fidelity in their printed catalogs .
Kodak even makes special film for catalog photography and keeps it in its product line years after it has become obsolete because printers understand its spectral properties .
Merchant who spend millions on their catalog Web sites may be overjoyed to watch the goods fly out the door , but they 'll be dismayed to find half of them fly right back because the delivered product did n't match the shade of mauve consumers saw on screen .
Forms , the 3270 of the 1990s
If the 3270 design appeals to you , take a trip down to the Computer Museum or load up Netscape .
The forms user interface model fell into the shade after 1984 when the Macintosh " user drives " pull - down menu system was introduced .
However , the Web provides balm for your nostalgia .
HTML forms work exactly like the good old 3270 .
Java
There is a stampede of people rushing to program in Java right now .
Java takes some features of Lisp from 1960 ( e.g. , automatic storage allocation and garbage collection ) and some features from SmallTalk circa 1975 ( e.g. , object classes ) and combines them with C syntax so that the current crop of programming drones does n't get too bad a shock when adapting to these 20 or 35 year - old " innovations " .
A naive person would probably ask " if I let an arbitrary program from the network run on my computer , what stops that program from getting into my personal files , snooping around my local network , etc . ? "
Sun Microsystems assures you that its Java engineering staff has thought of every contingency and that Java is completely safe .
This is the same company that was unable to make their operating system 's mailer secure .
Thus , Robert Morris , a graduate student at Cornell , was able to write a simple program that took over every Sun Unix workstation on the Internet ( plus most other Unix boxes , except for Digital's ) .
If you trust a Unix vendor to assure your security , please send me email .
I have some waterfront property in Florida that I would like to sell you .
Such bad text , pictures , and forms , and in such small portions too
Unix Haters
Academic computer scientists understood these problems decades ago , of course , and published papers on the subject .
They like to remind Web weenies of this fact : " Of course , any network system will come to a halt if you do n't have caching [ so that 1000 copies of the same thing are n't expensively fetched 1000 times ] and naturally the right way to find resources is to have a network - wide name that gets mapped by a distributing naming system to the closest available server .
Did n't you read my paper in the ACM Journal of Network Algorithms in 1972 ? "
They say this in the same patronizing tones that they reserve for Bill Gates and Microsoft .
It is true that systems that people use today would be much better if their builders had read the papers published by academicians in the 1960s and 70s .
This is a little unfair to the practitioners , though , because nobody has ever shown that academic computer science journal articles have any effect on either practical computer programs or even on academic computer science research .
Programmers tend to write programs that are natural extensions of systems that they 've personally used , not systems described in a 10 page paper they 've read .
Apple and Microsoft programmers proudly add multitasking to their operating systems in the 1990s , unaware that their " innovation " was common commercial practice in the 1960s .
University researchers in the 1990s build little tools for processing images , unaware that graphic artists in the 1980s were getting vastly better results with PhotoShop .

Top McCain defender 's firm prepped Blackwater for congressional probe Michael Roston
Published : Friday February 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This As John McCain 's reputation as a family man and a politician with a clean ethical record came under attack on Thursday , one man 's voice was heard most loudly : top political adviser Charles R. Black , Jr. . " Were going to go to war with them now ,  Black bluntly told the Politico on Thursday , referring to the New York Times .
Black was front and center in several media accounts about the Times ' allegations regarding McCain 's relationship with lobbyist Vicky Iseman , assailing the paper for lowering its standards and " smearing " the senator .
For Black , it must have seemed like just another day at the office .
The lobbying firm he leads , BKSH & Associates , is a specialist in helping its corporate clients put out fires in Washington .
And for the second time in this election season , Black was connected to a major campaign - related controversy .
The last time , his firm helped prepare private military contractor giant Blackwater Worldwide for a congressional probe of the killing of 17 civilians by its guards in Baghdad .
In the process of coaching Blackwater , BKSH inadvertently drew Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign into a lengthy controversy over the private career of its top political strategist , Mark Penn .
In addition to guiding Clinton 's campaign , Penn heads up Burson - Marsteller , a global public relations company with many clients whose interests often seem to clash with a variety of Democratic political goals .
BKSH is a subsidiary of Penn 's firm .
A former BKSH employee , Robert Tappan , had brought Blackwater to BKSH as a client .
The ex-State Department official has since left Black 's firm , and Blackwater is no longer a client .
Still , the Times ' revelations on Thursday are likely to focus more attention on the clients and company that McCain supporters like Black have been known to keep .
It 's not clear whether Black 's firm 's work for Blackwater has had any effect on Senator McCain 's policy positions relating to the use of private military contractors .
Black would insist it has not .
" I not only do not lobby him [ McCain ] , but if an issue comes up that I have a client on , I will tell him that and stay out of the discussion , " he told the Washington Post on Friday .
Still , although McCain is the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , he has not been particularly vocal on the use of rented security personnel in Iraq and other locations around the world .
When Blackwater has come up , McCain has not addressed the issue directly .
In an October appearance on CNN when the company 's role in Iraq was being most deeply probed , McCain would only say that the failure of President Bush and ex-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to deploy enough troops in Iraq had made the use of contractors necessary .
Independent of Black , it 's possible that McCain has developed some grudging respect for the private security contractors the US employs in Iraq .
The senator has made many visits to the war - torn country , and congressional delegations are often guarded by contractors like Blackwater .
During the fall 2007
House hearings , Republican congress members praised the company for having a perfect protection record in the country .
" Blackwater has protected dozens if not hundreds of members of Congress , including myself and members of this committee , when they travel to Afghanistan and Iraq , " said Rep. Patrick McHenry ( R - NC ) in an October hearing of the House Oversight Committee .
" I for one am grateful for their services .
Not one single member of Congress has been injured nor killed under Blackwater protection , and for that I am grateful . "

For those of you who have been living in a cave , there has been a recent wave of activism in Tibet supporting autonomy for the region .
Some highlights , from CNN :
Monday , March 10
• Hundreds of monks begin a protest on the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising against Beijing rule , which led to the exile of the Dalai Lama , now living in India .
• About 300 monks from Drepung Monastery on the outskirts of Tibet ’s capital , Lhasa , peacefully march toward Barkhor Street in the central city , but Chinese People ’s Armed Police stop them before they reach the city .
Police arrest monks suspected to be ringleaders .
All the monks were seeking the release of fellow Drepung monks , who apparently were detained as they tried to celebrate the Dalai Lama ’s receipt of the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal in October .
Tuesday , March 11th
• About 2,000 Chinese troops fire tear gas to disperse hundreds of monks from Sera Monastery who are calling for the release of their fellow monks and shouting pro-Tibet slogans .
Wednesday , March 12
• About 100 Tibetan nuns from Chutsang Nunnery on the west side of Lhasa march peacefully toward Barkhor Street , but Chinese People ’s Armed Police block them .
No reports of arrests .
• Monks from Gaden Monastery , about 30 miles east of Lhasa , launch a protest .
Police surround and seal off the monastery .
Thursday , March 13
• Two monks from Kirti monastery in Sichuan Province stab themselves in the chest , hands and wrists .
A reporter for Radio Free Asia says they were protesting the arrest of 17 people in the Sera Monastery protest Monday .
RFA says the two monks are in critical condition and not expected to survive .
Other monks from Sera Monastery are staging a hunger strike to protest the arrests .
• Police arrest around 500 students from Tibet University .
Friday , March 14
• Monks from Ramoche Temple attempt to hold a protest march , but police block streets and prevent the demonstration .
Laypeople join in and scuffles break out .
There are reports of protesters setting fire to vehicles , shops and a main market in Lhasa .
——
The Dalai Lama , from is home in Dharamsala India , called the actions of the Chinese Government a “ cultural genocide ” , and asked for an international probe into the situation .
According to the exiled Tibetan Government , there have been 80 deaths so far in this wave — including women and children .
According to the exiles , “ Monasteries have been completely sealed off by [ the military ] and remain under extremely strict surveillance …
Monks are being followed even as they try to move within the compounds of the monastery . ”
Today a Youtube video was released entitled “ Tibet WAS , IS , and ALWAYS WILL BE a part of China ” , and has achieved 100,000 views in its first 18 hours online .
The interesting part , however , is that the video has become the # 2 most discussed video of the day because there have been over 10,000 pro-China comments during these 18 hours .
People have even gone so far as to call the Dalai Lama a “ terrorist ” on many occasions .
While this sounds like an intense amount of support for the Chinese Government , in fact it is completely fake .
Upon further examination , one can see that literally thousands of new YouTube accounts have been created today and have only commented on this video .
A classic case of an astroturf campaign , the goal is to bend our perception of reality : creating the false appearance that there is popular opposition to the exiled Tibetan Government .
Popular movements are extremely strong , which is why it is extremely alarming that a fake one might be arising .
Given that coummunity averages far less than 1000 new accounts per day throughout the entire site , it is clear that YOUTUBE IS BEING HACKED IN THE NAME OF CHINA .
It is beyond my technological capabilities to discover whether it is being done by the Chinese Government or simply from a Lama opponent , but I would be very interested to hear from anyone who might be able to find out .
The beauty of the internet and web 2.0 sites such as YouTube is that for the first time in history , inherent political bias is taken out of news reporting .
Since everyone has access to thousands of first hand videos and responses to them by people involved , they are no longer forced to take what news networks report as truth .
The events taking place today are extremely dangerous because they threaten to remove our ability to have this untainted window .
Falsification of information on YouTube with regards to Tibet are especially bad because we already start from a lack of information coming out of the region .
TibetWatch claims that 80 people have died in the recent protests , including women and children — yet the Chinese Government claims that the number is only ten , all of which burned to death in the chaos of the riots .
I might be inclined to believe China if they let anyone verify that number , but major news networks beside Xinhua ( owned by the Chinese Government ) have been banned from the region and thus cannot report any new information .
As always , lack of transparency implies there is something to hide .
Every once in a while , an account will surface on Youtube , but it is clear that this last channel of unbiased reporting has now also been cut off .
An aside : Even without commenting on whether Tibet deserves autonomy , it is clear that China has been in the wrong during this recent wave .
It is very hard to come up with an argument justifying the killing of monks in peaceful protest , ever .
However , the warriors for the free flow of information do have one major thing working in our favor : the 2008 Olympics .
Already there have been calls to boycott the games , and thankfully all eyes are on Beijing .
Furthermore , the monks know this .
Protests are expected to grow as the Olympics approach , and it will be impossible to ignore the events in Tibet — no matter how many thousands of fake accounts are created on YouTube .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Sales of existing homes fell to a record low in October , as even the largest drop in home prices ever was n't enough to revive moribund sales , according to the latest reading on the battered housing market by an industry trade group released Wednesday .
The National Association of Realtors reported that sales by homeowners fell in October to an annual pace of 4.97 million , down from the revised September reading of 5.03 million .
September had marked a record low since the trade group started tracking sales for both single - family homes and condos in 1999 .
October marked the eighth straight month that the pace of sales has declined from the month before , and it left sales down 20.7 percent from a year ago .
It was also worse than the consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Briefing .com who had forecast an annual rate of 5 million .
The median price of a home sold during the month fell 5.1 percent to $ 207,800 from $ 218,900 a year earlier .
It marked the largest year - over - year drop in prices and the 15th month in the last 17 in which that key measure declined .
Before the start of the current housing slump , it had been 11 years since prices fell compared to a year earlier .
The median price of a single - family home fell even more , dropping a record 6.3 percent to $ 205,700 .
The trade group has tracked those sales prices going back to 1989 , so the record is even more significant than the record price drop in all existing homes .
The previous record price drop for that key part of the housing market was set in September .
" Price declines are part of the healing process , but we have a lot of healing to do , " said Paul Kasriel , chief economist of Northern Trust in Chicago .
" Obviously , when you have excess supply , one of the ways you come back into equilibrium is with price declines , and we 're starting to see that that with a vengeance .
Of course we 're going to see more - it's not over . "
The excess supply of homes on the market reached near - record levels in October .
Realtors estimated that there are now 4.5 million homes available for sale , which represents a nearly 11 - month supply .
That is up from the 10.4 - month supply in September and is the largest glut of homes in more than 22 years .
" We expect inventory problems in the existing home market to take a few years to work through , " said Adam York , an economist with Wachovia .
The Realtors said the price drop is distorted by continued problems in the market for so - called jumbo loans , which are mortgages of more than $ 417,000 .
The mortgage woes have made it difficult to sell securities backed by those loans , and that in turn has choked off the ability of some buyers of expensive homes to arrange financing .
The group also said that 93 of 150 metropolitan markets are showing either flat or slightly higher prices , despite the decline in national price readings .
" We continue to see the biggest impact in high - cost markets the rely on jumbo loans , " said Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the trade group .
Still the group 's existing home sales figures showed the Northeast , a region with a large percentage of high - priced markets , had flat sales compared to September and a slight uptick in median sales price compared to a year earlier .
The Realtors also highlighted the fact that the annual pace of sales of single - family homes in October was 4.37 million - the same as the prior month .
But that September reading had been the weakest annual sales pace since January 1998 .
The condo market is particular hard hit , as sales plunged 9.1 percent from September , as the supply of condos rose to 13.1 months worth from 12.2 .
The weak housing market has hit home builders particularly hard .
Of the nation 's largest home builders , only luxury home builder Toll Brothers ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , No. 6 in terms of revenue , has yet to report a quarterly loss in the current downturn .
Analysts are forecasting a loss for Toll 's just completed period after preliminary results showed a sharp drop in the number of homes sold and an even steeper decline in prices .
The five builders larger than Toll all reported much larger - than - forecast losses in recent financial periods .
Earlier this month Hovnanian Enterprises ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's No. 7 builder by revenue , reported that the sales pace during October " significantly deteriorated " in most of its markets , and its preliminary results also showed a sharp rise in cancellations .
D.R. Horton ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the No. 3 builder , reported a smaller than expected loss last week .
In October , credit rating agency Moody 's downgraded the debt of No. 1 home builder Lennar ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , No. 2 Centex ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and No. 4 Pulte Homes ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) to junk bond status .
MUHAMMAD , AISHA , ISLAM , AND CHILD BRIDES
by Silas NOTE
I needed to edit and correct this article because Ive learned some new details .
Initially , I believed what many Muslims asserted : Muhammad sexually consummated his marriage to the nine year old Aisha following her first menstruation .
HOWEVER , after reading brother Sam Shamouns articles ( 1 , 2 ) , I realized that the Quran , the Hadith , and Muslim scholars writings state that a Muslim husband can engage in sex with a child - bride before she has her first menses .
Further , Muhammad actually did just this  he had intercourse with Aisha prior to her first menses !
This increases the weight and scope of my argument and places Muhammad and Islam in a far darker , more disreputable , light .
Many Muslims dont know this and by their own standards Muhammad did the wrong thing in having sex with a child .
Muslims have to answer for their continued support for Muhammad because he transgresses their standards .
When children are allowed to be used for sex then that is sexual exploitation ; so why do they support the creator and establishment of a system that entrenches the abuse and sexual exploitation of children ?
I am not trying to use cheap polemics .
Surely you realize that for children there are painful ramifications behind Muhammads action .
They need to be discussed in detail and in context .
It might be offensive to some but it needs to be discussed .
CONTENTS
1 ) INTRODUCTION
Picture this historical setting : A 49 year old man asks his best friend if he could have his permission to marry his 6 year old daughter .
His friend agrees .
The man then visits his best friends house and speaks with the 6 year old daughter .
Her parents watch as the he proposes marriage to the child .
He is serious ; he wants to marry the little girl and is asking for her consent .
The little child says nothing ; she only stares at him in silence .
The Islamic source materials state that Muhammad proposed marriage to Aisha when she was 6 .
He assumed her silence constituted her consent .
Some 2 to 3 years later , just after he had fled to Medina , he consummated his marriage with her .
He was 52 and she was 9 .
This occurred prior to Aishas first menses and by Islams legal definition Aisha was still considered a child .
Islam teaches that a child enters adulthood at the beginning of puberty .
( This is scientifically inaccurate , the onset of puberty does not equal adulthood  see Appendix 3 ) .
The bottom line is Muhammad , the creator of Islam , revered by his followers , had sex with a child !
Worse , Muhammad 's action and teachings on marriage established an Islamic precedent and Islamic law allows female children to be married off and engaged in sex provided they are able to handle a mans penis ( Quran 65:4 ) .
As will be shown , this leads to physical , and psychological , damage to the child .
_____________________________________________________________________
2 ) EVIDENCE THAT ISLAM ALLOWS CHILDREN TO ENGAGE IN SEX BEFORE MENSTRUATION
First , we need to establish that Islam allows female children to be married and engaged in sex prior to their first menses ( prepubescent ) .
For that we turn to the Islamic source materials .
Starting with the Quran :
If you are in doubt concerning those of your wives who have ceased menstruating , know that their waiting period shall be three months .
The same shall apply to those who have not menstruated .
As for pregnant women , their term shall end with their confinement .
God will ease the hardship of the man who fears him .
65:4 , Dawood Brother Sam Shamoun comments on this verse :
The surrounding context deals with the issue of the waiting period for divorce , and remarriage .
The Quran is telling Muslims to wait for a certain period of time before making the divorce final or deciding to forego it .
The Quran exhorts men to wait a period of three months in the case of women who either are no longer menstruating or havent even started their menstrual cycles !
( Source ) Since Muslim men are to wait 3 months before divorcing a prepubescent child it means that they have been engaging in sex with those children .
Borrowing from Sams work (*)
I quote three Islamic scholars commentary related to 65:4 and the subject of sex with prepubescent children : Ibn Kathir writes regarding 65:4 < divorce them at their ` Iddah > , " The `Iddah is made up of cleanliness and the menstrual period . "
So he divorces her while it is clear that she is pregnant , or he does not due to having sex , or since he does not know if she is pregnant or not .
This is why the scholars said that there are two types of divorce , one that conforms to the Sunnah and another innovated .
The divorce that conforms to the Sunnah is one where the husband pronounces one divorce to his wife when she is not having her menses and without having had sexual intercourse with her after the menses ended .
One could divorce his wife when it is clear that she is pregnant .
As for the innovated divorce , it occurs when one divorces his wife when she is having her menses , or after the menses ends , has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her , even though he does not know if she became pregnant or not .
There is a third type of divorce , which is neither a Sunnah nor an innovation where one divorces A YOUNG WIFE WHO HAS NOT BEGUN TO HAVE MENSES , the wife who is beyond the age of having menses , and divorcing one 's wife before the marriage was consummated .
( Source ; bold and capital emphasis ours ) Al - Tabari said regarding 65:4
The interpretation of the verse " And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses , for them the ' Iddah ( prescribed period ) , if you have doubt ( about their periods ) , is three months ; and for those who have no courses [ ( i.e. they are still immature ) their ' Iddah ( prescribed period ) is three months likewise " .
He said :
The same applies to the ' idaah for girls who do not menstruate because they are too young , if their husbands divorce them after consummating the marriage with them .
Tafseer al - Tabari , 14/142 ( Source : Islam Q&A ( www.islam-qa.com)
( Question # 12708 :
Is it acceptable to marry a girl who has not yet started her menses ? )
Regarding sex with prepubescent children , Abu - Ala Maududi states : " Therefore , making mention of the waiting - period for girls who have not yet menstruated , clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl at this age but it is permissible for the husband to consummate marriage with her .
Now , obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Quran has held as permissible . "
( Maududi , volume 5 , p. 620 , note 13 , emphasis added )
It is clear : Muslim men can engage in sex with prepubescent children !
_____________________________________________________________________
3 ) EVIDENCE THAT AISHA WAS 9 WHEN SHE CONSUMMATED HER MARRIAGE
Now that weve established that Islam allows husbands to engage in sex with their child - brides , let s move on to Muhammad and Aisha .
The Islamic source materials state that Aisha was 9 when they consummated their marriage .
From the hadith of Bukhari , volume 5 , # 234 " Narrated Aisha :
The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six .
We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj .
Then I got ill and my hair fell down .
Later on my hair grew ( again ) and my mother , Um Ruman , came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends .
She called me , and I went to her , not knowing what she wanted to do to me .
She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house .
I was breathless then , and when my breathing became all right , she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it .
Then she took me into the house .
There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said , " Best wishes and Allah 's blessing and a good luck . "
Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me ( for the marriage ) .
Unexpectedly Allah 's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him , and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age . "
Bukhari vol .
7 , # 65 : " Narrated Aisha that the prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old .
Hisham said : " I have been informed that Aisha remained with the prophet for nine years ( i.e. till his death ) . " "
From the hadith of Muslim , volume 2 , #3309 Aisha reported : Allahs Messenger married me when I was six years old , and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine .
From the hadith of the Sunan of Abu Dawud , volume 2 , # 2116 " Aisha said , " The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old . "
( The narrator Sulaiman said : " Or six years . " ) .
" He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old . "
From " The History of Tabari " , volume 9 , page 131 " Then the men and women got up and left .
The Messenger of God consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old .
Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me " ... ( The Prophet ) married her three years before the Emigration , when she was seven years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old , after he had emigrated to Medina in Shawwal .
She was eighteen years old when he died .
From the Encyclopedia of Islam , under " Aisha " : " Some time after the death of Khadija , Khawla suggested to Muhammad that he should marry either Aisha , the 6 year old daughter of his chief follower , or Sawda Zama , a widow of about 30 , who had gone as a Muslim to Abyssinia and whose husband had died there .
Muhammad is said to have asked her to arrange for him to marry both .
It had already been agreed that Aisha should marry Djubayr Mutim , whose father , though still pagan , was friendly to the Muslims .
By common consent , however , this agreement was set aside , and Muhammad was betrothed to Aisha ...
The marriage was not consummated until some months after the Hidjra , ( in April 623 , 624 ) .
Aisha went to live in an apartment in Muhammad 's house , later the mosque of Median .
She cannot have been more than ten years old at the time and took her toys to her new home . "
SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE OF AISHA'S AGE
The above references are just a sample of the Islamic source material statements that Aisha was 9 when her marriage was consummated .
Over and over again the great Islamic scholars state that Aisha was 9 when her marriage was consummated .
No serious Muslim scholar doubts this .
Generally it is only embarrassed Muslims living in the West who challenge her age .
For a more in - depth presentation of the evidence of Aishas age being 9 , see Sams article here .
_____________________________________________________________________
4 ) EVIDENCE THAT MUHAMMAD HAD SEX WITH AISHA PRIOR TO HER FIRST MENSES
Weve seen that Islamic doctrine allows for prepubescent children to be engaged in intercourse , and that Aisha was 9 when Muhammad had sex with her for the first time .
Now well look at the evidence and see that Aisha was prepubescent when Muhammad had sex with her .
The hadith state that Aisha was taken to Muhammads house , as his bride , when she was 9 and she took her dolls with her as play toys .
Ill borrow some excerpts from Sams article here : ' A'isha reported that Allah 's Apostle married her when she was seven years old , and he was taken to his house AS A BRIDE WHEN SHE WAS NINE , AND HER DOLLS WERE WITH HER ; and when he ( the Holy Prophet ) died she was eighteen years old .
( Sahih Muslim , Book 008 , Number 3311 ) ' A'isha reported that she used to PLAY WITH DOLLS in the presence of Allah 's Messenger and when her playmates came to her they left ( the house ) because they felt shy of Allah 's Messenger whereas Allah 's Messenger sent them to her .
( Sahih Muslim , Book 031 , Number 5981 )
When the Apostle of Allah arrived after the expedition to Tabuk or Khaybar ( the narrator is doubtful ) , the draught raised an end of a curtain which was hung in front of her store - room , revealing some dolls which belonged to her .
He asked :
What is this ?
She replied : My dolls .
Among them he saw a horse with wings made of rags , and asked :
What is this I see among them ?
She replied : A horse .
He asked :
What is this that it has on it ?
She replied : Two wings .
He asked : A horse with two wings ?
She replied : Have you not heard that Solomon had horses with wings ?
She said : Thereupon the Apostle of Allah laughed so heartily that I could see his molar teeth .
( Sunan Abu Dawud , Book 41 , Number 4914 )
A Muslim scholar says that it is okay for Aisha ( and other children ) to play with dolls because they are not considered adults :
Al - Khattaabee said : From this Hadeeth it is understood that playing with dolls ( al - banaat ) is not like the amusement from other images ( suwar ) concerning which the threat ( wa'eed ) of punishment is mentioned .
The only reason why permission in this was given to ' Aa'isha ( may Allah be pleased with her ) is because SHE HAD NOT , AT THAT TIME , REACHED THE AGE OF PUBERTY .
( Source )
Examining the evidence from the previous sections we see Islam allows sex with prepubescent children who are married Aisha was playing with dolls after she consummated her marriage with Muhammad Under Islams rules , female children were allowed to play with dolls because they had not yet entered puberty , i.e. had their first menses and became adults .
Therefore , the only conclusion that can be made is that Muhammad was having sex with a Aisha while still was a child !
The Quran allows this , Muhammad did this , Aisha stated this , and the scholars affirm this .
Now Islams children have to deal with this .
_____________________________________________________________________
5 ) DISCUSSION
Most Muslims accept what the Hadith , Sira , and Muslim scholars say : Muhammad consummated his marriage to Aisha when she was 9 .
But many defend this by asserting that Aisha had had her first period , thus she entered puberty , and thus was considered an adult .
Somehow theyve been misled into believing that Aisha had her first menses before she consummated her marriage with Muhammad .
These same Muslims criticize the act of sexual intercourse with a girl who had not had her first menses .
They would say that a man would be having sex with a child and that that was wrong .
But as shown above if one studies Islams teachings he will see that Islam allows sexual intercourse prior to the childs first menses .
Tragically , today throughout much of the Mideast , girls as young as nine are often married by men old enough to be their grandfather , just as Muhammad was old enough to be Aishas grandfather .
Muslims know in their heart that it is just plain wrong for a man to be using a child for sex , married or not .
That is why so many of them have gone to great lengths to defend Muhammads relationship with Aisha because they assumed that she had her first period prior to their sexual consummation .
One such Muslim is Robert Squires .
He has gone to great lengths to defend Muhammads action , predicated upon the assumption that Aisha had her first menses .
You can read Robert Squires article here .
Here are some quotes from Mr. Squires  article : Puberty = Maturity = Marriage Part of the wisdom behind the Prophet 's marriage to Aishah just after she reached puberty is to firmly establish this as a point of Islamic Law , even though it was already cultural norm in all Semitic societies
There are many other references which should prove to any intelligent person what anthropologists and historians already know : in centuries past , people were considered ready for marriage when they reached puberty .
Unfortunately for Squires , if he studies the Islamic source materials , if he studies the analysis of the great scholars of Islam , he could only conclude that Islam allows sex with prepubescent children and that Muhammad had sex with Aisha prior to her first menses .
Muhammads consummation with Aisha occurred before she reached puberty .
Muhammad fails Squires " cultural " test .
Pity Robert Squires .
He has put his heart , his mind , his strength , his reputation , indeed his very soul , into defending his prophet Muhammad .
He built his defense upon the assumption that Aisha had menstruated .
Now he faces the ugly fact that Muhammad has indeed done the dirty deed , and made a fool out of him .
Muhammad has gone to a depth of depravity that Squires rejects as wrong .
Squires  beloved Muhammad was indeed an ugly man having sex with a child and Squires is stuck having to confront the naked truth .
By Squires  own standards , by Squires  own reasoning , by Squires own sense of right and wrong , Muhammad did very wrong .
And above all , weep for the Muslim children who are allowed by their faith to be used for sex .
Later Ill mention some studies and writings that show that when children are put into the situation that Muhammad and Islam allow they indeed suffer .
Islam brings misery upon its female children .
MUHAMMAD THE GOOD EXAMPLE ?
Muhammad claimed greatness : his god praised Muhammad in the Quran : " Surely in the Messenger of God you have a good example " .
33:21
But when we examine what he did , we repudiate it .
He was not " a good example . "
Let me ask you a question :
If Muhammad were living in the West today and did what he did , wouldnt he be thrown in jail and denounced as a pervert ?
Yes or no ?
I thank God that our standards are better than his and those of Islam when it comes to protecting children .
If Muhammad were a true prophet , why are the worlds standards better than his ?
Why are pagan cultures standards better than Islams ?
Where was the mercy or benefit for the children of Islam ?
Let s take a deeper look .
Why do we find it objectionable ?
Muhammad did not live in our culture or under our law .
Is the Western rejection of this practice merely cultural or is there a scientific or medical reason to reject Muhammads , and Islams norm ?
Indeed there are medical and scientific reasons to reject Islams position .
If Islam were truly a scientific faith it would not have erred this greatly .
This question is discussed at length in Appendix 4 .
As mentioned earlier , some Muslims and Western writers have written that Aisha did not have sex with Muhammad until she was 14 or so .
I 've never seen any textual support for their position .
They only have opinion and conjecture .
Since the thought of their prophet committing such an act is embarrassing to them so they invent , or re-write , or ignore , documented Islamic history to make it more acceptable to their minds and the minds of other Western people as well .
A CASE STUDY
As note above , there are many Muslims who know that it is just plain wrong and harmful for men to have sex with children , as Muhammad had sex with Aisha .
Muslim countries have passed laws outlawing what Muhammad had done .
This week , in Indonesia a similar situation occurred .
A Muslim cleric married a 12 year old girl .
Here is the link : The Jakarta Post , 27 October 2008 .
Fox
News then picked it up :
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,444255,00.html
Ill let the Indonesian Muslims make my argument and quote from the article :
All those involved in the case , he said , could be charged under Articles 81 , 82 and 83 of the 2002 Law on Child Protection .
If found guilty , they would face a maximum sentence of 15 years in jail and a fine of Rp 300 million ( US $ 30,000 ) , for " forcing " , " swindling " and / or " trading " a minor to sleep with another person .
Hadi said it would require a psychological test to prove whether the cleric could be termed a pedophile .
" We hope the police or the court , if the case is brought to trial , can determine this , " he added .
Pujiono reportedly married Lutfiana as his second wife in August and has declared he plans to marry two even younger girls -- a seven - year - old and a nine - year old .
The " eccentric " cleric refused to name the children out of concern it would spark " wider criticism " .
" Puji is a community leader who has many followers .
If he is allowed to continue doing this , we 're afraid that many other people will follow suit .
This will victimize children , " he said , adding that minors are neither physically nor mentally ready to engage in sexual activity .
Those in leadership in Indonesia recognize this for what it is : children being victimized , that they are not ready mentally or physically to be engaging in sex .
It is fortunate that the Muslims in Indonesia are in better touch with reality and science than the Muslim leadership in the Mideast .
The Indonesia Muslims are more caring for their children , the most vulnerable in their society .
Instead of copying Muhammad stupidly they looked after the welfare of their children in this case .
_____________________________________________________________________
6 ) CONCLUSION
Muhammad proposed to and married Aisha when she was 6 .
He had intercourse with her when she was 9 prior to her first menses .
Islam establishes this practice .
Since girls at that age are not fully mature either physically , emotionally , or psychologically , we know it is wrong for a man , regardless of his age , to engage a child in sexual relations .
Muhammad was just a man .
He had both good and bad qualities .
But he was not a prophet .
What he did is nothing more than instituting mans sex drive .
Muhammad was a man and at times let his penis do his thinking for him .
Tragically , what he instituted turned out to be harmful .
No one would expect a real prophet of a righteous God to engage in , justify , allow , and prescribe for his followers such an cancerous act .
Muhammads god instructed him on what to eat , what to wear , even how to wipe himself !
Wouldnt this same god instruct Muhammad about the sexual abuse of children ?
Muhammad proclaimed that his lifestyle was the one to be emulated , and in part , he bears the judgment for this child abuse in the Islamic world today .
Girls at age 9 are not mature enough , either physically , emotionally , or mentally , to be put into those type of " marriage " situations .
Should n't he be found guilty according to his own words and actions ?
Jesus said , " You shall know them by their fruits " , Matthew 7:20 .
We see that one of Muhammad 's fruits was allowing young girls to be subjected to a brutal custom .
Jesus told his followers that false prophets would arise and mislead many to hell .
Muhammad is to be rejected as such a false prophet .

APPENDIX 1 : DEFINITION OF THE WORD TRANSLATED AS " CONSUMMATE "
There has been some confusion about the definition of the word " consummate " .
In Sahih Bukhari , vol. 7 , # 64 , the root word used is " dakhala " .
From the Hans - Wehr Arabic - English Dictionary p273 , it means " to enter , to pierce , to penetrate , to consummate the marriage , cohabit , sleep with a woman " .
I have also asked two native Arabic speakers to confirm the definition of the word used in Bukhari .
They read Bukhari in Arabic for themselves , and did indeed state that it meant Muhammad had sexual intercourse with Aisha when she was 9 .
_____________________________________________________________________
APPENDIX 2 : JEWISH CULTURE AND MARRIAGE
Robert Squires claims that what Muhammad did was no different than what Abraham and the Israelites allowed .
His conclusion was " if it was good enough for Abraham it is good enough for me " .
Well , the fact is , it wasnt good enough for Abraham and the Israelites .
The Baker Ency. of the Bible says about Jewish marriage customs in volume 2 , page 1407 , under " Marriage " : " Subsequently , minimum ages ( for marriage ) of 13 for boys and 12 for girls were set . "
And Jim West ,
ThD , writes online , in " Ancient Israelite Marriage Customs " : " The wife was to be taken from within the larger family circle ( usually at the " outset of puberty " or around the age of 13 ) in order to maintain the purity of the family line " .
Even in the Mishnah , the age of maturity for a female is 12.5 years : " she won her case in court before she matured [ at the age of twelve years and six months ] , lo , they belong to the father . "
Mishnah Ketubot , 4:1 . Jewish culture allowed young girls to be married at an early age but not as young as 9 .

APPENDIX 3 : SCIENCE AND PUBERTY
How do the biological sciences address the topic of female puberty ?
Here are quotes from several college level text books .
There is a great deal of info presented , but it is necessary to provide scientific details to fully understand puberty .
From " Adolescence " , by L. Steinberg , pub . by McGraw Hill , 1993 .
page 22 : " Puberty derives from the Latin word " pubertas " , which means " adult " .
Technically , the term refers to the period during which an individual becomes capable of sexual reproduction , that is , it denotes the series of biological changes leading up to reproductive capability .
More broadly speaking , however , puberty is used as a collective term to refer to all the physical changes that occur in the growing girl or boy as the individual passes from childhood into adulthood . " page 23 : " Puberty may appear to be rather sudden , judging from its external signs , but in fact it is part of a gradual process that begins at conception .
( Petersen and Taylor , 1980 ) .
You may be surprised to learn that no new hormones are produced and no new bodily systems develop at puberty .
Rather , some hormones that have been present since before birth increase , and other decrease . " page 26 : " The effects of the endocrinological changes of puberty on the adolescent 's body are remarkable .
Consider the dramatic changes in physical appearance that occur during the short span of early adolescence .
One enters puberty looking like a child and within FOUR years or so has the physical appearance of a young adult . " page 32 : [ This page shows a chart depicting that puberty lasts about 4 years in girls ] .
" Generally , full reproduction function does not occur until several years after menarche , and regular ovulation follows menarche by about two years ( Hafetz , 1976 ) ....
The onset of puberty can occur as early as 8 years in girls and 9.5 in boys , or as late as 13 in girls and 13.5 in boys .
In girls , the interval between the first sign of puberty and complete physical maturation can be as short as one and one - half years or as long as six years ....
In more concrete terms , it is possible for an early - maturing , fast - maturing youngster to complete pubertal maturation by the age of 10 or 11 - two years before a late - maturing youngster has even begun puberty . " pages 36 - 37 : " ( Although menarche does not signal the onset of puberty .... ) ..... the average age at menarche generally is lower in those countries where individuals are less likely to be malnourished or suffer from chronic disease .
For example , in western Europe and in the United States , the median menarcheal age ranges from about 12.5 years to 13.5 years .
In Africa , however , the median menarcheal age ranges from 14 years to 17 years . " page 66 : [ There is a table depicting the four stages of cognitive development according to Piaget .
It shows that the brain develops mature cognitive ability after age 11 ] .
page 73 : [ On page 73 he presents a table showing that the brain is not fully mature until about the age of 16 .
From this table , I estimate that at age 9 , the maturation of the brain is between 50 to 60 % . ] .
From " ADOLESCENCE - TRANSITION FROM CHILDHOOD TO MATURITY " , by Lambert , Rothschild , Altland , & Green , pub . by Brooks / Cole , 1978 : page 106 : " The process of physical development that results in the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence involves three overlapping stages : Prepuberty , pubescence , and puberty .
Although this sequence is the same for all individuals , the times of onset and the lengths of these periods differ from one person to another ( Thornburg , 1975 ) .
Prepuberty begins at the end of childhood with a rapid rise in hormone levels ...
It is also a period in which a rapid growth spurt begins and the secondary sex characteristics , such as the budding of the breast in girls and the enlargement of the testes and penis in boys , start to develop .
Generally , girls experience theses changes two years before boys ; the average age of onset of this stage is 10 for females , 12 for males ( Tanner , 1975 ) .
Pubescence , the second stage , is characterized by the proliferation of sex cells and near completion of the secondary sex characteristics ( Thornburg , 1975 ) .
Pubescence begins with the menarche , or first menstruation , in girls ....
The appearance of these characteristics , however , does not necessarily indicate that the reproductive system is complete .
It may be a matter of months or even years before the body is capable of reproduction .
It is only with the third phase , puberty , that girls develop regular ovulatory menstrual cycles and the capability for procreation .... This period generally spans about two years for girls and about three years for boys , ending when all of the secondary sex characteristics have fully appeared and reproductive ability has been reached .
Most boys are well into puberty by age 14 ( Marshall , 1975 ) , most girls by the age of 15 - 16 . " page 108 : " ... the gradual decrease in the average age at which menarche has been occurring among Western European girls and apparently among girls of the United States and Canada as well ( Botstein & McArthus , 1976 ) ....
The fact that research has indicated that this trend is just as evident among girls in temperate climates as among girls in warm climates would also tend to destroy the myth that girls mature earlier in warm climates than in more moderate ones . " page 111 : " Abnormal growth and delayed or precocious puberty are usually associated with disorders in hypothalamic hormonal changes ( Schonberg , 1075 ; Sizonenko , 1975 ) . " pages 115 - 117 : " In girls there initially appears a budding of the breasts , then the appearance of pubic hair , then the menarche , and finally ovulation .
...
Breast development and pubic hair first become visible at about 10 - 11 years of age , whereas the menarche occurs , on the average , in the range of 11 - 13 years , or approximately two years after initial breast development .
Menstruation during pubescence is generally irregular , partly due to factors of emotion , tension , and nutrition .
Reproductive maturity is usually attained from one to two years after the first menstruation , with maximum fertility developing in the early 20s ( Lamburg et al. , 1973 ) ....
The average age at menarche is 12.5 to 13 .
However , some normal girls may begin to menstruate as early as 9 , while others may not start until the age of 16 ( Offer & Offer , 1968 ) ....
Genital growth is usually not complete when menstruation begins , and this growth continues slowly for several more years .
The menarche is frequently followed by a period of sterility , which lasts until a regular ovulatory menstrual cycle is established .
The duration of this period varies considerable ; the first ovulation ( the discharge of the first egg from the ovaries ) may occur at menarche , or it may not take place until years later ....
For several months following the menarche , there is usually a lack of regularity in the extent and timing of the menstrual flow . "
WHAT ARE THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TELLING US ABOUT PUBERTY ?
To begin with , puberty does not begin with a girl 's menarche .
It begins about a year or two earlier .
Islam missed the mark on this .
Islam considers that puberty and adulthood begin with the menarche .
Further , science teaches that puberty does not end with menarche .
It takes at least 2 more years for a child to sexually mature .
Islam also missed the mark on this end .
Science shows that usually the female body still has a ways to go from the time a girl has her menarche to the time she is sexually able to reproduce , or is considered to have an adult body .
Science further documents that there are times when a child may have " precocious puberty " and have menarche as early as age 8 .
This is usually due to a dysfunction or disorder within the child .
PUBERTY , MENARCHE , AND REPRODUCTION
There is a misconception that when a young girl has her first menarche , she is capable of getting pregnant .
Many primitive cultures believed that a girl can become pregnant following menarche ; Muhammad 's culture probably believed this as well .
However , science tells us this is very rare .
Instead , the average time for a girl to become pregnant following menarche is one to two years .
Clearly then , girls are not " mature " following their menarche .
There are no biological grounds to marry and engage post - menarcheal girls in sexual activity ; they cannot conceive children yet .
Puberty does not equal maturity , and therefore this misconception should not lead to marriage .
Logically then , menarche is not a sign of a female being able to bear children .
Only at the end of puberty can a girl conceive , not at the beginning , not at the middle .
Puberty usually takes several years to complete .

APPENDIX 4 : ISLAM AND DAMAGE TO YOUNG GIRLS SCIENCE AND OTHER EFFECTS OF EARLY SEXUAL ACTIVITY
Besides the documented assessment of growth and puberty above , other scientific and research groups have specifically addressed the effects of teen pregnancy .
Here are some excerpts from webpages that address this issue .
From the American Academy of Pediatrics (*)
" ... Improvements in prenatal care have resulted in decreases in medical complications among babies born to teenage mothers , but mothers aged 14 years and younger continue to experience unacceptably high rates of adverse outcomes .
The most significant medical risks for infants of teenage mothers are likely related to the parental care those infants receive after the first year of life .
Infants born to younger teenage mothers have a higher rate of mortality by their second birthday than infants of older adolescents and adults . [ 3 ]
The incidence of prenatal mortality and low birth weight increases with subsequent pregnancies in adolescents . [ 4 ]
The morbidity experienced by the infants of young mothers is more subtle to define but has been reported to include increased rates of hospitalization and increased risks of accidents , poisonings , burns , and superficial injuries . [ 5 ] ... ...
In several studies the cognitive levels of infants of younger v older mothers have been compared , and the results indicate lower cognition among the infants of younger mothers ...
FROM THE UNITED WAY - MARCH OF DIMES BIRTH DEFECTS FOUNDATION : TEENFACTS (*)
" Health Risks to the Mother " " A teenage mother is more at risk of pregnancy complications such as premature or prolonged labor , anemia and high blood pressure .
These risks are even greater for teens who are less than 15 years old .
( 3 ) " " Health Risks to the Baby " " A baby born to a teenage mother is more at risk than a baby born to an older mother .
" Nine percent of teenage girls have low - birthweight babies ( under 5.5 lbs. ) , compared to 7 percent of all mothers nationally . ( 1 ) " " Low - birthweight babies may have organs that are not fully developed .
This can lead to lung problems such as respiratory distress syndrome , or bleeding in the brain . "
" Low - birthweight babies are 40 times more likely to die in their first month of life than normal - weight babies . "
FROM THE UNITED NATIONS (*)
NOTE : The webpage I obtained this from was particularly gruesome to read .
Some sections , that did not pertain to this topic , ( like female genital circumcision , a practice found throughout the Islamic world and taught by one of the 4 major schools of Islamic theology ) , I could not finish reading myself .
It was just too gross .
Do not read it if you have a weak stomach , or are disturbed by reports about women being abused .
In this paper , I have tried to edit out gruesome details that were not necessary .
" HARMFUL TRADITIONAL PRACTICES AFFECTION THE HEALTH OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN " " An appraisal of harmful traditional practices and their effects on women and the girl child .
Traditional cultural practices reflect values and beliefs held by members of a community for periods often spanning generations .
Every social grouping in the world has specific traditional cultural practices and beliefs , some of which are beneficial to all members , while others are harmful to a specific group , such as women .
These harmful traditional practices include female genital mutilation ( FGM ) ; forced feeding of women ; early marriage ; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility ; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices ; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child ; female infanticide ; early pregnancy ; and dowry price .
Despite their harmful nature and their violation of international human rights laws , such practices persist because they are not questioned and take on an aura of morality in the eyes of those practicing them .... ( NOTE : most of these are practiced by the Islamic world ) .
...
Child marriage robs a girl of her childhood - time necessary to develop physically , emotionally and psychologically .
In fact , early marriage inflicts great emotional stress as the young woman is removed from her parents ' home to that of her husband and in - laws .
Her husband , who will invariably be many years her senior , will have little in common with a young teenager .
It is with this strange man that she has to develop an intimate emotional and physical relationship .
She is obliged to have intercourse , although physically she might not be fully developed .... ...
Health complications that result from early marriage in the Middle East and North Africa , for example , include the risk of operative delivery , low weight and malnutrition resulting from frequent pregnancies and lactation in the period of life when the young mothers are themselves still growing ....
The work of the Committee has also permitted the identification of certain areas where law reform should be undertaken , in both civil and penal areas , such as the minimum age for marriage and establishment of the age of criminal responsibility as being the attainment of puberty .
Some States have argued that girls attain their physical maturity earlier , but it is the view of the Committee that maturity cannot simply be identified with physical development when social and mental development are lacking and that , on the basis of such criteria , girls are considered adults before the law upon marriage , thus being deprived of the comprehensive protection ensured by the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
The International Conference on Population and Development , held at Cairo in September 1994 ( see p. 36 below ) , encouraged Governments to raise the minimum age for marriage .
In her preliminary report to the Commission on Human Rights , the Special Rapporteur on violence against women , its causes and consequences , Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy , also recognized that the age of marriage was a factor contributing to the violation of women 's rights ...
Early pregnancy can have harmful consequences for both young mothers and their babies .
According to UNICEF , no girl should become pregnant before the age of 18 because she is not yet physically ready to bear children .
Babies of mothers younger than 18 tend to be born premature and have low body weight ; such babies are more likely to die in the first year of life .
The risk to the young mother 's own health is also greater .
Poor health is common among indigent pregnant and lactating women .
...
An additional health risk to young mothers is obstructed labor , which occurs when the baby 's head is too big for the orifice of the mother .
This provokes vesicovaginal fistulas , especially when an untrained traditional birth attendant forces the baby 's head out unduly ....
Generally throughout the developing world , the average food intake of pregnant and lactating mothers is far below that of the average male .
Cultural practices , including nutritional taboos , ensure that pregnant women are deprived of essential nutriments , and as a result they tend to suffer from iron and protein deficiencies .... "
So not only does science teach us that young girls are not mature just because they have had first menarche , but science teaches us that teen , or worse yet , pre-teenage girls should not be bearing children .
Their bodies are not ready for it .
These type of pregnancies are frequently harmful both to the mother and the child .
However , Islam does not take into account the child 's or mother 's health .
Consequently , this type of abuse occurs throughout the Islamic world .
If anyone wants to see just how bad child abuse is in the Islamic world , read the above webpage posted by the United Nations .
Most of the barbaric cultural practices listed there are generally practiced in the Islamic world .
MORE PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO YOUNG GIRLS Modern medicine teaches that a female 's body is not fully developed at age 9 .
Sexual intercourse at that age could damage a female 's sexual organs .
For instance , at the age of 9 years old , the cervix of the female is yet undeveloped , as are many of the child 's sexual organs .
Further , intercourse at this age leads to an 80 % increased risk in her developing cervical cancer later in life .
PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE TO YOUNG GIRLS
There have been several studies done on females who were married at a very young age , and then taken into sexual intercourse .
Following is a citation from two of them .
" Sexual contact between children and adults : A life course perspective . "
Browning , Christopher R ; Laumann , Edward O
Citation : American Sociological Review , v62n4 , pp.540-560 , Aug 1997
Number : 03374356 Features : Table ; Illustration ; References
Copyright : American Sociological Association 1997
" Research interest in the long - term effects of sexual contact between female children and adults has increased dramatically in the last two decades .
Two sets of issues have driven this enhanced attention .
The first concerns the nature and extent of the impact these experiences have on subsequent well - being in adulthood .
Empirical research has offered evidence of the severe and wide ranging effects of adult - child sex by documenting its associations with a host of later " symptoms , " such as low self - esteem , depression , anxiety , and sexual dysfunction . "
" In each reduced model ( Model 1 ) , we see that adult - child sexual contact is significantly associated with the outcome considered .
Women who experienced adult - child sexual contact were 1.6 times as likely to report sexual desire dysfunction , 2.1 times as likely to report sexual response dysfunction , 2.4 times as likely to report high dysfunction , 1.6 times as likely to report low overall well being , 1.7 times as likely to report low relationship satisfaction , and had more sexual activities that they found appealing compared with those who had no coupled sexual experiences as children .
For every outcome except high dysfunction and number of sex acts found appealing , the introduction of the sexual trajectory variables ( Models 2 and 3 ) renders the adult - child sexual contact coefficient insignificant , indicating that the effects of adult - child sex on adult outcomes are largely indirect , mediated through sexual trajectories . "
Another such study was done by Peter O. Ebigbo .
In the German periodical for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychoanalysis his work was published .
The abstract reads : " Presents data on disturbed female clients whose marriages were arranged at age 9 - 13 years .
When husbands had paid the dowry and fulfilled marriage customs , they were entitled to have sexual intercourse with their wives .
Early sexual experience , mostly against the will of the underage girls , precipitated positive or negative reactions .
In positive reaction cases , an imprinting fixation on the man took place .
If the man died or rejected the young women , a disorientation took place , resulting mostly in an inability to have sexual relationships with other men .
If the reaction was negative , the women did all she could to prevent sexual relationships with her husband through a variety of symptoms such as frequent pregnancies and secret love affairs . "

APPENDIX 5 : AISHAS ACTIONS
A quick review of Aisha 's life , during and following Muhammad 's death , shows that she exhibited some psychological problems :
1 ) She was extremely jealous of some of Muhammad 's other wives .
From Bukhari , 5.164 : Narrated ' Aisha :
I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija ( although ) she died before he married me , for I often heard him mentioning her , and Allah had told him to give her the good tidings that she would have a palace of Qasab ( i.e. pipes of precious stones and pearls in Paradise ) , and whenever he slaughtered a sheep , he would send her women - friends a good share of it .
2 ) She conspired with other wives and lied to and deceived Muhammad .
From Bukhari 7.192 : Narrated ' Ubaid bin ' Umar :
I heard ' Aisha saying , " The Prophet used to stay for a long while with Zanab bint Jahsh and drink honey at her house .
So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet came to anyone of us , she should say him , " I detect the smell of Maghafir ( a nasty smelling gum ) in you .
Have you eaten Maghafir ? ' "
So the Prophet visited one of them and she said to him similarly .
The Prophet said , " Never mind , I have taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh , but I shall never drink of it anymore . "
So there was revealed : ' O Prophet !
Why do you ban ( for you ) that which Allah has made lawful for you ...
If you two ( wives of Prophet ) turn in repentance to Allah , ' ( 66.1 - 4 ) addressing Aisha and Hafsa .
' When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives . ' ( 66.3 ) namely his saying : But I have taken some honey . "
3 ) She was a ringleader in the first Muslim civil war ... the first time Muslims took arms up against other Muslims .
According to the Hadith , Muslims went to hell for fighting in support of her .
In the " Battle of the Camel " , thousands of Muslims were killed fighting against each other .
Aisha 's side lost and she was basically put under house arrest by Ali .
From Bukhari 9.204 : Narrated Al - Hasan :
( Al - Ahnaf said : ) I went out carrying my arms during the nights of the affliction ( i.e. the war between ' Ali and ' Aisha ) and Abu Bakra met me and asked , " Where are you going ? "
I replied , " I intend to help the cousin of Allah 's Apostle ( i.e. , ' Ali ) . "
Abu Bakra said , " Allah 's Apostle said , ' If two Muslims take out their swords to fight each other , then both of them will be from amongst the people of the Hell - Fire . '
It was said to the Prophet , ' It is all right for the killer but what about the killed one ? '
He replied , ' The killed one had the intention to kill his opponent . ' "
5.116 : Narrated Abu Wail :
When ' Ali sent ' Ammar and Al - Hasan to ( the people of ) Kufa to urge them to fight , ' Ammar addressed them saying , " I know that she ( i.e. ' Aisha ) is the wife of the Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter ( world to come ) , but Allah has put you to test , whether you will follow Him ( i.e. Allah ) or her . "
So not only did Aisha help cause the death of thousands of Muslim men , she is pictured as acting against the very will of Allah .
One can only feel sorry for Aisha .
Robbed of her childhood , becoming a bride to a man who had a large sexual appetite for many women , Aisha felt she had to at times lie to and deceive Muhammad to keep his attention .
She is forbidden to marry after Muhammad death .
Later she helps lead the first Muslim civil war , causing the death of thousands of Muslims , who according to Islam , would go to hell for fighting each other .
Finally defeated , she is not executed but ordered to live the rest of her days , essentially under house arrest , in Medina .

APPENDIX 6 : ABUSIVE PRACTICES IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD TODAY Sandra Mackey , in " Saudis , Inside the Desert Kingdom " writes on page 161 : " Girls are considered marriageable from the time they reach puberty .
The lower class marries very young .
The ages for marriage and first pregnancy on Tarut Island , off the east coast , were published in a rare study on women that I unearthed from a library .
In the group as a whole , the mean age for marriage was fourteen , with the first pregnancy occurring at sixteen .
Out of 193 girls , 3 married as young as ten .
Among the Bedouins and the rural poor , a girl can be the second of two wives , married to a man older than her father , the mother of several children , and suffering from severe depression by the age of eighteen . "
Jean Sasson writes in " Princess " page 74 : In Saudi Arabia , the appearance of the first menses means that it is time to select the first veil and abaaya .
page 75 : A child enters the store , but a woman emerges , veiled , and on that day , of marriageable age .
Her life changes in that split second .
There are other books I could quote from , but the above is enough to illustrate the point : the legal abuse of children exists in the Islamic world today .
Many of them are coerced , either by their fathers , family , or their family s financial situation , to accept marriage with a man old enough to be their grandfather .
Other girls probably do n't even understand what they are getting into when they are approached to marry a man .
Female children are valued greatly for their virginity , exploited by lustful old men , who purchase the girl with a dowry , and use them for sexual gratification .
They are left to live as second class people in a culture based upon Muhammad 's life .
This is the Islam that Muslims in the West do n't want to tell you about .
WAS AISHA MATURE ENOUGH TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF ?
ARE YOUNG GIRLS OLD ENOUGH TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES ?
It is obvious from reading Aisha 's accounts in the Hadith and Tabari 's history that she raised no objection in marrying Muhammad .
She wasnt mature enough to understand Muhammads marriage proposal .
She wasnt mature enough to know what Muhammad was up to when she was sent into the room and he had her sit on his lap .
It all happened so quickly that she did n't know what was going on .
This is not surprising .
As stated , the brain 's ability to be maturely cognitive occurs well after age 9 .
At age 9 , Aisha was barely able to comprehend the world around her .
She knew that Muhammad was someone special , she knew that her father loved him .
Because Aisha raised no objection does not make it right .
She was too young to truly think and decide for herself .
And what about all the other little girls in the Islamic world who are not " fortunate " enough to marry a celebrity like Muhammad ?
Do they really have a choice ?
Are their voices heard ?
According to what is documented , many are not .
Many little girls become severely depressed following Muhammad 's " Sunnah " in the Islamic world .

APPENDIX 7 : MUHAMMAD'S REASONS FOR MARRYING AISHA
Another claim Muslims make to justify Muhammad 's marriage to Aisha is that Muhammad was cementing his bond with Aisha 's father , Abu Bakr .
But , we read in Tabari that that was not the reason Muhammad married her .
Here is the quote from Tabari , volume 9 , page 129 .
" The Reason Why the Messenger of God Asked for the Hands of Both Aisha and Sawdah in Marriage ... ...
When Khadijah died , Khawlah , wife of Uthman , who was in Mecca , said ( to the Messenger of God ) , " O Messenger of God , will you not marry ? "
He replied , " Whom " ? " " A maiden [ virgin ] " , she said , if you like , or a non-maiden . "
He replied , " Who is the maiden ? "
" The daughter of the dearest creature of God to you , " she answered , " Aisha bint Abi Bakr . " ...
She went to Abu Bakr 's house , where she found Umm Ruman , mother of Aisha and said , " O Umm Ruman , what a good thing and a blessing has God brought to you ! "
She said , " What is that ? "
Khawlah replied , " The Messenger of God has sent me to ask for Aisha 's hand in marriage on his behalf . "
The story goes on to describe how Abu Bakr then gave his daughter in marriage when she was 6 .
Note here there is nothing at all about " cementing ties " , between Abu Bakr and Muhammad .
Instead , all we see is a match making friend hooking Muhammad up with Aisha .
Anyone familiar with Abu Bakr knows that his relationship to Muhammad needed no cementing .
He put his life on the line for Muhammad many times and followed him through thick and thin .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The death toll for private contractors in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has topped 1,000 , a stark reminder of the risks run by civilians working with the military in roles previously held by soldiers .

The death toll for private contractors in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has topped 1,000 , a stark reminder of the risks run by civilians working with the military in roles previously held by soldiers .
REUTERS / Ceerwan Aziz
A further 13,000 contractors have been wounded in the two separate wars led by the United States against enemies who share fundamentalist Islamic beliefs and the hit - and - run tactics that drain conventional armies .
The casualty toll is based on figures the U.S. Department of Labor provided to Reuters in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act and on locally gathered data .
The department said it had recorded 990 deaths - 917 in Iraq and 73 in Afghanistan - by the end of March .
Since then , according to incident logs tallied by Reuters in Baghdad and Kabul , at least 16 contractors have died in Iraq and two in Afghanistan .
Those killed in Iraq between March 31 and today included four contractors from the Philippines killed in a rocket strike on Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone compound , a frequent target of attacks .
The Labor Department ’s statistics put the number of wounded in Iraq between March 1 , 2003 and March 31 , 2007 as 10,569 .
The corresponding figure for Afghanistan , from September 2001 to March 2007 , is 2,428 .
Deaths and injuries among the growing ranks of civilians working in war zones are tracked on the basis of claims under an insurance policy , the Defense Base Act , which all U.S. contracting companies and subcontractors must take out for the civilians they employ outside the United States .
In Iraq , their number is estimated to be close to 130,000 -- not much less than the 157,000 U.S. troops presently deployed to the country .
Their work ranges from driving fuel trucks , cooking meals and cleaning toilets to servicing advanced weapons systems and guarding senior U.S. officials .
The contractor death toll compares with 3,577 U.S. military deaths in Iraq and 342 in Afghanistan , according to the U.S. Department of Defense .
That means that on average , since the two conflicts began in 2001 and 2003 respectively , one civilian contractor is killed for every four members of the U.S. Armed Forces .
STILL MORE APPLICANTS THAN JOBS
Despite the risks , there is no shortage of those wanting to work in the war zones , lured by high pay and , in some cases , a sense of adventure .
“ There are more applicants than there are jobs , ” said Doug Brooks , president of the International Peace Operations Association , a trade group for more than 30 private security companies .
“ That ’s been the case from the beginning and it is still true , even though pay has gone down because there is a lot of competition . ”
Neither the Pentagon nor any other U.S. government agency keeps a precise tally on the number of private security companies active in war zones - a fact that is drawing increasing complaints from Congressional critics who say there is not enough oversight and little accountability .
By some estimates , the number of private security companies in Iraq and Afghanistan has swollen to almost 300 , both U.S. and foreign corporations .
One of the richest contracts awarded since the U.S. invaded Iraq went to Aegis , a British firm involved in intelligence - gathering .
Contrary to common perceptions , the majority of civilian contractors in the war zones are not Americans - and foreigners have done most of the dying as the U.S. accelerated outsourcing functions previously performed by soldiers .
The Labor Department declined to give details of the nationalities of the contractors it listed as killed or wounded , saying that doing so would “ constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy ” under the U.S. Privacy Act .
But at a Congressional hearing in May , Joseph McDermott , the Assistant Inspector General for Iraq , quoted Labor Department statistics as saying that of 900 - plus contractors killed by the end of April , 224 were U.S. citizens .
Officials say the majority of contractors are Iraqis and people from developing countries as far apart as Chile and Nepal , Colombia and India , Fiji and El Salvador .
Filipinos make up one of the largest single groups .
Losing Your Freedom … a Little at a Time
How much are you willing to allow the government to interfere in your life ?
To what extent are you willing to give up personal freedoms ?
We have already been told what kind of shower heads we may have , and what kind of toilets we shall have in our bathrooms .
Soon , we will have to change from incandescent lightbulbs to the fluorescent kind .

When do you get out the pitchfork and march on city hall or your congressman ’s office ?
Today , the Japanese government institutes its compulsory “ flab checks ” for all workers over the age of 40 .
To stem Japan ’s “ soaring obesity , ” the health ministry has mandated that all waistlines among its 56 million workers over age 40 be below ‘ regulation size ’ of 33.5 inches ( for men ) .
Any company failing to bring its employees ’ weight under control — as well as the weights of their family members — will be fined up to 10 % of its earnings by the government .
According to government officials as reported by the Independent , 27 million Japanese — that ’s about half of all adult workers ! — have health indices ( cholesterol , blood pressure , blood sugar and BMI ) that do n’t meet ideal numbers .
They will be targeted for mandatory medical intervention .
That means compulsory medication , because , as we know , health indices have been set so low that most adults with normal aging will fall on the wrong side .
You can imagine the array of weight loss gimmicks and health and fitness machines now being marketed .
And “ special undergarments ” for Japanese businessmen ( girdles ) are now popular .
[ Read the whole thing . ]
This is happening in a country with almost no fat people .
We live in a country where both of the candidates for the Democratic Party nomination want to install government - controlled health care .
If you find the idea of government - paid health care appealing ( and please remember that the only money the government has , it gets from you ) then , having given them control of the purse - strings , you have given them control of your health and your body .
It might be wise to keep the Japanese in mind .
Certainly a part of this is the current “ fad ” of deep concern about obesity , in the media .
When the buzz reaches a certain level , bureaucracies feel they must “ do something ” .
And that , too , is a problem .
MAZAR-I-SHARIF , Afghanistan ( Reuters ) - Afghan authorities have discovered a mass grave containing at least 100 bodies believed to be victims of a Taliban massacre in the 1990s , security officials said on Saturday .
The grave was discovered in the northern province of Balkh , about 15 km ( 10 miles ) from the city of Mazar - i- Sharif .
Provincial security official Abdurrauf
Taj said about 100 bodies had been found in the grave , which is about 100 meters ( yards ) from a residential area .
“ We expect the number may rise , ” Taj told Reuters .
Residents of the area said they suspected the dead were members of the Hazara ethnic minority , massacred after the Taliban captured the area in the late 1990s .
“ These were all innocent people killed by the Taliban , ” said shopkeeper Mohammad Sami .
Provincial security commander Sardar Mohammad Sultani said the dead may have been massacred by the Taliban and investigators hoped to determine the truth .
None of the bodies were being moved until a team from Kabul inspected the site , Sultani said .
Mass graves from Afghanistan ’s three decades of war are occasionally unearthed in different parts of the country .

Remember the story back in June about how AT&T had extremely quietly started offering $ 10 DSL as was required in its deal to buy BellSouth ?
The company was promoting many other , more expensive , DSL options , but the only way you could get the required $ 10 version was if you specifically knew to ask about it .
Broadband Reports points to an interview from an Atlanta newspaper with AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson where he 's asked about the $ 10 DSL .
The interviewer points out that no story about AT&T resulted in a more irate response from AT&T customers as its story about the hidden offer for $ 10 DSL , suggesting that this was a huge issue for AT&T customers .
Stephenson 's response ?
First he denies that the company made it hard to find , and then he says that they 're not promoting it because customers do n't want it .
This , despite the clear response from customers to the very newspaper who was conducting the interview .
Then , he basically admits that the $ 10 DSL does n't work very well , saying that they do n't promote it because they do n't want to give customers a product that sucks .
Of course , he says that as if it's not his company that has quite a bit of control over whether or not the product sucks .
Yes , that 's right .
AT&T actually thinks you 'll believe that they 're hiding their cheap broadband offering because , seriously , who wants cheap broadband when more expensive broadband is available ?
Of course , this is n't a new strategy from AT&T .
Back when it was SBC and refused to offer naked DSL , the claim was that customers did n't want naked DSL either , despite the success many other companies were having with it , and numerous articles with people clamoring for it .
It appears that AT&T has figured out that when there 's really no competition , you get to decide what it is your customers really do or do not want .

Stephen Lynch only wanted to dig foundations for a garden shed
Stephen Lynch said he was mistakenly following plans given to him which outlined the foundations for a house .
But the work has made other houses in Duke Barn Field , Stoke Heath , Coventry , unsafe , engineers have concluded .
A housing association which owns next door houses has got a court order forcing Mr Lynch to fill in the hole .
The order obtained by Whitefriars Housing Group means Mr Lynch faces £ 50,000 in court and repair costs .
Mr Lynch spent £ 20,000 on an excavator to dig the hole
" ( The officials ) have been foolish in saying I have got to do footings for a house when all I wanted was a shed , " he said .
" When I 've gone a metre down , I might as well go two metres and have two basements .
" I obviously did n't want it to come to this , but it 's kept me busy , kept my mind busy . "
He said he had spent £ 20,000 hiring a small excavator to dig out a large area to the side and rear of his home .
But after complaints from neighbours the housing association took legal action .
Footpath at risk
Assistant director of Whitefriars Housing Group Richard Osborne said they had gone to court as a last resort after repeated requests to Mr Lynch to stop digging were ignored .
" A specialist structural engineer identified the foundations of our neighbouring properties were at risk along with a significant potential for the collapse of the footpath .
" This forced us to take legal action , " he said .
Work to fill in the hole is expected to start on Wednesday .

The Protestant Reformers Were Frauds
An Anabaptist speaks out .
" http://community.webtv.net/cyberministry/Articles
Also see Martin Luther , the Deranged Theologian
Martin Luther was not a great reformer like the history books teach , but he was a fraud !
Here are some quotes from Luther which shows that he taught the heresy of Once Saved Always Saved :
" Be a sinner and sin boldly , but believe and rejoice in Christ even more boldly for he is victorious over sin , death , and the world .
As long as we are here in this world we have to sin .
This life is not a dwelling place of righteousness "
" No sin will separate us from the lamb , even though we commit fornication and murder a thousand times a day . "
" Whenever the devil harasses you , seek the company of men or drink more , or joke and talk nonsense , or do some other merry thing .
Sometimes we must drink more , sport , recreate ourselves , and even sin a little to spite the devil , so that we leave him no place for troubling our consciences with trifles .
We are conquered if we try too conscientiously not to sin at all .
So when the devil says to you : do not drink , answer him : I will drink , and right freely , just because you tell me not to . "
" The imputation of righteousness we need very much , because we are far from perfect .
As long as we have this body , sin will dwell in our flesh .
Then , too , we sometimes drive away the holy spirit ; we fall into sin , like Peter , David , and other holy men .
Nevertheless we may always take recourse to this fact , that our sins are covered , and that God will not lay them to our charge .
Sin is not held against us for Christ 's sake . "
" your sin can not cast you into hell "
" No sin can harm me "
LUTHER WAS AN ANTI - SEMITE
Here are some quite shocking quotes from Luther which show that he was a rabid anti-Semite :
" The Jews deserve to be hanged on gallows , seven times higher than ordinary thieves "
" We ought to take revenge on the Jews and kill them . "
" The blind Jews are truly stupid fools "
" Now just behold these miserable , blind , and senseless people . "
" eject them forever from this country "
" they are nothing but thieves and robbers "
" What then shall we do with this damned , rejected race of Jews ? "
" Such a desperate , thoroughly evil , poisonous , and devilish lot are these Jews "
" They are the real liars and bloodhounds "
" We are at fault for not slaying them . "
" I shall give you my sincere advice : first to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn , so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them . "
" Second , I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed . "
" Fifth , I advise that safe - conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews . "
" Burn down their synagogues , forbid all that I enumerated earlier , force them to work , and deal harshly with them "
" If this does not help we must drive them out like mad dogs "
" If I had to baptize a Jew , I would take him to the river Elbe , hang a stone around his neck and push him over with the words ` I baptize thee in the name of Abraham ' . "
Martin Luther was not a Christian man , but , instead , he was a brutal man who persecuted the Jews unmercifully .
The word of God calls Martin Luther a liar :
1John 4:20 - If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
LUTHER CONDONED THE DEATHS OF A 100,000 PEASANTS
The peasants of Germany revolted in 1525 because of their miserable living conditions and were slaughtered at the behest of Martin Luther !
Here is a quote from Luther that will send chills up your spine :
" They should be knocked to pieces , strangled and stabbed , secretly and openly , by everybody who can do it , just as one must kill a mad dog ! "
Are these the words of a Christian and a great reformer ?
I think not !
Luther was an evil man who urged the slaughter of the poor who had revolted .
He told people to knock the peasants to pieces and strangle and stab them .
100,000 German peasants were horribly slaughtered in the revolt !
JOHN CALVIN WAS A MURDERER
Not only was the founder of Calvinism , John Calvin , a great deceiver , but he was also a murderer !
Here are John Calvin 's own words about Michael Servetus :
" If he ( Servetus ) comes ( to Geneva ) , I shall never let him go out alive if my authority has weight . "
" I hope that the verdict will call for the death penalty . "
In Geneva , on October 27 , 1553 , Michael Servetus was tied to a stake and was burned slowly to death :
www.encyclopedia.com/articlesnew/11716.html
Here is what John Calvin had to say about Michael Servetus after he was burned to death :
" Many people have accused me of such ferocious cruelty that ( they allege ) I would like to kill again the man I have destroyed .
Not only am I indifferent to their comments , but I rejoice in the fact that they spit in my face . "
" Whoever shall now contend that it is unjust to put heretics and blasphemers to death will knowingly and willingly incur their very guilt . "
John Calvin was not a Christian , my friends , but he was an egotistical tyrant and a cold - blooded killer !
How anyone can follow the warped teachings of this deranged monster from the past is beyond belief .
A man named Sebastian Castellio wrote against what Calvin did to Servetus and he made this tremendous statement :
" To kill a man is not to defend a doctrine .
It is to kill a man ! "
Castellio paid a great price for standing up to Calvin the tyrant .
He was hounded and persecuted by John Calvin until his death .
Murderers like John Calvin and Martin Luther are not Christians :
1 John 3:15 - ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
For more on Calvin see Calvinism and The Servetus Murder
In five years , 1542 - 46 , Geneva , with 16,000 inhabitants , had fifty - seven executions and seventy - six banishments .
All these sentences were sanctioned by John Calvin .
Let 's take a look at the two so - called great reformers of the protestant reformation :
1. Martin Luther was a false teacher , a racist , a persecutor and a murderer !
2. John Calvin was a false teacher , a deranged tyrant , a persecutor and a murderer !
The Protestant Reformation was a farce !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Women who get cosmetic breast implants are nearly three times as likely to commit suicide as other women , U.S. researchers reported on Wednesday .
The study , published in the Annals of Plastic Surgery , reinforces several others that have shown women who have breast enlargements have higher suicide risks .
Loren Lipworth of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee and colleagues followed up on 3,527 Swedish women who had cosmetic breast implant surgery between 1965 and 1993 .
They looked at death certificates to analyze causes of death among women with breast implants .
Only 24 of the women had committed suicide after an average of 19 years , but this worked out to triple the risk compared to the average population , they reported .
Doctors who perform cosmetic breast surgery may want to monitor patients closely or screen them for suicide risk , Lipworth said .
“ The increased risk of suicide was not apparent until 10 years after implantation , ” the researchers wrote .
Lipworth said she believes that some women who get implants may have psychiatric problems to start with , perhaps linked with lower self - esteem or body image disorders .
“ I think we do n’t even know how big of a problem it is because we cannot even pinpoint what proportion of women have psychiatric disorders , ” Lipworth said in a telephone interview .
“ There could be a whole lot of different disorders . ”
Women with breast implants also had a tripled risk of death from alcohol and drug use .
“ Thus , at least 38 deaths ( 22 percent of all deaths ) in this implant cohort were associated with suicide , psychological disorders and / or drug and alcohol abuse / dependence , ” the researchers wrote .
NO RISE IN CANCER DEATH RISK
They found no increase in the risk of death from cancer , including breast cancer .
Women with implants were more likely to die from lung cancer and respiratory diseases , such as emphysema , but this is probably because they were more likely to smoke , the researchers said .
Last year , Canadian scientists also found a higher risk of suicide among women who got breast implants , although they had lower rates of other diseases , including cancer .
In November , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration okayed the sale of silicone breast implants for the first time in 14 years , after years of hearings on their safety .
The FDA said independent research over the past decade has found no convincing evidence that breast implants were associated with connective tissue diseases or cancer .
While silicone implants were banned , women could only use saline - filled breast implants .
Plastic surgeons say women prefer the silicone ones , and Lipworth said most of the women in her study had silicone implants .
In 2006 , 383,886 U.S. women had breast augmentation , according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery .
It was the second - most common surgical cosmetic procedure , after liposuction .
B y next week , my husband and I will finish making payments on the Toronto house we bought in August 1986 .
Yes , we 're breaking free from a 25 - year mortgage with a little more than three years to spare .
If we were buying that house today , we 'd probably spread the payments over 30 to 40 years , as do most buyers .
And we'd be paying off that mortgage long after we retired – or working into our late sixties to retire the mortgage .
The advent of extended amortizations has extended Canada 's real estate boom , as noted in last Wednesday 's column .
But the popular 40 - year loans hold dangers for homeowners that are n't always stated .
• You have less chance of being debt - free in retirement or retiring early .
" I think of a 40 - year mortgage as long - term renting , " says Adrian Mastracci , a Vancouver investment counsellor .
" It 's a recipe for not going into retirement and extending your time in the workforce . "
• You wo n't build equity in your home for many years .
Building equity takes a long time , even with a conventional 25 - year loan .
Suppose you have a $ 200,000 mortgage amortized over 25 years , with a five - year term at 7.19 per cent ( the current posted rate at big banks ) .
Your payments are $ 1,424.37 a month , or $ 17,092.44 a year .
Only by year 16 do you reach the point where more than half your payments go to principal , not interest .
Now let 's take that $ 200,000 mortgage and amortize it over 40 years , with a five - year term at 7.19 per cent .
Your payments go down to $ 1,255.17 a month , or $ 15,062.04 a year .
But only by year 31 – gasp – will you be paying more principal than interest .
( I used the mortgage analyzer calculator at the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals 's website , www.caamp.org.)
You may owe more than what the house is worth if there 's an economic decline .
Suppose you put little or no money down when you buy a house .
You have to buy mortgage default insurance , which adds 2.7 per cent to 3.1 per cent to the loan amount .

Spreading the payments over 40 years will boost the cost of mortgage insurance .
John Cocomile , who runs a mortgage brokerage firm in Toronto , GreedyMortgage.com , shows what can happen in his worst - case scenario .
You buy a house for $ 450,000 .
You make no down payment and go for 100 per cent financing with a 40 - year amortization .
You have to pay 3.7 per cent of the loan value to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp . ( or $ 16,650 ) .
So , now you owe $ 466,650 – more than the home 's market value – before you even move in .
And with a 40 - year amortization , it could take a decade or more to repay the CMHC premium , let alone make a dent in the mortgage .
In Cocomile 's view , many buyers could owe more than the value of their properties if there 's a period of slow growth or recession .
They would have no equity to borrow against , and nothing to fall back on , if they lost their jobs and could n't pay their mortgages .
So , keep these dangers in mind when starting out in real estate or upgrading to a more expensive property .
If you opt for a longer payback period , start accelerating your payments as soon as you can .
Retiring debt provides a risk - free after - tax return approaching 10 per cent , one of the best you can get in today 's volatile markets .

The Minnesota Financial Crimes Task Force has decided to stop taking mortgage fraud cases in a move that may or may not dent the state ’s efforts to combat a widespread problem , depending on whom you talk to .
Either way , the decision speaks to the tough time law enforcement is having tackling a new breed of financial crime , one that has played a significant role in the nation ’s foreclosure crisis and does n’t fit neatly into traditional police beats .
In fact , the U.S. Attorney ’s office in Minneapolis is holding a special meeting today to discuss just how federal and state laws can be used together to better tackle mortgage fraud .
“ If the task force ca n’t do it , then we need to reinvigorate this other task force to start coordinating cases , ” said John McCullough , executive director of the Retailers Protection Association , which includes lenders .
McCullough also is a member of the council that oversees the Minnesota Financial Crimes Task Force .
The “ other task force ” McCullough referred to is a group of federal investigators in the Twin Cities including the FBI that have been working on mortgage fraud with prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney ’s Office .
As for the Minnesota Financial Crimes Task Force , its 17 - member oversight council in January instructed the group to shut the door on mortgage fraud , saying the cases were so time - consuming they threatened to overwhelm the group .
Chris Omodt , a Hennepin County Sheriff ’s lieutenant who heads the task force , said he thinks crimes will go unchecked , but acknowledges it does n’t have the resources .
Mike Siitari , Edina police chief and oversight council chairman , said the group needed to return to its original mission : identity theft and financial crimes such as credit card fraud and check fraud .
As for mortgage fraud , “ We do n’t have the staff or funding to address it , ” Siitari said .
“ We have hundreds of cases of backlog . ”
The financial crimes task force charged 301 people in 2,203 cases last year , according to its report to the Legislature this month .
Only a handful of its cases focused on mortgage fraud , a problem the task force began looking into last year .
Yet Siitari calls mortgage fraud a “ massive problem ” that is being dumped on law enforcement .
Everyone is looking at each other thinking , “ Where does this go ? ” Siitari said .
“ There is no good answer right now .
Who has the resources ? ”
Anoka County Attorney Bob Johnson , former chair of the oversight council , said mortgage fraud presents a major challenge for local law enforcement already close to capacity handling normal street crime .
“ This type of crime really taxes a decentralized criminal justice system and points out , frankly , its weaknesses , ” Johnson said .
The financial crimes task force , which currently has nine investigators and operates on a $ 750,000 annual budget through the state Department of Public Safety , could see that amount reduced to $ 300,000 for fiscal 2009 under Gov. Tim Pawlenty ’s proposed budget .
Three of the task force ’s most experienced investigators — Sgt. Chris Abbas , Detective Jack Talbot and Sgt. Mark Johnston — left the task force in the past month .
Talbot and Johnston said Abbas was ordered to leave and reassigned to the Minneapolis Police Department ’s fraud and forgery unit .
Abbas could n’t be reached for comment .
The mortgage fraud decision was “ a part ” of their decision to leave , Talbot and Johnston said .
They said they also were very frustrated by budget problems and how politicized the task force had become .
Both were near retirement .
“ We ’re the Minnesota Financial Crimes Task Force and we ’re not going to do mortgage fraud ?
Who is going to do them ?
It ’s preposterous , ” said Johnston .
Pawlenty ’s office said it ’s simply paring the task force budget back to prior levels .
The task force “ was never envisioned to deal with mortgage fraud , ” Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said .
He said the state already employs a team of investigators at the Commerce Department devoted to real estate crimes .
Nonetheless , it ’s the wrong time to be cutting back on mortgage fraud efforts , said Sen .
Satveer Chaudhary , DFL - Fridley , a member of the oversight council .
Chaudhary said he does n’t support the decision .
“ In a worsening economy , financial crimes are only going to go up .
If anything , we need to double our efforts , not diminish them , ” Chaudhary said .
Pat Diamond , deputy county attorney in Hennepin County , said the task force ’s decision will make it harder to thoroughly investigate cases in a way that gets them to trial .
He said the task force was instrumental in three cases in which his office has filed multiple charges .
The task force never handled mortgage fraud cases in Ramsey County .

According to a survey conducted by Gametart , a game rental service in the UK , chicks who game get more lovin ' than those who do n't .
Out of a sample of 200 ladies ( or should that be " laid - ees " ? ) , the ones who gamed got , erm , fragged 1.1 more times a week than those who did n't .
So what I 'm saying is you might want to give your honey a DS for Valentine 's Day .
Mmm hmm .
Read on for the rest of the oh - so - scientific study .
Gamers Have Sex More Often !
It ’s official – women who play video games have sex more often !
Gametart , the UK ’s largest online games rental company , carried out the survey throughout January to see how the recent influx of the likes of Pink
PSPs and DS Lites would affect gamers ’ sex lives across the country .
The results were surprising .
Of our sample of 200 women , those who played video games on average had sex 4.3 times a week while those who did n’t play games only had sex just 3.2 times a week .
Perhaps even more promising for gamers is the fact that many of the women that we interviewed who have only recently started playing games said that they now have sex more often than before .
Gamers have never had it so good !
Sony Still Fixing Canadian PS3 Pricing
You know , I could have sworn Sony fixed the problem of over - charging Canadian PS3 owners last October , but hey , maybe they did n’t .
Or did a half - arsed job .
Or the US dollar got even weaker against the Canadian dollar .
Maybe all of the above !
Point is , Sony ’s Peter Dille has jumped into the comments section of his blog post yesterday on the PS3 , assuring Canadian consumers :
Regarding Canadian pricing , we have been looking into this and will be adjusting it .
We understand the concerns and are looking to correct the discrepancy .
As a PAL consumer whose prices are only ever being adjusted upwards , I can only offer a jealousy - coated fuck you to our more fortunate Commonwealth brothers .

Anthony Guarisco : A severe Alzheimer ’s patient whose memories are quickly drifting away ... A WWII and Korea Navy Combat Veteran who founded and directed the International Alliance of Atomic Veterans ( IAAV with AAV here in the US ) .
Mary C Guarisco : 1934 – 2007
AAV Cofounder , Executive Secretary , Board Member , loving mother and OZ protector for us kids .
' The secret of a good life is to have the right loyalties and hold them in the right scale of values . '
~ Norman Thomas 1884 – 1968
Over the years , I have written many essays on a whole variety of subjects , all of which I felt were important .
But none came remotely close to hitting home as this one has .
Undeniably , the following pages are the hardest I will ever attempt to write in my lifetime .
This piece has been on my computer for almost a year now -- and I cannot begin to tell everyone how many times I have rewritten it time and again .
Point blank , enough can never be said about those we dearly love and respect .
For me ,
It would require a very thick book to truly give my parents the honorable tribute they so wholeheartedly deserve .
And , who knows , perhaps some day I will .
Having said that , I will start this off with a few things both of them would appreciate -- just a few little thoughtful things that meant so much to them and us in the family .
Does anyone remember the following quote ?
' I 'll get you my pretty !
And ... your little dog too !'~ The Wicked Witch of the East Threatening ' Dorothy ' in ' The Wizard of Oz . '
Yes , of course we do ... I think just about everyone on the planet has seen this film classic .
Well , just like everything these days -- movies , plays , music , etc. -- everything has a different meaning to each of us , as individuals .
Once in a while , a Hollywood film is not only entertaining , but it captures our domestic moral quest in surreal human form .
For me , ' The Wizard of Oz ' is just that , a phenomenal measure of good over evil , a valuable imperative for us to acquire the needed essentials to build character for overcoming life ’s many challenges .
This movie , and its message - point , will undoubtedly continue giving long after I ’m gone ... and rightfully so .
I will never forget , as a young boy , the first time I watched this old family classic with mom and dad .
I was trembling with fear when the wicked witch glaringly threatened Dorothy ( quoted above ) .
Mom , with a loving smile , got down on her knees and kissed away a tear that was streaming down my cheek .
Then , dad tenderly placed his hand on my shoulder as mom placed hers over my heart and whispered in my ear : ' Son , do n’t be afraid , we will always be here with you ... you are never alone , our hearts beat as one .
There are many scary things to face in life , but your father and I will show you how to see past this to find the beauty and glory just beyond . '
Feeling much better , I gazed up at both of them ( with a big smile ) knowing I had found that beauty .
In the Wizard of OZ , Dorothy had to click her ruby slippers to find her way home .
Not me .
All I ever have to do is simply place my hand over my heart to know ' I ’m already there . '
Yes , we truly are fortunate to have had them as parents .
I say this because we entered the scary land of perpetual
Oz better prepared because we had wise and loving parents as our sentimental guide , blessing us with several hearts beating as one .
In truth , it turned out to be the one gift that will last a lifetime .
Underneath it all -- I guess I always was a softy -- I was after all , mom ’s small bundle of joy born on her birthday back in 1959 .
My parents truly are to me what is best remembered in life .
As a high - strung kid always on the go , they constantly reminded me to slow down , take a good look around and enjoy the small , thoughtful things that mean so little to most .
Both took the philosophical view that happiness could not be demanded from life .
They taught us that such things as inner peace and harmony and ' being loved ' compiled the essential passport .
But as the years rolled by , I observed something else too .
For them -- true happiness also meant giving themselves completely for a worthy purpose or cause to help others .
In doing so , I now understand they both achieved a higher sphere of ' excellence ' worthy of noting as they won the hearts and minds of those who had the pleasure of interacting with them .
Their mission in life was to ease the suffering of those they could .
They were the voice for those in society who seemingly had no voice at all .
And their bio speaks for itself ... it ’s monumental !
But before we get to that , I want to share a few more aspects of how they molded us kids into the people we later became ..
The message we heard was loud and clear :
If common sense is an idea worth having once -- is it not worth having twice ?
Indeed , thanks to them , we learned to accept responsibility for our own decisions in life , the well from which self respect springs .
With a tender hand , our parents taught us to always walk the path upright knowing that with each persistent storm blowing our compass in disarray usually brings a colorful rainbow trailing not far behind -- if we are patient and our vision is not limited , narrow or oblique .
Mother loved to say , ' Happiness is our own delightful reflection caressing us in our dreams , but before we can truly find it , we must first awaken and see it within . '
Words to live by ... and father firmly admired a quote by Voltaire – ' Those who can make you believe absurdities , can make you commit atrocities . '
A hard fact learned by him when the military industrial complex used him as a guinea pig after he served his country so valiantly .
A defining moment that produced a lifetime of activism ...
In addition , my parents taught us to never worry about seeing the end of the journey , but to simply enjoy the trip while traveling .
And we all laughed together when Truman Capote said , ' Life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act . '
Whew , both of them were so down to earth !
They kept it real in every way imaginable .
They loved having fun , loved reading , laughing , loved music including rock groups , such as Pink Floyd , especially their ' The Dark Side of the Moon ' and ' The Wall ' albums .
They dug the heck out of it !
Both of them were totally ' hip ' to say the least .
But most important , they truly enjoyed the company of family and friends and always cherished the time we spent together .
In looking back on all the decades of wear that can sometimes grind with unsettling madness , through it all , we somehow found our own personal calling .
And just as all life experiences play out in this torrid time of maniacal misgivings , our family adventure was no munchkin paradise simply filled with holographic picnic pleasantries .
Yes , we definitely had our fair share of yellow brick road madness riddled with many trials and tribulations along the way .
Indeed , our great OZ forest was always laden with many masters of the universe who have consistently had one cold , callous hand on the nation ’s pulse with the other on the trigger ready to destroy the world at a moment 's notice .
Sadly , this has always been and probably will remain the environment in which our children and grandchildren must live .
But we were luckier than most .
My parents understood empty minds are easily manipulated , so they taught us history and pushed education , which they believed was the foundation for creating a better , peaceful society and nation .
They did their best to prepare us for the many obstacles that life can sometimes put in front of us .
They held nothing back from us and told us everything good or bad that we may have to face in life .
They told us true stories of how our leaders often betrayed us and how they sometimes serve their own selfish goals .
They shared the truth , no matter what road that took us on .
More important , they taught us never to be fooled or manipulated into doing anything that we knew in our heart was against the high principles of our beliefs .
And , they taught us to redirect our energy and knowledge into positive ways in order to create meaningful lives , not only for ourselves , but for those around us .
But the years roll by so fast , and no one lives forever .
They say the most difficult task we ’ll ever face in life is losing our loved ones .
This is so true .
I will never forget just before my mother passed away , she gave one final piece of advise .
As instructed , I put my head next to hers and she whispered , ' Son , always cherish the happy , little moments in life , because later on , they make a much better cushion in old age . '
The next day ... she passed away in her sleep .
The following day was equally dreadful .
I was given the hard task of informing my father of the devastating news that mom had died .
Although , father does not remember much of anything these days , we both cried together in our terrible moment of sadness .
Before I left the healthcare facility , I glanced back at him and gave him a great big smile ... wanting him to only remember this expression on my face .
And for the first and ' only ' time in my life , I was relieved he was infected with Alzheimer ’s disease that had erased his memories .
Because I did not want him to mourn .
For mom was as precious to him as life itself .
I will always believe that sparing him the grief of losing her was a gift from above .
Someone once told me that God has a special love for those kindred souls taken in their sleep .
I choose to believe this is true .
And so it is , the sweet violin is now laid to rest having strung its final note .
The candle has now dimmed for one great pioneer of love and truth .
Mary C. Guarisco , born in 1934 in the heartland of Nebraska , passed away in May , 2007 .
Mary lived in the West Arizona Desert by the banks of the Colorado River for most of her last 40 years of life .
She now rests peacefully with her parents in the oldest section of Rose Hills Cemetery located on a beautiful green hilltop in Southern California .
Her headstone has the following inscription : ' Mother is Love in the Eyes of God . '
May she find peace and harmony with continued joy while dancing among the stars in God ’s paradise .
And may my father ’s lost memories find their way through the gates of heaven reaching the one person he most dearly loved .
As I sit here blinded by tears , I must confess -- the real lesson here is not to make you feel sad or mourn , but to ' inspire . '
Both Mary and Anthony Guarisco unselfishly devoted most of their lives to many facets of social activism , always striving to better our society for a kinder , more caring and peaceful prosperity .
In part , this essay is a small tribute to honor their legacy , their lifetime achievements and hard work .
But it is also a heartfelt plea for you to see the higher mission in life by not just taking , but giving back that which we all at times take for granted .
This is the essence of what they stood for .
Anthony Guarisco enlisted in the Navy in 1944 , serving one year of WWII in the Pacific and the early days of the Korean War .
It changed his life forever .
In 1947 , Anthony was attached to the 32nd Destroyer Division and conducted Special Forces combat operations from Fusan , Korea , to the Manchurian border , aboard the USS Buckley , DD808 .
But before his Korean experience , the full impact of nuclear weapons became part of his big picture at Bikini Atoll in 1946 in " Operation Crossroads . "
For those of you not familiar with this hideous event , Operation Crossroads was a series of two 23 - kiloton plutonium atomic bomb tests in which the US government used 42,000 of its own uniformed citizens as guinea pigs .
Each bomb was twice the size of the one that destroyed Hiroshima .
My father was six to seven miles away from the B - 29 airdrop of ' Able , ' which exploded at 520 feet above a target array of 80 vessels .
Troops entered the lagoon immediately after .
Damage assessment took several weeks , then ' Baker ' was detonated under water , producing a radioactive mushroom cloud 6,000 feet high .
My father had been two to four miles away from ground zero on LST388 .
Within a few days , post - Baker , he experienced what is now recognized as a radiation sickness .
He remained in the lagoon 67 days within a mile of the epicenter of both explosions .
Upon his return to Pearl Harbor , my father was ordered aboard the hospital ship USS Haven for examination , evaluation and treatment for skin rashes , and severe symptoms similar to influenza .
It ’s worthy to note , LST388 was too ' hot ' with radiation to enter port so , after transferring the men , a decision was made to sink the ship outside of Hawaii .
In 1948 , he entered Hines VA Hospital in Maywood , IL , with the same symptoms plus a swelling resembling elephantiasis from the knees down .
Interestingly , my father found himself in a room with three other Crossroads vets at Hines with similar radiation symptoms : bone deterioration leading to a leg amputation , complete hair loss , fever and welts .
After treatment , therapy and release , his spine began to progressively fuse from Ankylosing Spondylitis and persisting urological disorders .
In 1979 , my father helped formulate the National Association of Atomic Veterans ( NAAV ) as an organization .
Later , he became national research director .
Among my parents studies was the Stanford Warren Papers on Operation Crossroads that contained one of the big smoking guns of the nuclear weapons industry .
Working with then Illinois congressman Paul Simon , they participated in the original writing of PL9772 : legislation that allowed atomic veterans to enter any VA hospital for treatment .
Anthony and Mary Guarisco established outreach to atomic veterans in Canada , Britain , and Australia and they founded the International Alliance of Atomic Veterans ( IAAV with AAV ) in the United States .
Working with Greenpeace in 1984 , they organized a cross-country tour for veterans , widows and children to many major cities , which culminated with joining other radiation victims worldwide .
The action drew national attention to the Nevada Test Site and the beginning of major opposition to all atomic testing .
In 1986 , IAAV made contact with the Soviet War Veterans Committee in Moscow and my father returned several times , afterwards .
Mary accompanied Anthony , who testified numerous times in the US Congress and the parliaments of Canada and Great Britain .
In fact , Calif .
Sen .
Alan Cranston , then chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee , recognized that AAV was ' extremely instrumental ' in the groundbreaking 1988 legislation that granted presumption of cause - effect to all atomic veterans .
Anthony spoke out at anti-nuclear demonstrations in the US , Netherlands , Canada , Japan , Germany , UK , and former USSR .
Both Anthony and Mary organized with other radiation victims from Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Four Corners Uranium Mines , Southwest Desert Downwinders , Three Mile Island , Chernobyl and Commonwealth Edison of Illinois .
Much of their work was with other veterans ' organizations , such as Veterans for Peace , Veterans Peace Action Teams , and Vietnam Veterans Against the War .
They collaborated with Agent Orange fighters like Maude De Victor , a courageous famed whistleblower .
In 1986 , IAAV organized the 40th anniversary reunion of Crossroads veterans in Chicago .
In that same year , my parents worked with the Great Peace March .
In 1987 , they attended the first Global Conference of Radiation Victims in New York City .
Anthony has been a member of the Radiation Victims Roundtable in Washington , D.C. since 1983 and they both coordinated with the National Committee of Radiation Victims .
With such groups as Citizens Against Nuclear Power and Weapons and People Against Radioactive Dumping , Anthony ( with Mary ’s assistance ) has spoken out against nuclear power and weapons , and nuclear waste dumping from Zion , Illinois to Ward Valley , California .
They are both known as an anti-nuke activists throughout the Southwest .
Moreover , in 1984 they staked a claim for a placer gold mine dead center on the site of U.S. Ecology ’s ( USE ) planned nuclear burial ground , in Ward Valley -- an action that was instrumental in stopping USE dead in its tracks .
Media work included interviews on Donahue , Good Morning America , Latenight Detroit and Studs Terkel , author of ' The Good War . '
They helped producer Robert Stone with historical material on Operation Crossroads for ' Radio Bikini , ' which was nominated for the 1988 Oscar for best documentary .
Anthony was inspiration for photojournalist Jim Lerager and is featured in Lerager ’s ' In the Shadow of the Cloud . '
My parents ' activism has been quoted in newspapers in Japan , Korea , Latin America , USSR , and elsewhere .
New Zealand ’s equivalent of ' 60 Minutes ' produced a segment about the alliance and the New Zealand occupation forces of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
AAV developed the atomic Veterans History Project that entailed a video production demonstrating the involvement of atomic veterans -- in their own words .
Just last year ( 2007 ) , well - known author and media critic Norman Solomon paid tribute to my father in his newly published book , ' Made Love , Got War . '
In addition , Solomon is a past spokesperson for IAAV / AAV , and on more than one occasion has said my father gave him great inspiration .
He also offered kind words to me for my mother ’s loss and acknowledged how hard she worked and that she was always kind to him and everyone with whom she came in contact .
But as I said before , time catches up with everyone .
And as their health progressively got worse Anthony and Mary Guarisco both retired from activism in 2001 , closing IAAV / AAV .
In 1935 , Will Rogers said : ' We ca n’t all be heroes because somebody has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by . '
I speak for my whole family when I say we hope that all those clapping on the sidelines will read this essay and become inspired enough to actively participate in doing everything they can to improve our nation and society .
I like what Bob Dylan said , ' I think a hero is someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom . '
I could n’t have said it better myself .
Sadly , all things must end , and that ’s the ultimate price for living .
Undeniably , I say again , this is the hardest essay I will ever attempt to write in my lifetime .
I once read : Death is more universal than life ; everyone dies but not everyone lives .
How true .
Fortunately , nothing fell short in that department for my parents .
They both lived life to its up - most fullest -- always sharing their love with everyone around them , always eager to laugh , to have fun and always thoughtful and kind in putting the needs of others before their own .
In every element of living , both Anthony and Mary compassionately gave life ' one heck of ride !'
I will not even try to hide the fact that a box of empty tissues is sitting right next to me by my keyboard .
And would add , it ’s a good thing its made of mostly plastic ... or it would have surely rusted by now .
The following is pure emotion for me , but I feel compelled to share my final thoughts with you --
My parents were my best friends , my dream makers , and their combined love kept our family ' binder ' as tightly woven as one magical book .
For that alone I will always be grateful .
Each time I gaze upon the polished , black granite marker that contains a tile picture of my mother , it takes my breath away .
I am momentarily frozen as I lose myself in the stillness of it .
And for a while , time virtually stands still for me as I embrace the memories we shared together .
As I see my own reflection blend with hers , I slowly close my eyes and feel a real sense of spiritual togetherness in this quiet holy resting place .
A feeling that is also extended in the same way as I sit with my father holding his hand , even though he does not remember I am his son .
But I know he ’s my father and that is enough .
Yes , I weep with a real sense of loss for both of them .
But it uplifts my spirit to know deep within my soul that I am never alone , never lonely , because in my heart ( beating with them ) is the essence of who they are .
And that will always flow inside of me .
A kind of ' conscience gathering ' held dear for what is best remembered in life .
A former lover of the missing wife of Linux programmer and accused spouse killer Hans Reiser has confessed to killing eight people unrelated to the case , prosecutors informed the defense last week .
Sean Sturgeon , a one - time friend of Reiser 's , had already been a focus of the defense team 's efforts to shift suspicion off Reiser in the disappearance of his estranged wife , Nina Reiser .
Sturgeon 's alleged confession to a series of unrelated murders will likely complicate the trial , which is set to begin Monday .
" ( Deputy District Attorney ) Paul Hora indicated that the court was ordering him to divulge this information , " defense attorney Richard Tamor said last Friday .
" He also said that Sturgeon had confessed to a potential ninth murder , but that Sturgeon was n't sure if the victim was fully dead when he left him . "
" Sturgeon claims that the murders were in retaliation for his abuse as a child , " said Ramon Reiser , Hans Reiser 's father , who was briefed by the defense team over the weekend and spoke to Wired News on Sunday .
On Monday , Superior Court Judge Don Clay issued a gag order barring attorneys on both sides from discussing Sturgeon .
Prosecutor Hora declined to comment on the confession Thursday , or on any law enforcement investigation of Sturgeon , citing the gag order .
" In fact , I can't even comment on the gag order because the order is sealed , " Hora said .
Reached by phone Wednesday night , Sturgeon did not deny that he had made the confession .
Sturgeon 's answers in the 40 - minute interview were frequently evasive , and he declined to answer specific questions about the alleged killings .
" I have offered to be judged for my crimes , " he said at one point .
" I take responsibility for what I have done . "
Nonetheless , he vigorously denied killing Nina Reiser .
" I 've never been a threat to Nina Reiser , " Sturgeon said .
" I will take a lie - detector test .
I will take whatever passes for truth serum these days . "
He also indicated that the evidence pointed to Hans Reiser 's guilt .
" I will not take credit for what another has done , " he said .
" Let Hans take a lie - detector test about Nina . "
It 's unclear when Sturgeon made the confession – he would say only , " I have cooperated since day one . "
Asked why he had confessed at all , he responded with this question : " In a murder case , if somebody has killed , who is a witness , is it relevant ?
Yes or no ? "
When this reporter responded that it was relevant , Sturgeon said , " Then you have the answer to your question . "
Sturgeon added that confessing was one of the most difficult decisions of his life .
He also regrets being a source of distraction in the case , joking that he is not so much a red herring as a " red Sturgeon . "
Nina Reiser was last seen Sept. 3 at the home Hans Reiser shared with his mother in the Montclair area of Oakland , California .
Her van turned up five days later , abandoned on a quiet residential street two miles from Reiser 's home .
Though no body has been found , Reiser was arrested Oct. 10 after the Oakland Police Department found small drops of blood in his house and in his Honda CRX .
DNA testing tied the blood to Nina Reiser .
According to testimony in preliminary hearings in the case , Nina Reiser had once dated Sturgeon , but broke off their relationship in January 2006 because she was unhappy with his lifestyle and taste for sadomasochism .

Number 8
Today ’s piece is written by Damon Lindelof , Co-Creator and Executive Producer of “ Lost . ”
I was listening to the news on NPR the other day and two things occurred to me .
First , only assholes feel the constant need to tell you they listen to NPR ( does anyone ever say , “ So I was watching the CW last night … ” ? ) and I guess that makes me an asshole .
The second was that in the midst of listening to the story in question , I had finally figured out how to succinctly sum up why I write .
It goes a little something like this —
There ’s this ninety - year old woman named Rose who , after honking her horn repeatedly at the school bus idling in front of her , decides she has much more important things to do and guns her Honda Civic around the bus .
Before she realizes that the bus was stopped for a very good reason indeed , Rose finds herself watching a freight train bear down on her and almost instantly , it smashes into the passenger side of the Civic and pushes it a good hundred feet before screeching to a stop .
Forgoing all the gory details , Rose is pronounced dead at the local hospital and the attending doctor in the ER is tasked with notifying next of kin .
Turns out Rose ’s husband has been dead for decades , but she has a couple sons and a daughter .
The doctor calls one of her sons and his wife answers the phone .
The son is n’t home , but the wife offers to take a message .
The notification ethics , however , forbid the hospital from telling anyone but next of kin about Rose ’s death and so they ask when the son will be home so they can call back .
And the wife responds “ He wo n’t be back for two months . ”
And the hospital says , “ Well … do you have a number where we could reach him ? ”
And the wife says no , she does n’t .
And why not ? –
Because he ’s in space .
As in outer space .
As in orbit .
As in one of a handful of human beings who have the unique distinction of not being on the fucking planet .
The son , Richard , is working on the International Space Station doing repair work .
And as he floats in Zero - G , he is blissfully unaware that his ninety - year old mother has just been flattened by a train .
I shit you not .
This really happened .
And what does this family ’s personal tragedy have to do with why I write ?
Because to me , this is an amazing story .
And as soon as I hear it , my brain is already hammering out the scene where Rose ’s other kids debate as to whether or not to even tell Richard .
The daughter , Christine , insists on telling him that mom died peacefully in her sleep and holding the grisly truth for when he ’s back on Earth .
Richard ’s brother Michael , however , demands they tell Richard all the gory details .
Why ?
Because it was Richard ’s fault she was still driving at ninety .
Michael ’s been trying to get her into assisted living for over five years now and if stupid fucking Richard had just fucking listened to him , she ’d still be fucking alive !
Fortunately , I think , the decision is not up to Richard ’s siblings .
He is , after all , a member of the military , so this would be a NASA issue .
And it turns out in their guidelines there ’s this thing called the Dual Plume Protocol .
The Dual Plume Protocol , or DPP , was officially incorporated into NASA ’s Psychological Charter this year .
Let me back up —
In September of 2001 , the space station was manned by three people — an American and Two Russians .
As they were orbiting over the Northeastern United States , the American called Mission Control to report that he could see ( with his naked eye ) two massive pillars of black smoke rising up through the atmosphere .
When they answered back , explaining that the black smoke was all that remained of the Towers , the American took a long , sorrowful pause and responded – “ I wish you had n’t told me that . ”
As a result of the DPP , NASA started actually asking the astronauts who are leaving the planet what their personal wishes are regarding notifications of earthbound tragedies .
And this is like , a very detailed document because it covers everything from worldwide catastrophes ( i.e. Katrina or a Tsunami ) down to things that would only affect the astronaut him or herself ( i.e. their mother ’s Honda getting pulverized by a freight train ) and it must be signed and notarized before launch .
Why ?
Because the emotional state and focus of these guys is critical .
They ’re being sent up to perform missions on a space station and after spending millions to train them ( Richard is one of three people alive who has the skill set to execute these specific repairs ) it costs BILLIONS just to get them up there to perform them and the last thing NASA needs is for someone to go batshit with grief on the day they ’re supposed to fix the thruster converter thigamajob .
So I ’m sitting there thinking how Richard may have filled out his DPP Form …
And I realize there ’s no such thing .
I made it up .
Yeah , I remember hearing about the astronauts on the space station having seen the carnage over Manhattan from orbit , but that ’s got nothing to do with the story of Rose ’s death .
In fact , I do n’t know how many kids she had or , for that matter , whether or not they can just send an email to Richard ( can you get email in space ? ) and dispense with all the formality .
But where ’s the drama in that ?
So that ’s why I write .
I write because I ca n’t help but make things up .
I write because I love to tell stories .
I write because my imagination compels me to do so .
I write because if I did n’t , I ’d be branded a pathological liar .
Oh , and also because I ’m still trying to make my dead father proud of me .
But that ’s none of your goddamn business .

There ’s been a fierce and now apparently fading argument over the last week over whether Hillary Clinton should drop out of the nomination race or , more pointedly , whether she ’s under some sort of obligation to do so .
Not just in this race but in general I ’ve always taken a dim view of people trying to muscle candidates to drop out of campaigns , usually on the basis of long odds or when it comes from insider pundit types pushing the idea that there ’s something undignified about keeping a campaign going after it looks like you probably wo n’t win — something I ’ve never understood and do n’t agree with .
So when people have asked me whether I think Hillary should drop out I ’ve said I do n’t think she ’s under any obligation to do so but that I do think , with her odds now this long , she should not be running a campaign that seems to go out of its way not simply to compete but to damage the likely nominee as a general election candidate and attempt to discredit the nomination process itself .
But when I was writing out my take on her interview over the weekend with Post , I realized that I had n’t made clear enough in what I ’d written , or even really in my own head , how much the two things are really combined .
As I said in that post , I do n’t think Hillary ’s claim that she ’s going to stay in the race through the convention in Denver is really about Denver , or staying through August or even till June .
It ’s about keeping her troops motivated and confident so that she can keep in the game through April and May .
And here I think we see the pattern .
Hillary does n’t want to run for president in 2nd or 3rd gear .
It ’s beneath her dignity .
And I do n’t mean that sarcastically .
It really is .
She ’s a powerful United States senator , former First Lady , etc .
She wants to win .
And if she ’s still in it she wants to run full bore with the money you need to run a serious campaign , the crowds , poll numbers , etc .
She ’s not some Huckabee figure who ’s going to hang around with little chance of winning
It really is all or nothing .
You ’ve got to convince your supporters , donors and to at least some degree the media that you ’re really in it , and in it with a shot .
Otherwise you face the classic problem of a cascade failure .
Poor fundraising generates bad press stories , which depress turnout at rallies , which create more bad press stories and eventually no press stories , etc .
It ’s no different from the precarious position any campaign faces when the odds are n’t looking good .
And so we have this vicious cycle in which the longer Hillary ’s odds become the further she has to up the ante to keep her candidacy credible — in other words , the more forcefully she has to question the legitimacy of the nomination process and the more aggressively she has to push the idea that Obama ca n’t win the general election or is not qualified to be president .
( For example , the argument that the Clinton campaign now appears to be making to funders and the press is that Obama literally cannot win the general .
And thus she ’s not only entitled but actually obligated to do whatever it takes to ensure that he ’s not the nominee . )
Without making real progress on one of those fronts , the premise of the candidacy just becomes too difficult to sustain .
And when that fails just throw up lots of nonsense about the popular vote in primary states or blue states or significant states , or whatever .
I think there are a lot of people who would actually like to see the race play out as long as neither candidate is going out of their way to make their opponent unviable in the general .
But thinking over what I ’ve said above , I ’m just not sure how realistic that is .
There are a number of things Wikipedia discourages its users from doing when editing or adding to the site .
Actions that incur a good bit of wrist - slapping include , for example , the construction or amendment of autobiographies .
The reason of course for this is that subjectivity ( as opposed to objectivity ) can be tricky thing , and for that it is a soft line that users are told not to cross .
Another no - no is spreading falsities and generally causing a ruckus in one or more pages on the encyclopedia through some digital hooliganism .
That kind of stuff annoys the heck of out administrators and editors alike , so any naughtiness may well bring the people with power to lock any page (s ) temporarily and bar the bad blodd from perpetrating any further disturbances .
We ’d now like to add another guideline to the list :
Post no romantic break - ups to the Wikipedia .
Especially if your name is Jimmy Wales and happen to be the site ’s founder and chief evangelist .
‘ Cause , as you know , the site is an information reference .
It ’s pretty much Britannica version Web 2.0 .
Not place for personal gossip .
As some of you may now , A so - called tryst ( we use this term loosely ) between Wikipedia ’s Jimmy Wales and conservative commentator Rachel Marsden leaked to the Web not too long ago , according to Valleywag ’s Owen Thomas .
It was an alleged match made very evident that you may have in turn found quite unappealing .
But that ’s neither here nor there .
What ’s more pertinent is Wales ’s recent “ slippage ” where his adamance for that good ol ’ by - the - book behavior he ’s requested of all Wikipedians , including himself .
This weekend ’s news of Wales ’s public disavowal of any existing or past relationship with Ms Marsden is quite unbecoming of the man , would n’t you say ?
He knows better than any other that Wikipedia has no rightful home for such chatter .
Any severance with Marsden would probably have been better left noted in Jimmy ’s Facebook profile .
Which is apparently where all the kids these days are hooking up and cutting ties with one another .
We understand Jimbo ’s all about open , but come on now .
Some decorum , sir .
Please .

· Digital method could be used on two - year - olds · Asperger 's syndrome may be target for technique
Tens of thousands of children with rare genetic disorders could be diagnosed earlier and more cheaply following pioneering research that uses computers to analyse images of people 's faces .
The technique will help doctors make a swift diagnosis by identifying the most likely genetic disorder a child has purely by examining their features .
Until now , doctors have had to run a series of expensive and time - consuming genetic tests before being sure of their diagnosis .
The British research , published today , is also expected to allow doctors to screen children as young as two years old for autism disorders , such as Asperger 's , boosting their chances of receiving appropriate care and treatment as early as possible .
The breakthrough exploits the fact that of 5,000 documented genetic disorders , around 700 cause slight but specific changes in facial development .
One of the most dramatic examples is Down 's syndrome , but many other conditions lead to more subtle differences in facial appearance that can only be spotted by experienced specialists .
One condition , called fragile X syndrome , is the most common inherited cause of mental impairment and is triggered by a mutation in a single gene on the X chromosome .
Of the one in 4,000 newborns it affects , many develop mental impairment , autistic behaviour , anxiety problems and seizures , but they also have a subtly different appearance , growing slightly longer , narrow faces and more prominent ears .
Peter Hammond , at the Institute of Child Health in London , used 3D digital photography to build a library of healthy children 's faces and merged them to produce an " average " healthy face .
He then travelled to hospitals around the world to take 3D images of children with various genetic disorders and from them created typical faces for each condition .
Each image contains 25,000 points that capture the most subtle contours of the face .
Dr Hammond 's team has now used the images to diagnose disorders in children .
Doctors simply need to take 3D images of the child 's face and use the computer to see which condition their facial features most closely resemble .
The researchers are working on 30 different genetic conditions which alter the shape of the face .
Among them is Williams syndrome , a mental impairment that affects one in 15,000 , and is characterised by a short , upturned nose and small jaw .
Children with the condition often find their behaviour is altered too , making them unusually friendly towards strangers .
Another condition , Smith Magenis syndrome , gives one in 25,000 children flat - looking noses and raised top lips .
They are prone to self - harming and release the sleep hormone melatonin during the day , making them sleep in the daytime and rise at night .
Many of these children develop curved spines and heart and kidney problems which can be picked up more quickly if the child is diagnosed at a young age .
In tests , Dr Hammond 's computer system accurately diagnosed 92 % of fragile X syndrome cases , 98 % of Williams syndrome cases and 91 % of patients with Smith Magenis .
Details of the research are to be presented today at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in York .
" Some specialists will be able to make a diagnosis as soon as a patient comes through the door , but some of these conditions are very rare , and it can take a lot of experience to recognise them .
Some doctors will only have read about cases in journal papers , " Dr Hammond said .
" Doctors can use this to focus in on the likely disorder before beginning genetic tests , which can cost £ 500 to £ 1,000 each , so the children and the parents should get a cheaper , quicker diagnosis . "
Dr Hammond 's team has created software that can morph from a healthy face to a face with any one of the 10 different genetic disorders they have so far studied .
In January , the system will be used for the first time to teach doctors in Cambridge how to identify the disorders .
The technique is unlikely to be available across the country soon , because the 3D digital cameras needed typically cost £ 20,000 .
Of the 15 or so British hospitals that have the equipment already , most are in maxillofacial centres , where they are used to assess facial surgery operations .

The coming death of Indian outsourcing
Sramana Mitra , Forbes.com | March 03 , 2008
I ndia is riding high on outsourcing .
Information technology and IT - enabled services will employ 4 million people in 2008 and account for 7 % of gross domestic product and 33 % of India 's foreign - exchange inflows , according to Nasscom , an Indian IT industry organization .
The death of this industry is far from anyone 's mind .
However , the reality is that wages are rising in India .
The cost advantage for offshoring to India used to be at least 1:6 .
Today , it is at best 1:3 .
Attrition is scary .
Jobs that are low value - added and easily automatable should and will disappear over the next decade .
People talk a lot about India moving up the value chain .
Some of that has indeed happened .
An industry that started gaining momentum when Indian software developers were tapped to help fix the ' Y2K ' problems in old software code has blossomed beautifully into one that offers a much more comprehensive spectrum of services .
Yet , India , for all its glory , is still the world 's back office .
India 's tech industry is a " services " industry .
The Indians do n't do the thinking .
The customers do .
India executes .
As a result , India has not learned to invent technology products of its own .
Barring a few exceptions , the huge amount of venture capital chasing India finds it difficult to be deployed .
There is way too much money , way too few deals .
Instead , tech - sector VCs are now diverting capital to retail , real estate , hotels and other non-tech sectors .
India 's $ 30 billion IT / ITES services industry , meanwhile , is slowly and surely losing its competitive advantage .
Most of the 4 million people that the industry employs have now " arrived . "
They have breezed through the milestones that their fathers had to toil all their lives to reach .
A phone .
A watch .
A TV .
A car .
A house .
They are complacent .
They will not take risks .
They have " outsourced " thinking to their customers .
As the 1:3 cost structure becomes 1:1.5 , it will soon become inefficient to use Indian labor .
Why not Oklahoma or British Columbia ?
For many Europeans , Eastern Europe has already become more compelling than India .
The pure labor arbitrage equation will no longer balance .
ADP , the largest U.S. payroll services provider , has 45,000 employees worldwide , of which only 2,500 are in India .
It has around 1,000 workers in El Paso , Texas , it 's expanding a location in Augusta , Ga. , and it 's opening a facility in Jackson , Miss .
It 's also growing a location in Halifax , Canada .
ADP is n't moving its workforce to India - - it 's hedging its bets geographically .
On a recent earnings call , ADP 's chief executive used terms such as " smartshoring , " and " nearshoring " to describe the strategy .
The software as a service ( SaaS ) megatrend in technology also plays against India .
Here 's an example :
There 's a tiny Silicon Valley start - up called InsideView .
It helps customers to generate sales leads , qualify those leads and use technology tools to help find big sales opportunities for customers .
In November 2007 , InsideView acquired a company called TrueAdvantage , which did the exact same thing manually with a team of 150 people in India .
After the acquisition , InsideView moved all 2,500 of TrueAdvantage 's customers over to its SaaS solution .
All 150 TruAdvantage employees in India were laid off .
That 's been a familiar tale in Detroit -- but no so far in India .
But that 's changing .
Indian powerhouses like Infosys [ Get Quote ] and Wipro [ Get Quote ] must diversify their portfolios away from pure body - shopping and process competencies to technology - driven advantages .
They , too , could build -- or acquire -- SaaS businesses .
So far that 's not happening .
Infosys is still hiring thousands of new employees in India every year .
The mood is upbeat .
Nasscom is forecasting 25 % annual growth in the Indian IT services industry for the next few years .
The golden goose is still laying large , warm eggs , enough to feed the 4 million and their families , servants , chauffeurs and cooks .
Meanwhile , the workforce is getting comfortable in their cubicle chairs , just as the turkey gets comfortable before Thanksgiving .
Forbes recently published some scary statistics on wage inflation in India .
Salaries rose 15.1 % in 2007 , up from 14.4 % the previous year .
The 2008 forecast : 15.2 % .
This would be the fifth consecutive year of salary growth above 10 % .
Add to that the appreciation of the rupee against the weakening dollar , and its impact on the labor arbitrage market .
Is the death of Indian outsourcing all that far off ?
Assuming a 15 % year - to - year salary hike rate , and a 2007 cost advantage of 1:3 in favor of India , if US wages remain constant , India 's cost advantage disappears by 2015 .
Then what ?

When one ’s driving it , like I did today , and one gets bored listening to stuff on the iPod - radio system , and turns with great trepidation to the radio , there are few options : lots of Spanish , lots of Jesus , and Rush Limbaugh .
I settled on the latter , and it was an interesting day to tune in .
His first hour was spent describing and defending his sneaky plan to have Republicans in Texas vote for Hillary , in a rabble - rousing attempt to keep the selection process going in the “ Democrat ” party ( as he so charmingly calls it ) .
Many disarmingly normal - sounding listeners called in to claim that they had already done so , and to express their gut - wrenching horror at actually pulling the lever for Hillary , even if it was done strategically .
In Rush ’s defense , Daily Kos advocated the same thing with Romney in Michigan , and I have to be honest : while the show ’s ideology was obviously pretty rancid , the facts were pretty well - covered .
A segment about the mainstream media ’s overplaying of the “ Limbaugh hates McCain ” situation was also kind of enlightening ( and disturbing for any Democrat who anticipates conservatives staying home in November ) , since Rush took responsibility for his previous criticism of McCain but pointed out that since he became the presumptive nominee , he ’s backed off .
Things eventually turned ridiculous , though .
A caller , discussing how Clinton and Obama are both terrifying or whatever , made the comment that “ my 12 - year - old says that Obama looks like Curious George ! ”
As my jaw hit the steering wheel , Rush chuckled and they moved on to the next topic .
Upon coming back from a commercial break , however , Rush made an announcement : he apologizes , he did n’t know who Curious George was , let alone the fact that he is a monkey , and to drive home the point proceeded to spend about 30 minutes denying any knowledge of pop culture in general , professing ignorance , in turn , of Snoopy , The Simpsons , and “ cartoon monkeys ” of any sort .
He apologized multiple times to Obama and , inexplicably , to McCain , but it was all just so sad that I started to feel kind of ill , and I finally put on “ 104.1 It Just Rocks ” until I neared the Bay Area and a staticky public radio signal , although they were broadcasting “ Talk of the Nation , ” which really is n’t that much better .
But my trip through the valley of the shadow of death did at least confirm that while Limbaugh may have brief moments of internal logical consistency , eventually he ’ll indict himself with hypocrisy so pathetic you ’re willing to listen to Nickelback instead .
Global warming ranks far down the concerns of the world 's biggest companies , despite world leaders ' hopes that they will pioneer solutions to the impending climate crisis , a startling survey will reveal this week .
Nearly nine in 10 of them do not rate it as a priority , says the study , which canvassed more than 500 big businesses in Britain , the US , Germany , Japan , India and China .
Nearly twice as many see climate change as imposing costs on their business as those who believe it presents an opportunity to make money .
And the report 's publishers believe that big business will concentrate even less on climate change as the world economy deteriorates .
The survey demolishes George Bush 's insistence that global warming is best addressed through voluntary measures undertaken by business – and does so at the most embarrassing juncture for the embattled President .
For this week he is convening a meeting of the world 's largest economies to try to persuade them to agree with him .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The meeting – in Hawaii on Wednesday and Thursday – follows the US 's refusal to accept binding targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions , the main cause of global warming , in international negotiations in Bali last month , and is seen as an attempt to develop a less rigorous approach to the crisis .
But the new report shows that even business does not support this , with four out of the five companies surveyed wanting governments to take a central role in tackling climate change .
The survey , carried out by the consulting firm Accenture , found that only 5 per cent of the companies questioned – and not one in China – regarded global warming as their top priority .
And only 11 per cent put it in second or third place .
Overall it ranked eighth in business leaders ' concerns , below increasing sales , reducing costs , developing new products and services , competing for talented staff , securing growth in emerging markets , innovation and technology .
Although most are taking limited action to reduce their own emissions , almost one in five had done nothing .
Mark Spelman , global head of strategy at Accenture , told The Independent on Sunday at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week : " Climate change is not going to get nearly the same degree of attention here as it would have achieved if the economic outlook were brighter .
Whenever there are underlying economic concerns , people will focus on them . "
The report makes it clear that – in contradiction of the Bush administration 's position – business is waiting for governments to take the lead .
Nearly half of all the companies worldwide said that climate change was already a major issue for them and three in five expected it to be so within five years .
But more than half confessed to be struggling to understand its implications .
Matthew Farrow , head of environment for the Confederation of British Industry , agreed that companies are having a hard time digesting climate change , but added : " The core financials need to be right , but business also needs to understand how climate change will affect the marketplace and realise those business opportunities . "
Some 67 per cent of the businesses surveyed agreed they have a role to play in tackling global warming , but only four out of 10 felt in a position to fulfil it .
In China only 14 per cent of those questioned felt in a strong position .
The report concludes : " Businesses clearly are seeking long - term signals about where and how to invest .
They are reluctant to make big investments in climate change - related initiatives until the scope of future regulation becomes clearer " .
This point has been made to US and European governments by businesses in their own countries .
The European Corporate Leaders on Climate Change group , made up of the heads of major companies – which persuaded both Tony Blair and EU President José Manuel Barroso to make climate change a priority – has called for " a strong and clear policy framework " to enable cuts in emissions .
And the US Climate Action Partnership – which includes the heads of blue - chip companies such as General Electric , DuPont , and Alcoa – has urged Mr Bush to " establish a mandatory emissions pathway " leading to a reduction of up to 30 per cent in US emissions within 15 years .
Yesterday , Mark Kenber , policy director at the Climate Group , said : " These disappointing findings highlight the fact that carbon pricing mechanisms are not yet strong enough for businesses to incorporate climate change risks and opportunities into traditional business strategy " .
IBM is developing a type of memory that it says could one day be faster and more reliable than today 's hard drives and flash memory .
Called " racetrack , " it is a solid - state memory that aims to combine the best attributes of flash , like having no moving parts , and the low cost of hard drives for an inexpensive form of nonvolatile memory that will be stable and durable , said Stuart Parkin , an IBM Fellow .
Racetrack memory stores information in thousands of atoms in magnetic nanowires .
Without the atoms moving , an electrical charge causes data to move swiftly along a U - shaped pipe that allows data to be read and written in less than a nanosecond , Parkin said .
A nanosecond is a billionth of a second and commonly used to measure access time to RAM .
The memory reads 16 bits of data through one transistor , so it reads and writes information 100,000 times faster than flash memory , Parkin said .
" In flash memory and hard drives , one transistor can access 1 bit , or with flash , maybe 2 or possibly even 4 bits , that 's it .
We are going to use ... a transistor to access many bits of information . "
Racetrack is still in its early days .
The concept was proposed four or five years ago , Parkin said , and IBM hopes to be able to provide terabytes worth of storage from such devices in a few years .
" It will take two to four years to build a prototype in which we build these reading - and - writing elements on a nanoscopic scale .
In four years we can perhaps demonstrate it works and then manufacture it , " Parkin said .
Racetrack memory has no moving parts , it is " virtually unbreakable " and will never wear out , unlike flash drives , which could wear out after 10,000 read - and - write cycles , Parkin said .
He likened the U - shaped design of horizontal pipes to a racetrack .
The memory keeps atoms constant , making it more durable than hard drives or flash .
" Whenever you start to move atoms you have problems and devices wear out from fatigue after a time , " Parkin said .
Racetrack memory 's storage capacity is similar to flash 's and may soon exceed hard - drive capacities , Parkin said .
Hard disks rotate to access information , while racetrack memory uses an electrical charge to read and write data , so it also uses less electricity , he said .
It will be inexpensive to manufacture because fewer transistors will be required and each memory chip will hold thousands of nanowires in a small footprint , Parkin said .
The premise behind racetrack memory is spintronics , a technology that manipulates the charge and spin properties of electrons .
Using spintronics , hard - drive makers have developed drives that read data from a microscopically small area .
Parkin is widely noted for his work on spintronics and helping double the density of hard drives every year .
Scientists Albert Fert , of France , and Peter Grunberg , of Germany , won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2007 for their spintronics research .
VenezuelanÂ petrotyrant Hugo Chavez has renewed his denunciations of biofuels .
According to an Associated Press story dated April 26 , 2008 :
“ Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says a U.S. push to boost ethanol production during a world food crisis is a â€˜crime.â€ ™
The socialist leader says he ’s concerned that so much U.S. - produced corn could be used to make biofuel , instead of feeding the world ’s poor .
Chavez says the corn needed to fill an average car with ethanol would be enough to feed seven people for a year . ”
Actually , since a bushel of corn yields 2.8 gallons of ethanol , the corn needed to fill a 20 gallon SUV tank is 7 bushels , which at the current market price of $ 5 / bushel , costs a total of $ 35 .
According to Mr. Chavez , then , the cost of feeding one person for a year is $ 5 .
With oil hitting $ 120 / barrel , Mr. Chavez ’s government this year will receive about $ 88 billion in revenues taxed from the rest of the global economy , while the OPEC governments collectively will tax the world to the tune of $ 1400 billion .
( Omitted from Chavezâ€™s analysis is the fact that the ethanol program has actually stimulated corn production so much that , after the part used for ethanol is taken away , the net US corn harvest available for food and feed is up 34 % since 2002 .
Furthermore , contrary to claims in many articles , this has not been done at the expense of soy or wheat production .
In fact , U.S. soy plantings this year are expected to be up 18 % to a near record of 75 million acres , wheat plantings are up 6 % , and overall , US farm exports are up 23 % .
Much more can be produced as demand requires , since of 800 million acres of US farmland , only 280 million are actually being farmed .
This is why – $ 5 per person per year feeding price aside – Â the entire Malthusian conceit underlying Chavezâ€™s fuel vs. food argument is nonsense . )
Chavez ’s remarks reinforce those made by the Saudi Arabian oil minister in a speech made in Paris April 8 , wherein he expressed his deep concern that biofuels could contribute to global warming .
Chavez and the Saudi ’s negative assessments of biofuels were also strongly supported by arch Malthusian Lester Brown in an op ed in the Washington Post April 22 .
The fundamental unity of the Islamist , the petrotyrant , and the Malthusian positions was made clear by pro-OPEC propagandist Robert Bryce , in a debate with meÂ that aired on the Mike Medved Show April 21 .
( Which can be heardÂ by clicking here . )
When hard pressed , Bryce finally emerged with the following argument : Biofuels are to be shunned because they threaten to lower the price of oil , and thus encourage economic growth , particularly in the third world , and thus global warming .
So apparently we should all be thankful to OPEC , which by taxing the world economy into a recession , is doing so much to curtail uncontrolled human aspirations , while concentrating power in the hands of those who would eliminate all freedom forever . Â

UPDATE :
A reader writes in with an example of how innumerate Chavez ’ statement is :
“ If the $ 88 billion / year Venezuelan oil revenue figure is correct ( and I have no reason to suspect otherwise ) , then Hugo Chavez can singlehandedly end global hunger – $ 88 billion / $ 5 per person = 17.6 billion people that can be fed on Venezuelan oil revenue alone .
What a humanitarian gesture that would be !
And as there are only 6.6 billion people on Earth , he can still pocket $ 55 billion dollars for his own personal needs … ”
In the latest heist to shake the art world , three men wearing ski masks walked into the E. G. Bührle Collection in Zurich on Feb. 9 , grabbed a Cézanne , a Degas , a van Gogh and a Monet together worth an estimated $ 163 million , and tossed them into a van and sped off .
Though one thief brandished a gun , there were signs that the job was probably not up to robbery ’s highest standards : the most expensive of the collection ’s paintings were left behind ( the four that were stolen were in one room ) and the police said the stolen paintings appeared to be poking out of the back of the white van the men used to make their getaway .

“ No one theory can fit all examples of art theft , but I think it ’s often an I.Q. test for not - so - smart criminals , and a lot of them fail , ” said James Mintz , the principal of a corporate investigations firm with offices in New York , London , Zurich and other cities that has handled art cases .
Many of the most notorious art thefts in past decades bear him out and illuminate a strange disconnect between the enduring mystique of art theft and the reality of its perpetrators .
The theft in Vienna in 2003 of a gold - plated saltcellar made by Benvenuto Cellini , valued at $ 60 million , was traced to a 50 - year - old alarm - systems specialist with no criminal record .
The police , who caught him after he tried to ransom the sculpture , called him a “ funny guy ” who had decided to take the Cellini more or less spontaneously .
A divorcé who lived alone , he kept the sculpture under his bed for two years .
Just last year , two men suspected in the theft of two paintings and a drawing by Picasso from the Paris home of Diana Widmaier - Picasso , a granddaughter of the artist , were caught on the street carrying the paintings , estimated to be worth more than $ 60 million , rolled up in cardboard tubes .
Law enforcement officials and officials with the Art Loss Register , a private database of lost and stolen art , emphasize that there are , certainly , highly effective art thieves at work around the world , in an enterprise that the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates at about $ 6 billion a year in stolen goods .
The marquee example remains the 1990 robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston , the biggest art theft in American history , with a value estimated as high as $ 300 million .
Speculation has run high for years that the crime , still unsolved and the art unrecovered , might have been carried out by the organization of James “ Whitey ” Bulger , the Boston crime boss , who remains a fugitive .

Who ’s minding the store in Washington ?
While President George W. Bush was standing before the members of Congress on January 28 laying out his plans , such as they are , for the final year of his second term in the White House , he was also seriously and perhaps fatally undermining the authority of Congress with a new signing statement , attached to the latest National Defense Authorization
Act , in which he declared that he would simply violate or fail to comply with four provisions .
Let me say that again .
The president states in writing that he is not going to obey and will not be bound by four parts of a law duly passed by the Congress .
Just so you know that we ’re not talking about the naming of a bridge or a new ship , the four provisions of the act which the president is going to ignore are :
* the establishment of a commission to investigate contractor fraud in Afghanistan and Iraq
* the protection or whistleblowers who report contractor fraud from harassment or official retribution
* a requirement that US intelligence agencies respond to Congressional requests for documents
* a ban on funding for any permanent military bases in Iraq , and on any actions that would seek to give the US control over Iraq ’s oil resources or oil money .
Now first of all , let ’s see what the constitution has to say .
Article I , the first actual statement about how our government works , which comes right after the preamble about “ We the People , ” states unambiguously :
“ All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . ”
It goes on to state that :
“ Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it becomes a Law , be presented to the President of the United States ;
If he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his Objections , to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal , and proceed to reconsider it .
If after such Reconsideration by two thirds of that House shall agree to apss the Bill , it shall be sent , together with the Objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a Law … If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the Same shall be a Law , in like Manner as if he had signed it . ”
Note that there is no asterisk or footnote saying anything about the president having the power to simply ignore those legislative powers or to violate them at will .
If he does not veto the entire bill — and in this case he did not , he signed it — it becomes the Law of the Land .
Article I also defines the powers of the Congress expansively , stating that it has the power to lay and collect taxes , to regulate commerce , to coin money , to declare war , ro call forth the militia , and
“ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States or in any Department or Officer thereof . ”
Article II goes on to define the powers of the president .
It states :
“ The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . ”

The CIA destroyed the tapes while being scrutinised over secret prisons
It follows last month 's preliminary joint inquiry with the CIA into whether a full investigation was necessary .
Critics have accused the CIA of a cover - up to hide evidence of possible torture and abuse of detainees .
The CIA says it destroyed the tapes as they no longer had " intelligence value " and were a security risk to its agents .
The CIA will of course cooperate fully with this investigation as it has with the others into this matter
CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield
US Attorney General Michael Mukasey announced the move , appointing federal prosecutor John Durham to oversee the case .
In a statement he said : " The department 's national security division has recommended , and I have concluded , that there is a basis for initiating a criminal investigation of this matter . "
CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said the agency would " co-operate fully with this investigation as it has with the others into this matter " .
Interrogation methods
The hundreds of hours of footage , recorded in 2002 , reportedly contained images of interrogation techniques including water - boarding , which simulates drowning .
President George W Bush has said that the US does not use torture but has not been specific about interrogation methods .
Congress are also examining exactly how and why the tapes came to be destroyed in 2005 .
The House Intelligence Committee has called on Jose Rodriguez , the former CIA official who ordered the tapes destroyed , to appear at a hearing on 16 January .
The Bush administration has so far refused to co-operate with the congressional investigation .

Downtown Los Angeles has seen a much - heralded revival in the last few years , with thousands of people moving in and a flock of new restaurants and upscale stores opening to serve them .
Attractions such as Staples Center and the Nokia Theatre are helping support premium eateries and a lively club scene .
But there are signs that downtown ’s residential boom is slowing , if not stalling out altogether .
Prices of condominiums , which dominate the downtown market , have fallen more sharply here than in Los Angeles and Orange counties overall , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
More than one - third of the residential projects approved by city officials have been sidelined .
Downtown ’s defenders say the area simply is suffering from the same housing slump that has slowed sales to a crawl and depressed prices across the country .
But some real estate analysts believe downtown ’s housing troubles run deeper .
They say developers and planners miscalculated its appeal as a residential community , leading them to build far too many projects for the demand .
As a result , the housing market downtown could fall more sharply and take longer to recover than it might in established residential areas .
“ There was great hype , ” said Fred Sands , a veteran real estate broker who sold his namesake firm and now invests in commercial properties .
“ There was sort of a mania that fed on itself .
People said downtown was the future , and young people bought into it .
Some of those buildings should not have been built . ”
Downtown developers counter that argument , saying there are too many people working downtown and not enough places for them to live .
Traffic gets worse every year , they point out , which will drive up demand for housing closer to where people work .
“ I think it is absolutely inevitable more and more people will live in downtown - type locations , ” saidJames A. Osterling , a developer and the former chief financial officer of Shea Homes .
“ I do n’t think [ the real estate slump ] is going to kill off downtown . ”
Home sales data , however , suggest that the downtown market is faring worse than the region overall .
The median sales price for homes sold downtown , almost all of which are condos , fell to $ 497,360 for the fourth quarter of last year , 16 % below the peak reached in early 2007 , according to DataQuick .
By comparison , condo prices fell 7 % from their peak in Los Angeles County during the same period and 11 % from their peak in Orange County , DataQuick said .
The median sales price for condos in both counties in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $ 410,000 .
Downtown ’s residential expansion began in 1999 , when the city relaxed parking , zoning and seismic safety rules , making it easier for developers to convert aged office buildings into apartments .
The wide - open layouts and spare look of the lofts , with concrete floors and exposed pipes , quickly proved popular with an adventuresome crowd .
Within a few years , developers began to offer units in the rehabbed buildings for sale , and luxury buildings were constructed from the ground up , with rooftop pools and sky - high prices .
So far , however , demand has not kept pace with ambitions , as several downtown boosters concede .
Developers of nearly completed condominium buildings have been pulling out all the stops to move their units .
Until recently , one complex offered to lease a Mini Cooper car for buyers .
It has now upped the ante : $ 60,000 in upgrades and discounts .
Another developer was giving away paid vacations at a Mexican resort to loft purchasers .
Despite declining values , many downtown lofts are still listed for sale at more than $ 600,000 , comparable to houses in easy commuting distance to downtown .
Osterling , who is developing a residential project in Chinatown , is well aware of the challenge .
Though he calls himself “ a huge believer in the renaissance in downtown Los Angeles , ” he likes his Altadena house just fine .
If he did downsize , “ I ’d probably get a condo in Pasadena , ” he said .
“ It has the theater , restaurants and culture without the rough edges of downtown . ”
Real estate experts say those rough edges -- including pockets of homeless people and areas that still appear run-down -- remain an obstacle .
Sands said he was seriously considering buying apartment buildings in the downtown warehouse district three years ago .
He said he changed his mind after seeing “ an attractive young woman pushing an infant in a stroller , with winos all around her . ”
Paul Park , 34 , a marketing manager for an architecture and design firm , said he and his partner considered moving their office and residence downtown several years ago .
Instead , they set up an office in West Hollywood and remained in their Hollywood house .
Park said he found the well - publicized new night life and shopping downtown was n’t as abundant as he would like .
“ We were n’t ready to homestead , ” he said .
Architect Ken Lewis and his wife , Patricia , moved downtown in 2001 to live closer to work and join what they saw as an exciting urban revival .
But after two years of living in a converted office building near City Hall , they abandoned downtown for suburban Burbank .
“ I really needed a garage , ” said Lewis , 51 , an avid woodworker .
He added : “ Patricia really loves to garden ; she wanted a small yard . ”
USC professor Peter Gordon said the loft movement was an outgrowth of the flood of high - rise office buildings that shot up in Bunker Hill in the 1980s .
The new skyscrapers rented at rates low enough to draw tenants from the older buildings downtown , emptying them out .
Developers saw an opportunity to convert these vacant , often run-down office spaces into lofts .
It ’s a good idea that might make sense on paper , Gordon said , but they were trying to create a market where one did n’t exist .
“ There ’s a sort of faddishness ” to the demand for downtown lofts without doors on the bedrooms and bathrooms or dedicated parking spaces , Gordon said .
“ I do n’t think it extends deeply . ”
He anticipates a long period of high vacancies and deeply discounted rents for downtown ’s loft buildings .
Despite skeptics such as Gordon , downtown has seen a big increase in its residential population .
According to the downtown Business Improvement District , the total has grown 42 % in the last three years , based on a formula that figures 1.6 persons per housing unit .
The city , using U.S. census data , estimates more modest growth of 20 % downtown from 2000 to 2006 .
But that still outpaced L.A. 's growth of 8 % for that period .
“ We have created a desirable place to live , ” said Carol E. Schatz , president of the Central City Assn. , a downtown business advocacy group .
Schatz said slowing condo sales downtown simply reflected the national real estate downturn .
“ As the whole region comes out of the downturn , we will speed ahead , ” she said .
“ There ’s no other place you can go to the opera , a Lakers game or a world - class concert ” in the Los Angeles area , she said .
Downtown ’s growth coincided with the creation of several landmark developments , such as Staples Center and the Walt Disney Concert Hall .
Coming up : the Grand Avenue project , with its hotels , offices and condos in the Civic Center .
The recently opened Nokia Theatre near the Los Angeles Convention Center marked the first phase of L.A. Live , an ambitious hotel , retail and residential complex .
Even skeptics like Sands see South Park , the area around Staples Center , as promising .
“ South Park eventually is going to be great , ” Sands said .
James Atkins , whose development firm , Portland , Ore. - based Williams , Dame & Atkins , has built two major projects downtown , is bullish on the area but acknowledges that its transformation is not complete .
From his developments elsewhere , Atkins has learned that younger people will live in edgy new neighborhoods .
But a neighborhood becomes firmly established when older , more affluent people are willing to move in -- a sign that the area ’s safety and amenities match that of the suburbs where they ’d been living .
Downtown needs even more restaurants , stores and parks for that to happen , Atkins said .
“ When the Westside empty - nesters arrive , that ’s when we ’ll see the real jump in the market , ” he said .
He added : “ That process took 20 years in Portland . ”

Religious affairs correspondent , BBC News
The scholars say they are returning to the original values of Islam
Turkey is preparing to publish a document that represents a revolutionary reinterpretation of Islam - and a controversial and radical modernisation of the religion .
The country 's powerful Department of Religious Affairs has commissioned a team of theologians at Ankara University to carry out a fundamental revision of the Hadith , the second most sacred text in Islam after the Koran .
The Hadith is a collection of thousands of sayings reputed to come from the Prophet Muhammad .
As such , it is the principal guide for Muslims in interpreting the Koran and the source of the vast majority of Islamic law , or Sharia .
This is kind of akin to the Christian Reformation .
Not exactly the same , but ... it 's changing the theological foundations of [ the ] religion
Fadi Hakura ,
Turkey expert , Chatham House
Islam series : Modern roles
But the Turkish state has come to see the Hadith as having an often negative influence on a society it is in a hurry to modernise , and believes it responsible for obscuring the original values of Islam .
It says that a significant number of the sayings were never uttered by Muhammad , and even some that were need now to be reinterpreted .
' Reformation '
Commentators say the very theology of Islam is being reinterpreted in order to effect a radical renewal of the religion .
Its supporters say the spirit of logic and reason inherent in Islam at its foundation 1,400 years ago are being rediscovered .
Some believe it could represent the beginning of a reformation in the religion .
Some messages ban women from travelling without their husband 's permission ...
But this is n't a religious ban .
It came about because it simply was n't safe for a woman to travel alone
Prof Mehmet Gormez ,
Hadith expert ,
Department of Religious Affairs
Turkish officials have been reticent about the revision of the Hadith until now , aware of the controversy it is likely to cause among traditionalist Muslims , but they have spoken to the BBC about the project , and their ambitious aims for it .
The forensic examination of the Hadiths has taken place in Ankara University 's School of Theology .
Fr Felix Koerner , a Christian theologian who has observed the project , says some of the sayings - also known individually as " hadiths " - can be shown to have been invented hundreds of years after the Prophet Muhammad died , to serve the purposes of contemporary society .
" Unfortunately you can even justify through alleged hadiths , the Muslim - or pseudo - Muslim - practice of female genital mutilation , " he says .
" You can find messages which say ' that is what the Prophet ordered us to do ' .
But you can show historically how they came into being , as influences from other cultures , that were then projected onto Islamic tradition . "
HAVE YOUR SAY Many Hadiths relate to life in the Middle East 1,400 years ago and are no longer relevant Brian , London
The argument is that Islamic tradition has been gradually hijacked by various - often conservative - cultures , seeking to use the religion for various forms of social control .
Leaders of the Hadith project say successive generations have embellished the text , attributing their political aims to the Prophet Muhammad himself .
Revolutionary
Turkey is intent on sweeping away that " cultural baggage " and returning to a form of Islam it claims accords with its original values and those of the Prophet .
Women are re-examining their portrayal in the scriptures
But this is where the revolutionary nature of the work becomes apparent .
Even some sayings accepted as being genuinely spoken by Muhammad have been altered and reinterpreted .
Prof Mehmet Gormez , a senior official in the Department of Religious Affairs and an expert on the Hadith , gives a telling example .
" There are some messages that ban women from travelling for three days or more without their husband 's permission and they are genuine .
" But this is n't a religious ban .
It came about because in the Prophet 's time it simply was n't safe for a woman to travel alone like that .
But as time has passed , people have made permanent what was only supposed to be a temporary ban for safety reasons . "
The project justifies such bold interference in the 1,400 - year - old content of the Hadith by rigorous academic research .
Prof Gormez points out that in another speech , the Prophet said " he longed for the day when a woman might travel long distances alone " .
So , he argues , it is clear what the Prophet 's goal was .
Original spirit
Yet , until now , the ban has remained in the text , and helps to restrict the free movement of some Muslim women to this day .
There 's also violence against women within families , including sexual harassment ...
This does not exist in Islam ... we have to explain that to them
Hulya Koc , a " vaize "
As part of its aggressive programme of renewal , Turkey has given theological training to 450 women , and appointed them as senior imams called " vaizes " .
They have been given the task of explaining the original spirit of Islam to remote communities in Turkey 's vast interior .
One of the women , Hulya Koc , looked out over a sea of headscarves at a town meeting in central Turkey and told the women of the equality , justice and human rights guaranteed by an accurate interpretation of the Koran - one guided and confirmed by the revised Hadith .
She says that , at the moment , Islam is being widely used to justify the violent suppression of women .
" There are honour killings , " she explains .
" We hear that some women are being killed when they marry the wrong person or run away with someone they love .
" There 's also violence against women within families , including sexual harassment by uncles and others .
This does not exist in Islam ... we have to explain that to them . "
' New Islam '
According to Fadi Hakura , an expert on Turkey from Chatham House in London , Turkey is doing nothing less than recreating Islam - changing it from a religion whose rules must be obeyed , to one designed to serve the needs of people in a modern secular democracy .
He says that to achieve it , the state is fashioning a new Islam .
" This is kind of akin to the Christian Reformation , " he says .
" Not exactly the same , but if you think , it 's changing the theological foundations of [ the ] religion . "
Fadi Hakura believes that until now secularist Turkey has been intent on creating a new politics for Islam .
Now , he says , " they are trying to fashion a new Islam . "
Significantly , the " Ankara School " of theologians working on the new Hadith have been using Western critical techniques and philosophy .
They have also taken an even bolder step - rejecting a long - established rule of Muslim scholars that later ( and often more conservative ) texts override earlier ones .
" You have to see them as a whole , " says Fadi Hakura .
" You can't say , for example , that the verses of violence override the verses of peace .
This is used a lot in the Middle East , this kind of ideology .
" I can not impress enough how fundamental [ this change ] is . "

73,846 US TROOPS DEAD ( near top of page 6 ) 1,620,906 PERMANENTLY DISABLED
( near top of page 7 ) US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ISSUES OFFICIAL REPORT CONFIRMING 73,000 U.S. TROOPS KILLED IN IRAQ SAME GOVERNMENT AGENCY REPORT CONFIRMS 1.6 MILLION " DISABLED " BY THE WAR From Peter Marshall E. Boomhower eboomhower@juno.com
George Walker Bush has presided over the worst defeat of the United States Military since Vietnam and has deliberately skewed reporting of the deaths and injuries to conceal the facts .
Department of Veteran 's Affairs , in conjunction with the Joint Chiefs of Staff , has released the truth because they need the American People to know our military is literally , destroyed .
They cannot release these horrific numbers via the chain of command because they are under orders to conceal the truth at all costs , so they let slip a report which now cannot be " un-slipped . "
Here are the facts and a link to the government source to prove these facts : More Gulf War Veterans Have Died Than Vietnam Veterans .
The Department of Veterans Affairs , May 2007 , Gulf War Veterans Information System reports the following : Total U.S. Military Gulf War 1 and Gulf War 3 Deaths : 73,846 * Deaths amongst Deployed : 17,847 * Deaths amongst Non-Deployed : 55,999 Total " Undiagnosed Illness " ( UDX ) claims : 14,874 Total number of disability claims filed : 1,620,906 * Disability Claims amongst Deployed : 407,911 * Disability Claims amongst Non-Deployed : 1,212,995 Percentage of combat troops who filed Disability Claims 36 % Soldiers , by nature , typically do n't complain .
They do n't want to be perceived ( by idiots ) as being weak , or complainers , or looking to get out of work / danger .
In other words , the real impact of those who are disabled from the US invasions in Iraq , Afghanistan and other Nations , is not fully reflected in the official Veterans Affairs numbers .
Why are the government numbers of 3,777 as of 9 - 7 - 7 are so low ?
The answer is simple , the government does not want the 73,846 dead U.S. soldiers killed in the Gulf to date to be compared to the 55,000 U.S. soldiers killed in Vietnam , lest we all conclude Iraq = Vietnam .
What the government is doing is only counting the soldiers that die in action before they can get them into a helicopter or ambulance .
Any soldier who is shot but they get into a helicopter before he dies is not counted .
73,846 dead U.S. soldiers for this scale operation using weapons of mass destruction is not high - we expect the great majority of U.S. soldiers who took part in the invasion of Iraq to die of uranium poisoning , which can take decades to kill .
More than 1,820 tons ( 3 - million , 640 thousand pounds ) of radio- active nuclear waste uranium were exploded into Iraq alone in the form of armor piercing rounds and bunker busters , representing the worlds worst man made ecological disaster ever .
64 kg of uranium were used in the Hiroshima bomb .
The U.S. Iraq Nuclear Holocaust represents far more than fourteen thousand Hiroshima atomic bombs .
That 's 14,000 .
The nuclear waste the U.S. has exploded into the Middle East will continue killing for BILLIONS of years and can wipe out more than a third of life on earth .
Gulf War Veterans who have ingested the uranium will continue to die off over a number of years .
From a victors perspective , above any major war in history , The Gulf War has taken the severest toll on soldiers .
So far , more than one million people have been slaughtered in the illegal invasion of Iraqi by the U.S. .
This is genocide of the highest order .
Iraqi birth defects are up 600 % - the same will apply to U.S. Veterans .
Statistics and evidence published by the government and mainstream media in no way reflect the extreme gravity of the situation .
Those working for the government and media must wake up and take responsibility for immediately reversing this U.S. Holocaust .
Understanding who is manipulating all of us is critical for all of us .
For those of you who doubt the veracity of this story , who naively believe it can't be true because if it were true , you would have heard it from the government or from the main stream media , can see the proof yourselves directly from the United States Department of Veteran 's Affairs web site - Source : http://www1.va.gov/rac-gwvi/docs/GWVIS_May2007.pdf
This story is 100 % accurate .
100 % true .
100 % verifiable .

( CNN ) -- Turkish troops backed by air support attacked Kurdish rebels Friday in northern Iraq , the Turkish military said .
Turkish tanks on the move near the border town of Silopi in Sirnak province , southeastern Turkey .
At least 24 suspected Kurd militants were killed , the Turkish military reported , adding it suffered 5 casualties .
The incursion against the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) in Iraq began around 7 p.m. Thursday .
In a statement , the Turkish military said it would act with " utmost sensitivity in order to avoid negative impact on local elements " -- a reference to keeping civilians out of the conflict .
" The Turkish Armed Forces , which values Iraq 's territorial integrity and its stability , will return as soon as planned goals are achieved , " the military said .
" The executed operation will prevent the region from being a permanent and safe base for the terrorists and will contribute to Iraq 's stability and internal peace . "
Turkey has been taking cross - border military action , including airstrikes and artillery shelling , against the PKK in retaliation to attacks by the group on targets in Turkey from bases in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq .
The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey .
Turkey has also been carrying out small ground operations into Iraq , forays characterized as " hot pursuit " incursions with a few hundred commandos responding to a particular threat .
Citing Turkish media reports estimating that as many as 10,000 Turkish troops had been involved , Fadi Hakura , an analyst with UK military thinktank Chatham House , said the operation was the first major incursion by Turkey into Iraq since Hussein was toppled in 2003 .
Hakura said the Turkish military wanted to conduct a surprise attack against the PKK prior to the springtime , when violent attacks tend to escalate , and when the snow in the mountainous border region leaves the fighters ' footprints .
" Normally during the 1980s and the 1990s , the incursions involved 35,000 50,000 troops and they tended to be somewhat open - ended over weeks .
This one is expected to be limited to a matter of days and targeted attacks against the PKK , " he said .
U.S. officials were downplaying the scope of the operation Friday .
Tom Casey , deputy State Department spokesman , said Iraqi Foreign Ministry Hoshyar Zebari called the incursion " limited in nature " and not " major . "
" The PKK is a common enemy of the U.S. , Turkey and Iraq .
We need to work together to resolve it , " Casey said .
" We are pleased that Turks have stressed that they will do everything possible to avoid acts that would harm civilians . "
Rear Adm. Gregory Smith , a spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq , told CNN the military is " aware " of a Turkish " operation of limited duration to specifically target PKK terrorists in that region . "
" Turkey has given its assurances it will do everything possible to avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians or Kurdish infrastructure , " Smith said .
The ground troops ' deployment followed cross - border shelling early Thursday by Turkish soldiers into abandoned villages north of Irbil -- the capital of Iraq 's Kurdish Regional Government .
The shelling , which struck abandoned villages in the Khwar - Kork area north of Irbil , lasted two hours and was followed by heavy gunfire , a KRG official told CNN .
There were no reports of casualties .
Border tensions have been a source of diplomatic disagreement between the U,S. and its Iraqi and Turkish allies .
U.S. and Iraqi authorities have been concerned that any large - scale operation by Turkey into Iraq to chase down Kurdish rebels could destabilize the region .
At the same time , the U.S. backs Turkey 's efforts to battle the PKK , which both countries regard as a terrorist group and has been providing intelligence to the Turks .
" The United States continues to support Turkey 's right to defend itself from the terrorist activities of the PKK and has encouraged Turkey to use all available means , to include diplomacy and close coordination with the Government of Iraq to ultimately resolve this issue , " Smith said .

1. Introduction
An important feature of transactional databases like SQLite is " atomic commit " .
Atomic commit means that either all database changes within a single transaction occur or none of them occur .
With atomic commit , it is as if many different writes to different sections of the database file occur instantaneously and simultaneously .
Real hardware serializes writes to mass storage , and writing a single sector takes a finite amount of time .
So it is impossible to truly write many different sectors of a database file simultaneously and / or instantaneously .
But the atomic commit logic within SQLite makes it appear as if the changes for a transaction are all written instantaneously and simultaneously .
SQLite has the important property that transactions appear to be atomic even if the transaction is interrupted by an operating system crash or power failure .
This article describes the techniques used by SQLite to create the illusion of atomic commit .
The information in this article applies only when SQLite is operating in " rollback mode " , or in other words when SQLite is not using a write - ahead log .
SQLite still supports atomic commit when write - ahead logging is enabled , but it accomplishes atomic commit by a different mechanism from the one described in this article .
See the write - ahead log documentation for additional information on how SQLite supports atomic commit in that context .
2. Hardware Assumptions
Throughout this article , we will call the mass storage device " disk " even though the mass storage device might really be flash memory .
We assume that disk is written in chunks which we call a " sector " .
It is not possible to modify any part of the disk smaller than a sector .
To change a part of the disk smaller than a sector , you have to read in the full sector that contains the part you want to change , make the change , then write back out the complete sector .
On a traditional spinning disk , a sector is the minimum unit of transfer in both directions , both reading and writing .
On flash memory , however , the minimum size of a read is typically much smaller than a minimum write .
SQLite is only concerned with the minimum write amount and so for the purposes of this article , when we say " sector " we mean the minimum amount of data that can be written to mass storage in a single go .
Prior to SQLite version 3.3.14 , a sector size of 512 bytes was assumed in all cases .
There was a compile - time option to change this but the code had never been tested with a larger value .
The 512 byte sector assumption seemed reasonable since until very recently all disk drives used a 512 byte sector internally .
However , there has recently been a push to increase the sector size of disks to 4096 bytes .
Also the sector size for flash memory is usually larger than 512 bytes .
For these reasons , versions of SQLite beginning with 3.3.14 have a method in the OS interface layer that interrogates the underlying filesystem to find the true sector size .
As currently implemented ( version 3.5.0 ) this method still returns a hard - coded value of 512 bytes , since there is no standard way of discovering the true sector size on either Unix or Windows .
But the method is available for embedded device manufacturers to tweak according to their own needs .
And we have left open the possibility of filling in a more meaningful implementation on Unix and Windows in the future .
SQLite has traditionally assumed that a sector write is not atomic .
However , SQLite does always assume that a sector write is linear .
By " linear " we mean that SQLite assumes that when writing a sector , the hardware begins at one end of the data and writes byte by byte until it gets to the other end .
The write might go from beginning to end or from end to beginning .
If a power failure occurs in the middle of a sector write it might be that part of the sector was modified and another part was left unchanged .
The key assumption by SQLite is that if any part of the sector gets changed , then either the first or the last bytes will be changed .
So the hardware will never start writing a sector in the middle and work towards the ends .
We do not know if this assumption is always true but it seems reasonable .
The previous paragraph states that SQLite does not assume that sector writes are atomic .
This is true by default .
But as of SQLite version 3.5.0 , there is a new interface called the Virtual File System ( VFS ) interface .
The VFS is the only means by which SQLite communicates to the underlying filesystem .
The code comes with default VFS implementations for Unix and Windows and there is a mechanism for creating new custom VFS implementations at runtime .
In this new VFS interface there is a method called xDeviceCharacteristics .
This method interrogates the underlying filesystem to discover various properties and behaviors that the filesystem may or may not exhibit .
The xDeviceCharacteristics method might indicate that sector writes are atomic , and if it does so indicate , SQLite will try to take advantage of that fact .
But the default xDeviceCharacteristics method for both Unix and Windows does not indicate atomic sector writes and so these optimizations are normally omitted .
SQLite assumes that the operating system will buffer writes and that a write request will return before data has actually been stored in the mass storage device .
SQLite further assumes that write operations will be reordered by the operating system .
For this reason , SQLite does a " flush " or " fsync " operation at key points .
SQLite assumes that the flush or fsync will not return until all pending write operations for the file that is being flushed have completed .
We are told that the flush and fsync primitives are broken on some versions of Windows and Linux .
This is unfortunate .
It opens SQLite up to the possibility of database corruption following a power loss in the middle of a commit .
However , there is nothing that SQLite can do to test for or remedy the situation .
SQLite assumes that the operating system that it is running on works as advertised .
If that is not quite the case , well then hopefully you will not lose power too often .
SQLite assumes that when a file grows in length that the new file space originally contains garbage and then later is filled in with the data actually written .
In other words , SQLite assumes that the file size is updated before the file content .
This is a pessimistic assumption and SQLite has to do some extra work to make sure that it does not cause database corruption if power is lost between the time when the file size is increased and when the new content is written .
The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the VFS might indicate that the filesystem will always write the data before updating the file size .
( This is the SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND property for those readers who are looking at the code . )
When the xDeviceCharacteristics method indicates that files content is written before the file size is increased , SQLite can forego some of its pedantic database protection steps and thereby decrease the amount of disk I/O needed to perform a commit .
The current implementation , however , makes no such assumptions for the default VFSes for Windows and Unix .
SQLite assumes that a file deletion is atomic from the point of view of a user process .
By this we mean that if SQLite requests that a file be deleted and the power is lost during the delete operation , once power is restored either the file will exist completely with all if its original content unaltered , or else the file will not be seen in the filesystem at all .
If after power is restored the file is only partially deleted , if some of its data has been altered or erased , or the file has been truncated but not completely removed , then database corruption will likely result .
SQLite assumes that the detection and / or correction of bit errors caused by cosmic rays , thermal noise , quantum fluctuations , device driver bugs , or other mechanisms , is the responsibility of the underlying hardware and operating system .
SQLite does not add any redundancy to the database file for the purpose of detecting corruption or I /O errors .
SQLite assumes that the data it reads is exactly the same data that it previously wrote .
By default , SQLite assumes that an operating system call to write a range of bytes will not damage or alter any bytes outside of that range even if a power loss or OS crash occurs during that write .
We call this the " powersafe overwrite " property .
Prior to version 3.7.9 ( 2011-11-01 ) , SQLite did not assume powersafe overwrite .
But with the standard sector size increasing from 512 to 4096 bytes on most disk drives , it has become necessary to assume powersafe overwrite in order to maintain historical performance levels and so powersafe overwrite is assumed by default in recent versions of SQLite .
The assumption of powersafe overwrite property can be disabled at compile - time or a run-time if desired .
See the powersafe overwrite documentation for further details .
3. Single File Commit
We begin with an overview of the steps SQLite takes in order to perform an atomic commit of a transaction against a single database file .
The details of file formats used to guard against damage from power failures and techniques for performing an atomic commit across multiple databases are discussed in later sections .
3.1. Initial State
The state of the computer when a database connection is first opened is shown conceptually by the diagram at the right .
The area of the diagram on the extreme right ( labeled " Disk " ) represents information stored on the mass storage device .
Each rectangle is a sector .
The blue color represents that the sectors contain original data .
The middle area is the operating systems disk cache .
At the onset of our example , the cache is cold and this is represented by leaving the rectangles of the disk cache empty .
The left area of the diagram shows the content of memory for the process that is using SQLite .
The database connection has just been opened and no information has been read yet , so the user space is empty .
3.2 . Acquiring A Read Lock
Before SQLite can write to a database , it must first read the database to see what is there already .
Even if it is just appending new data , SQLite still has to read in the database schema from the " sqlite_schema " table so that it can know how to parse the INSERT statements and discover where in the database file the new information should be stored .
The first step toward reading from the database file is obtaining a shared lock on the database file .
A " shared " lock allows two or more database connections to read from the database file at the same time .
But a shared lock prevents another database connection from writing to the database file while we are reading it .
This is necessary because if another database connection were writing to the database file at the same time we are reading from the database file , we might read some data before the change and other data after the change .
This would make it appear as if the change made by the other process is not atomic .
Notice that the shared lock is on the operating system disk cache , not on the disk itself .
File locks really are just flags within the operating system kernel , usually .
( The details depend on the specific OS layer interface . )
Hence , the lock will instantly vanish if the operating system crashes or if there is a power loss .
It is usually also the case that the lock will vanish if the process that created the lock exits .
3.3 . Reading Information Out Of The Database
After the shared lock is acquired , we can begin reading information from the database file .
In this scenario , we are assuming a cold cache , so information must first be read from mass storage into the operating system cache then transferred from operating system cache into user space .
On subsequent reads , some or all of the information might already be found in the operating system cache and so only the transfer to user space would be required .
Usually only a subset of the pages in the database file are read .
In this example we are showing three pages out of eight being read .
In a typical application , a database will have thousands of pages and a query will normally only touch a small percentage of those pages .
3.4 . Obtaining A Reserved Lock
Before making changes to the database , SQLite first obtains a " reserved " lock on the database file .
A reserved lock is similar to a shared lock in that both a reserved lock and shared lock allow other processes to read from the database file .
A single reserve lock can coexist with multiple shared locks from other processes .
However , there can only be a single reserved lock on the database file .
Hence only a single process can be attempting to write to the database at one time .
The idea behind a reserved lock is that it signals that a process intends to modify the database file in the near future but has not yet started to make the modifications .
And because the modifications have not yet started , other processes can continue to read from the database .
However , no other process should also begin trying to write to the database .
3.5 . Creating A Rollback Journal File
Prior to making any changes to the database file , SQLite first creates a separate rollback journal file and writes into the rollback journal the original content of the database pages that are to be altered .
The idea behind the rollback journal is that it contains all information needed to restore the database back to its original state .
The rollback journal contains a small header ( shown in green in the diagram ) that records the original size of the database file .
So if a change causes the database file to grow , we will still know the original size of the database .
The page number is stored together with each database page that is written into the rollback journal .
When a new file is created , most desktop operating systems ( Windows , Linux , Mac OS X ) will not actually write anything to disk .
The new file is created in the operating systems disk cache only .
The file is not created on mass storage until sometime later , when the operating system has a spare moment .
This creates the impression to users that I/O is happening much faster than is possible when doing real disk I/O .
We illustrate this idea in the diagram to the right by showing that the new rollback journal appears in the operating system disk cache only and not on the disk itself .
3.6 . Changing Database Pages In User Space
After the original page content has been saved in the rollback journal , the pages can be modified in user memory .
Each database connection has its own private copy of user space , so the changes that are made in user space are only visible to the database connection that is making the changes .
Other database connections still see the information in operating system disk cache buffers which have not yet been changed .
And so even though one process is busy modifying the database , other processes can continue to read their own copies of the original database content .
3.7 . Flushing The Rollback Journal File To Mass Storage
The next step is to flush the content of the rollback journal file to nonvolatile storage .
As we will see later , this is a critical step in insuring that the database can survive an unexpected power loss .
This step also takes a lot of time , since writing to nonvolatile storage is normally a slow operation .
This step is usually more complicated than simply flushing the rollback journal to the disk .
On most platforms two separate flush ( or fsync ( ) ) operations are required .
The first flush writes out the base rollback journal content .
Then the header of the rollback journal is modified to show the number of pages in the rollback journal .
Then the header is flushed to disk .
The details on why we do this header modification and extra flush are provided in a later section of this paper .
3.8 . Obtaining An Exclusive Lock
Prior to making changes to the database file itself , we must obtain an exclusive lock on the database file .
Obtaining an exclusive lock is really a two - step process .
First SQLite obtains a " pending " lock .
Then it escalates the pending lock to an exclusive lock .
A pending lock allows other processes that already have a shared lock to continue reading the database file .
But it prevents new shared locks from being established .
The idea behind a pending lock is to prevent writer starvation caused by a large pool of readers .
There might be dozens , even hundreds , of other processes trying to read the database file .
Each process acquires a shared lock before it starts reading , reads what it needs , then releases the shared lock .
If , however , there are many different processes all reading from the same database , it might happen that a new process always acquires its shared lock before the previous process releases its shared lock .
And so there is never an instant when there are no shared locks on the database file and hence there is never an opportunity for the writer to seize the exclusive lock .
A pending lock is designed to prevent that cycle by allowing existing shared locks to proceed but blocking new shared locks from being established .
Eventually all shared locks will clear and the pending lock will then be able to escalate into an exclusive lock .
3.9 . Writing Changes To The Database File
Once an exclusive lock is held , we know that no other processes are reading from the database file and it is safe to write changes into the database file .
Usually those changes only go as far as the operating systems disk cache and do not make it all the way to mass storage .
3.10 . 0 Flushing Changes To Mass Storage
Another flush must occur to make sure that all the database changes are written into nonvolatile storage .
This is a critical step to ensure that the database will survive a power loss without damage .
However , because of the inherent slowness of writing to disk or flash memory , this step together with the rollback journal file flush in section 3.7 above takes up most of the time required to complete a transaction commit in SQLite .
3.11 . 1 Deleting The Rollback Journal
After the database changes are all safely on the mass storage device , the rollback journal file is deleted .
This is the instant where the transaction commits .
If a power failure or system crash occurs prior to this point , then recovery processes to be described later make it appear as if no changes were ever made to the database file .
If a power failure or system crash occurs after the rollback journal is deleted , then it appears as if all changes have been written to disk .
Thus , SQLite gives the appearance of having made no changes to the database file or having made the complete set of changes to the database file depending on whether or not the rollback journal file exists .
Deleting a file is not really an atomic operation , but it appears to be from the point of view of a user process .
A process is always able to ask the operating system " does this file exist ? " and the process will get back a yes or no answer .
After a power failure that occurs during a transaction commit , SQLite will ask the operating system whether or not the rollback journal file exists .
If the answer is " yes " then the transaction is incomplete and is rolled back .
If the answer is " no " then it means the transaction did commit .
The existence of a transaction depends on whether or not the rollback journal file exists and the deletion of a file appears to be an atomic operation from the point of view of a user - space process .
Therefore , a transaction appears to be an atomic operation .
The act of deleting a file is expensive on many systems .
As an optimization , SQLite can be configured to truncate the journal file to zero bytes in length or overwrite the journal file header with zeros .
In either case , the resulting journal file is no longer capable of rolling back and so the transaction still commits .
Truncating a file to zero length , like deleting a file , is assumed to be an atomic operation from the point of view of a user process .
Overwriting the header of the journal with zeros is not atomic , but if any part of the header is malformed the journal will not roll back .
Hence , one can say that the commit occurs as soon as the header is sufficiently changed to make it invalid .
Typically this happens as soon as the first byte of the header is zeroed .
3.12 . 2 Releasing The Lock
The last step in the commit process is to release the exclusive lock so that other processes can once again start accessing the database file .
In the diagram at the right , we show that the information that was held in user space is cleared when the lock is released .
This used to be literally true for older versions of SQLite .
But more recent versions of SQLite keep the user space information in memory in case it might be needed again at the start of the next transaction .
It is cheaper to reuse information that is already in local memory than to transfer the information back from the operating system disk cache or to read it off of the disk drive again .
Prior to reusing the information in user space , we must first reacquire the shared lock and then we have to check to make sure that no other process modified the database file while we were not holding a lock .
There is a counter in the first page of the database that is incremented every time the database file is modified .
We can find out if another process has modified the database by checking that counter .
If the database was modified , then the user space cache must be cleared and reread .
But it is commonly the case that no changes have been made and the user space cache can be reused for a significant performance savings .
4. Rollback
An atomic commit is supposed to happen instantaneously .
But the processing described above clearly takes a finite amount of time .
Suppose the power to the computer were cut part way through the commit operation described above .
In order to maintain the illusion that the changes were instantaneous , we have to " rollback " any partial changes and restore the database to the state it was in prior to the beginning of the transaction .
4.1 . When Something Goes Wrong ...
Suppose the power loss occurred during step 3.10 above , while the database changes were being written to disk .
After power is restored , the situation might be something like what is shown to the right .
We were trying to change three pages of the database file but only one page was successfully written .
Another page was partially written and a third page was not written at all .
The rollback journal is complete and intact on disk when the power is restored .
This is a key point .
The reason for the flush operation in step 3.7 is to make absolutely sure that all of the rollback journal is safely on nonvolatile storage prior to making any changes to the database file itself .
4.2 . Hot Rollback Journals
The first time that any SQLite process attempts to access the database file , it obtains a shared lock as described in section 3.2 above .
But then it notices that there is a rollback journal file present .
SQLite then checks to see if the rollback journal is a " hot journal " .
A hot journal is a rollback journal that needs to be played back in order to restore the database to a sane state .
A hot journal only exists when an earlier process was in the middle of committing a transaction when it crashed or lost power .
A rollback journal is a " hot " journal if all of the following are true :
The rollback journal exists .
The rollback journal is not an empty file .
There is no reserved lock on the main database file .
The header of the rollback journal is well - formed and in particular has not been zeroed out .
The rollback journal does not contain the name of a super - journal file ( see section 5.5 below ) or if does contain the name of a super - journal , then that super - journal file exists .
The presence of a hot journal is our indication that a previous process was trying to commit a transaction but it aborted for some reason prior to the completion of the commit .
A hot journal means that the database file is in an inconsistent state and needs to be repaired ( by rollback ) prior to being used .
4.3 . Obtaining An Exclusive Lock On The Database
The first step toward dealing with a hot journal is to obtain an exclusive lock on the database file .
This prevents two or more processes from trying to rollback the same hot journal at the same time .
4.4 . Rolling Back Incomplete Changes
Once a process obtains an exclusive lock , it is permitted to write to the database file .
It then proceeds to read the original content of pages out of the rollback journal and write that content back to where it came from in the database file .
Recall that the header of the rollback journal records the original size of the database file prior to the start of the aborted transaction .
SQLite uses this information to truncate the database file back to its original size in cases where the incomplete transaction caused the database to grow .
At the end of this step , the database should be the same size and contain the same information as it did before the start of the aborted transaction .
4.5 . Deleting The Hot Journal
After all information in the rollback journal has been played back into the database file ( and flushed to disk in case we encounter yet another power failure ) , the hot rollback journal can be deleted .
As in section 3.11 , the journal file might be truncated to zero length or its header might be overwritten with zeros as an optimization on systems where deleting a file is expensive .
Either way , the journal is no longer hot after this step .
4.6 . Continue As If The Uncompleted Writes Had Never Happened
The final recovery step is to reduce the exclusive lock back to a shared lock .
Once this happens , the database is back in the state that it would have been if the aborted transaction had never started .
Since all of this recovery activity happens completely automatically and transparently , it appears to the program using SQLite as if the aborted transaction had never begun .
5. Multi-file Commit
SQLite allows a single database connection to talk to two or more database files simultaneously through the use of the ATTACH DATABASE command .
When multiple database files are modified within a single transaction , all files are updated atomically .
In other words , either all of the database files are updated or else none of them are .
Achieving an atomic commit across multiple database files is more complex that doing so for a single file .
This section describes how SQLite works that bit of magic .
5.1 . Separate Rollback Journals For Each Database
When multiple database files are involved in a transaction , each database has its own rollback journal and each database is locked separately .
The diagram at the right shows a scenario where three different database files have been modified within one transaction .
The situation at this step is analogous to the single - file transaction scenario at step 3.6 .
Each database file has a reserved lock .
For each database , the original content of pages that are being changed have been written into the rollback journal for that database , but the content of the journals have not yet been flushed to disk .
No changes have been made to the database file itself yet , though presumably there are changes being held in user memory .
For brevity , the diagrams in this section are simplified from those that came before .
Blue color still signifies original content and pink still signifies new content .
But the individual pages in the rollback journal and the database file are not shown and we are not making the distinction between information in the operating system cache and information that is on disk .
All of these factors still apply in a multi- file commit scenario .
They just take up a lot of space in the diagrams and they do not add any new information , so they are omitted here .
5.2 . The Super - Journal File
The next step in a multi- file commit is the creation of a " super- journal " file .
The name of the super - journal file is the same name as the original database filename ( the database that was opened using the sqlite3_open ( ) interface , not one of the ATTACHed auxiliary databases ) with the text " - mjHHHHHHHH " appended where HHHHHHHH is a random 32 - bit hexadecimal number .
The random HHHHHHHH suffix changes for every new super - journal .
( Nota bene :
The formula for computing the super - journal filename given in the previous paragraph corresponds to the implementation as of SQLite version 3.5.0 .
But this formula is not part of the SQLite specification and is subject to change in future releases . )
Unlike the rollback journals , the super - journal does not contain any original database page content .
Instead , the super - journal contains the full pathnames for rollback journals for every database that is participating in the transaction .
After the super - journal is constructed , its content is flushed to disk before any further actions are taken .
On Unix , the directory that contains the super - journal is also synced in order to make sure the super - journal file will appear in the directory following a power failure .
The purpose of the super - journal is to ensure that multi- file transactions are atomic across a power - loss .
But if the database files have other settings that compromise integrity across a power - loss event ( such as PRAGMA synchronous=OFF or PRAGMA journal_mode=MEMORY ) then the creation of the super - journal is omitted , as an optimization .
5.3 . Updating Rollback Journal Headers
The next step is to record the full pathname of the super - journal file in the header of every rollback journal .
Space to hold the super - journal filename was reserved at the beginning of each rollback journal as the rollback journals were created .
The content of each rollback journal is flushed to disk both before and after the super - journal filename is written into the rollback journal header .
It is important to do both of these flushes .
Fortunately , the second flush is usually inexpensive since typically only a single page of the journal file ( the first page ) has changed .
This step is analogous to step 3.7 in the single - file commit scenario described above .
5.4 . Updating The Database Files
Once all rollback journal files have been flushed to disk , it is safe to begin updating database files .
We have to obtain an exclusive lock on all database files before writing the changes .
After all the changes are written , it is important to flush the changes to disk so that they will be preserved in the event of a power failure or operating system crash .
This step corresponds to steps 3.8 , 3.9 , and 3.10 in the single - file commit scenario described previously .
5.5 . Delete The Super - Journal File
The next step is to delete the super - journal file .
This is the point where the multi- file transaction commits .
This step corresponds to step 3.11 in the single - file commit scenario where the rollback journal is deleted .
If a power failure or operating system crash occurs at this point , the transaction will not rollback when the system reboots even though there are rollback journals present .
The difference is the super - journal pathname in the header of the rollback journal .
Upon restart , SQLite only considers a journal to be hot and will only playback the journal if there is no super - journal filename in the header ( which is the case for a single - file commit ) or if the super - journal file still exists on disk .
5.6 . Clean Up The Rollback Journals
The final step in a multi- file commit is to delete the individual rollback journals and drop the exclusive locks on the database files so that other processes can see the changes .
This corresponds to step 3.12 in the single - file commit sequence .
The transaction has already committed at this point so timing is not critical in the deletion of the rollback journals .
The current implementation deletes a single rollback journal then unlocks the corresponding database file before proceeding to the next rollback journal .
But in the future we might change this so that all rollback journals are deleted before any database files are unlocked .
As long as the rollback journal is deleted before its corresponding database file is unlocked it does not matter in what order the rollback journals are deleted or the database files are unlocked .
6. Additional Details Of The Commit Process
Section 3.0 above provides an overview of how atomic commit works in SQLite .
But it glosses over a number of important details .
The following subsections will attempt to fill in the gaps .
6.1 . Always Journal Complete Sectors
When the original content of a database page is written into the rollback journal ( as shown in section 3.5 ) , SQLite always writes a complete sector of data , even if the page size of the database is smaller than the sector size .
Historically , the sector size in SQLite has been hard coded to 512 bytes and since the minimum page size is also 512 bytes , this has never been an issue .
But beginning with SQLite version 3.3.14 , it is possible for SQLite to use mass storage devices with a sector size larger than 512 bytes .
So , beginning with version 3.3.14 , whenever any page within a sector is written into the journal file , all pages in that same sector are stored with it .
It is important to store all pages of a sector in the rollback journal in order to prevent database corruption following a power loss while writing the sector .
Suppose that pages 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are all stored in sector 1 and that page 2 is modified .
In order to write the changes to page 2 , the underlying hardware must also rewrite the content of pages 1 , 3 , and 4 since the hardware must write the complete sector .
If this write operation is interrupted by a power outage , one or more of the pages 1 , 3 , or 4 might be left with incorrect data .
Hence , to avoid lasting corruption to the database , the original content of all of those pages must be contained in the rollback journal .
6.2 . Dealing With Garbage Written Into Journal Files
When data is appended to the end of the rollback journal , SQLite normally makes the pessimistic assumption that the file is first extended with invalid " garbage " data and that afterwards the correct data replaces the garbage .
In other words , SQLite assumes that the file size is increased first and then afterwards the content is written into the file .
If a power failure occurs after the file size has been increased but before the file content has been written , the rollback journal can be left containing garbage data .
If after power is restored , another SQLite process sees the rollback journal containing the garbage data and tries to roll it back into the original database file , it might copy some of the garbage into the database file and thus corrupt the database file .
SQLite uses two defenses against this problem .
In the first place , SQLite records the number of pages in the rollback journal in the header of the rollback journal .
This number is initially zero .
So during an attempt to rollback an incomplete ( and possibly corrupt ) rollback journal , the process doing the rollback will see that the journal contains zero pages and will thus make no changes to the database .
Prior to a commit , the rollback journal is flushed to disk to ensure that all content has been synced to disk and there is no " garbage " left in the file , and only then is the page count in the header changed from zero to true number of pages in the rollback journal .
The rollback journal header is always kept in a separate sector from any page data so that it can be overwritten and flushed without risking damage to a data page if a power outage occurs .
Notice that the rollback journal is flushed to disk twice : once to write the page content and a second time to write the page count in the header .
The previous paragraph describes what happens when the synchronous pragma setting is " full " .
PRAGMA synchronous=FULL ;
The default synchronous setting is full so the above is what usually happens .
However , if the synchronous setting is lowered to " normal " , SQLite only flushes the rollback journal once , after the page count has been written .
This carries a risk of corruption because it might happen that the modified ( non-zero ) page count reaches the disk surface before all of the data does .
The data will have been written first , but SQLite assumes that the underlying filesystem can reorder write requests and that the page count can be burned into oxide first even though its write request occurred last .
So as a second line of defense , SQLite also uses a 32 - bit checksum on every page of data in the rollback journal .
This checksum is evaluated for each page during rollback while rolling back a journal as described in section 4.4 .
If an incorrect checksum is seen , the rollback is abandoned .
Note that the checksum does not guarantee that the page data is correct since there is a small but finite probability that the checksum might be right even if the data is corrupt .
But the checksum does at least make such an error unlikely .
Note that the checksums in the rollback journal are not necessary if the synchronous setting is FULL .
We only depend on the checksums when synchronous is lowered to NORMAL .
Nevertheless , the checksums never hurt and so they are included in the rollback journal regardless of the synchronous setting .
6.3 . Cache Spill Prior To Commit
The commit process shown in section 3.0 assumes that all database changes fit in memory until it is time to commit .
This is the common case .
But sometimes a larger change will overflow the user - space cache prior to transaction commit .
In those cases , the cache must spill to the database before the transaction is complete .
At the beginning of a cache spill , the status of the database connection is as shown in step 3.6 .
Original page content has been saved in the rollback journal and modifications of the pages exist in user memory .
To spill the cache , SQLite executes steps 3.7 through 3.9 .
In other words , the rollback journal is flushed to disk , an exclusive lock is acquired , and changes are written into the database .
But the remaining steps are deferred until the transaction really commits .
A new journal header is appended to the end of the rollback journal ( in its own sector ) and the exclusive database lock is retained , but otherwise processing returns to step 3.6 .
When the transaction commits , or if another cache spill occurs , steps 3.7 and 3.9 are repeated .
( Step 3.8 is omitted on second and subsequent passes since an exclusive database lock is already held due to the first pass . )
A cache spill causes the lock on the database file to escalate from reserved to exclusive .
This reduces concurrency .
A cache spill also causes extra disk flush or fsync operations to occur and these operations are slow , hence a cache spill can seriously reduce performance .
For these reasons a cache spill is avoided whenever possible .
7. Optimizations
Profiling indicates that for most systems and in most circumstances SQLite spends most of its time doing disk I/O .
It follows then that anything we can do to reduce the amount of disk I/O will likely have a large positive impact on the performance of SQLite .
This section describes some of the techniques used by SQLite to try to reduce the amount of disk I/O to a minimum while still preserving atomic commit .
7.1 . Cache Retained Between Transactions
Step 3.12 of the commit process shows that once the shared lock has been released , all user - space cache images of database content must be discarded .
This is done because without a shared lock , other processes are free to modify the database file content and so any user - space image of that content might become obsolete .
Consequently , each new transaction would begin by rereading data which had previously been read .
This is not as bad as it sounds at first since the data being read is still likely in the operating systems file cache .
So the " read " is really just a copy of data from kernel space into user space .
But even so , it still takes time .
Beginning with SQLite version 3.3.14 a mechanism has been added to try to reduce the needless rereading of data .
In newer versions of SQLite , the data in the user - space pager cache is retained when the lock on the database file is released .
Later , after the shared lock is acquired at the beginning of the next transaction , SQLite checks to see if any other process has modified the database file .
If the database has been changed in any way since the lock was last released , the user - space cache is erased at that point .
But commonly the database file is unchanged and the user - space cache can be retained , and some unnecessary read operations can be avoided .
In order to determine whether or not the database file has changed , SQLite uses a counter in the database header ( in bytes 24 through 27 ) which is incremented during every change operation .
SQLite saves a copy of this counter prior to releasing its database lock .
Then after acquiring the next database lock it compares the saved counter value against the current counter value and erases the cache if the values are different , or reuses the cache if they are the same .
7.2 . Exclusive Access Mode
SQLite version 3.3.14 adds the concept of " Exclusive Access Mode " .
In exclusive access mode , SQLite retains the exclusive database lock at the conclusion of each transaction .
This prevents other processes from accessing the database , but in many deployments only a single process is using a database so this is not a serious problem .
The advantage of exclusive access mode is that disk I/O can be reduced in three ways :
It is not necessary to increment the change counter in the database header for transactions after the first transaction .
This will often save a write of page one to both the rollback journal and the main database file .
No other processes can change the database so there is never a need to check the change counter and clear the user - space cache at the beginning of a transaction .
Each transaction can be committed by overwriting the rollback journal header with zeros rather than deleting the journal file .
This avoids having to modify the directory entry for the journal file and it avoids having to deallocate disk sectors associated with the journal .
Furthermore , the next transaction will overwrite existing journal file content rather than append new content and on most systems overwriting is much faster than appending .
The third optimization , zeroing the journal file header rather than deleting the rollback journal file , does not depend on holding an exclusive lock at all times .
This optimization can be set independently of exclusive lock mode using the journal_mode pragma as described in section 7.6 below .
7.3 . Do Not Journal Freelist Pages
When information is deleted from an SQLite database , the pages used to hold the deleted information are added to a " freelist " .
Subsequent inserts will draw pages off of this freelist rather than expanding the database file .
Some freelist pages contain critical data ; specifically the locations of other freelist pages .
But most freelist pages contain nothing useful .
These latter freelist pages are called " leaf " pages .
We are free to modify the content of a leaf freelist page in the database without changing the meaning of the database in any way .
Because the content of leaf freelist pages is unimportant , SQLite avoids storing leaf freelist page content in the rollback journal in step 3.5 of the commit process .
If a leaf freelist page is changed and that change does not get rolled back during a transaction recovery , the database is not harmed by the omission .
Similarly , the content of a new freelist page is never written back into the database at step 3.9 nor read from the database at step 3.3 .
These optimizations can greatly reduce the amount of I/O that occurs when making changes to a database file that contains free space .
Beginning in SQLite version 3.5.0 , the new Virtual File System ( VFS ) interface contains a method named xDeviceCharacteristics which reports on special properties that the underlying mass storage device might have .
Among the special properties that xDeviceCharacteristics might report is the ability of to do an atomic sector write .
Recall that by default SQLite assumes that sector writes are linear but not atomic .
A linear write starts at one end of the sector and changes information byte by byte until it gets to the other end of the sector .
If a power loss occurs in the middle of a linear write then part of the sector might be modified while the other end is unchanged .
In an atomic sector write , either the entire sector is overwritten or else nothing in the sector is changed .
We believe that most modern disk drives implement atomic sector writes .
When power is lost , the drive uses energy stored in capacitors and / or the angular momentum of the disk platter to provide power to complete any operation in progress .
Nevertheless , there are so many layers in between the write system call and the on - board disk drive electronics that we take the safe approach in both Unix and w32 VFS implementations and assume that sector writes are not atomic .
On the other hand , device manufacturers with more control over their filesystems might want to consider enabling the atomic write property of xDeviceCharacteristics if their hardware really does do atomic writes .
When sector writes are atomic and the page size of a database is the same as a sector size , and when there is a database change that only touches a single database page , then SQLite skips the whole journaling and syncing process and simply writes the modified page directly into the database file .
The change counter in the first page of the database file is modified separately since no harm is done if power is lost before the change counter can be updated .
7.5 . Filesystems With Safe Append Semantics
Another optimization introduced in SQLite version 3.5.0 makes use of " safe append " behavior of the underlying disk .
Recall that SQLite assumes that when data is appended to a file ( specifically to the rollback journal ) that the size of the file is increased first and that the content is written second .
So if power is lost after the file size is increased but before the content is written , the file is left containing invalid " garbage " data .
The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the VFS might , however , indicate that the filesystem implements " safe append " semantics .
This means that the content is written before the file size is increased so that it is impossible for garbage to be introduced into the rollback journal by a power loss or system crash .
When safe append semantics are indicated for a filesystem , SQLite always stores the special value of - 1 for the page count in the header of the rollback journal .
The - 1 page count value tells any process attempting to rollback the journal that the number of pages in the journal should be computed from the journal size .
This - 1 value is never changed .
So that when a commit occurs , we save a single flush operation and a sector write of the first page of the journal file .
Furthermore , when a cache spill occurs we no longer need to append a new journal header to the end of the journal ; we can simply continue appending new pages to the end of the existing journal .
7.6 . Persistent Rollback Journals
Deleting a file is an expensive operation on many systems .
So as an optimization , SQLite can be configured to avoid the delete operation of section 3.11 .
Instead of deleting the journal file in order to commit a transaction , the file is either truncated to zero bytes in length or its header is overwritten with zeros .
Truncating the file to zero length saves having to make modifications to the directory containing the file since the file is not removed from the directory .
Overwriting the header has the additional savings of not having to update the length of the file ( in the " inode " on many systems ) and not having to deal with newly freed disk sectors .
Furthermore , at the next transaction the journal will be created by overwriting existing content rather than appending new content onto the end of a file , and overwriting is often much faster than appending .
SQLite can be configured to commit transactions by overwriting the journal header with zeros instead of deleting the journal file by setting the " PERSIST " journaling mode using the journal_mode PRAGMA .
For example :
PRAGMA journal_mode=PERSIST ;
The use of persistent journal mode provides a noticeable performance improvement on many systems .
Of course , the drawback is that the journal files remain on the disk , using disk space and cluttering directories , long after the transaction commits .
The only safe way to delete a persistent journal file is to commit a transaction with journaling mode set to DELETE :
PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE
; BEGIN EXCLUSIVE ; COMMIT ;
Beware of deleting persistent journal files by any other means since the journal file might be hot , in which case deleting it will corrupt the corresponding database file .
Beginning in SQLite version 3.6.4 ( 2008 - 10 - 15 ) , the TRUNCATE journal mode is also supported :
PRAGMA journal_mode=TRUNCATE ;
In truncate journal mode , the transaction is committed by truncating the journal file to zero length rather than deleting the journal file ( as in DELETE mode ) or by zeroing the header ( as in PERSIST mode ) .
TRUNCATE mode shares the advantage of PERSIST mode that the directory that contains the journal file and database does not need to be updated .
Hence truncating a file is often faster than deleting it .
TRUNCATE has the additional advantage that it is not followed by a system call ( ex : fsync ( ) ) to synchronize the change to disk .
It might be safer if it did .
But on many modern filesystems , a truncate is an atomic and synchronous operation and so we think that TRUNCATE will usually be safe in the face of power failures .
If you are uncertain about whether or not TRUNCATE will be synchronous and atomic on your filesystem and it is important to you that your database survive a power loss or operating system crash that occurs during the truncation operation , then you might consider using a different journaling mode .
On embedded systems with synchronous filesystems , TRUNCATE results in slower behavior than PERSIST .
The commit operation is the same speed .
But subsequent transactions are slower following a TRUNCATE because it is faster to overwrite existing content than to append to the end of a file .
New journal file entries will always be appended following a TRUNCATE but will usually overwrite with PERSIST .
8. Testing Atomic Commit Behavior
The developers of SQLite are confident that it is robust in the face of power failures and system crashes because the automatic test procedures do extensive checks on the ability of SQLite to recover from simulated power loss .
We call these the " crash tests " .
Crash tests in SQLite use a modified VFS that can simulate the kinds of filesystem damage that occur during a power loss or operating system crash .
The crash - test VFS can simulate incomplete sector writes , pages filled with garbage data because a write has not completed , and out of order writes , all occurring at varying points during a test scenario .
Crash tests execute transactions over and over , varying the time at which a simulated power loss occurs and the properties of the damage inflicted .
Each test then reopens the database after the simulated crash and verifies that the transaction either occurred completely or not at all and that the database is in a completely consistent state .
The crash tests in SQLite have discovered a number of very subtle bugs ( now fixed ) in the recovery mechanism .
Some of these bugs were very obscure and unlikely to have been found using only code inspection and analysis techniques .
From this experience , the developers of SQLite feel confident that any other database system that does not use a similar crash test system likely contains undetected bugs that will lead to database corruption following a system crash or power failure .
9 . Things That Can Go Wrong
The atomic commit mechanism in SQLite has proven to be robust , but it can be circumvented by a sufficiently creative adversary or a sufficiently broken operating system implementation .
This section describes a few of the ways in which an SQLite database might be corrupted by a power failure or system crash .
( See also : How To Corrupt Your Database Files . )
9.1 . Broken Locking Implementations
SQLite uses filesystem locks to make sure that only one process and database connection is trying to modify the database at a time .
The filesystem locking mechanism is implemented in the VFS layer and is different for every operating system .
SQLite depends on this implementation being correct .
If something goes wrong and two or more processes are able to write the same database file at the same time , severe damage can result .
We have received reports of implementations of both Windows network filesystems and NFS in which locking was subtly broken .
We can not verify these reports , but as locking is difficult to get right on a network filesystem we have no reason to doubt them .
You are advised to avoid using SQLite on a network filesystem in the first place , since performance will be slow .
But if you must use a network filesystem to store SQLite database files , consider using a secondary locking mechanism to prevent simultaneous writes to the same database even if the native filesystem locking mechanism malfunctions .
The versions of SQLite that come preinstalled on Apple Mac OS X computers contain a version of SQLite that has been extended to use alternative locking strategies that work on all network filesystems that Apple supports .
These extensions used by Apple work great as long as all processes are accessing the database file in the same way .
Unfortunately , the locking mechanisms do not exclude one another , so if one process is accessing a file using ( for example ) AFP locking and another process ( perhaps on a different machine ) is using dot - file locks , the two processes might collide because AFP locks do not exclude dot - file locks or vice versa .
9.2 . Incomplete Disk Flushes
SQLite uses the fsync ( ) system call on Unix and the FlushFileBuffers ( ) system call on w32 in order to sync the file system buffers onto disk oxide as shown in step 3.7 and step 3.10 .
Unfortunately , we have received reports that neither of these interfaces works as advertised on many systems .
We hear that FlushFileBuffers ( ) can be completely disabled using registry settings on some Windows versions .
Some historical versions of Linux contain versions of fsync ( ) which are no -ops on some filesystems , we are told .
Even on systems where FlushFileBuffers ( ) and fsync ( ) are said to be working , often the IDE disk control lies and says that data has reached oxide while it is still held only in the volatile control cache .
On the Mac , you can set this pragma :
PRAGMA fullfsync=ON ;
Setting fullfsync on a Mac will guarantee that data really does get pushed out to the disk platter on a flush .
But the implementation of fullfsync involves resetting the disk controller .
And so not only is it profoundly slow , it also slows down other unrelated disk I /O .
So its use is not recommended .
9.3 . Partial File Deletions
SQLite assumes that file deletion is an atomic operation from the point of view of a user process .
If power fails in the middle of a file deletion , then after power is restored SQLite expects to see either the entire file with all of its original data intact , or it expects not to find the file at all .
Transactions may not be atomic on systems that do not work this way .
9.4 . Garbage Written Into Files
SQLite database files are ordinary disk files that can be opened and written by ordinary user processes .
A rogue process can open an SQLite database and fill it with corrupt data .
Corrupt data might also be introduced into an SQLite database by bugs in the operating system or disk controller ; especially bugs triggered by a power failure .
There is nothing SQLite can do to defend against these kinds of problems .
9.5 . Deleting Or Renaming A Hot Journal
If a crash or power loss does occur and a hot journal is left on the disk , it is essential that the original database file and the hot journal remain on disk with their original names until the database file is opened by another SQLite process and rolled back .
During recovery at step 4.2 SQLite locates the hot journal by looking for a file in the same directory as the database being opened and whose name is derived from the name of the file being opened .
If either the original database file or the hot journal have been moved or renamed , then the hot journal will not be seen and the database will not be rolled back .
We suspect that a common failure mode for SQLite recovery happens like this : A power failure occurs .
After power is restored , a well - meaning user or system administrator begins looking around on the disk for damage .
They see their database file named " important.data " .
This file is perhaps familiar to them .
But after the crash , there is also a hot journal named " important.data - journal " .
The user then deletes the hot journal , thinking that they are helping to cleanup the system .
We know of no way to prevent this other than user education .
If there are multiple ( hard or symbolic ) links to a database file , the journal will be created using the name of the link through which the file was opened .
If a crash occurs and the database is opened again using a different link , the hot journal will not be located and no rollback will occur .
Sometimes a power failure will cause a filesystem to be corrupted such that recently changed filenames are forgotten and the file is moved into a " / lost + found " directory .
When that happens , the hot journal will not be found and recovery will not occur .
SQLite tries to prevent this by opening and syncing the directory containing the rollback journal at the same time it syncs the journal file itself .
However , the movement of files into / lost + found can be caused by unrelated processes creating unrelated files in the same directory as the main database file .
And since this is out from under the control of SQLite , there is nothing that SQLite can do to prevent it .
If you are running on a system that is vulnerable to this kind of filesystem namespace corruption ( most modern journalling filesystems are immune , we believe ) then you might want to consider putting each SQLite database file in its own private subdirectory .
10 . 10.0 Future Directions And Conclusion
Every now and then someone discovers a new failure mode for the atomic commit mechanism in SQLite and the developers have to put in a patch .
This is happening less and less and the failure modes are becoming more and more obscure .
But it would still be foolish to suppose that the atomic commit logic of SQLite is entirely bug - free .
The developers are committed to fixing these bugs as quickly as they might be found .
The developers are also on the lookout for new ways to optimize the commit mechanism .
The current VFS implementations for Unix ( Linux and Mac OS X ) and Windows make pessimistic assumptions about the behavior of those systems .
After consultation with experts on how these systems work , we might be able to relax some of the assumptions on these systems and allow them to run faster .
In particular , we suspect that most modern filesystems exhibit the safe append property and that many of them might support atomic sector writes .
But until this is known for certain , SQLite will take the conservative approach and assume the worst .
The New South Wales Government is under fire over reports a Sydney high school scanned its students ' fingerprints without parental consent .
Ku-ring - gai High School , in north Sydney , reportedly scanned all of its students ' fingerprints for a new attendance monitoring scheme , even after some parents asked for their children to be exempt .
The Australian newspaper reports parents who complained were told the data would only be deleted if there were still objections later .
State Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell says the NSW Government has mismanaged the program since the beginning .
" [ Premier ] Morris Iemma needs to explain why this controversial scheme has never been publicly announced by his Government , " he said .
" Very little happens in schools that the Department of Education does n't oversight .
" The Department of Education claims that if parents do n't want their children to participate in this high school fingerprinting scheme , those students can opt out .
" Here we have claims again that students are being forced to participate . "
' Benefit of the doubt '
State Education Minister John Della Bosca says he will be speaking to the school involved before making any judgement about its actions .
Mr Della Bosca says departmental guidelines clearly state that parents must give consent before their children 's fingerprints are scanned .
" Today , we 'll be speaking with the school , unlike Mr O'Farrell , who 's scoring cheap political points against his local school , " he said .
" I think the school deserves the opportunity to explain and the parents and citizens deserve the benefit of the doubt . "
He says fingerprint scanning can be a useful tool for schools to keep track of attendance if it is done properly .
" You have to understand that education for people of compulsory schooling age is compulsory and schools do have an obligation to keep an accurate roll of attendance , " he said .

BBC News , Ayacucho , Peru
Peruvians are very proud of their potatoes
At harvest time in the highland village of Paucho , the first crop of potatoes are baked in a hole in the ground covered with hot rocks , in a ceremony called Watia - a homage to Pacha Mama , or Mother Earth .
For thousands of years , the potato has been the staple diet of the people of the Andes .
It was first cultivated on the Altiplano of modern - day Peru and Bolivia , and Peru still has some 2,800 varieties of potato , more than any other country .
Like many people , I took the humble spud for granted , but after the launch of the UN Year of the Potato in Ayacucho in the Peruvian Andes , I am repentant at my lack of reverence for the third biggest food staple in the world .
Boost consumption I have never seen a vegetable invoke such high passions and poetry .
It was the theme for a seamless succession of carnival floats , colourful costumes , and traditional dance and music .
All this was punctuated by cries of " la papa es Peruana " - " the potato is Peruvian " , just in case anyone forgot .
Despite this , consumption of the potato in Peru has dropped to half that of many European countries , with many Peruvians turning to rice or bread .
Many potato - producing communities are very poor
But internationally high food prices , especially wheat - 80 % of which is imported in Peru - are causing hardship for the country 's poor , who make up almost half the population .
Peru 's agriculture minister , Ismael Benavides , says the native potato is the answer .
The government is trying to boost its consumption by encouraging more people to eat bread baked with potato flour , starting with schoolchildren and prisoners .
" When I went to the UN in October to launch the International Year of the Potato somebody from an Eastern European country , Ukraine I think , said to me ' I did n't realise that potatoes came from Peru ' .
That showed me that we had to claim our place , " Mr Benavides said at the festival .
" The potato is very important in the diet worldwide and in this age of rising commodity prices ... a number of countries , such as China and India , are looking to double or triple their production . "
Marketing tactics Can Peru benefit from this projected surge in consumption ?
" The paradox that we find today is that it is precisely those communities which have developed and given the world the potato are some of the poorest communities in the Andean chain , " says Pamela Anderson , director of the International Potato Centre , based in Lima .
" So part of what we do at the International Potato Centre is to take the native potato and really begin seriously and systematically marketing it , so that these small , poor farmers can use the native potato as a pathway out of poverty . "
Nowadays we eat potatoes every day in my family
Hermelinda Azurin
The International Potato Centre is working with the government to drive the internal consumption of native potatoes , which come in a rich variety of colours , shapes and flavours .
The idea is not only to help poor rural communities , but also the 70 % of Peru 's population that lives in urban centres .
" The price of bread has gone up and I just do n't have the money to buy it as I used to , " says Hermelinda Azurin , who supports her two daughters working as a maid in Lima .
" A kilo of potato bread is 3.4 soles ( $ 1.16 ) whereas normal bread has gone up to 5.40 soles ( $ 1.84 ) in my neighbourhood .
A kilo of potatoes is just 70 centimos ( $ 0.23 ) .
Nowadays we eat potatoes every day in my family . "
The Peruvian government is also looking at exporting native potatoes .
They are exotic - looking , organic and have vitamins and amino acids that regular white potatoes do not have .
" We feel the quality of this product should have a market abroad , especially as we are opening markets with the US , Canada and we hope soon with the European Union , " says Mr Benavides .
" These would fall under what is called fair trade , so we feel there 's great opportunities for these potatoes , native in particular . "
' Infinite variety '
But it is precisely those new markets and free trade deals which many Peruvian farmers believe will mean they will have to compete unfairly with agricultural imports .
Mario Tapia , an agronomist who specialises in Andean crops , says a lack of investment in infrastructure is one part of the problem .
Colourful potatoes are seen as a gastronomic treat abroad " The potato yields are not so high because there is not high investment in the production , so to compete with farmers who have subsidies in their own countries will not be fair for those farmers in the highlands , " he says .
With or without an export market , the government plans to boost the internal potato market and give technical assistance to the 1.8 m potato growers in Peru .
In the gastronomic world , the native potato has enthusiastic advocates .
Peruvian restaurateur Isabel Alvarez says its " infinite variety of colours , textures , shapes and flavours " has prompted positive reactions in Europe .
" The potato is a world in itself , and it is a gastronomic world which we 've only begun to explore , " she says .
With gastronomic plaudits and its spiritual place in Andean culture assured , the question remains : can Peru 's gift to the world now be used to help those who gave it to us in the first place ?

TORONTO ( Reuters Life ! ) - Toronto ’s CN
Tower may no longer be the tallest free - standing structure in the world but it has another unusual feature -- a glass - floored elevator that travels 1,135 feet in a dizzying 58 - second journey .
A woman stands on the new glass floor panelled elevator in the CN Tower in Toronto in this photo released on April 9 , 2008 .
REUTERS /CN
Tower / Handout
“ We like to reinvent ourselves and come up with something new and exciting every year , ” Jack Robinson , chief operating officer of the CN Tower , said about the lift that is billed as the world ’s No. 1 elevator ride .
Three of the tower ’s six glass - fronted elevators will have glass floors by the end of the year .
But Robinson said people afraid of heights and speed should not worry .
“ It ’s very safe and secure , you can stand at the back , ” he explained .
The lift operator can also flip a switch and transform the glass floor panel into an opaque white surface .
The panels were designed with the same technology used to create the glass floor inside the tower , which was installed in 1994 .
The structure , built by Canadian National Railways in 1976 as a telecommunications tower , is facing competition as the tallest building from the Burj Dubai , a tower under construction in Dubai .
The Burj Dubai announced it had surpassed the height of the CN Tower in September 2007 when it reached 1,821 feet ( 555 meters ) .
Its projected completion is slated for 2009 .
At 1,815 feet , the CN Tower Web site proclaims it is the world ’s tallest building .
But Robinson says the idea for the glass - floored elevator was n’t inspired by a desire to compete with the Burj Dubai .
Once the Burj Dubai is finished , its height status will be clear , he said .
“ I am not turning the baton over just yet , but when the time comes I will , and if that happens this year , that ’ll be 32 years with the record , ” he added .

There ’s always somebody trying to outdo somebody . ”
New Yorker suggests Rice as McCain's VP RAW STORY
Published : Monday March 10 , 2008

Print This Email This Rice ' could deflect Obama / Clinton attacks '
The New Yorker 's Hendrik Hertzberg makes the case for Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) to pick an unlikely ally in his bid for the presidency : Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
" If McCain really wants to have it all to refurbish his maverick image without having to flip - flop on the panderings that have tarnished it ; to galvanize the attention of the press , the nation , and the world ; to make a bold play for the center without seriously alienating  the base then he can avail himself of a highly interesting option : Condoleezza Rice . "
Rice , he says , would saddle McCain with the legacy of the Iraq war .
McCain , however , has already been a staunch defender of the war -- so it might not hurt him as much .
" Rice would fit nicely into McCains view of the war as worth fighting but , until Donald Rumsfelds exit from the Pentagon , fought clumsily , " he writes .
" And it would be fairly easy to establish a story line that would cast Rice as having been less Bushs enabler than a loyal subordinate who nevertheless pushed gently from within for a more reasonable , more diplomatic approach . "
" Her nomination to a constitutional executive office would cost McCain the votes of his partys hardened racists and incorrigible misogynists .
They are surely fewer in number , though , than the people who would like to participate in breaking the glass ceiling of race or gender but , given the choice , would rather do so in a more timid way , and / or without abandoning their party , " he adds .
" And with Rice on the ticket the Republicans could attack Clinton or Obama with far less restraint . "
Even so , Hertzberg says Rice 's " record in office has been one of failure , from downgrading terrorism as a priority before 9/11 to ignoring the Israel - Palestine problem until ( almost certainly ) too late . "
" But this does not seem to have done much damage to her popularity , " he notes .
" In a Washington Post - ABC News poll taken when opposition to the Iraq war was approaching its height , she enjoyed a  favorable - unfavorable  rating of nearly two to one . "
" Choosing Rice would be a trick , " he concludes .
" Her failures would be buried in an avalanche of positive publicity for a personal story as yet only vaguely known to the broad public .
( One of the little girls who died in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing was her playmate ?
We didnt know that !)
But the trick would not be an entirely cynical one .
Her ascension , though nowhere near as momentous a breakthrough as the election of Obama or Clinton , would be a breakthrough all the same .
In this connection , a kind word for George W. Bush may be in order .
By appointing first Colin Powell and then Rice to the most senior job in the Cabinet , a job of global scope , Bush changed the way millions of white Americans think about black public officials .
This may turn out to the most positive legacy of his benighted Presidency . "
Over the past 6 years or so , I ’ve failed each item on “ The Turkey Test . ”
It ’s very simple : will your code work properly on a person ’s machine in or around the country of Turkey ?
Take this simple test .
Parsing dates from a configuration file using DateTime .
Parse ( string ) : Does it pass “ The Turkey Test ? ” Nope : Reason : Turkish people write July 4th , 2008 as “ 04.07.2008 ” Fix : Always specify what format your date is in .
In this case , we use a DateTimeFormat .
InvariantInfo which just happens to be USA English ’s format ( more or less ) :
Which gives us what we were expecting : Scott Hanselman likes to talk about DateTimes .
( Be sure to see his DateTime interview question ) .
Ok , ok .
You knew about dates .
I sort of did , but I still got it wrong the first few times .
What about this seemingly simple piece of code : Does it pass “ The Turkey Test ? ” Nope : Reason : Turkish people use a period to group digits ( like people in the USA use a comma ) .
Instead of getting a 4.5 % discount like you intended , Turkish people will be getting at 45 % discount .
Fix : Again , always specify your format explicitly :
Which saves your company from having to go out of business from having too high of discounts :
John McCain Does n’t Have What it Takes to Beat the Democrat Nominee
Barack Obama has an insurmountable delegate lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton .
It would take a collapse of inconceivable proportions for Obama to not head into the convention with a lead in pledged delegate .
However , he is trying his best to lose this lead .
While losing this lead is improbable , there is still the real chance he will not get the nomination .
This is a scenario that I thought inconceivable just a week ago , after all how could Democrat super delegates vote against the people ’s choice ?
But that has all changed .
With Barack Obama ’s close ties to the racist , anti-American reverend , Jeremiah Wright the real possibility exists that the Democrat super delegates will turn towards Hillary Clinton because Obama will be seen as not being able to win a general election because of his ties to the deplorable reverend Wright .
The theory being floated is that the “ all caring ” Democrat opponents to Obama ( Hillary ) will need the black vote in order to win the presidency .
Because of this , Hillary ca n’t go after Obama in a big way because if she were to win the nomination at the expense of alienating the black vote , she would be unable to win the general election .
The next part of this theory is the belief that because Republicans wo n’t get a majority of the black vote anyway , the Republicans will be willing to go after Obama ’s perceived racist , anti-American pastor and in doing so will link his pastor ’s opinions to him .
In theory , this may be a possibility , but we must remember that Republicans do n’t have a real candidate in this election .
They do n’t have a candidate who is willing to “ go after ” his opponent and deliver a knock out blow .
Republicans have John McCain .
This is what happened to a John McCain staffer who posted a video of the reverend Jeremiah Wright ’s sermon .
The same video which is circulating all over the blogosphere .
From CNS
News :
A McCain campaign aide has been suspended for posting a racially charged video using the controversial words of Sen. Barack Obama ’s pastor on a blog .
“ We have been very clear on the type of campaign we intend to run and this staffer acted in violation of our policy .
He has been reprimanded by campaign leadership and suspended from the campaign , ” Jill Hazelbaker said in a statement .
The video sent by Soren Dayton to the blog - hosting site , Twitter , was described as a “ good video on Obama and Wright . ”
McCain has already said he does not hold Obama accountable for Rev. Wright ’s views .
“ What Sen . McCain has said repeatedly , is that these candidates cannot be held accountable for all the views of people who endorse them , or people who befriend them , ” McCain adviser Charlie Black said recently .
“ I do n’t think Sen. McCain wants to get in the middle of a discussion about Sen .
Obama ’s former pastor , or his faith .
He believes that people who endorse you , people who befriend you are entitled to their own views , but you are not held personally accountable . ”
There you have it , John McCain does n’t hold the words that reverend Wright used against Obama even though Obama heard these comments and kept going to these sermons for twenty years .
Surely Obama must have agreed with the words of the reverend because he kept going .
Yet McCain does n’t have the stones to call out Obama on this issue .
That is why I believe that McCain does n’t have what it takes to take on the Democrat nominee .
Design your own desktop with Xfce 4.4
Xfce is just as customisable as KDE or GNOME , so I set myself a goal : make Xubuntu look like Windows Vista .
Why ?
Because I can . 🙂
Though you wo n’t be told how to achieve the exact same end result ( Microsoft™ © ® most likely would not appreciate that ) , this guide provides comprehensive instructions helping you make Xubuntu look the way you want it to .
In any case , I would certainly not recommend such a setup for someone new to Xubuntu .
Xubuntu is different than Windows ; making it look similar is only confusing .
Panels
Since Windows comes with a total of a mere one panel , I had to remove one of Xubuntu ’s two default panels .
This task was easily done using Xfce ’s Panel Manager , which can be opened by right clicking empty space on a panel and selecting Customise Panel , or by opening Applications -> Settings -> Panel Manager .
Removing the first panel was simply a matter or clicking the - while the target panel was selected in the drop - down menu .
Most options in the panel manager are quite straightforward as long as your realize that they apply to the panel currently selected in the drop - down menu .
For my setup , I just wanted to change the size of the panel to 30 pixels and set a background image .
Wait … Did I say “ background image ” ?
There is no option in the panel manager to set a background image for your panels !
Luckily , that other Xubuntu Blog comes to the rescue .
Basically , what we will do is to override the settings of whatever GTK theme you are using to apply a background image to panels .
The disadvantage of this method is that this will be applied to all panels .
The first thing you need is , obviously , a background image to use .
It can be as much 1 pixel wide , if you like , because it will be tiled throughout the full width of the panel .
This image needs to be saved in your home directory ( e.g. /home / yourusername / ) .
You can prepend the filename with a dot .
to make it a hidden file , e.g. /home/vincent/.panelbackground.png .
Now , to apply this background image , open up a text editor like Mousepad ( Applications -> Accessories -> Mousepad ) .
You then have to open the file .gtkrc - 2.0 , but since that is a hidden file ( starting with a . ) , it is not listed among the other files .
Luckily , in the “ Open ” dialog , you can just enter .gtkrc - 2.0 in the Location field ( press Ctrl + L to make it visible if it is not ) to open it .
More likely than not , it is an empty file .
Now , paste the following into that file , obviously replacing .
panelbackground.png with the name of your background image .
style " panel "
{
bg_pixmap [ NORMAL ] = " .panelbackground.png "
fg [ NORMAL ] = " white "
}
widget_class " * Panel * " style " panel "
widget " * Panel * " style " panel "
class " * Panel * " style " panel "
Note that the fg[ NORMAL ] = " white " sets the text colour to white , but you can edit that to whatever ( supported ) colour you like , or remove the line altogether to use your theme ’s default .
And that ’s it really !
The next time you login , this image will be used as background image for your panel .
Wallpaper
Of course I also wanted to use a wallpaper similar to Vista’s .
Setting a background image for my desktop is a breeze , luckily .
All that was needed was a click on the “ browse ” icon next to the File input field to select the image of my preference .
If you want to , you can even make a list of files , of which one will be chosen each time you log in 🙂
GTK theme
Next up is changing the GTK theme , which is often one of the most notable changes because it encompasses almost everything on your screen .
Download a theme you like ( I used Murrina Aero ) and open it ( with Archive Manager ) .
Select Archive ->Extract ( or the equivalent option if you use another archive manager than Xubuntu 7.10 ’s default ) and extract it to / home / yourusername / .
themes ( again , enter . themes in the location field if it ’s invisible ) .
Then open Applications -> Settings -> User Interface Settings , where your preferred theme should now be listed in the theme list .
It will be applied when you select it .
Icon theme
Using icon themes , it is possible to change the commonly used icons .
For my Vista - like setup I selected the nuoveXT icon theme .
The process of installing an icon theme is similar to the process of installing a GTK theme .
After you have downloaded the theme , you extract it , however , this time you extract them to /home / yourusername /.icons .
Just as when changing your GTK theme , you need Applications -> Settings -> User Interface Preferences to change the icon theme .
This time , however , you switch to the Icon Theme tab ( surprise ) , where you can select the preferred icon theme in the list .
Fonts
Ultimately , I also wanted to use Microsoft ’s Segoe UI font .
Unfortunately , it can only be obtained together with a copy of Windows Vista .
However , there are plenty of other beautiful fonts available ( like Red Hat ’s Liberation fonts ) that can be installed easily .
You just need the TTF files , which you need to place in the . fonts directory .
It can then be selected , just as your GTK theme and icon theme , through Applications -> Settings -> User Interface Preferences .
Click the button below Font , where your font should be listed under Family .
Xfw m4 themes
The theming craze is n’t over yet , because you can also theme your window borders .
By default , Xubuntu ’s Window Manager is xfwm4 , which can be themed with xfw m4 themes .
First you need to find an xfw m4 theme you like .
Once you downloaded that theme , extract it to the . themes directory in your home folder .
The theme can then be easily applied using Applications -> Settings -> Window Manager Settings .
The theme should show up in the list on the left - hand side , selecting it will apply it .
Emerald themes
If you installed Compiz using Emerald as window manager , then changing window border themes is a little bit different .
First , you need to get yourself an Emerald theme .
Emerald themes are files that end in .emerald .
I picked the theme included in the Aero- clone pack , aero_blue .emerald .
To install the theme , you need to open Applications -> Settings -> Emerald Theme Manager .
Click Import … and open the .emerald file .
The theme will be selected when you click it in the list .
Conclusion
Xubuntu ( and open source desktops in general ) offers an enormous range of options allowing you to tweak the look to your own preferences .
You can make it look as ugly or as pretty as you want .
Heck , if you want to , you can make it look near pixel - perfect like another operating system !
The end result might not be perfect , but you can get very close 😀
Alcides Moreno was hurtling downward at a speed up to 124 mph , clinging to a 1,250 - pound scaffold that acted like a surfboard in the sky .
Those grappling with why he miraculously survived his plunge from the roof of a 47 - story high - rise say the aluminum platform added air resistance that slowed his descent – and blunted the tremendous force of hitting the concrete pavement in an alley below .
Maybe , experts said , a random air current rising between the Upper East Side buildings where Moreno plummeted slowed him the extra bit that spared his life .
The 37 - year - old window washer – who remains in critical condition but has moved his arms and legs and tried to open his eyes , relatives say – has amazed trauma doctors and physicists alike .
“ Fifty percent of people who fall four to five stories die .
By the time you reach 10 or 11 stories , just about everyone dies , ” said Dr. Sheldon Teperman , director of trauma and critical - care surgery at Jacobi Medical Center in The Bronx .
“ This guy absolutely should have died . ”
The tragedy occurred on Dec. 7 at about 10:15 a.m. as Moreno and his brother Edgar , 30 , employees of City Wide Window Cleaning , got ready for a day ’s work at the Solow Tower , a luxury apartment building at 265 E. 66th St. with a black - glass surface .
The workers – not yet wearing required safety harnesses – fell or were dragged off the roof when the 16 - foot - long “ swing scaffold , ” which could slide around the building , collapsed .
Officials suspect the cause was improperly secured cables , but investigations are ongoing .
Physicists theorize it was Alcides ’ training , presence of mind – or luck – that he remained atop the Louisville Ladder scaffold as it plummeted that saved him .
He landed in a tangle of cables and bent railings that may have broken his 500 - foot fall or absorbed some of the shock .
His brother slipped off the scaffold and smashed onto the top of a brick wall , which cut him in half .
In a free fall , both men would quickly have hit a maximum speed of 124 mph , or terminal velocity – the point when gravity pulling a person down is balanced by upward air friction , said James Kakaklios , a physics professor at the University of Minnesota .
But the scaffold ’s platform likely slowed Alcides ’ descent “ significantly ” by pushing the air , he said .
His landing position also could have made a huge difference .
“ If he was lying flat , not only would the scaffold act as a shock absorber , but the force to stop him would be spread more evenly over his body .
If he came down on one point , the sudden shock could easily break the back or neck , ” Kakaklios said .
He compared Alcides to people who surprisingly survived the I - 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis on Aug .
1 . Some “ rode their cars down ” the splintered bridge .
Supports underneath added air resistance and slowed its fall into the Mississippi River .
Alcides suffered blood clots in the brain , collapsed lungs , numerous broken bones , damaged kidneys and other internal injuries , relatives said .
Stefan Bright , safety director for the International Window Cleaners Association , never heard of a case like Alcides ’ , calling it “ extreme luck . ”
“ Window washers have fallen six feet and died , ” Bright said .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A 21 - year - old German man has been convicted of sending a photograph of his penis to an unknown woman via mobile phone , authorities said on Wednesday .
“ We all had a bit of a laugh when we saw the thing , ” said Christian Kropp , presiding judge at the court in the eastern town of Sondershausen .
The woman reported the sender to police after receiving the photo attachment of the man ’s genitals , the court said .
Officers found evidence he may have sent similar images to other women .
The man did not explain his motive but expressed remorse for the photo , Kropp said .
He was fined 150 euros ( $ 220 ) for distributing pornographic material .
The kilogram is losing weight and many international scientists , including some at Sandia National Laboratories , agree that it ’s time to redefine it .
Scientists are hoping to redefine the kilogram by basing it on standards of universal constants rather than on an artifact standard .
The International Prototype Kilogram ( IPK ) or “ Le Grand K , ” made in the 1880s , is a bar of platinum - iridium alloy kept in a vault near Paris .
“ The idea is to replace the single master kilogram with something based on physical constants , rather than an artifact that could be damaged accidentally , ” says mechanical engineer Hy Tran , a project leader at the Primary Standards Laboratory ( PSL ) at Sandia .
Of the seven units of measurement in the International System , or SI , the kilogram is the only base still defined by a physical object .
In addition , copies of the kilogram have changed over time by either gaining or losing weight as compared to the standard kilogram .
The purpose of redefining the kilogram is based on risk reduction , says Tran .
“ In the long term , the redefinition — especially if performed correctly — is beneficial because of risk reduction and because it may enable better measurements in the future , ” he says .
By replacing the master kilogram — Le Grand K — with a unit based on physical constants , researchers at multiple laboratories and at national measurement institutes could establish traceability , he says .
Tran says the kilogram will remain the kilogram ; it ’s only the way it will be defined that will change .
He says the earliest the kilogram would be redefined is 2011 .

“ If and when the redefinition takes place , it will be done in such a fashion as to have minimal or no practical impact with other measured quantities , ” Tran says .
“ In other words , if it is redefined so as to ensure better than 10 parts per billion agreement — rather than 20 parts per billion agreement — then we will see no major changes immediately . ”
Based on the current formal definition of the kilogram ( the mass of the 1 kilogram prototype ) and experimental dissemination to standards labs , the uncertainty ( 95 percent confidence ) in PSL ’s kilogram is about 40 parts per billion , compared to the IPK .
One part per billion is about the ratio of the area of a square 3/32 inch on a side , with respect to the area of a regulation NFL football field ( including the endzones , or 120 yards by 53 - 1/3 yards ) , Tran says .
The target originally proposed by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures ( International Bureau of Weights & Measures ) was to get one of the alternative kilogram definitions , such as the experimental measurement of force on the watt balance ( or counting atoms on the silicon sphere ) , and deriving the kilogram , matched to experimental measurements of the prototype kilogram to within 20 parts per billion .
Sandia physicist Harold Parks agrees that the redefinition of the kilogram is inevitable and says there are a couple of issues that need to be resolved before it ’s redefined .

“ The watt balance method of defining the kilogram makes the most sense for those of us in electrical metrology and so far it is the most accurate , ” he says .
“ But other proposals , such as those based on counting the number of atoms in a silicon crystal , are being considered . ”
The watt balance is based on an idea that compares electrical and mechanical power with a high degree of accuracy , he says .
Conflicts between the results of the watt balance and the atom counting experiments will also need to be resolved , Parks says .
“ The NIST ( National Institute of Standards and Technology ) watt balance experiment has achieved the accuracy needed to redefine the kilogram , but the experiment will need to be confirmed by other groups in order for the results to be fully accepted , ” he says .
Tran says redefining the kilogram will have little impact on the Primary Standards Lab or the broader nuclear weapons complex .
The lab develops and maintains primary standards traceable to national standards and calibrates and certifies customer reference standards .
“ It should not affect PSL or the complex if the international metrology community ensures that they fully consider the uncertainties , the necessary experimental apparatus to realize the kilogram , and implementation issues prior to agreeing to the redefinition , ” Tran says .
In preparation for the change , PSL staff members are staying up to date in research in metrology and standards practices .
Staff also participate in standards activities in order to ensure that any transition would be smooth .
Third Annual Movie - Plot Threat Contest
I ca n’t believe I let April 1 come and go without posting the rules to the Third Annual Movie - Plot Threat Contest .
Well , better late than never .
For this contest , the goal is to create fear .
Not just any fear , but a fear that you can alleviate through the sale of your new product idea .
There are lots of risks out there , some of them serious , some of them so unlikely that we should n’t worry about them , and some of them completely made up .
And there are lots of products out there that provide security against those risks .
Your job is to invent one .
First , find a risk or create one .
It can be a terrorism risk , a criminal risk , a natural - disaster risk , a common household risk — whatever .
The weirder the better .
Then , create a product that everyone simply has to buy to protect him - or herself from that risk .
And finally , write a catalog ad for that product .
Here ’s an example , pulled from page 25 of the Late Spring 2008 Skymall catalog I ’m reading on my airplane right now :
A Turtle is Safe in Water , A Child is Not !
Even with the most vigilant supervision a child can disappear in seconds and not be missed until it ’s too late .
Our new wireless pool safety alarm system is a must for pool owners and parents of young children .
The Turtle Wristband locks on the child ’s wrist ( a special key is required to remove it ) and instantly detects immersion in water and sounds a shrill alarm at the Base Station located in the house or within 100 feet of the pool , spa , or backyard pond .
Keep extra wristbands on hand for guests or to protect the family dog .

Carphone Warehouse 's Charles Dunstone says it is not his job to be an ' internet policeman '
Charles Dunstone
The head of one of Britain 's biggest internet providers has criticised the music industry for demanding that he act against pirates .
The trade body for UK music , the BPI , asked internet service providers to disconnect people who ignore requests to stop sharing music .
But Charles Dunstone of Carphone Warehouse , which runs the TalkTalk broadband service , is refusing .
He said it is not his job to be an internet policeman .
BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan - Jones said that the music industry has been fighting a losing battle to prevent people from swapping songs for nothing on the internet .
Mr Dunstone , whose TalkTalk broadband is Britain 's third biggest internet provider , said the demands are unreasonable and unworkable .
' No control '
He said : " Our position is very clear .
We are the conduit that gives users access to the internet .
We do not control the internet , nor do we control what our users do on the internet .
" I cannot foresee any circumstances in which we would voluntarily disconnect a customer 's account on the basis of a third party alleging a wrongdoing . "
He added the company would fight to protect the rights of its users using the law .
At the heart of this issue is ensuring that creators are fairly rewarded in the digital age
Geoff Taylor
BPI chief executive
The BPI denied it is asking ISPs to become internet police , saying the firms need to educate their customers not to steal music .
It also says that if they do not help with the fight against music piracy , then the government will bring in legislation to make them cooperate .
BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor said : " At the heart of this issue is ensuring that creators are fairly rewarded in the digital age , and we passionately believe that working in partnership with ISPs to develop first - class , safe , legal , digital music services is the way forward .
" But such a partnership can't succeed if an ISP refuses to do anything to address the problem of illegal downloading on its network . "
He added : " We believe that any socially responsible ISP should , as a core part of its business , put in place steps to help their customers avoid engaging in illegal activity , and deter those who knowingly break the law . "

Open Steve Coll ’s aptly titled book , Ghost Wars : The Secret History of the CIA , Afghanistan , and Bin Laden , from the Soviet Invasion to September 10 , 2001 , at almost any page and you ’re likely to find something that makes a mockery of the film Charlie Wilson ’s War .
There , on p. 90 , for instance , is the larger - than - life CIA director of the era , William Casey , the “ Catholic Knight of Malta educated by Jesuits , ” who “ believed fervently that by spreading the Catholic Church ’s reach and power he could contain Communism ’s advance , or reverse it . ”
And , if you could n’t have the Church do it , as in Afghanistan in the 1980s , then second best , Casey believed , were the Islamic warriors of jihad , the more extreme the better , with whom , in his religio - anticommunism , he believed himself to have much in common .
( The enemy of my enemy is my friend , after all . )
Casey was , in fact , an American jihadi , eager in the 1980s not just to defeat the Soviets in Afghanistan , but to push “ the Afghan jihad into the Soviet Union itself . ”
His CIA , while funding activities like translating the Koran into Uzbek ( Uzbekistan being , then , an SSR of the Soviet Union ) , was also , through Pakistan ’s intelligence service , funneling a vast flow of advanced weaponry regularly to the most extreme ( and , even then , anti-American ) of Afghan jihadis .
I could go on , starting perhaps with the president Casey served , Ronald Reagan , who declared the Afghan anti-Soviet fighters his CIA director was running , partly with Saudi money , to be “ the moral equal of our founding fathers . ”
None of this was exactly secret information , or even hard to find , at the time that the movie Charlie Wilson ’s War was being made  which makes it a top candidate for the most politically bizarre , consciously dumb film of our era .
Two well - known entertainment - industry liberals , director Mike Nichols and Aaron Sorkin ( the man responsible for The West Wing ) , have tried to take possession of part of that great anti-Soviet Afghan jihad for well , whom ?
The Democratic Party ?
As hopeless an undertaking as this was , there was only one way to turn it and its horrific aftermath into a feel - good , celebratory liberal film .
So they wrote all the Reaganauts out of the picture , which meant excising history from history .
They created a movie in which neither Ronald Reagan nor William Casey even exists .
You could easily think that the Afghan operation had simply been run by Democratic Congressman Charlie Wilson and a low - level CIA agent more or less on their own .
Leaving out the crucial cast of characters was , in this case , comparable to , but far stranger than , what the propagandists of the former Soviet Union used to do in airbrushing discredited leaders out of official photos .
Ronald who ?
Coll ’s book was published in 2004 .
Chalmers Johnson ’s Blowback : The Costs and Consequences of American Empire came out in 2000 , 18 months before the attacks of 9/11 .
Its prescient analysis made it a prophetic text  and propelled it onto bestseller lists after the 9/11 attacks ( and “ blowback , ” a CIA term of trade , into popular culture ) .
Even though he wrote that book well before those towers came down , Johnson saw clearly that , while “ American policies helped ensure that the Soviet Union would suffer the same kind of debilitating defeat in Afghanistan as the United States had in Vietnam in Afghanistan the United States also helped bring to power the Taliban , a fundamentalist Islamic movement . ”
Even more important , he noted that the “ mujahedeen , who only a few years earlier the United States had armed with ground - to - air Stinger missiles , grew bitter over American acts and polices ”  with consequences that were , even then , becoming apparent and would soon enough culminate in a horrific blowback from a CIA - run operation that had been deemed a great success .
Thank heavens , then , that Chalmers Johnson , whose magisterial book Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic ( the final volume of his Blowback Trilogy ) will be appearing in paperback this month , puts a little history back into Charlie Wilson ’s War in his own inimitable manner .

Second thoughts on Charlie Wilson ’s War
By Chalmers Johnson
I have some personal knowledge of congressmen like Charlie Wilson ( D - 2nd District , Texas , 1973 - 1996 ) because , for close to 20 years , my representative in the 50th Congressional District of California was Republican Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham , now serving an eight - and - a - half - year prison sentence for soliciting and receiving bribes from defense contractors .
Wilson and Cunningham held exactly the same plummy committee assignments in the House of Representatives  the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee plus the Intelligence Oversight Committee  from which they could dole out large sums of public money with little or no input from their colleagues or constituents .
Both men flagrantly abused their positions  but with radically different consequences .
Cunningham went to jail because he was too stupid to know how to game the system  retire and become a lobbyist  whereas Wilson received the Central Intelligence Agency Clandestine Service ’s first “ honored colleague ” award ever given to an outsider and went on to become a $ 360,000 per annum lobbyist for Pakistan .
In a secret ceremony at CIA headquarters on June 9 , 1993 , James Woolsey , Bill Clinton ’s first director of central intelligence and one of the agency ’s least competent chiefs in its checkered history , said : “ The defeat and breakup of the Soviet empire is one of the great events of world history .
There were many heroes in this battle , but to Charlie Wilson must go a special recognition . ”
One important part of that recognition , studiously avoided by the CIA and most subsequent American writers on the subject , is that Wilson ’s activities in Afghanistan led directly to a chain of blowback that culminated in the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and led to the United States ’ current status as the most hated nation on earth .
On May 25 , 2003 ( the same month George W. Bush stood on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln under a White - House - prepared “ Mission Accomplished ” banner and proclaimed “ major combat operations ” at an end in Iraq ) , I published a review in the Los Angeles Times of the book that provides the data for the film Charlie Wilson ’s War .
The original edition of the book carried the subtitle , “ The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History  the Arming of the Mujahedeen . ”
The 2007 paperbound edition was subtitled , “ The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Times . ”
Neither the claim that the Afghan operations were covert nor that they changed history is precisely true .
In my review of the book , I wrote ,
“ The Central Intelligence Agency has an almost unblemished record of screwing up every ‘ secret ’ armed intervention it ever undertook .
From the overthrow of the Iranian government in 1953 through the rape of Guatemala in 1954 , the Bay of Pigs , the failed attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro of Cuba and Patrice Lumumba of the Congo , the Phoenix Program in Vietnam , the ‘ secret war ’ in Laos , aid to the Greek Colonels who seized power in 1967 , the 1973 killing of President Allende in Chile , and Ronald Reagan ’s Iran -Contra war against Nicaragua , there is not a single instance in which the Agency ’s activities did not prove acutely embarrassing to the United States and devastating to the people being ‘ liberated . ’
The CIA continues to get away with this bungling primarily because its budget and operations have always been secret and Congress is normally too indifferent to its Constitutional functions to rein in a rogue bureaucracy .
Therefore the tale of a purported CIA success story should be of some interest .
“ According to the author of Charlie Wilson ’s War , the exception to CIA incompetence was the arming between 1979 and 1988 of thousands of Afghan mujahedeen ( ‘ freedom fighters ’ ) .
The Agency flooded Afghanistan with an incredible array of extremely dangerous weapons and ‘ unapologetically mov[ed ] to equip and train cadres of high tech holy warriors in the art of waging a war of urban terror against a modern superpower [ in this case , the USSR ] . ’
“ The author of this glowing account , [ the late ] George Crile , was a veteran producer for the CBS television news show 60 Minutes and an exuberant Tom Clancy - type enthusiast for the Afghan caper .
He argues that the U.S. ’s clandestine involvement in Afghanistan was ‘ the largest and most successful CIA operation in history , ’ ‘ the one morally unambiguous crusade of our time , ’ and that ‘ there was nothing so romantic and exciting as this war against the Evil Empire . ’
Crile ’s sole measure of success is killed Soviet soldiers ( about 15,000 ) , which undermined Soviet morale and contributed to the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the period 1989 to 1991 .
That ’s the successful part .
“ However , he never once mentions that the ‘ tens of thousands of fanatical Muslim fundamentalists ’ the CIA armed are the same people who in 1996 killed nineteen American airmen at Dhahran , Saudi Arabia , bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , blew a hole in the side of the USS Cole in Aden Harbor in 2000 , and on September 11 , 2001 , flew hijacked airliners into New York ’s World Trade Center and the Pentagon . ”
Where Did the “ Freedom Fighters ” Go ?
When I wrote those words I did not know ( and could not have imagined ) that the actor Tom Hanks had already purchased the rights to the book to make into a film in which he would star as Charlie Wilson , with Julia Roberts as his right - wing Texas girlfriend Joanne Herring , and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gust Avrakotos , the thuggish CIA operative who helped pull off this caper .
What to make of the film ( which I found rather boring and old - fashioned ) ?
It makes the U.S. government look like it is populated by a bunch of whoring , drunken sleazebags , so in that sense it ’s accurate enough .
But there are a number of things both the book and the film are suppressing .
As I noted in 2003 ,
“ For the CIA legally to carry out a covert action , the president must sign off on  that is , authorize  a document called a ‘ finding . ’
Crile repeatedly says that President Carter signed such a finding ordering the CIA to provide covert backing to the mujahedeen after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on December 24 , 1979 .
The truth of the matter is that Carter signed the finding on July 3 , 1979 , six months before the Soviet invasion , and he did so on the advice of his national security adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , in order to try to provoke a Russian incursion .
Brzezinski has confirmed this sequence of events in an interview with a French newspaper , and former CIA Director [ today Secretary of Defense ] Robert Gates says so explicitly in his 1996 memoirs .
It may surprise Charlie Wilson to learn that his heroic mujahedeen were manipulated by Washington like so much cannon fodder in order to give the USSR its own Vietnam .
The mujahedeen did the job but as subsequent events have made clear , they may not be all that grateful to the United States . ”
In the bound galleys of Crile ’s book , which his publisher sent to reviewers before publication , there was no mention of any qualifications to his portrait of Wilson as a hero and a patriot .
Only in an “ epilogue ” added to the printed book did Crile quote Wilson as saying , “ These things happened .
They were glorious and they changed the world .
And the people who deserved the credit are the ones who made the sacrifice .
And then we f*cked up the endgame . ”
That ’s it .
Full stop .
Director Mike Nichols , too , ends his movie with Wilson ’s final sentence emblazoned across the screen .
And then the credits roll .
Neither a reader of Crile nor a viewer of the film based on his book would know that , in talking about the Afghan freedom fighters of the 1980s , we are also talking about the militants of al - Qaeda and the Taliban of the 1990s and 2000s .
Amid all the hoopla about Wilson ’s going out of channels to engineer secret appropriations of millions of dollars to the guerrillas , the reader or viewer would never suspect that , when the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 , President George H.W.
Bush promptly lost interest in the place and simply walked away , leaving it to descend into one of the most horrific civil wars of modern times .
Among those supporting the Afghans ( in addition to the U.S. ) was the rich , pious Saudi Arabian economist and civil engineer Osama bin Laden , whom we helped by building up his al - Qaeda base at Khost .
When bin Laden and his colleagues decided to get even with us for having been used , he had the support of much of the Islamic world .
This disaster was brought about by Wilson ’s and the CIA ’s incompetence as well as their subversion of all the normal channels of political oversight and democratic accountability within the U.S. government .
Charlie Wilson ’s war thus turned out to have been just another bloody skirmish in the expansion and consolidation of the American empire  and an imperial presidency .
The victors were the military - industrial complex and our massive standing armies .
The billion dollars ’ worth of weapons Wilson secretly supplied to the guerrillas ended up being turned on ourselves .
An Imperialist Comedy
Which brings us back to the movie and its reception here .
( It has been banned in Afghanistan . )
One of the severe side effects of imperialism in its advanced stages seems to be that it rots the brains of the imperialists .
They start believing that they are the bearers of civilization , the bringers of light to “ primitives ” and “ savages ” ( largely so identified because of their resistance to being “ liberated ” by us ) , the carriers of science and modernity to backward peoples , beacons and guides for citizens of the “ underdeveloped world . ”
Such attitudes are normally accompanied by a racist ideology that proclaims the intrinsic superiority and right to rule of “ white ” Caucasians .
Innumerable European colonialists saw the hand of God in Darwin ’s discovery of evolution , so long as it was understood that He had programmed the outcome of evolution in favor of late Victorian Englishmen .
( For an excellent short book on this subject , check out Sven Lindquist ’s Exterminate All the Brutes . )
When imperialist activities produce unmentionable outcomes , such as those well known to anyone paying attention to Afghanistan since about 1990 , then ideological thinking kicks in .
The horror story is suppressed , or reinterpreted as something benign or ridiculous ( a “ comedy ” ) , or simply curtailed before the denouement becomes obvious .
Thus , for example , Melissa Roddy , a Los Angeles filmmaker with inside information from the Charlie Wilson production team , notes that the film ’s happy ending came about because Tom Hanks , a co-producer as well as the leading actor , “ just ca n’t deal with this 9/11 thing . ”
Similarly , we are told by another insider reviewer , James Rocchi , that the scenario , as originally written by Aaron Sorkin of West Wing fame , included the following line for Avrakotos : “ Remember I said this :
There ’s going to be a day when we ’re gonna look back and say ‘ I ’d give anything if [ Afghanistan ] were overrun with Godless communists . ' ”
This line is nowhere to be found in the final film .
Today there is ample evidence that , when it comes to the freedom of women , education levels , governmental services , relations among different ethnic groups , and quality of life  all were infinitely better under the Afghan communists than under the Taliban or the present government of President Hamid Karzai , which evidently controls little beyond the country ’s capital , Kabul .
But Americans do n’t want to know that  and certainly they get no indication of it from Charlie Wilson ’s War , either the book or the film .
The tendency of imperialism to rot the brains of imperialists is particularly on display in the recent spate of articles and reviews in mainstream American newspapers about the film .
For reasons not entirely clear , an overwhelming majority of reviewers concluded that Charlie Wilson ’s War is a “ feel - good comedy ” ( Lou Lumenick in the New York Post ) , a “ high - living , hard - partying jihad ” ( A.O. Scott in the New York Times ) , “ a sharp - edged , wickedly funny comedy ” ( Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun - Times ) .
Stephen Hunter in the Washington Post wrote of “ Mike Nichols ’s laff - a- minute chronicle of the congressman ’s crusade to ram funding through the House Appropriations Committee to supply arms to the Afghan mujahedeen ” ; while , in a piece entitled “ Sex ! Drugs ! ( and Maybe a Little War ) , ” Richard L. Berke in the New York Times offered this stamp of approval : “ You can make a movie that is relevant and intelligent  and palatable to a mass audience  if its political pills are sugar - coated . ”
When I saw the film , there was only a guffaw or two from the audience over the raunchy sex and sexism of “ good - time Charlie , ” but certainly no laff - a- minute .
The root of this approach to the film probably lies with Tom Hanks himself , who , according to Berke , called it “ a serious comedy . ”
A few reviews qualified their endorsement of Charlie Wilson ’s War , but still came down on the side of good old American fun .
Rick Groen in the Toronto Globe and Mail , for instance , thought that it was “ best to enjoy Charlie Wilson ’s War as a thoroughly engaging comedy .
Just do n’t think about it too much or you may choke on your popcorn . ”
Peter Rainer noted in the Christian Science Monitor that the “ Comedic Charlie Wilson ’s War has a tragic punch line . ”
These reviewers were thundering along with the herd while still trying to maintain a bit of self - respect .
The handful of truly critical reviews have come mostly from blogs and little - known Hollywood fanzines  with one major exception , Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times .
In an essay subtitled “ Charlie Wilson ’s War celebrates events that came back to haunt Americans , ” Turan called the film “ an unintentionally sobering narrative of American should n’t - have ” and added that it was “ glib rather than witty , one of those films that comes off as being more pleased with itself than it has a right to be . ”
My own view is that if Charlie Wilson ’s War is a comedy , it ’s the kind that goes over well with a roomful of louts in a college fraternity house .
Simply put , it is imperialist propaganda , and the tragedy is that four - and - a - half years after we invaded Iraq and destroyed it , such dangerously misleading nonsense is still being offered to a gullible public .
The most accurate review so far is James Rocchi ’s summing - up for Cinematical.com : “ Charlie Wilson ’s
War is n’t just bad history ; it feels even more malign , like a conscious attempt to induce amnesia . ”

The apology represents a break from previous policies
Aboriginal people
Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin said the apology would be the first item of business when the new legislature convened on 13 February .
It is aimed at the " Stolen Generations " - Aboriginal children taken from their parents to be raised by white families .
It was the " first , necessary step to move forward from the past " , she said .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced plans to apologise after his victory in last year 's general elections .
The move is a highly symbolic one marking a definitive break from policies of previous administrations , correspondents say .
' Respect
Ms Macklin said that the content of the apology had been determined after wide consultation with Aboriginal leaders .
It would be made " on behalf of the Australian government and does not attribute guilt to the current generation of Australian people " , she said in a statement .
" Once we establish this respect , the government can work with indigenous communities to improve services aimed at closing the 17 - year life expectancy gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians , " she said .
Thousands of Aboriginal children were forcibly taken from their parents and given to white families or institutions to raise between 1915 and 1969 .
The policy was aimed at forcing assimilation between Aboriginal and white communities .
Indigenous campaigners have been seeking a billion - dollar nationwide compensation package for the policy .
But the government has ruled this out , instead promising to fund improved education and health care facilities for Aboriginal communities .
The ' Big Four ' record labels - EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner have started legal proceedings to force an ISP to end piracy on its network .
The action , brought against Irish ISP , Eircom , is the first of its kind .
Eircom is the largest Irish ISP .
Today , the Big Four record labels have started legal proceedings which they hope will force Eircom to effectively end music piracy on its network .
According to the Ireland.com report , this action is the first against an ISP , rather than individual file - sharers .
Mr Justice Peter Kelly today admitted the proceedings at the court under the Copyright and Related Rights Acts 2000 .
It appears the labels are trying to get an order to effectively force Eircom to take responsibility for their customer ’s actions by saying that it ’s the ISP that is doing the ‘ making available ’ to the public , by facilitating the infringement .
Eircom ’s lawyers see if differently .
They say that Eircom was “ not on notice of specific illegal activity that infringed the rights of the companies ” , adding that it was under no legal obligation to monitor traffic on its network .
Willie Kavanagh , Managing Director of EMI records in Ireland said of Eircom : “ with the greatest of respect ” it was “ well aware ” that its customers used its networks to infringe copyrights “ on a grand scale ” .
Previously , Eircom has refused to use any filtering technology to interfere with file - sharers , something the labels wish to address in this case too .
It looks like the IFPI has shifted its focus from the individual filesharer to the ISPs .
Last month , the IFPI won a court case in Denmark , and the ISP “ Tele2â €³ was ordered to block all access to The Pirate Bay .
Tele2 announced later that it will fight the decision .
Banning illegal filesharing from their network , voluntary or not , is in the best interest of ISPs according to the IFPI : “ Illegal P2P file - sharing may have helped drive broadband subscriptions in the past , yet today these activities , particularly in respect of movies , are hogging bandwidth , ” they state .
By Martin Bosworth
The Save The Internet coalition alerted me to Comcast ’s quietly rolling out new terms of service that codify what has been common knowledge for some time –that the company does , indeed , interfere with traffic on its network , and reserves the right to do so , any time it wishes .
Of course , the company has n’t actually come out and said it so plainly , any more than they ’ll admit they cancel customer accounts for hitting undisclosed bandwith caps .
Instead , as Mike Masnick notes , they ’re using “ weasel language ” that implies their intent without being so precise as to be caught .
Let ’s compare and contrast .
From Comcast ’s terms of service , Section III , “ Network Management And Consumption : ”
How does Comcast manage its network ?
Comcast uses various tools and techniques to manage its network , deliver the Service , and ensure compliance with this Policy and the Subscriber Agreement .
These tools and techniques are dynamic , like the network and its usage , and can and do change frequently .
For example , these network management activities may include ( i ) identifying spam and preventing its delivery to customer e-mail accounts , ( ii ) detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing the distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content , ( iii ) temporarily delaying peer - to - peer sessions ( or sessions using other applications or protocols ) during periods of high network congestion , ( iv ) limiting the number of peer - to - peer sessions during periods of high network congestion , and ( v ) using other tools and techniques that Comcast may be required to implement in order to meet its goal of delivering the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers .
From Comcast ’s selection of high - speed Internet packages :
Get on the fast track … fast !
With Comcast High - Speed Internet , you ’ll enjoy the most amazing online experience .
Powered by Comcast ’s advanced fiber - optic network , you ’ll love the thrill of blazing - fast speeds .
Speeds way faster than DSL from the phone company !
*
And with Comcast ’s innovative PowerBoostÂ® technology , activities like downloading videos , movies , music and games or uploading photos go even faster .
One of these things is not like the others .
For Comcast to come out and say that their network may be something less than “ blazing fast ” is the kiss of marketing death , but at the same time , in the wake of their impending FCC investigation , they have to give themselves at least some legalistic CYA to ensure they ca n’t be held accountable by angry customers , consumer activists , or Capitol Hill .
Thus this song - and - dance .
As Andy Patrizio and Masnick have noted , the “ reasonable network management ” phrase is the same language used by the FCC itself , a clear signal that the company is trying to appease Kevin Martin in his never - ending war on cable .
I recommend reading Free Press ’ Marvin Ammori’s awesome analysis of this seemingly innocuous change , in which he deconstructs their legalese down to the essence –that they are too cheap to build out a more advanced network to handle the demands their customer base is placing on it ( which happens when you ’re an essential monopoly in many regions ) , so they ’re instead throttling their customers ’
Internet access and calling that “ reasonable network management . ”
Enjoy that blazing - fast 3 mbps speed !
Oil Companies Want Gov't Help for Cleantech
February 26th , 2008 by Maria Surma Manka
Cambridge Energy Research Associates – called “ as close as it gets to a proxy for conventional wisdom within Big Oil ” by a Wall Street Journal blogger – just finished a new report that says global warming represents the world ’s first serious challenge to the dominance of fossil fuels .
Companies know this and are starting to do more about it .
While fossil fuels are n’t going away tomorrow , there ’s ‘ lots the government can do to encourage their adoption and further innovation :
Put a price on carbon dioxide emissions , set standards for a certain percentage of our energy to come from renewables , and provide subsidies to encourage cleantech .
While clean energy supporters have been saying this for years , does this sentiment from big oil mean we ’re starting to see some enlightenment ?

Strauss said that despite the high levels in dollar - yen and rumors of possible intervention by the Bank of Japan , there were no clear indications the Japanese government is ready to take action to prevent the currency from appreciating further .
The dollar fell as low as 95.77 yen according to Reuters data , and set a historic trough at 0.9637
Swiss francs after breaking below parity last week .
Implied volatility -- a key component of option prices -- in dollar / yen surged to its highest levels in around a decade both on the one - week and one - month C horizon .
" The dollar is suffering from the dual shock of an economic slowdown and a financial crisis , " said Teis Knuthsen , head of FX research at Danske Markets in Copenhagen .
In another report on Monday , the U.S. Treasury Department said net overall capital flows in the country fell to its lowest level in four months in January .
The inflows were not sufficient to cover the month 's U.S. trade deficit .
" Today 's TICs report takes a back seat to tomorrow 's FOMC 's decision , with market expectations regarding the size of the anticipated cut all over the map , " Michael Woolfolk , a senior currency strategist at The Bank of New York Mellon , said in a note .
Short - term U.S.
Treasury yields fell to five - year lows as investors expect the Fed could slash overnight rates by up to 100 basis points by the end of its policy meeting on Tuesday .
The euro rose as high as $ 1.5904 , having already added around 4 percent in the first two weeks of March , roughly doubling its year - to - date gains .
Intervention ?
The rapid dollar fall fanned talk of possible coordinated dollar - buying intervention from major central banks other than the Bank of Japan .
" From the ECB point of view , these are moves which are not easy to ignore , " Dresdner Kleinwort currency strategist Michael Klawitter said .
Central banks in Europe , Japan and the U.S. last jointly intervened in September 2000 , propping up the euro after the currency hit an all - time low below $ 0.85 , a loss of nearly 30 percent of its value since its January 1999 launch .
ECB Governing Council Member Klaus Liebscher said in Vienna sharp movements in the currency markets were a matter of concern for the central bank .
" I am concerned about the development ... and about the excess volatility , which we see now in the markets , " he said .
Japanese Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga also said on Monday he is watching currency market moves in cooperation with authorities in the United States and Europe .
What is going on in the world ?
How is it that Bear Sterns can go from $ 20 a share to $ 2 ?
Basically , my feeling is that the credit crunch of the past 6 months sends a serious message to us all , a message about value .
The problem with board members who rely on econometrics and statistics to forecast company growth and decide who the CEO should be is that they have become too focussed on the profit , and have completely forgotten value .
To paraphrase Oscar Wilde , who summed up the crisis we ’re in quite well : beware the man who puts a price on everything whilst not knowing the value of anything .
The sub - prime mortgage is a result of a bunch of spin-doctors who tried to put a price on things without caring about value .
Blackberries , Smart - phones , spread - betting software and all the other plagues of today ’s world have made the average business proposition a mile - wide and an inch deep .
Very little in today ’s business environment adds actual value , carries real substance or does anything beside enrich the very people who push them .
Take cell - phones for instanceâ€¦ its in Motorola ’s best interests to sell you something that is highly desirable but only lasts a year , to ensure that you are a repeat customer .
Now , there may be nothing wrong with that , but in a world where 1 million cell - phones are thrown away on a daily - basis in an environment that is already destabilized and polluted , perhaps we should forsake profit in the name of sustainability .
Does n’t is turn your stomach to think about the land - fill that will one day be home to all the Guitar Hero 3 guitars sold this past Christmas .
I think the ways and the reasons of and for doing business need to be fundamentally re-appraised .
Guitar Hero 3 does not give any value to society , the consumer or the environment .
A real guitar on the other hand is a piece of art that can be handed down from generation to generation .
Another product with inherent value is wine .
Wine farmers have the environment and eco-systems in their best interests , and sustainability is at the heart of their business .
The jobs created along the supply chain enrich communities , and its production enlivens a century ’s old tradition of pairing wine with food in the company of friends and spreading good will .
The contemporary wine - lover is a person who inherently appreciates value and whom Oscar Wilde would hold in high - esteem .
Long - live the love of wine !

San Quentin loses data on 3,500 visitors SACRAMENTO
A flash memory drive containing names , birth dates and driver 's license numbers of more than 3,500 people who either volunteered or visited San Quentin State Prison in a group tour has been lost , a prison official said Friday .
The flash drive was used to move the data each evening from the prison 's administrative office near the parking lot to computers at the two entrance gates to the facility to allow guards to identify volunteers or groups , such as college students , that tour the prison , said Samuel Robinson , a San Quentin spokesman .
" What happens is that we have to transport that information out to individual areas where we let people through " onto prison grounds , he said .
" It 's our security measure to walk the flash drive . "
The flash drive did not contain Social Security numbers , but the personal information on visitors was not encrypted , he said , adding that the prison has since decided to encrypt the data .
Prison officials have not received any reports of identify theft tied to this incident , Robinson said .
Sen. Gloria Romero , D - Los Angeles , chairwoman of the Senate Public Safety Committee , criticized the Corrections Department for losing such sensitive information , and said she will call prisons secretary James Tilton to address the issue .
" This is how cavalier the Corrections Department can be with private information , " she said .
" There has been a breech of security . "
The unit was discovered missing March 4 and a preliminary investigation shows that it was last used on March 3 , Robinson said .
It 's yet unclear how the flash drive was lost or if it may be somewhere on prison grounds , he said .
There is no indication that the flash drive was stolen for malicious reasons , such as identity theft , Robinson said .
Prison officials recently sent out letters alerting the individuals whose information is believed to be on the flash drive .
The letter , dated March 20 , recommends the recipients call a credit reporting agency and place a fraud alert on their credit files .
It also recommends checking credit reports every three months for the next year .
Anyone who has visited San Quentin and is concerned their personal information could be on the flash drive may call Sgt. Rudy Luna , administrative assistant , at ( 415 ) 455-5000 or Laura Bowman , community partnership manager , at ( 415 ) 454-1460 , extension 5400 .

Typography is more than being legible and looking good .
Among other things , effective typography manages to achieve two important objectives : a ) to create an appropriate atmosphere and enable users to develop trust toward the site and b ) to make sure visitors get the main message of the site and ( if possible ) become interested in the services offered on the site .
Since written text is the most efficient instrument to communicate with visitors precisely and directly , the power of typography should n’t be underestimated .

Sources and Resources
ABC News ’ Jan Crawford Greenburg reports :
In dozens of top - secret talks and meetings in the White House , the most senior Bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency , sources tell ABC News .
The so - called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of “ combined ” interrogation techniques — using different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time — on terrorist suspects who proved difficult to break , sources said .
Highly placed sources said a handful of top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects — whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding .
The high - level discussions about these “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney , former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
â ¦
Then - Attorney General Ashcroft was troubled by the discussions .
He agreed with the general policy decision to allow aggressive tactics and had repeatedly advised that they were legal .
But he argued that senior White House advisers should not be involved in the grim details of interrogations , sources said .
According to a top official , Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting : “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
My friend and occasional blog - partner D.Billy sent me this excerpt from a Dave Eggers interview the other day and my God , it made my heart sing a massive oceans - wide whale song of recognition .
I ’ve been feeling ground down by a heavily “ no ” - intensive environment , the sort of thing where a cautious , smart “ no ” is always better than a “ hey - let ’ s - give - it - a - shot yes . ”
The cautious , smart “ no ” is usually pretty satisfying .
You feel safe , secure .
Then a few years go by and the view out the window never changes , and you start to think “ wait , I feel kinda stagnant . ”
If you ’re lucky you might notice that all that caution kept you in the driveway instead of out on the open road .
The whole interview is worth a read , but it all boils down to this at the end .
Read it , and let your heart ’s whale - song harmonize with the entire universe :
The thing is , I really like saying yes .
I like new things , projects , plans , getting people together and doing something , trying something , even when it ’s corny or stupid .
I am not good at saying no .
And I do not get along with people who say no .
When you die , and it really could be this afternoon , under the same bus wheels I ’ll stick my head if need be , you will not be happy about having said no .
You will be kicking your ass about all the no ’s you ’ve said .
No to that opportunity , or no to that trip to Nova Scotia or no to that night out , or no to that project or no to that person who wants to be naked with you but you worry about what your friends will say .
No is for wimps .
No is for pussies .
No is to live small and embittered , cherishing the opportunities you missed because they might have sent the wrong message .
There is a point in one ’s life when one cares about selling out and not selling out .
One worries whether or not wearing a certain shirt means that they are behind the curve or ahead of it , or that having certain music in one ’s collection means that they are impressive , or unimpressive .
Thankfully , for some , this all passes .
I am here to tell you that I have , a few years ago , found my way out of that thicket of comparison and relentless suspicion and judgment .
And it is a nice feeling .
Because , in the end , no one will ever give a shit who has kept shit ‘ real ’ except the two or three people , sitting in their apartments , bitter and self - devouring , who take it upon themselves to wonder about such things .
The keeping real of shit matters to some people , but it does not matter to me .
It ’s fashion , and I do n’t like fashion , because fashion does not matter .
What matters is that you do good work .
What matters is that you produce things that are true and will stand .
…
What matters is not the perception , nor the fashion , not who ’s up and who ’s down , but what someone has done and if they meant it .
What matters is that you want to see and make and do , on as grand a scale as you want , regardless of what the tiny voices of tiny people say .
Do not be critics , you people , I beg you .
I was a critic and I wish I could take it all back because it came from a smelly and ignorant place in me , and spoke with a voice that was all rage and envy .
Do not dismiss a book until you have written one , and do not dismiss a movie until you have made one , and do not dismiss a person until you have met them .
It is a fuckload of work to be open - minded and generous and understanding and forgiving and accepting , but Christ , that is what matters .
What matters is saying yes .
I say yes , and Wayne Coyne says yes , and if that makes us the enemy , then good , good , good .
We are evil people because we want to live and do things .
We are on the wrong side because we should be home , calculating which move would be the least damaging to our downtown reputations .
But I say yes because I am curious .
I want to see things .
I say yes when my high school friend tells me to come out because he ’s hanging with Puffy .
A real story , that .
I say yes when Hollywood says they ’ll give me enough money to publish a hundred different books , or send twenty kids through college .
Saying no is so fucking boring .
And if anyone wants to hurt me for that , or dismiss me for that , for saying yes , I say Oh do it , do it you motherfuckers , finally , finally , finally .
DNC Chairman , Howard Dean , appeared on today 's Late Edition to talk about the campaign and the race on the Democratic side .
Howard did a good job deflecting Wolf Blitzer 's doom and gloom for the Democrats line of questioning .
Each time Blitzer would ask him about the tension between Senators Clinton and Obama , Dean would fire back with the reality of John McCain 's lack of ethics and credibility .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
While I do n't completely agree with Dean 's assertion that some of the negative campaigning that 's occurred between the Democratic candidates is n't an issue , I was encouraged to see how aggressively he pushed back at Blitzer , staying focused , cutting through the spin and charging right at John McCain 's weaknesses .
An interesting piece of history was discovered in a document that the State Department ’s historical office released .
It was a conversation transcript between China ’s Chairman Mao Zedong and US Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger .
“ You know , China is a very poor country , ” Mao said .
“ We do n’t have much .
What we have in excess is women .
So if you want them we can give a few of those to you , some tens of thousands . ”
Mao circled back to the offer a few minutes later .
“ Do you want our Chinese women ? ” he asked .
“ We can give you 10 million . ”
Kissinger noted Mao was “ improving his offer , ” and the chairman is on record then saying , “ We have too many women … They give birth to children and our children are too many . ”
“ It is such a novel proposition , ” Kissinger replied .
“ We will have to study it . ”
OK , throw another $ 50 billion down the rat hole that is the Iraq occupation .
It ’s only money , if you ignore the lives being destroyed .
That ’s what the White House is asking for , in addition to the $ 147 billion in supplementary funds already requested , and Congress will grant it after Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker follow President Bush ’s photo op in Iraq ’s Anbar province with a dog and pony show of their own .
Meanwhile , the Democrats are totally cynical about this continuing waste of taxpayer dollars and of American and Iraqi lives , and , wanting Bush to hang himself with his own rope , they will deny him nothing .
In the effort to retaliate against terrorists who hijacked planes six years ago with an arsenal of $ 3 knives , this year ’s overall defense budget has been pushed to $ 657 billion .
We are now spending $ 3 billion a week in Iraq alone , occupying a country that had nothing to do with the tragedy that sparked this orgy of militarism .
The waste is so enormous and irrelevant to our national security that a rational person might embrace the libertarian creed if only for the sake of sanity .
Clearly , the federal government no longer cares much about providing for health , education , hurricane reconstruction or even bridge safety , as the military budget now dwarfs all other discretionary spending , despite the lack of a sophisticated enemy in sight .
Numbers are boring , and the media act as if there is no difference between a million and a billion dollars thrown at the military — let alone the trillion - dollar projected cost of the Iraq war .
That last figure is well documented in a solid study out of Harvard co-authored by Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz but ignored by the mass media
So too a recent authoritative report from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office that , despite the $ 44.5 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars already poured into reconstruction , little detectable progress has been made in Iraq ’s crucial oil and electricity systems .
Remember when Paul Wolfowitz , then the Pentagon ’s resident neocon genius , assured Congress that Iraqi oil money would easily bear the entire cost of America ’s Iraqi adventure ?
Now the GAO tells us that , even after spending an additional $ 57 billion on the Iraqi oil and electricity infrastructure , and assuming peace is restored , Iraq would still not produce enough oil and electricity to meet local demand until the year 2015 .
Aside from corruption and the lack of security , the biggest problem in supplying Iraq with electricity is that the national electrical grid has broken down , and different factions , divided largely along ethnic and religious lines , are grabbing what they can .
This kind of anarchy is emblematic of the new , emerging Iraq , in which the central government has declining sway over the nation ’s decisions .
That latter point was underscored this week by Bush ’s happy - faced visit to a highly fortified and isolated American outpost in Anbar province .
After posing gamely with the troops at the Al - Asad base , Bush celebrated the return of Sunni areas to the control of U.S. - armed militias — composed largely of former insurgents who have at least temporarily decided that their Shiite rivals , currently in control of the central government , are a more pressing enemy than the American occupiers .
Speaking of one such group of Sunnis trained by the Americans and dubbed the “ Volunteers ” by their instructors , a U.S. soldier told The Washington Post , “ I think there is some risk of them being Volunteers by day and terrorists by night . ”
That is exactly what has occurred on the Shiite side , where anti-U.S. religious groups have completely infiltrated the American - trained Iraqi military and police forces .
In Iraq ’s Shiite - controlled south , the domination of the military and police by the fiercely anti-American Madhi Army and other militias was ensured by the final withdrawal of British troops from Basra , Iraq ’s second - largest city and a vital center of oil production , on the same day that Bush visited Iraq .
Instead of the liberated , united and democratic Iraq promised by this invasion , we are left with a nation ruled by religious fiefdoms sustained far into the future by U.S. taxpayers .
The French and the Germans , hoary veterans of various failed European adventures in imperialism , warned us about precisely this outcome .
While U.S. troops spill blood to guard broken oil pipelines , the Chinese and others go merrily about the world buying up black gold on the open market .
But hey , do n’t worry about your tax dollars and the waste of lives — eat some freedom fries and learn , like our president , to keep smiling .
This webpage is boring .
Go look at naked ladies .

The most important story to come out of Washington recently had nothing to do with the endless presidential campaign .
And although the media largely ignored it , the story changes the world .
The story ’s unlikely source was the staid World Bank , which published updated statistics on the economic output of 146 countries .
China ’s economy , said the bank , is smaller than it thought .
About 40 % smaller .
China , it turns out , is n’t a $ 10 - trillion economy on the brink of catching up with the United States .
It is a $ 6 - trillion economy , less than half our size .
For the foreseeable future , China will have far less money to spend on its military and will face much deeper social and economic problems at home than experts previously believed .

What happened to $ 4 trillion in Chinese gross domestic product ?
Statistics .
When economists calculate a country ’s gross domestic product , they add up the prices of the goods and services its economy produces and get a total -- in dollars for the United States , euros for such countries as Germany and France and yuan for China .
To compare countries ’ GDP , they typically convert each country ’s product into dollars .
The simplest way to do this is to use exchange rates .
In 2006 , the World Bank calculated that China produced 21 trillion yuan worth of goods and services .
Using the market exchange rate of 7.8 yuan to the dollar , the bank pegged China ’s GDP at $ 2.7 trillion .
That number is too low .
For one thing , like many countries , China artificially manipulates the value of its currency .
For another , many goods in less developed economies such as China and Mexico are much cheaper than they are in countries such as the United States .
Advertisement
To take these factors into account , economists compare prices from one economy to another and compute an adjusted GDP figure based on “ purchasing - power parity . ”
The idea is that a country ’s GDP adjusted for purchasing - power parity provides a more realistic measure of relative economic strength and of living standards than the unadjusted GDP numbers .
Unfortunately , comparing hundreds and even thousands of prices in almost 150 economies all over the world is a difficult thing to do .
Concerned that its purchasing - power - parity numbers were out of whack , the World Bank went back to the drawing board and , with help from such countries as India and China , reviewed the data behind its GDP adjustments .
It learned that there is less difference between China ’s domestic prices and those in such countries as the United States than previously thought .
So the new purchasing - power - parity adjustment is smaller than the old one -- and $ 4 trillion in Chinese GDP melts into air .
The political consequences will be felt far and wide .
To begin with , the U.S. will remain the world ’s largest economy well into the future .
Given that fact , fears that China will challenge the U.S. for global political leadership seem overblown .
Under the old figures , China was predicted to pass the United States as the world ’s largest economy in 2012 .
That is n’t going to happen .
Advertisement
Also , the difference in U.S. and Chinese living standards is much larger than previously thought .
Average income per Chinese is less than one - tenth the U.S. level .
With its people this poor , China will have a hard time raising enough revenue for the vast military buildup needed to challenge the United States .
The balance of power in Asia looks more secure .
Japan ’s economy was not affected by the World Bank revisions .
China ’s economy has shrunk by 40 % compared with Japan too .
And although India ’s economy was downgraded by 40 % , the United States , Japan and India will be more than capable of balancing China ’s military power in Asia for a very long time to come .
But do n’t pop the champagne corks .
It is bad news that billions of people are significantly poorer than we thought .
China and India are not the only countries whose GDP has been revised downward .
The World Bank figures show sub-Saharan Africa ’s economy to be 25 % smaller .
One consequence is that the ambitious campaign to reduce world poverty by 2015 through the United Nations Millennium Development Goals will surely fail .
We have underestimated the size of the world ’s poverty problem , and we have overestimated our progress in attacking it .
This is not good .
There is more bad news .
U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs hoping to crack the Chinese and Indian markets must come to terms with a middle class that is significantly smaller than thought .
Investors in overseas stocks should take note .
Companies with growth plans tied to the Indian and Chinese markets could face disappointing results , and the high prices of many emerging - market stocks depend on buzz and psychology .
Investor sentiment on China and India may now be significantly more vulnerable to future bad news .

China ’s political stability may be more fragile than thought .
The country faces huge domestic challenges -- an aging population lacking any form of social security , wholesale problems in the financial system that dwarf those revealed in the U.S. sub -prime loan mess and the breakdown of its health system .
These problems are as big as ever , but China has fewer resources to meet them than we thought .
And there is the environment .
With poor air quality , acute water shortages , massive pollution in major watersheds and many other environmental problems , China needs to make enormous investments in the environment to avoid major disasters .
Globally , it will be much harder to get China -- and India -- to make any sacrifices to address problems such as global warming .
For Americans , the new numbers from the World Bank bring good news and bad .
On the plus side , U.S. leadership in the global system seems more secure and more likely to endure through the next generation .
On the other hand , the world we are called on to lead is poorer and more troubled than we anticipated .
Maybe the old Chinese curse says it best :
We seem to be headed for interesting times .
Curious Deer Watches Closely as Michigan Woman Sinks Golf Putt
Duration : 00:58
PGA pro Jason Michael Dudzinski and his fiancee , Katie Nolff , were enjoying a day of golf on September 27 in Oakland County , Michigan , when a young deer wandered onto the course .
Dudzinski posted a video to his Facebook page showing the deer walking right up to Nolff just as she is setting up for her last shot of the day .
“ This has never happened before to either of us , ” Dudzinski told Storyful .
“ I was a little surprised as I was watching her out there and happened to glance over and see the deer approaching the green .
I was a little nervous as you never know how deer might react , but Katie is an animal whisperer .
It was an encounter is if she was petting a dog , ” he said .
Nolff says hello to the buck and lets it smell her hand before she sets up again , and sinks her shot .
The deer sticks around while Nolff and Dudzinski retrieve the ball , as Nolff suggests that perhaps the animal wants to play with them , and proceeds to pick up and throw the ball for the deer , who is apparently not into fetch .
The couple had celebrated their upcoming nuptials with friends and family earlier in the day , and told Storyful that they thought the deer could be the spirit of Nolff ’s late father stopping by to wish them well .

Brock Thiessen at Exclaim reports on the anti-emo backlash said to be sweeping through Mexico :
According to Daniel Hernandez , who 's been covering the anti-emo riots on his blog Intersections , the violence began March 7 , when an estimated 800 young people poured into the Mexican city of Queretaro 's main plaza " hunting " for emo kids to pummel .
Then the following weekend similar violence occurred in Mexico City at the Glorieta de Insurgents , a central gathering space for emos .
Hernandez also reports that several anti-emo riots have now also spread to various other Mexican cities .
Via the Austin American Statesmen , several postings on Mexican social - networking sites , primarily organising spot for these " emo hunts , " have been dug up and translated .
One states : " I HATE EMOS !!!
They are not even people , they are so stupid , they cry over meaningless things …
My school is infested with them , I want to kill them all ! "
Another says : " We 've never seen all the urban tribes unite against one single tribe before …
Emos , their way of thinking is for crap , if you are so depressed please do us all a favour and kill yourselves ! "
In the annals of judicial imperialism , we have arrived at a strange new chapter .
A California court ruled this month that parents cannot " home school " their children without government certification .
No teaching credential , no teaching .
Parents " do not have a constitutional right to home school their children , " wrote California appellate Justice Walter Croskey .
The 166,000 families in the state that now choose to educate their children at home must be stunned .
But at least one political lobby likes the ruling .
" We 're happy , " ...
Computer security analyst Babak Pasdar says that a major mobile telecommunications carrier has a built - in backdoor that provides an undisclosed third - party with unfettered access to its internal technical infrastructure , including the ability to eavesdrop on all calls through its network .
In an affidavit that describes the circumstances and basis for the allegations , Pasdar provides evidence which could indicate that the FBI is on the other side of the secret line , engaging in warrantless surveillance of mobile communications .
Pasdar discovered evidence of the backdoor when he was part of a rapid deployment team that was brought in to facilitate a large - scale network security hardware migration for the mobile carrier .
During the migration , Pasdar was instructed not to migrate the traffic for one particular DS - 3 , which was referred to as the " Quantico Circuit " by consultants who worked closely with the carrier ( the FBI Academy is based in Quantico , Virginia ) .
According to Pasdar , the consultants informed him that the Quantico Circuit is supposed to have no firewalls of any kind and no access control — it is given complete access to everything in the carrier 's internal network and there is no way to tell conclusively what has been accessed through it .
The consultants indicated that they knew who was at the other end of the Quantico Circuit , but they refused to divulge this information to Pasdar .
When Pasdar insisted that the Quantico Circuit should at least have the minimum level of security access logging if not access control , the consultants called the company 's Director of Security , who threatened Pasdar , telling him that he would be replaced if he did n't forget about the circuit and continue with the migration .
In the affidavit , Pasdar says that the absence of access control systems and basic access logging for the Quantico Circuit represents a deviation from industry - acceptable use scenarios and notes that such a serious breach of security would generally be considered a breach of organizational policy .
He also points out that even the internal offices and systems of the carrier do n't have the same level of unfettered access to the network as the Quantico Circuit .
Although Pasdar has refused to name the carrier , and those working for the carrier who have knowledge of the Quantico Circuit 's user are n't saying what they know , Wired 's Threat Level blog connected the pieces and points us to the 2006 wiretapping lawsuit against the telcos , which alleges that Verizon " has engaged and maintained and still does maintain a high speed data transmission line from its wireless call center to a remote location in Quantico , Virginia , the site of a U.S. government intelligence and military base . "
The lawsuit also asserts that " the transmission line provided the Quantico recipient direct access to all content and all information concerning the origin and termination of telephone calls placed on the Verizon Wireless network as well as the actual content of calls . "
Providing any third party with unfettered network access to such a broad spectrum of sensitive consumer data would seem to constitute a very clear violation of the Communications
Act , which broadly forbids disclosure of such information .
The lack of access controls and logging undermines safeguards against abuse by enabling the recipient of the data to operate entirely outside the realm of accountability .
This is particularly disturbing if the recipient of the Quantico Circuit is the FBI , because the agency has a long history of intelligence abuses and has been found to have a serious lack of meaningful internal oversight .

A grandfather has
been given a prison sentence
for racial harassment
after calling a Welsh
woman " English " .
Mick Forsythe used the term
during an argument over a
scratched car in his Welsh
home town .
He called the vehicle 's owner ,
Lorna Steele , an " English bitch " .
She and her husband took great
offence at the jibe and decided to
take him to court .
The 55 - year - old former lorry driver
was found guilty of racially
aggravated disorderly behaviour ,
and received a ten - week prison
sentence suspended for 12 months .
Yesterday Mr Forsythe attacked
the prosecution as a waste of time
and money .
" I find it unbelievable that I've
been prosecuted for this , " he said .
" I 'm originally from Northern
Ireland so I 'm an adoptive Welshman .

The case took nine months to
get to court , having begun on a
snowy day in February in the
quiet mid-Wales market town of
Newtown .
Mr Forsythe says his mind was
on the recent arrival of his granddaughter
when he struck anothervehicle while parking in front of his
bric - a - brac shop .
The car belonged to Mrs Steele ,
who runs the tattoo parlour next
door with her husband Gavin .
Mr Forsythe claims he went to offer
to pay for the scratches he had
caused .
But , the court was told , he
became abusive and hurled insults at
Mrs Steele , 32 , and her husband .
Yesterday his wife Val , 50 , explained :
' Mick was a bit distracted because
our granddaughter Rhian had just
been born .
He went in and did the
decent thing and owned up to it .
Then the next thing is they are asking
for £ 500 for the damage .
" My husband has a temper and he
was a lorry driver for years so his language
is a bit colourful sometimes .
" The Steeles started the row and
Mick got angry and he admits he
swore at them .
But he only muttered
under his breath . "
After the argument Mrs Steele put
up a sign in her shop which read
" Some People Call Me a Bitch " .
But
she insisted the incident was no joking
matter .
She said : " I 'm Welsh – I was born in
Welshpool .
" But we could n't let him
get away with what he said . "
Her husband ,
a 40 - year - old Englishman originally
from Hull , added of Mr
Forsythe : " He is a racist .
He does n't
like the English .
" He 's from Ireland
originally and he 's lived in Wales for
years and some of them do n't like
English people .
" The point is that he should n't have
said those things to Lorna .
" All we wanted from him was an
apology but he would n't give us that .
" So we 've had to go all the way
through the courts to get it .
" There 's no way this should have
ended up in court , it 's the sort of
thing you should be able to sort out
without that .
" But he said what he
said and I think he deserved to be
found guilty . "
Forsythe , of Newtown , was ordered
to pay £ 200 in costs in the hearing at
Welshpool Magistrates Court .
George Bush 's biggest mistake in John McCain 's eyes ?
Signing budget bills .
But , earlier in his administration , when the Republicans controlled Congress , Bush routinely signed budgets that included pork - barrel projects and earmarked spending .
" That was probably the biggest mistake the Bush administration made , " McCain said Tuesday .
That is a principled , straight - talking position , right ?
And check out what McCain was saying in 2003 :
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , a key swing vote on fiscal matters in the narrowly divided chamber , told fellow lawmakers it was premature to consider any tax reductions or spending increases until the administration and Congress have a better idea what the war will cost .
In 2003 , he was against tax reductions and spending increases because the war might cost a lot .
In 2008 , he thinks Bush should have vetoed even Republican - passed bills because of pork .
That 's consistency !
Not so fast :
2005 Budget Resolution ( voted 3/12/04 ) : Yea
2006 Budget Resolution ( voted 3/17/05 ) : Yea
2007 Budget Resolution ( voted 3/16/06 ) : Yea
Only when you 've been running against someone like Mitt Romney , who switched positions daily , does this count as consistency .
In the real world , it 's what we call " hypocrisy . "
World Can't Wait activists protest at a panel discussion at Boalt Hall on Thursday .
Panelists discussed the presidency and the future of the courts after President Bush .
Contributing Writer
Clad in orange jumpsuits and black cloth , a group of about 20 people were pulled out by campus police after protesting a panel discussion moderated by UC Berkeley law professor John Yoo at the Boalt Hall School of Law .
Members of World Can't Wait , an organization opposing the current White House administration , protested against Yoo as the panel discussed the importance of the U.S. Supreme Court in the new presidential administration .
Group members cited former U.S Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Yoo 's alleged advocacy of torture in the Iraq War and support of a powerful executive body as reasons to protest .
" Yoo is moderating tonight , yet he is not non-partisan or neutral , " said Giovanni Jackson , youth student organizer of World Ca n't Wait .
" He is a war criminal responsible for undermining international law and supporting torture . "
The expert panel discussion was part of the Institute of Governmental Studies ' series " Choosing the President : Campaign and Governing in War and Peace , " which kicked off last August and will continue until the upcoming presidential elections .
The panel focused on the importance of not just the next elected president but on the people he or she would appoint as well .
" People do n't vote on judges and the court as an issue during elections , which is a current problem in our voting system , " said William K. Kelley , associate professor of law at the University of Notre Dame .
As the panelist discussion progressed , protestors continuously shouted at Yoo , though he appeared unphased by the comments .
" Legalization of torture in the war must end .
Yoo has authored torture memos and has advocated it , " Jackson said .
" He should not be a moderator and needs to be stopped . "
Panelists from various disciplines included law professor Jesse Choper at Boalt and law professor Susan Estrich from the University of Southern California , said Ethan Rarick , director of the Center on Politics at the Institute of Governmental Studies .
" We 're at a time where our only hope is courageous district judges to stand up for issues surrounding the war on terror , " Estrich said during the talk .
Event organizers said the event was meant for open discussion , although they had hoped it would be respectful .
" We 're fine with people coming to express their opinions even on the panelists and participants but it should not disrupt the event , " Rarick said .
According to a 2017 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , more than 21 million American workers are :
Contingent ( temporary ) workers , either directly employed or employed through temp agencies
Independent contractors
On - call workers without regular hours
Workers employed through contract firms
None of these workers earns regular , predictable salaries .
Nor do millions more part - time workers whose hours – and paychecks – are at their scheduling managers ’ mercy , or commissioned workers whose income fluctuates due to forces beyond their control .
While budgeting might not be brain surgery , it ’s a lot more difficult when you do n’t know exactly how much you ’ll take home each month .
I would know ; I have n’t held a salaried job in years , and although time has improved my irregular - income budgeting skills , I still miss the mark some months .
If your income varies from month to month , here ’s how to build a budget that meets your needs , as well as some tips for staying within that budget .
Step - by - Step Guide to Budgeting on Variable Income
If you ’re a non-salaried worker – a solopreneur , freelancer , contingent employee , or someone who owns a seasonal business – then this step - by - step guide to building a realistic , sustainable budget on an irregular income may work for you .
I say “ may ” because the non-salaried workforce is dizzyingly diverse , so it ’s impossible to account for every unique financial circumstance within that category .
You may find that a modified version of this approach – or something entirely different – works better for you .
But this is a good place to start .
1. Add Up Your Non-Discretionary Spending
First , add up your non-discretionary spending .
This is the budgetary baseline that , for the most part , is fixed and non-negotiable .
Non-discretionary expenses include :
Housing .
This category covers rent or mortgage escrow payments .
Mortgage escrow typically includes principal and interest , property taxes , homeowners insurance , and perhaps homeowners association dues .

Insurance .
This category may include premiums for auto insurance , renters insurance , health insurance , life insurance , and disability insurance .
If they ’re not withheld from your paycheck , you may include contributions to health savings accounts , flexible spending accounts , and other tax - advantaged accounts designed to cover non-discretionary expenses .

Debt Service .
This category may include installment loans , such as secured auto loans and unsecured personal loans , and revolving debt , such as credit cards and home equity lines of credit .
It ’s always advisable to pay your credit cards in full each month , rather than making just the minimum payment .
If you use rewards credit cards for everyday spending , you ’ll need to pay those bills by their due dates each month , or interest and late payment charges could throw your budget out of whack .

Child Care .
This category may include day care , nanny or au pair care , and babysitter pay .
For older children , it may include school tuition and fees as well .

For older children , it may include school tuition and fees as well .
Taxes .
Many non-salaried workers are n’t subject to tax withholding .
If you ’re in this boat , you may be obligated to make quarterly estimated tax payments to federal or state revenue authorities or both , though you can wait until the tax filing deadline and make lump - sum payments if you ’re willing to pay the requisite late payment penalties .
Divide your quarterly estimated tax payments by three to find your monthly tax obligation , then set those funds aside in a high yield savings account .
If you ’ve merged finances with a partner or spouse , include that person ’s expenses in your budget calculations as well .
You ’ll also include their income , irregular or not , in your income calculations .
2. Calculate Your Average Monthly Discretionary Spending
Next , calculate your average monthly discretionary spending .
If your income is seasonal , meaning you receive the bulk of it in just a few months out of the year , look back 12 months to capture the entire cycle .
Even if your income exhibits no real seasonal patterns , looking back at least 12 months makes for a bigger sample size and , potentially , a more accurate average .
To find your total monthly discretionary spending , pore over statements from every account you use for everyday spending .
These might include :
The checking account tied to your debit card
Any credit cards you use regularly
Any reloadable prepaid cards you use regularly
If you primarily use cash for everyday spending , add up your bank account withdrawals , then subtract any cash left on hand at the end of each month .
Calculate your discretionary spending for each month in the period you ’re reviewing , add each month ’s discretionary spending , and then divide that total by the number of months in the period .
The result is your average monthly discretionary income .
If your average monthly income – which you ’ll calculate in the next step – reveals that you ’re spending too much each month , you ’ll look to trim discretionary spending first before taking more drastic measures .
3. Calculate Your Average Monthly Income
Next , calculate your average monthly income .
Pore over your bank account statements to determine your actual income – not invoiced payments due or pending commissions , both of which may exceed the actual income you receive in any given month – over the same period .
Add in income from your spouse or partner , if applicable , bearing in mind that even if your partner earns a regular salary , your combined household income is still irregular .
Add up each month ’s total , then divide by the number of months in the review period to find your average monthly income .
4. Set Aside Savings
Your savings contributions are technically discretionary .
In a true financial emergency , you ’d pause contributions to goal - oriented savings accounts , such as accounts earmarked for a down payment on a house , and tax - advantaged accounts for long - term needs such as higher education or retirement .
However , as a non-salaried worker , you face greater financial uncertainty than someone protected by a traditional employment arrangement .
Saving for the future – and for unforeseen financial emergencies , in particular – should , therefore , be a priority .
You can either :
Set aside funds earmarked for savings and investment accounts out of your gross income , before paying your salary in the next step
Treat savings as discretionary expenses , similar to set - asides for taxes and housing
If you contribute to multiple savings buckets , assign each a priority level .
During lean months , you may need to defer lower - priority contributions .
Pro tip :
If you do n’t have a retirement account set up yet , start today with an IRA or a Roth IRA from You Invest by J.P. Morgan .
5. Pay Yourself a Salary Based on the Sum of Your Expenses
Now , for the fun part : paying yourself .
For the best results , deposit your “ salary , ” drawn from last month ’s income , into the checking account you use for day - to - day spending – or the one you use to pay off the credit cards you use for day - to - day spending .
Do this on the first day of each month .
Your salary should be the bare minimum necessary to cover your monthly discretionary and non-discretionary expenses .
If you consistently earn much more than you spend , or your spending varies little from month to month , you may feel comfortable paying yourself a salary equal to your average monthly expenditure .
Otherwise , set your salary at the lowest monthly spend in your review period and adjust your discretionary budget accordingly .
Although you should aim to end the month with almost nothing in your day - to - day spending account – a practice known as zero - sum budgeting – it ’s obviously better to run a surplus than a deficit .
6. Segregate Discretionary & Non-Discretionary Funds
By definition , your discretionary expenses are more important than your non-discretionary expenses .
Formalize this distinction , and avoid the temptation to overspend on the discretionary side , by keeping your funds for the two categories separate , either in two separate deposit accounts or two separate columns on your budget ledger .
If you ’re worried about non-discretionary expenses getting lost in the shuffle , schedule one day each month – perhaps the first – to pay all those bills at once and zero out your non-discretionary spending for the period .
Alternatively , set a calendar reminder a few days before each due date .
Tips for Sticking to Your Budget
By definition , budgeting on an irregular income is an inexact exercise .
After a good month , you ’ll have more than enough to meet your baseline and budgeted discretionary spending .
After an average month , you may have little to nothing left over .
After a really bad month , you may need to trim your discretionary budget to make ends meet .
A sound , lean budget smooths out the vagaries of irregular income and reduces the need for on - the - fly budget cuts and deferred spending – as long as you stick to it .
These strategies can help you do that .
1. Always Save the Excess
Sticking to your irregular - income budget is much easier when you also stick to a basic principle of personal finance : always save the excess .
Have $ 10 left at the end of the month ?
Nice .
Do n’t buy two lattes with it ; stash it in a savings account instead .
Have $ 50 left at the end of the month ?
Great job !
Resist the temptation to treat yourself to a nice dinner and put it away instead .
Have $ 200 left at the end of the month ?
Wow !
You know what to do .
This principle also applies to periodic windfalls , such as an annual tax refund .
The more you put away when times are good , the more you ’ll have to draw from when lean times hit .
2. Maintain Separate Accounts for Revenue & Spending
Non-salaried workers should have at least three FDIC - insured liquid accounts :
One checking account to receive income earned throughout the month ( if you have a formal business entity , this could be a business checking account )
Another checking account to hold funds earmarked for short - term spending , the beginning - month balance of which should equal the sum of your discretionary and non-discretionary budgets
An interest - bearing savings account to hold the difference between your gross income and monthly budgeted spending
This is the minimum number .
Some non-salaried workers prefer to isolate funds earmarked for tax payments in entirely separate accounts ; others maintain multiple goal - oriented savings accounts or certificates of deposit .
But do n’t feel like you have to do too much at once .
If you ’re new to this budgeting thing and typically do n’t have much left over after expenses , start with these three accounts .
The goal here is to create distinct , purpose - based silos for funds that , under normal circumstances , should never commingle .
3. Build an Ample Emergency Fund
An emergency fund is one of the three types of savings everyone needs .
A basic emergency fund should be large enough to replace three months ’ expenses ; the ideal emergency fund doubles that .
These are typically kept in a high yield account from someone like CIT Bank .
Workers with irregular or seasonal income are particularly vulnerable to financial strain .
If you ’re an independent professional , small business owner , or seasonal employee without sufficient emergency savings , prioritize that reserve over longer - term savings and goal - oriented accounts .
Should your income unexpectedly crater , or a major expense arise out of the blue , you ’ll appreciate that cushion .
See our guide to building an emergency fund on an irregular income for more .
4. Look for Ways to Bring in Extra Money
Would n’t it be nice to right - size your budget with the wave of a magic wand ?
Alas , that ’s not how budgeting works .
However , if you have time and talent to spare , increasing your income may prove more fruitful than agonizing over how much to cut your grocery or clothing budget this month .
Money - making strategies and side hustles to consider include :
5. Enroll in Autopay
Absent a financial emergency that demands a draw on your emergency savings , missing a preset payment due date is an unnecessary error that may increase your net expenses if you incur a late payment fee or penalty interest , and it will throw next month ’s budget out of whack .
If the payee reports the missed payment to the major consumer credit reporting bureaus , the lapse may hurt your credit score as well .
Thankfully , this particular error is preventable .
Virtually every corporate payee – such as mortgage servicers , credit card issuers , and utility companies – offers an autopay option .
Many allow you to set your own due date for added flexibility .
For non-corporate payments – for instance , rent paid to the individual or single - member business entity that owns your residence – your bank or credit union probably allows you to schedule recurring bill payments through its bill pay suite .
6. Regularly Re-Evaluate Discretionary Spending
Every three to six months , thoroughly re-evaluate your discretionary spending .
Look for obvious fat to trim , such as a gym membership you do n’t use or a gold - plated Internet - cable - phone package when an Internet - and - basic - cable bundle will suffice .
You can also use Services like Truebill , which will help negotiate lower rates on these expenses .
Comb through bank and credit card statements for egregious one - off purchases like that spur - of - the - moment concert or fine dining experience .
Excise the fat and look for sensible ways to reduce these one - off purchases ; for instance , you do n’t have to swear off dining out altogether , but you can limit fine dining outings to truly special occasions , such as your wedding anniversary or birthday .
7. Use the Envelope System to Control Impulse Spending
If you ’re tired of fighting off the temptation to overspend , the envelope budgeting system can render impulse spending all but impossible .
Envelope budgeting is simple .
Each spending category gets its own physical envelope with enough cash to cover its budgeted amount for the month .
If you spend $ 300 on groceries each month , your grocery envelope gets $ 300 ; if you dine out to the tune of $ 150 each month , your dining envelope gets $ 150 .
When the funds in an envelope run out , you ’re done spending in that category until the following month .
You do n’t have to go all - in on envelope budgeting to utilize its temptation - neutralizing power .
Many “ partial ” envelope budgeters use it for discretionary spending only , while continuing to make non-negotiable payments for things like housing and electricity from their checking accounts .
Final Word
As mentioned before , this is only one possible budget - building process for workers who , for whatever reason , do n’t earn steady paychecks .
You may arrive at a modified approach – for instance , one that emphasizes aggressive long - term savings and minimizes spending with an eye toward financial independence .
Or you may determine that an entirely different budgeting method is warranted .
As long as you adhere to sound principles of personal finance , you ’re free to tweak your budget however you like .
Is your income irregular ?
How do you stick to your budget when you do n’t know how much is coming in ?
Paul campaign requests Nevada caucus delay RAW STORY
Published : Friday January 18 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Says last - minute rule changes have put system ' in chaos ' Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul is asking Nevada election officials to consider postponing Saturday 's GOP caucuses there after discovering what the campaign calls " multiple inconsistencies " in the process .
Paul 's supporters have alleged there were voting irregularities in New Hampshire , although the Texas Congressman decided against requesting a recount .
The Paul campaign released the following statement Friday on the Nevada Caucuses : ARLINGTON , VIRGINIA  Today , the Ron Paul 2008 campaign is calling on the Nevada State Republican Party to re-examine multiple inconsistencies in the Nevada Caucus process , and to consider postponing the caucus , which is scheduled for Saturday , January 19 .
 The inconsistencies , errors and multiple changes in the rules reek of playing politics with the what should be a neutral process ,  said Ron Paul 2008 campaign manager Lew Moore .
 The people of Nevada deserve to know exactly what the rules are and to know that those rules are being fairly enforced .
This has not happened up to this point , and the caucus appears to be in chaos . 
The problem of multiple rule changes is being compounded by other inconsistencies and errors in the process .
Many Nevada Republicans have received postcards with incorrect information about their caucus location , and the Nevada GOP website had incorrect caucus locations listed as late as Wednesday , January 16 .
Additionally , one or more county chairs have expressed concerns over an insufficient number of ballots , and the Ron Paul campaign has heard reports that rural counties are short of ballots , while Clark County precincts were given what is regarded as far too many ballots .
The Ron Paul campaign has learned that the Nevada Republican Party has changed the rules for eligibility requirements for caucusing three times since January 9 .
Last summer when the January 19 caucus was set , the Nevada GOP announced that caucus would be closed and only for Republicans who had registered by December 19 .
On January 10 , 2008 , a caucus director for the Nevada Republican Party reversed the earlier policy and anounced a new standard by stating that any person who asserts that they are a registered Republican in the precinct but cannot be found in the voter rolls that the Republican party has , would be able to participate if they signed an affidavit attesting to the fact that they were a registered Republican .
Then , on January 15 the Ron Paul campaign received communication from the state party that the affidavits would not be used .
However , on January 17 the policy was changed for a third time , as the state party announced that affidavits would be in use throughout the state , subject to the discretion of county central committees and chairs .
The Nevada Republican
Party is changing the rules from week to week , and currently the rules will not even be uniform across the state , as eligibility rules may differ from county to county .
Given the caucus location confusion  with potential caucus participants not knowing where to go  and the new rule effectively allowing anyone to get a ballot , the Ron Paul campaign is concerned that the confusion surrounding the caucus will both disenfranchise voters and make the election particularly susceptible to vote fraud .
Is the Bush administration ramping up for an attack on Iran ?
The signs seem to point in that direction .
On March 11 , Navy Adm. William Fallon , commander of the U.S. forces in the Middle East , retired early because of differences with Washington on Iran policy .
And now , Dick Cheney 's current Middle East tour may be designed to prepare our Arab allies for an imminent " preemptive " war against Iran .
Bush and Cheney have long been rattling the sabers in Iran 's direction .
The disaster they created in Iraq is n't going well , no matter how they spin it .
They may feel that engaging the United States militarily in Iran would make it harder to elect anyone other than the seasoned military man , John McCain .
The Republican presidential candidate just happens to be touring Iraq with Sen. Joe Lieberman , one of the strongest advocates of a U.S. military strike on Iran .
Lieberman is likely on McCain 's short list for a vice - presidential running mate .
Admiral Fallon took early retirement after making comments that contradicted the Bush administration 's aggressive stance on Iran .
Fallon told the Arab television station Al Jazeera last fall that a " constant drumbeat of conflict " from the administration against Iran was " not helpful and not useful . "
After Fallon announced his retirement , the New York Times reported a senior administration official as saying Fallon 's comments about U.S. Iran policy " left the perception he had a different foreign policy than the president . "
If Fallon wants to talk to Iran rather than attack it , then his policy differs from Bush 's .
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm . Mike Mullen , however , has downplayed the significance of Admiral Fallon 's abrupt retirement .
Admiral Mullen proclaimed recently , " In my view , this should not be seen as a sign at all towards any kind of conflict with Iran . "
Perhaps the chairman doth protest too much .
The White House has been spewing pugilistic rhetoric toward Iran .
In spite of the unanimous conclusion of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran is not developing nukes , Bush immediately declared , " I have said Iran is dangerous , and the NIE estimate does n't do anything to change my opinion about the danger Iran poses to the world - quite the contrary . "
( http://marjoriecohn.com/2007/12/bush-still-spinning-nukes-in-iran.html).
News reports this morning announced that Dick Cheney is on a surprise weeklong visit to Iraq , Israel , the occupied Palestinian territories , Saudi Arabia , Oman and Turkey .
High on Cheney 's agenda is the topic of U.S. policy toward Iran .
Connect the dots .
They paint a very frightening picture .

( This article originally appeared in two parts in Game Developer Magazine , March and April , 2007 ) Fluid effects such as rising smoke and turbulent water flow are everywhere in nature , but are seldom implemented convincingly in computer games .
The simulation of fluids ( which covers both liquids and gasses ) is computationally very expensive .
It is also mentally very expensive , with even introductory papers on the subject relying on the reader having math skills at least at the undergraduate calculus level .
In this article I will attempt to address both these problems from the perspective of a game programmer not necessarily conversant with vector calculus .
I ’ll explain how certain fluid effects work without using advanced equations and without too much new terminology .
I shall also describe one way of implementing the simulation of fluids in an efficient manner without the expensive iterative diffusion and projection steps found in other implementations .
A working demonstration with source accompanies this article and can be downloaded from here , example output from this can be seen in figure 1 .
GRIDS OR PARTICLES ?
There are several ways of simulating the motion of fluids .
These generally divide into two common types of methods : grids methods and particle methods .
In grid methods , the fluid is represented by dividing up the space a fluid might occupy into individual cells , and storing how much of the fluid is in each cell .
In particle methods the fluid is modeled as a large number of particles that each move around and react to collision with the environment and interacting with nearby particles .
Here I ’m going to concentrate on simulating fluids with grids .
It is simplest to discuss the grid methods with respect to a regular two - dimensional grid , although the techniques apply equally well to three dimensions .
At the simplest level , to simulate fluid in the space covered by a grid you need two grids , one to store the density of liquid or gas at each point , and another to store the velocity of the fluid .
Figure 2 shows a representation of this , with each point having a velocity vector , and also containing a density value ( not shown ) .
The actual implementation of these grids in C / C++ is most efficiently done as one dimensional arrays .
The amount of fluid in each cell is represented as a float .
The velocity grid ( also referred to as a velocity field , or vector field ) could be represented as an array of 2D vectors , but for coding simplicity it is best represented as two separate arrays of floats , one for x and one for y .
In addition to these two grids we can have any number of other matching grids that store various attributes .
Again each will be stored as matching array of floats , and can store things such as the temperature of the fluid at each point , or the color of the fluid ( whereby you can mix multiple fluids together ) .
You can also store more esoteric quantities such as humidity , for if you were simulating steam or cloud formation .
ADVECTION
The fundamental operation in grid based fluid dynamics is advection .
Advection is basically moving things around on the grid , but more specifically it ’s moving the quantities stored in one array by the movement vectors stored in the velocity arrays .
It ’s quite simple to understand what is going on here if you think of each point on the grid as being an individual particle , with some attribute ( the density ) and a velocity .
You are probably familiar with the process of moving a particle by adding the velocity vector to the position vector .
On the grid , however , the possible positions are fixed , so all we can do is move ( advect ) the quantity ( the density ) from one grid point to another .
In addition to advecting the density value , we also need to advect all the other quantities associated with the point .
This would obviously include additional attributes such as temperature and color , but also includes the velocity of the point itself .
The process of moving a velocity field over itself is referred to as self - advection .
The grid does not represent a series of discreet quantities , density or otherwise , it actually represents ( inaccurately ) a smooth surface , with the grid points just being sampled points on that surface .
Think of the points as being X , Y vertices of a 3D surface , with the density field being the Z height .
Thus you can pick any X and Y position on the mesh , and find the Z value at that point by interpolating between the closest four points .
Similarly while advecting a value across the grid the destination point will not fall directly on a grid point , and you will have to interpolate your value into the four grid points closest to the target position .
In figure 3 , the point at P has a velocity V , which , after a time step of dt , will put it in position P’ = P + dt * V.
This point falls between the points A , B , C and D , and so a bit of P has to go into each of them .
Generally dt *V will be significantly smaller than the width of a cell , so one of the points A , B , C or D will be P itself .
Advecting the entire grid like this sufferers from various inaccuracies , particularly that quantities dissipate when moving in a non -axis - axis - aligned direction .
This inaccuracy can actually be turned to our advantage .
STAM’S ADVECTION
Programmers looking into grid based fluid dynamics for the first time will most often come across the work of Jos Stam and Ron Fedkiw , particularly Stam ’s paper “ Real - Time Fluid Dynamics for Games “ , presented at the 2003 Game Developer Conference .
In this paper Stam presents a very short implementation of a grid based fluid simulator .
In particular he describes implementing the advection step using what he terms a “ linear backtrace ” , which simply means instead of moving the point forward in space , we invert the velocity and find the source point in the opposite direction , essentially back in time .
We then take the interpolated density value from that source ( which , again , will lay between four actual grid points ) , and then move this value into the point P . See figure 4 .
Stam ’s approach produces visually pleasing results , yet suffers from a number of problems .
Firstly the specific collection of techniques discussed may be covered by U.S. patent # 6,266,071 , although as Stam notes , the approach of backtracing dates back to 1952 .
Check with your lawyer if this is a concern to you .
On a more practical note the advection alone as described by Stam simply does not work accurately unless the velocity field is smooth in a way termed mass conserving , or incompressible .
Consider the case of a vector field where all the velocities are zero except for one .
In this situation the velocity cannot move ( advect ) forward through the field , since there is nothing ahead of it to “ pull ” it forward , instead the velocity simply bleeds backwards .
The resultant velocity field will terminate at the original point , and any quantities moving through this field will end up there .
This problem is solved by adding a step to the algorithm termed projection , which is basically smoothes out the velocity by making it incompressible , thus allowing the backtracing advection to work perfectly , and making the paths formed by the velocity be “ swirly ” , as would be the case in real water .
The problem with this approach is that projection is quite expensive , requiring 20 iterations over the velocity field in order to “ relax ” it to a usable state .
Another performance problem with Stam ’s approach is that there is a diffusion step , which also involves 20 iterations over a field .
This is needed to allow the gas to spread out from areas of high density to areas of low density .
If the diffusion step were missing , solid blocks of the fluid would remain solid as them moved over the velocity field .
The diffusion is an important cosmetic step in the process .
ACCOUNTING ADVECTION
If a velocity field is not mass conserving , then this means that some points will have multiple velocity vectors from other points pointing towards them .
This means that if we simply move our scalar quantities ( like density ) along these vectors , then there will be multiple quantities going to ( or coming from ) the same point , and the result will be a net loss or gain of the scalar quantity .
So if the total amount of something such as the density would either fade to zero or gradually ( or perhaps explosively ) increase .
The usual solution to this problem is to make sure the vector field is incompressible and mass conserving .
But as mentioned before , this is computationally expensive .
One partial solution is to make the advection step mass conserving , regardless of if the velocity field actually is mass conserving .
The basis of this solution is to always account for any movement of a quantity by subtracting in one place what is added in another .
Advection uses a source and destination buffer to keep it independent of update order .
In Stam ’s implementation , the destination buffer is simply filled one cell at a time by combining a value from four cells in the source buffer , and placing this value into the destination buffer .
To properly account for compressible motion , we need to change this copying to accumulating , and initially make the destination buffer a copy of the source buffer , and as we move quantities from one place to another we can subtract them in the source and add them in the destination .
With the forward advection in figure 3 , we are moving a quantity from point P to points A , B , C and D .
To account for this we simply subtract the original source value in P from the destination value in P , and then add it ( interpolated appropriately ) , to A , B , C , D . The net change on the destination buffer is zero .
With the reverse advection in figure 4 , as used by Stam , the solution would initially seem to be symmetrically the same : just subtract the interpolated source values in E , F , G and H from the destination buffer , and add them to P .
While this works fine for signed quantities such as velocity , the problem here is that quantities such as density are positive values .
They can not go below zero as you cannot have a negative quantity of a liquid .
Suppose that point E was one source point for two destinations P1 and P2 , both of which wanted 0.8 of E. Now , if we follow our initial plan and subtract 0.8 * E from E and add 0.8 * E to both P1 and P2 , the net effect is zero , but now the value at E is negative .
If we clamp E to zero then there is a net gain of 0.6 * E .
If we subtract 0.8 * E from the source value of E after updating P1 , then when we update P2 it will only get 0.8* 0.2*E , when clearly both P1 and P2 should both get equal amounts , and intuitively here it seems they should both get 0.5*E , and the resulting value in E should be zero , leading to a net zero change .
To achieve this result I first create a list that for each point records the four points that are sources for that point , and the fraction of each point they want .
Simultaneously I accumulate the fractions asked of each source point .
In an ideal world , this would add up to one , as the entire value is being moved somewhere ( including partially back where it started ) .
But with our compressible field the amount of the value in each point that is being moved can be greater than or less than one .
If the total fraction required is greater than one , then we can simply scale all the requested fraction by this value , which means the total will be one .
If less than one , then the requesting points can have the full amount requested .
We should not scale in this case as it will lead to significant errors .
With the mass conservation of advection fully accounted for in both directions , it turns out that neither forward or backward linear advection alone will produce smooth results .
After some experimentation I determined that applying forward advection followed by backward advection worked very well , and give a very smooth and artifact free flow of fluid over a compressible velocity field .
NOW WHAT ?
So , we can now perform both forward and reverse advection in a mass - conserving manner , meaning we can move fluid around its own velocity field .
But even though our velocity field does not need to be mass - conserving , we actually still want it to be , since the velocity fields of real world fluids generally are incompressible .
Stam solves this problem by expensively forcing the field to be fully mass conserving after every change .
This is necessary , since the reverse advection requires it .
The key difference now is that since our advection step does not require the field to be mass - conserving , we are really only doing it for cosmetic purposes .
To that end , any method that rapidly approaches that state over several time - steps will suit our purpose .
That method , and the method of diffusion , can be found in the accompanying code , and are discussed below .
PRACTICAL FLUID DYNAMICS : PART 2
In last month ’s article ( above ) I gave an overview of the nuts and bolts behind simple two dimensional fluid dynamics using a grid system .
This month I ’ll expand upon this , explaining how we can achieve a reasonable level of realism without too many expensive iterations .
I ’ll also continue with my goal of explaining how everything works by using no math beyond basic algebra .
To recap so far : we have a velocity field which is an array of cells , each of which stores the velocity at a particular point ( click example on the right ) .
Remember this a continuous field , and we can get the velocity at any point on the field surface ( or in the field volume for 3D ) , by interpolating between the nearest points on the field .
We also have a matching field of density .
The density field represents how much of the fluid or gas is in a particular grid cell .
Again this a continuous field , and you can get a density value for any point in the simulated space by interpolating .
I then described the process of advection , which is the moving of the values in one field ( say the density field ) , over the velocity field .
I described both forward advection and reverse advection , where the quantities in the field are respectively pushed out of a cell , or pulled into a cell by the velocity at that cell .
I noted that the advection process worked well if you perform forward advection and then follow it with reverse advection .
INCOMPRESSIBLE FIELDS
I noted that reverse advection in particular would only work if the velocity field was in a state termed incompressible .
But what does this mean ?
Well , you might have heard that “ water is incompressible ” , meaning you ca n’t squeeze water into a smaller volume than it already occupies .
Compare this with gasses such as air , where you can clearly be compressed .
Picture , for example , a diver ’s air tank .
The tank contains a lot more air than the volume occupied by the tank .
But if you were to take that tank , and fill it with water , and then somehow push in another pint of water , then the tank would explode .
Water , in fact , is actually compressible , very slightly , since it ’s physically impossible to have a truly incompressible form of matter .
The incompressibility of a material is measured by a metric called a “ bulk modulus ” , For air this is about 142,000 whereas for water , it ’s 2,200,000,000 or approximately 15,000 times as much .
By comparison , the least compressible substance known to humankind , aggregated diamond nanorods , are just 500 times more incompressible than water .
So for most practical purposes , you can imagine water as being incompressible .
So , with water being considered incompressible , then when considering a solid volume of water , there can not be more water in one cell than in another .
So , if we start out with an equal amount of water in each cell , then after moving the water along the velocity field ( advecting ) , we ca n’t increase or decrease the amount of water in each cell .
If this happens , then the velocity field is incompressible or mass conserving .
PRESSURE
You can think of the pressure at a particular node as being the difference in density between a cell and its neighbors .
Now with water being incompressible , the pressure is going to be the same throughout the density field .
If we think of a node as having a series of inputs and outputs during the advection process , then in an incompressible field , the sum of input is equal to the sum of outputs ( Figure 5a ) .
When we move the water along its incompressible velocity field , then the density at each node will remain constant , and hence the pressure will remain constant .
On the other hand , if the velocity field happens to be structured in such a way that for some cells more is going into them then is coming out , then the velocity field is compressible ( Figure 5 b ) .
When the density of the fluid is advected across a compressible velocity field , then the density in individual cells will increase or decrease .
If we simply keep advecting the density , then the density will eventually all be compressed into the cells of the velocity field that have a net gain of input over output .
If we were not performing accounting in our advection step ( as explained last month ) , then there would be an overall net loss in density ( the field is not mass conserving ) .
Stepping back from our abstraction for a second , what prevents this from happening in real - life ?
Well , obviously if more of a fluid flows into a cell than is flowing out , then the density of that cell increases relative to its neighbors , and hence the pressure in that cell increases .
High pressure in a cell creates an acceleration force on the neighboring cells , increasing their velocity away from that cell , hence increasing the outflow rate from the cell , and evening out the imbalance .
As with the atmosphere , fluid flows from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure .
APPLYING PRESSURE
Listing 1 shows the code for applying pressure .
Here mp_p0 is the array that stores the density ( which is equivalent to the pressure , so I actually refer to it as pressure in the code ) .
The arrays mp_xv1 and mp_y v1 store the x and y components of the velocity field .
The function Cell( x , y ) returns a cell index for a given set of x and y coordinates .
The loop simply iterates over all horizontal and vertical pairs of cells , finds the difference in pressure , scales it by a constant ( also scaled by time ) and adds it to both cells .
The logic here is slightly unintuitive , since physics programmers are used to the Newtonian principle that every action has an equal an opposite reaction , yet here when we add a force , there is no opposing force , and we do n’t subtract a force from anywhere else .
The reason is clear if you consider what is actually going on .
We are not dealing with Newtonian mechanics .
The force actual comes from the kinetic energy of the molecules of the fluid which are actually randomly traveling in all directions ( assuming the fluid is above absolute zero ) , and the change to the velocity field actually happens evenly across the gradient between the two points , so in effect we are applying the resultant force from a pressure gradient to the area it covers , which here is two cells , and we divide it between them .
Here ’s an example , just looking in the x direction , we have a flat pressure field , with one cell denser that the rest .
The cell densities are 4,4,5,4,4 .
The gradients between the four pairs of cells is 0 , -1 , +1,0 Adding this to each cell ( ignoring scaling ) , we get : 0 , -1,0 , +1,0 .
See Figure 6 .
Here the cells on either side of the high pressure cell end up with a velocity pointing away from that cell .
Consider now what will happen with the advection step , the reverse advection combined with forward advection will move the high pressure cell outwards , reducing the pressure , and reducing the force .
The fluid moves from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure .
Effectively this makes the velocity field tend towards being incompressible and mass conserving .
If there is a region that is increasing in density , then the resultant increase in pressure will turn the velocity field away from that area , and hence decrease the density in that area .
Eventually the velocity field will either become mass conserving ( mass just circulating without density change ) , or it will stop ( become zero ) .
Listing 1 – The pressure differential between two cells creates an identical force on both cells
for ( int x = 0 ; x < m_w - 1 ; x++ ) { for ( int y = 0 ; y < m_h - 1 ; y++ ) { int cell = Cell( x , y ) ; float force_x = mp_p0 [ cell ] - mp_p0[cell+1 ] ; float force_y = mp_p0 [ cell ] - mp_p0[cell+m_w ] ; mp_xv1 [ cell ] += a * force_x ; mp_xv1 [ cell+1 ] += a * force_x ; mp_yv1 [ cell ] += a * force_y ; mp_yv1[cell+m_w ] += a * force_y ; }
INK AND SMOKE
What we are modeling here is motion within a fluid ( such as air swirling around inside a room ) , and not the overall motion of a volume of water , ( such as water sloshing around a cup .
This method , as it stands , does not simulate the surface of the fluid .
As such , visualizing the fluid itself is not very interesting , since a room full of air looks pretty much the same regardless of how the air is moving .
Where it become interesting is when we introduce some substance into the fluid that is suspended by that fluid , and carried around by the fluid .
In water this could be silt , sand ink , or bubbles .
In air , it could be dust , steam , or smoke .
You can even use the velocity field techniques outlined here to move larger object such as leaves or paper in a highly realistic manner .
Note it ’s important that what we are talking about is a suspension of one substance in another .
We are generally not so interested in simulating two fluids that do not mix ( like oil and water ) .
Games have things that burn and explode , so smoke is a very common graphical effect .
Smoke is not a gas , but a suspension of tiny particles in the air .
These tiny particles are carried around by the air , and they comprise a very small percentage of the volume occupied by the air .
So we do not need to be concerned about smoke displacing air .
In order to simulate smoke , we simply add another advected density field matching , where the value at each cell represents the density of smoke in that region .
In the code this is referred to as “ ink ” .
This is similar to the density of air , except the density of smoke or ink is more of a purely visual thing , and does not affect the velocity field .
HEATING THINGS UP
One final ingredient that often goes along with a fluid system like this is the heat of the fluid / gas at each location .
Sources of smoke are usually hot , which heats up the air the smoke initially occupies .
This causes the smoke to rise .
It rises because higher temperatures mean more energy , which means the fluid molecules are moving faster , which means higher pressure , which means lower density ( remember density is only proportional to pressure at constant temperature ) , which makes the hot air rise .
Now , that ’s a complex sequence of events , but it ’s initially simpler to just model the result , “ hot air rises ” , and have the relative temperature of a cell create a proportionate upwards force on the velocity field at that cell .
We can do this trivially by adding a scaled copy of the heat field to the Y velocity field .
Similarly , rather than attempt to model the effects of heat in the initial phases of a simulation , I found it easier to simply model the expected results .
So , although a flame creates heat which makes the smoke rise , more pleasing results were found by “ manually ” giving the volume of air around the flame an initial upwards velocity , and then letting the heat take it from there .
With more complex systems such as an explosion , the fiddly physics happens in the first tenth of a second , so you can just skip over that and set up something that looks visually pleasing with our simplified physics .
FILTERING THINGS OUT
The simplistic application of forces we perform for acceleration due to pressure ( Figure 2 ) has the tendency to introduce artifacts into the system .
These typically present as unnatural looking ripples .
The way these are dealt with is to smooth out the velocity and pressure fields by applying a simple diffusion filter .
If you use the Stam style reverse advection with projection , then you have to use a computationally intensive filter iterating several time .
But with the inherent diffusion of forward advection , combined with the accuracy of the combined forward and backwards accounted advection , we can get away with a single iteration .
It ’s often difficult to see exactly what effect a change can have on a fluid system such as this .
The fluid is very complex looking , and small changes to parameters often have an effect that is not immediately obvious .
The ideal way to solve this problem is to set up your system so you can run two copies of the same system in parallel , with one having the modified parameters .
The difference can then become obvious .
Figure 7 ( below ) shows such an A/B comparison .
The image on the left has no diffusion filtering , and the image on the right has a single pass of diffusion filtering applied every update .
FLUID IDEAS
I ’ve glossed over a few other important aspects here , but details of these aspects can be found in the accompanying code .
You need to pay particular attention to how you handle the cells that are at the edge of the system , as the differing number of neighbors has a significant effect .
At the edges of a system you have the option of either reflecting , wrapping or zeroing values , depending on what you want .
By wrapping in one direction you essentially get a tiling animated texture in that direction , which could be used as a diffusion or displacement map for the surface of a moving stream of fluid .
There is also the issue of friction .
Motion in a fluid is generally quite viscous .
This can be implemented as a simple friction force that applies to the velocity field .
If there is no friction in the fluid it can slosh around forever , which is generally not what you want .
Different viscosity setting give very different visual results .
There are a very large number of variables that can be tweaked to give radically difference visual effects , even in my rather simple implementation .
It ’s worthwhile spending some time just playing with these values just to see what happens .

While the American economy is free falling into bankruptcy , it is becoming apparent that the American military is becoming more and more desperate to attack the countries that have decoupled their economies from the US dollar .
Going as far as cutting the internet cables , effectively closing off the middle east banking centers in Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , UAR , Turkey and Kuwait , Iran .
Americans were terror struck this week when OPEC refused to increase the oil supply , rejecting outright the proposal .
Also enraging the Americans was Turkey 's refusal to cut banking ties to Iran which allows Iran to do it 's international banking .
Furthermore Saudi Arabia warned Mr Bush not to attack Iran and refused to accept any plan for such attacks arguing he would switch his country 's oil sales to Euros if America persisted .
America was also put in it 's place when they asked Germany for troops to fight in Afghanistan the answer came swiftly and without remorse " NO "
Every nation that has switched to the Euro has come under attack for their sales of oil in Euros opposed to American dollars , Iraq , Iran , Russia and Venezuela .
With Saudi Arabia threatening to switch to Euros , the result of which would crumple the bed rock of American banking . indeed the American economy or what is left of it would disappear over night .
In effect Saudi Arabia holds America hostage .
Russia has put on full alert all of it's military .
it has been dusting off the 600 mega ton bombs and resuming bombing run exercises .
There will be a show down in the middle east , this is certain , what is not certain is which side will prevail or will any side prevail at all .
America being the road block to the NWO may come to find that they are slated for removal by the powers that be , to make way for a one world govt ..
As James Warburg said , " We shall have world govt .
whether you want it or not , the only question is whether it is by consent or by conquest " .
The culmination of middle east events this past week has placed enormous strains on America , who 's people are for the most part unaware of the impending total collapse of their economy .
Former Democratic Senator , and presidential candidate , Gary Hart on HuffPost :
It will come as a surprise to many people that there are rules in politics .
Most of those rules are unwritten and are based on common understandings , acceptable practices , and the best interest of the political party a candidate seeks to lead .
One of those rules is this :
Do not provide ammunition to the opposition party that can be used to destroy your party ’s nominee .
This is a hyper - truth where the presidential contest is concerned .
By saying that only she and John McCain are qualified to lead the country , particularly in times of crisis , Hillary Clinton has broken that rule , severely damaged the Democratic candidate who may well be the party ’s nominee , and , perhaps most ominously , revealed the unlimited lengths to which she will go to achieve power .
She has essentially said that the Democratic party deserves to lose unless it nominates her… .
If Mrs. Clinton loses the nomination , her failure will be traced to the date she voted to empower George W. Bush to invade Iraq .
That is not the kind of judgment , or wisdom , required by the leader answering the phone in the night .
For her now to claim that Senator Obama is not qualified to answer the crisis phone is the height of irony if not chutzpah , and calls into question whether her primary loyalty is to the Democratic party and the nation or to her own ambition .
A Click is Enough
" They 're offering you the exciting opportunity to bleed every penny of your budget every day , advertising against keywords that you did n't want to bid on , " says Dan Thies , a Frisco , Texas - based keyword guru who makes a living counseling search engine advertisers .
" Sure , if I sell Adidas shoes , why would n't I want to get some traffic from people who searched for slippers ?
I mean , it 's not like I 'm trying to turn a profit or anything , right ? "
If you could n't tell , that last bit is sarcasm .
On the other hand , if you 're Google , " automatic matching " is a wonderful idea .
It 's a sure way to boost the bottom line .
There are cases where Google only gets paid if an ad leads to a sale or some other customer " conversion " - the company recently introduced a " pay per action " program - but typically , a click is enough .
Yes , " automatic matching " will turn out well for some advertisers .
Increased clicks will lead to increased conversions .
But it wo n't turn out well for all .
Google Simplifies AdWords
“ If you 're a new advertiser , either you fail or Google makes a bunch of money off you . ”
The trouble is that Google seems to include users in this new program without their approval .
According to Thies , a Google support representative told one of his customers that the onus is on the user to turn the program off .
And most users do n't know any better .
To be fair , Google bills " automatic matching " as a beta .
And Google is certainly committed to keeping " unintentional clicks " down .
But the company bills almost everything it does as a beta .
And there 's no arguing it 's interested in boosting its own revenue .
" Automatic matching " is just the latest in a long list of ways the company misleads advertisers who do n't quite understand the way the system works .
And it has to be said :
An awful lot of Google customers do n't understand the way the system works .
" Even for experienced advertisers , setting up an AdWords account is a real challenge , " says Andrew Goodman , the Toronto - based paid search consultant who wrote the book on AdWords .
" If you 're a new advertiser , either you fail or Google makes a bunch of money off you . "
What Google Does n't Want You to Know
Only Google understands AdWords entirely .
And that includes the self - proclaimed experts .
For one thing , AdWords is epically complicated - as you 'd expect from a system that juggles bids from more than a million advertisers across the globe .
But even if you 're blessed with a brain hardwired for search engine marketing , you can't know all the ins and outs .
Google wo n't divulge the system 's core algorithms .
There 's a good reason for this .
If Google exposed everything , the experts say , advertisers could turn the system itself into a money maker - and ad relevance would go out the window .
" If Google was completely transparent , the bad guys in my industry would game the system , " says David Szetela , owner and CEO of the online ad consultant Clix Marketing .
" And that would lead to irrelevant ad results for the person doing a search . "
The end result is that inexperienced advertisers have no hope of grasping what 's what - or even coming close .
Naturally , when these advertisers sign up for the system , Google gives them an interface that " simplifies " much of that epic complexity .
But at the same time , Google stacks the deck in its own favor .
This may or may not be justified .
But it 's true .
" Hiding the complexities of AdWords makes Google the most money .
There 's the potential for a conflict of interest . "
" You 're kind of at the mercy of Google , " says Adam Audette , founder of AudetteMedia , a boutique search marketing shop out of Bend , Oregon .
" They make everything as intuitive and as easy as possible right out of the gate - and that 's a nice bonus for people who do n't know have a lot of experience with Adwords .
But on the flip side , hiding the complexities of AdWords makes Google the most money .
There 's at least the potential for a conflict of interest . "
By default , AdWords saddles users with several features that behave a lot like the new " automatic match . "
They serve Google 's needs without necessarily serving the advertiser's .
What 's more , in fashioning algorithms that weed out so - called " bad actors , " Google may force legitimate users into bidding ridiculously high amounts just to participate in the AdWords auction .
" I 've got a whole staff of Cal Tech and Rice and Baylor engineers who sit here and do nothing but track what Google is doing , " says Erick Herring , vice president of engineering at Adapt , a Pasadena , California company that offers a online service for confused AdWords users .
" What is the poor end marketer to do ?
Many only do what Google wants them to do , which is tell Google what their site is about , give Google money , and hope they do n't go out of business before the clicks start converting . "
Ray and I were both lucky .
We both own ‘ launch day ’
Wii’s and I ’d be lying if I said I was n’t a tad worried that Super Smash Bros .
Brawl would n’t work on my Wii.
Ray had his Wii repaired last year when things started going haywire playing Mario Strikers Charged , so his Wii was probably cleaned and looked over then .
Mine did have an unfortunate accident a couple months ago ( involving lots of shattered glass and a poorly made TV stand ) , but it ’s a trooper and has n’t so much as hiccuped in my time with the game .
I played a few online matches with Ray last night and afterwards told him that I ’m definitely now a fan .
I always appreciated the Smash Bros. series and knew that Brawl would be a quality game , but I worried that maybe it just was n’t for me .
I ’m glad I was wrong because I ’ve already had a blast playing against some of you out there and we ’re only a few days in !
Other states have their own problems .
Kentucky has its largest budget crisis in state history , sparked by the movement of manufacturing jobs overseas .
New York ’s budget has felt the wounds delivered by its mercurial friend Wall Street .
Some states are filling holes in their current budgets as they look toward the next fiscal year  or in the case of states that operate on two - year budget cycles , in the face of dire predictions about future revenues .
In most cases , states have moved to cut state spending , particularly in education .
Ms. Lav said that eight states are cutting into the budgets for higher education , and nine states are cutting into their financing for primary and secondary education .
( There is some overlap between those two groups . )
Delaware will not finance new school construction , and in Arizona , where school enrollment continues to explode , the Legislature , which wants to continue to pay cash to build schools , is fighting the governor , who would prefer to borrow for that construction in light of the state ’s woes .
“ Most places do n’t have to build a school every year , ” said Barrett Marson , the spokesman for the Arizona House Republicans .
“ We have to . ”
To help close a $ 600 million budget gap in Virginia , the state made hundreds of thousands of dollars in cuts at universities , including dorm cleaning staff , library budgets and graduate assistantships .
( The governor wrote the state a check , giving back 5 percent of his salary , to help balance the books . )
In California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s proposed budget for 2008 - 9 includes a $ 4.4 billion cut in public education , the largest ever considered in the state .
School districts , preparing for next year ’s budgets , are already contemplating cuts to their staff .
In the Alameda school district in Northern California , trustees voted to reduce the $ 83.7 million budget by cutting $ 200,000 to the sports programs , eliminating music programs for all children below fourth grade and increasing class sizes in ninth grade to an average of 29 students , up from 20 .
Turkey is engaged in a bold and profound attempt to rewrite the basis for Islamic sharia law while also officially reinterpreting the Qur'an for the modern age .
The exercise in reforming Islamic jurisprudence , sponsored by the modernising and mildly Islamic government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the prime minister , is being seen as an iconoclastic campaign to establish a 21st century form of Islam , fusing Muslim beliefs and tradition with European and western philosophical methods and principles .
The result , say experts following the ambitious experiment , could be to diminish Muslim discrimination against women , banish some of the brutal penalties associated with Islamic law , such as stoning and amputation , and redefine Islam as a modern , dynamic force in the large country that pivots between east and west , leaning into the Middle East while aspiring to join the European Union .
A team of reformist Islamic scholars at Ankara University , acting under the auspices of the Diyanet or Directorate of Religious Affairs , the government body which oversees the country 's 8,000 mosques and appoints imams , is said to be close to concluding a " reinterpretation " of parts of the Hadith , the collection of thousands of aphorisms and comments said to derive from the prophet Muhammad and which form the basis of Islamic jurisprudence or sharia law .
" One of the team doing the revision said they are nearly finished , " said Mustafa Akyol , an Istanbul commentator who reflects the thinking of the liberal camp in Erdogan 's governing AK party .
" They have problems with the misogynistic hadith , the ones against women .
They may delete some from the collection , declaring them not authentic .
That would be a very bold step .
Or they may just add footnotes , saying they should be understood from a different historical context . "
Fadi Hakura , a Turkey expert at Chatham House , described the project as an attempt to make Turkish Sunni Islam " fully compatible with contemporary social and moral values .
" They see this not as a revolution , but as a return to the original Islam , away from the excessive conservatism that has stymied all reforms for the last few centuries .
It 's somewhat akin to the Christian reformation , although not the same . "
Under the guidance of Ali Bardokoglu , the liberal Islamic scholar who heads the religious directorate and was appointed by Erdogan , the Ankara theologians are writing a new five - volume " exegesis " of the Qur'an , taking the sacred text apart forensically , rooting it in its time and place , and redefining its message to and relevance for Muslims today .
They are also ditching some of the Hadith , sayings ascribed to and comments on the prophet collected a couple of hundred years after his death .
A Roman Catholic Jesuit expert on Turkey and Islam , Felix Koerner , is working with the Ankara professors , reportedly schooling them in the history of western religious and philosophical change and how to apply the lessons of historical Christian reform movements to modern Islam .
" This is really a synthesis of modern European critical thought and Muslim Ottoman Koranic tradition , " said Koerner .
" There is also a political agenda .
With this government there is more confidence in these modern theologians . "
Erdogan insists his AK party , in a country that is constitutionally secularist , is a Turkish Muslim equivalent of a European Christian democratic party - traditionalist , conservative , based on religious values , but democratic , tolerant , and liberal .
With Spain and the Zapatero government , he is pushing an " Alliance of Civilisations " aimed at a rapprochement between the Muslim and western worlds .
After years of fighting the militantly secularist Turkish establishment , he has just succeeded in lifting the ban on Islamic headscarves for girls in higher education .
His many opponents decry it as part of Turkey 's slide away from secularism down the slippery slope of Islamism .
Sources say the Islamic reform project is so ambitious and so fundamental it will take years to complete , but that it is already paying dividends - abolition of the death penalty , a campaign against honour killings , and the training and appointment of several hundred women as imams .
At a glance
The Hadith are narrations of the life of the prophet Muhammad and his companions and are considered an important source of material on religious practice , law , history and biography .
Hadith relate what the prophet said , did or liked .
Most Muslims consider the Hadith to be an essential addition to and clarification of the Qur'an .
In Islamic jurisprudence the holy book contains guidelines about the behaviour expected from Muslims but there are no specific rules on many matters .
Hadith influence around 90 % of sharia , or Islamic law , and the most controversial ones concern the violent punishments meted out to adulterers and apostates , the role and treatment of women and jihad .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Supporters of a third - party presidential bid by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg began a 50 - state petition drive on Tuesday seeking to “ draft ” the mayor , a billionaire who is edging closer to entering the race while continuing to deny he is a candidate .
The petition effort was announced by two veteran political hands who say the current system in Washington is broken and needs a nonpartisan , pragmatic leader like Mr. Bloomberg .
Gerald Rafshoon , a former spokesman for President Jimmy Carter , and Doug Bailey , a longtime Republican consultant , are not the first to start an online petition drive for Mr. Bloomberg , but their move comes at the height of the primary season .
They filed with the Federal Election Commission and the I.R.S. to start the draft - Bloomberg effort .
“ He ’d be a very unique candidate for a very unique time , ” Mr. Rafshoon said .
Mr. Bloomberg , a 65 - year - old Democrat - turned - Republican - turned - independent , continues to say that he is not a candidate , but he has been polling and conducting a voter analysis in every state as he decides whether to make a bid for president .
The greeting outside Ward African Methodist Episcopal Church on Saturday was meant to send a clear message that their special guest and keynote speaker could feel at home .
Wangari Muta Maathai , the founder of Kenya ’s Green Belt Movement and the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize , received fresh bouquets of flowers as she walked to the church , down a street filled with the musical sounds of ululating women dancing to the rhythms of African drummers .
In Los Angeles , the city ’s gritty environment is often talked about as something to be survived -- not something to be saved .
But Maathai delivered a different message at the pulpit at 1177 W. 25th St. , talking about simple things that can be done , such as recycling , planting trees , changing light bulbs and using public transportation .

“ It does n’t have to start with big things ; start with small things , start with ourselves , ” she said .
Maathai ’s appearance in Los Angeles was part of an Ecological Justice Day of Awakening sponsored by the Women ’s Global Resource and Development Initiative , an organization that seeks to promote self - esteem in women and children through self - help projects around the globe .
“ When you are talking about healing the earth , you are talking about healing the quality of life for all who share in the earth , ” said the Rev. Cecelia Williams Bryant , executive director of the organization .
Minority communities in Los Angeles , Bryant said , need to look at the rise in asthma that stems from air pollution , and childhood obesity as an outgrowth of fast food diets .
“ Children are full , but not well - fed .
If you send children to school hungry and ill - equipped and tired , you are sending them as fodder to respond negatively to a stressful environment . ”

In addition to honoring Maathai , the program paid tribute to Anna Marie Carter , a local environmentalist known as “ The Seed Lady ” for her work promoting organic gardening in Watts and Long Beach .
“ We are kindred spirits , ” Carter said of Maathai .
“ We do the same work , but on opposite sides of the planet . ”
As part of the event , Million Trees L.A. , a joint project of the city and community groups , distributed free trees to those in attendance .
In front of an audience of more than 300 people , L.A. City Councilman Bernard Parks welcomed Maathai and described her as a courageous woman who had risked her life on several occasions to save the environment .

Maathai ’s campaign against deforestation also touches on issues such as poverty , malnutrition , corruption , women ’s low economic status and the lack of media freedom in Kenya .
She has also criticized the negative images of Africa .
She studied biological sciences in Kansas and earned a master ’s in science from the University of Pittsburgh in the 1960s .
She founded Green Belt Movement in 1977 , in a small nursery in her backyard in Kenya .
She has been arrested several times for her environmental campaigning and once was beaten unconscious by police .
During her hourlong presentation at the church , Maathai gave a history of the Peace Prize , which was established by Alfred Nobel , the inventor of dynamite , in 1895 and first awarded in 1901 .
Maathai , who won in 2004 , has led members of the Green Belt Movement , mostly women , in planting more than 30 million trees to counter the effects of deforestation .
The campaign has created thousands of jobs while providing a sustainable source of firewood for families .
Maathai traced the roots of her environmental activism to the 1960s , when she came to study in the United States in the midst of the nation ’s civil rights movement .
When she returned to Kenya , she found the demands for lumber by the timber industry were resulting in widespread deforestation .
The soil was drying up , and farmers were having a difficult time growing crops .

“ We can live in a home without furniture , but we cannot live in a place where there is no food or water , ” she said .
To take part in the Green Belt Movement , each new member must plant at least one tree .
“ If the tree dies , your membership lapses , ” she said .
In Kenya , the Green Belt Movement has taken up several environmental issues , including the fight to reduce the use of plastic bags .
“ There were so many that people thought it was the native flower , ” she said .

During this trip to the U.S. , Maathai said she wanted to “ try to get young people to understand the value of protecting the environment and the value of thinking about the environment that is not just in their neighborhood but far from where they live .
“ Most communities are concerned about survival and their immediate needs rather than the long - term effects brought by climate change that affect us all , whether rich or poor , ” she said .
“ It ’s important to understand that if things are bad , they can get worse . ”
Maathai delved only briefly into U.S. politics , and never directly mentioned the name of presidential candidate Barack Obama , whose father was Kenyan .
She told the audience that that the world looks to America for direction .

“ You have been a big inspiration , not only in politics , ” she said .
“ I hope you can continue to spread the spirit . ”

A dark chapter in American history begins with the signing of an Executive Order :
United States Executive Order 9066 was a presidential executive order issued during World War II by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19 , 1942 , using his authority as Commander - in - Chief to exercise war powers to send ethnic groups to internment camps .
This order authorized U.S. armed forces commanders to declare areas of the United States as military areas “ from which any or all persons may be excluded . ”
It was eventually applied to one - third of the land area of the U.S. ( mostly in the West ) and was used against those with “ Foreign Enemy Ancestry ” – Japanese , Italians , and Germans .
The order led to the Japanese American internment in which some 120,000 ethnic Japanese people were held in internment camps for the duration of the war .
Of the Japanese interned , 62 percent were Nisei ( American - born , second - generation Japanese American ) or Sansei ( third - generation Japanese American ) and the rest were Issei ( Japanese immigrants and resident aliens , first - generation Japanese American ) .
The Secretary of War ( then Henry L. Stimson ) was to assist those residents of such an area who were excluded with transport , food , shelter , and other accommodations .
Americans of Japanese ancestry were by far the most widely - affected , as all persons of Japanese ancestry were removed from the West Coast and southern Arizona .
In Hawaii , however , where there were 140,000 people of Japanese ancestry ( constituting 37 percent of the population ) , the Japanese were neither relocated nor interned — there were so many that the political and economic implications of such a move would have been overwhelming .
The Japanese were only vulnerable on the mainland .
Americans of Italian and German ancestry were also targeted by these restrictions , including internment , though to a much lesser extent .
(…)
One thing that was remarkable about the internment order was that there was virtually no opposition .
Even people who were generally pretty liberal accepted the notion that internment was acceptable — even desirable .
Interestingly , one of the few voices in Washington opposed to internment was FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover .
By the time World War II began , after nearly a decade of Democratic control of Washington under President Roosevelt , Hoover was one of the few Republicans left with any power .
His opposition to internment is ironic , considering how some labeled his career as one in opposition to civil liberties .

The US bee population fell by about 30 % last year
One in every three mouthfuls has been touched by their tiny feet ; but our six - legged friends are in trouble .
They are getting sick and leaving their hives .
Without bees , food gets more expensive - some products could disappear altogether .
Colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) emerged last year , and by spring 2007 bees were dying in huge numbers - over the year as a whole the total bee population fell by 30 % .
Some beekeepers lost closer to 90 % , and the fear is it will get worse .
Beekeeper Gilly Sherman says : " It 's worse than last year , and last year was worse than the year before , so it 's bad , and there are a lot of good big beekeepers that are having a lot of problems .
" I think we 're coming in for a big train wreck . "
Few answers
He has moved his bees to Bakersfield , California .
The state 's Central Valley is home to the largest managed pollination event in the world - 1.5 million hives are transported there on trucks .
That is almost every commercial hive in the country .
Without bees there would be practically no almonds , and it's the same for many other crops .
Apples , strawberries , even onions , all depend on bees .
Bees are frozen to preserve them for research
Yet despite their importance , there is still no answer to the problem of CCD .
Its causes remain a mystery even after a year of intense publicity .
Part of that is due to lack of funding , say researchers , who rejoiced at the news that Haagen - Dazs , the ice cream maker , is donating $ 250,000 to their cause .
At Penn State University , nestled in the Pennsylvania countryside , scientists spend day and night working on the problem .
Bees are collected and kept at freezing temperatures to preserve them so they can be ground down to show up viruses , bacteria and other pathogens - basically anything that causes disease .
Many different types have been found , so it is proving difficult to know what the main cause is .
A parasite called Nosema ceranae , which infects the bee 's guts , has been found too .
Raj Singh , who made one of the most recent discoveries , says : " We have found some of the honey bees that are uninfected bringing in pollen pellets from the field , and those pollen pellets were actually infected - that 's one of the routes of virus transmission that we 've found . "
But he admits they are far from finding the " silver bullet " and even further from knowing how to stop it .
Limited funds
Entomologist at Penn State , Diana Cox Foster , says it is an urgent problem .
" We do feel that we need additional monies to come in for grants to work on this problem , " she said .
" We also need to have collaboration internationally to address what the role of different pathogens is . "
Beekeeper Gilly Sherman is moving his hives
She acknowledged that a quarter of a million dollars from Haagen - Dazs is n't much when faced with such a mysterious problem , but says better offers from higher authorities are few and far between .
" At the Senate and at the House of Representatives , at the federal level , they have said that they are quite interested and they would like to help a great deal but we have n't yet seen the monies being released for this .
" It is of concern , and hopefully other people will start to see it that way before it hits us in the supermarkets . "
Bees ' influence on supermarket shelves is vast .
As well as fruits and vegetables , it could get as far as beef and dairy products because cows are fed alfalfa - another bee - pollinated plant .
Of course honey would disappear altogether without bees .
More money and more commitment to research are called for to keep this essential industry going .
In a world so dominated by man it may come as a big shock to realise there are some things we cannot do without nature 's help .
In a move sure to bring the polygraph haters out of the woodwork , the US Army is issuing a handheld lie detector to select soldiers in Afghanistan in order to " root out potential terrorists " and help " narrow the list of suspects after a roadside bombing . "
The DoD is n't asserting that the device is perfect , but it 's hoping the detection capabilities are accurate enough to save American lives and sniff out allegiances that may have otherwise gone unnoticed .
Hailed as PCASS ( Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening System ) , the underlying unit is a TDS Ranger that relies on three sensors connected to a respondent and integrated software that uses Green to signify truth , Yellow if it can't decide and Red if it recognizes a filthy liar on the other end .
Nevertheless , we 're certain Lafayette Instrument Company is stoked about the deal -- you know , considering that the Army has already purchased 94 of 'em at $ 7,500 apiece .

Wall Street stumbled Friday after a disappointing first - quarter report from General Electric surprised the market and stoked concern about both corporate profits and the wider economy .
The major indexes fell more than 2 percent , with the Dow Jones industrials giving up more than 250 points .
A weaker - than - expected reading showing consumer confidence at a 26 - year low damped any positive sentiment .
G.E. , which is regarded as a bellwether of big business , said its financial services divisions had been challenged by the slowing American economy and difficult capital markets .
The company , which has units in entertainment , consumer and industrial manufacturing , finance and health care , also lowered its projections for the entire year .
The shortfall at the conglomerate , which is one of the early companies to post first - quarter results , stirred worries of more similarly dreary pictures .
This week , the aluminum producer Alcoa reported disappointing results and the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices issued a profit warning .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Texas was supposed to be a bastion of support for Hillary Clinton in the battle for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination , but it may turn out to be her Alamo .
Her wide lead in Lone Star state polls has disappeared , and experts say it is looking more and more like her last stand against Barack Obama .
In one of history ’s most famous battles , Texas independence fighters tried to stop the Mexican army at the Alamo in 1836 , but they were wiped out by a larger force that overwhelmed them .
In this case , it is not soldiers , but Obama ’s momentum , threatening to do the same thing to Clinton ’s presidential aspirations .
After winning 11 straight contests , Obama , an Illinois senator , has overtaken Clinton in the Texas polls , erasing a double - digit lead she held a month ago .
A Reuters /C-SPAN / Houston Chronicle poll released on Saturday showed Obama leading 45 percent to 43 percent .
The survey had a margin of error of 4 percentage points .
Texas and Ohio will vote on Tuesday in must - win primaries for Clinton , a New York senator .
“ It is Hillary ’s last stand and increasingly looks like it wo n’t be successful , ” said Matthew Wilson , political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
“ At this point , Obama can do no wrong .
He ’s on an incredible ride and the air has n’t started coming out of his balloon yet . ”

Texas , next door to former President Bill Clinton ’s home state of Arkansas , was supposed to be Clinton country .
The Clintons forged strong ties to Texas Democrats while working in the state during the 1972 presidential campaign of George McGovern and had historic ties to black and Hispanic voters .
But Obama , according to recent polls , has taken big bites out of the Clinton coalition by splitting the white vote and winning sweeping support from black voters .
HISPANIC VOTES
Clinton is pinning her hopes largely on a big Hispanic vote in her favor .
Hispanics , by some estimates , make up about 20 percent or more of registered voters in Texas , compared to 12 percent for blacks and 66 percent for whites .
A Texas A&M University poll conducted February 18 - 24 , showed Hispanics favoring Clinton over Obama 62 percent to 22 percent .
But a more recent Reuters / C- SPAN / Houston Chronicle poll , conducted Tuesday through Thursday , found Clinton ’s edge among Hispanics had dropped to 55 percent , versus 33 percent for Obama .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Texas A&M political scientist Sylvia Manzano said Obama has gained Hispanic support because he has had two weeks since the last primaries to campaign in Texas .
“ What we ’ve seen in the rest of the country is that the longer he has in a state , the more support he gets , ” Manzano said .
Obama got help in strongly Hispanic south Texas last week from U.S. Sen .
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , who sang a song in fractured Spanish at a rally in Laredo .
But the Clinton family , including daughter Chelsea , is working hard to shore up Hispanic support .
“ There was a Clinton in south Texas every day last week , ” Manzano said .
A record turnout is expected throughout the state , where long lines have marked early voting .
Armed police officers will be stationed at polling places in San Antonio because such big crowds are expected .
With John McCain well ahead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination , and because Texans can vote in either party ’s primary , Republicans have been voting in the Democratic race , University of Houston political scientist Richard Murray said .
Most are voting for Obama because they want to keep Clinton out of the White House , he said .
“ We ’ve always had our quota , plus some , of Hillary haters .
T hey think they can drive a stake through her presidential heart , and they are hammering away with gusto , ” Murray said .
What are the physical sensations you associate with hunger ?
For most people these sensations include stomach grumbling , headaches , light - headedness , shakiness , irritability , fatigue , and inability to focus .
Since eating removes the symptoms , they are mistakenly believed to be signs of hunger .
The resulting overeating behavior , to reduce these physical sensations , undermines any attempt to lose weight .
Understanding true hunger could be a key factor in reversing this trend .
Are these sensations truly signs of hunger ?
Conventional wisdom , and even medical textbooks , would suggest that they are .
I disagree .
In my experience treating thousands of patients and guiding them through transitioning to a nutrient - dense , plant - based ( Nutritarian ) diet , I have observed that my patients ’ perceptions of hunger change after their diets improve — feelings of hunger become less frequent , less uncomfortable , and are mainly felt in the mouth and throat ( “ true hunger ” ) rather than the head and stomach .
I have documented and published these results ( titled “ Changing perceptions of hunger on a high nutrient density diet ” ) in Nutrition Journal , a peer - reviewed publication that encourages scientists and physicians to publish results that challenge current models , tenets or dogmas .
My data does just that — these results argue for a complete re-evaluation of our definition of human hunger .
Key results from this study :
“ Hunger pains ” were experienced less often on a high nutrient - density diet .
Discomfort between meals or upon a skipped meal was experienced less often on a nutrient - dense , plant - based diet .
80 % of respondents reported that their experience of hunger had changed upon following a high nutrient - density diet .
Irritability and decline in mood were experienced less often on a high nutrient - density diet .
A nutrient - dense , plant - base diet was associated with more feelings of hunger in the mouth and throat and less in the head and stomach .
Conclusion : Enhancing the micronutrient quality of the diet leads to changes in the experience of hunger and a reduction in uncomfortable symptoms associated with hunger despite a lower caloric intake .
1
So if stomach grumbling , headaches , and light - headedness a few hours after a meal are not really hunger , what are they ?
The typical Western diet is characterized by high - calorie processed foods , oils , sweeteners , and animal products and is low in phytochemicals and other micronutrients .
There is evidence that such a diet , low in micronutrients and phytochemicals , results in inflammation , oxidative stress , and accumulation of toxic metabolites .
2- 4
When digestion is complete , the body begins to mobilize and eliminate waste products , causing uncomfortable symptoms .
If we allow waste metabolites to build up by eating unhealthy foods , we will feel discomfort when the body attempts to mobilize and remove these wastes .
I propose that these sensations are actually symptoms of detoxification and withdrawal from an unhealthy diet , lacking in crucial micronutrients .
I call this Toxic Hunger .
Scientists now know that unhealthy food has effects on the brain similar to those of addictive drugs .
Healthy food does not produce withdrawal symptoms — when the body is given vegetables , fruits , beans , nuts and seeds , there is nothing to detoxify .
This is why so many diets fail .
Simply restricting portions of the same disease - causing foods does not resolve the symptoms of toxic hunger .
In addition to being effective for weight loss , a nutrient - dense , plant based ( Nutritarian ) diet has now been scientifically shown to change the perception of hunger , getting people in touch with true hunger ( felt in the throat ) .
The function of true hunger is to prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue for energy ; true hunger is a signal that directs the body to the precise amount of calories needed to maintain a healthy weight .
A Nutritarian diet , if widely adopted , could bring millions of people in touch with true hunger and stop the proliferation of obesity and preventable chronic disease .

Learning a shy " hola " or " bonjour " is as far as many pupils get in speaking a foreign language .
But those at Newbury Park Primary are a little more ambitious .
Children there learn key phrases in more than 40 languages - all spoken fluently by one or more pupils at the school .
By the time they leave for secondary school , they boast far more than a mere smattering of French or Cantonese .
Scroll down for more ...
Multilingual : Pupils teach their friends phrases in Sanskrit ( left ) and Nepali ( right )
They can say something in everything from Afrikaans to Hebrew , Japanese to Norwegian .
Teachers say Newbury Park's " language of the month " programme has also helped tackle the sense of alienation felt by newcomers to the school in Redbridge , East London .
In little more than a decade , the proportion of pupils at the school who do not speak English at home has doubled to 80 per cent .
The biggest ethnic group are Tamils who have fled the civil war in Sri Lanka .
" You have 250 Tamil children in the school .
It is just polite to greet them in their own language and recognise their culture , " said teacher Joe Debono , who runs the language scheme .
" And it is a way of celebrating the ethnic diversity of the school and not seeing it as a problem . "
Scroll down for more ...
Languages covered under the programme - and spoken by at least one pupil - include Spanish , Swahili and dialects originating in India and Africa .
Some of the pupils already speak more than one language .
Many came to Britain via other European countries including Norway , France and Germany , adding to the diversity of the " language of the month " list .
The school is even considering adding Latin to the list since it is thought by many experts to help children master any language .
Under the scheme , a child is selected every month to present lessons in their native tongue .
Seven - year - old Aneeka Bhatturai , whose family is from Nepal , is the current " language teacher " .
Mr Debono researches the language with the pupil 's parents and films the child speaking it .
This can then be used in every class in the 850 - pupil school , which accepts children aged from four to 11 .
Scroll down for more ...
Linguists :
The pupils of Newbury Park Primary School can speak up to 40 languages
Classes start by greeting each other in that month 's chosen language .
With help from pupils , Mr Debono also draws up a list of a dozen or so useful phrases .
" It 's the sort of language that would be useful if you were holidaying in the place , " he said .
" It gives the children a lot of self - esteem and they are quite proud they 've done it . "
The classes are in addition to languages studied as part of the national curriculum .
From 2010 , the Government wants every primary school to ensure pupils start learning a language from the age of seven .

Slumming with BASIC Programmers
I 'm a registered user of BlitzMax , an extended BASIC - variant primarily targeted at people who want to write games .
It 's also the easiest way I 've run across to deal with graphics , sound , and user input in a completely cross platform way , and that 's why I use it .
Every program I 've written works perfectly under both OS X on my MacBook and Windows XP on my desktop ; all it takes is a quick recompile .
The same thing is possible with packages like SDL , but that involves manually fussing with C compiler set - ups .
BlitzMax is so much more pleasant .
But still , it 's BASIC .
BASIC with garbage collection and OOP and Unicode strings , but BASIC nonetheless .
It does n't take long , reading through the BlitzMax community forums , to see that the average user has a shallower depth of programming experience than programmers who know Lisp or Erlang or Ruby .
Or C for that matter .
There are misconceptions about how data types work , superstitions involving performance that are right up there with music CDs colored with green marker , paranoia about recursion .
The discussions about OOP , and the endearing notion that sealing every little bit of code and data into objects is somehow inherently right , feels like a rewind to 15 or more years ago .
In Erlang or Python , to report the collision of two entities , I 'd simply use :
{collision , EntityA , EntityB}
forgetting that this can be made more complex by defining a CollisionResult class with half a dozen methods for picking out the details of the obvious .
( For an even better example of this sort of time warp , consider PowerBASIC , which touts a keyword for indicating that a variable should be kept in a CPU register .
It 's C's register variables all over again , the difference being that this is still considered an important optimization in the PowerBASIC world . )
By this point I 'm sure I 've offended most of the BlitzMax and PowerBASIC users out there , and to everyone else it looks like I 'm gleefully making fun of Blub programmers .
I may be looking down my snooty language dilettante nose at them , yes , but from a get - things - done productivity point of view I 'm seriously impressed .
There 's a continuous stream of games written in BlitzMax , games that are more than just retro-remakes of 8 - bit relics , from people with very little programming experience .
There are games with physics , games with elaborate effects , 3D games written with libraries designed for 2D , games written over the course of spring break .
I 'm withholding judgement on the raw aesthetics and playability of these games ; the impressive part is that they exist and are largely written by people with minimal programming background .
( I 've downloaded more than one BlitzMax game that came with source code and marveled at how the entire core of the project was contained in a single 1000 + line function . )
Compare this with any hipper , purportedly more expressive language .
I 've written before about how you can count the number of games written in a purely functional style on one hand .
Is it that language tinkerers are less concerned about writing real applications ?
That they know you can solve any problem with focused grunt work , but it 's not interesting to them ?
That the spark and newness of a different language is its own reward ?
Either way , the BASIC programmers win when it comes down to getting projects finished .

A question mark has long hovered over human transitions from hunting and gathering to farming : did agriculture spread by communication — in archaeological parlance , by diffusion ?
Or did the early practitioners of farming migrate , carrying their technology with them , and displace native hunter - gatherers ?
In the American Southwest , at least , a tentative answer may be in hand , stored in some of the most banal artifacts held by Harvard ’s Peabody Museum : prehistoric wads of chewed leaves called “ quids , ” and thong - like “ aprons , ” fashioned from shredded juniper bark , stained with what is presumed to be menstrual blood .
In an unusual cross-disciplinary collaboration funded by the provost ’s office , the museum ’s director of collections , Steven LeBlanc , teamed with Harvard Medical School ’s Thomas Benjamin , a research professor in pathology whose lab normally studies mouse cancer , to recover DNA thousands of years old from the artifacts .
They focused on mitochondrial DNA , which is passed from mother to child for generation after generation , and which exists in a thousand copies per cell , and extracted it successfully from about a quarter of the quids they sampled , and from a smaller fraction of the aprons .
What they found in their small sample from an early corn-growing culture suggests that in this part of the New World , at least , migrating Uto - Aztecans from Mexico probably did not pass their technology to the indigenous hunter - gatherers , but instead out - reproduced and replaced them .
LeBlanc says this theory — that farmers spread north from central Mexico — was advanced by Peter Bellwood of Australian National University in a controversial 2005 book , First Farmers .
“ Bellwood argues that this is a worldwide pattern of how farming spreads : by migration , not diffusion , ” he explains .
There were exceptions : places where “ the foragers were either dense enough or close enough socially and technologically to the farmers that they were able to adapt .
In Europe , it looks like the Basques are an example , and Scandinavia is an example , ” LeBlanc says .
Different geographical conditions — high altitude , or cold climates not conducive to growing crops — may have momentarily checked the farmers ’ advance , giving hunter - gatherers on the other side of the pause line a chance to react .
In the American Southwest , he notes , there is a Zuni-speaking population on the Arizona - New Mexico border that took up corn farming without being swamped by an Uto - Aztecan influx .
But “ the general pattern suggests that foragers have trouble switching to farming , ” he reports , because becoming a farmer requires more than just having seeds .
It means staying in the same place , storing food year - round , and changing social behavior : foragers , who often live by an ethic of sharing , would have faced “ an enormous potential freeloader problem , ” he says .
Becoming a farmer requires changing that ethic to a policy that says , “ ‘ I am not going to share completely , be - cause I ’ll starve if I do . ’”
LeBlanc describes his study as “ one little piece of a very large chain of investigation , ” but the work has nevertheless demonstrated the efficacy of using DNA analysis on objects held in museums .
“ The FBI does it all the time , ” he says , “ but archaeologically , this is the first time that anybody has ever done such a thing . ”
The earliest artifact LeBlanc and Benjamin studied was about 2,400 years old ; whether the methodology is directly transferable to answer similar questions in Europe , for example , where farming ’s spread began thousands of years earlier , remains unknown .
An answer will also depend on what sorts of objects have been saved from excavations there .
“ What archaeologists think of as artifacts does change over time , ” LeBlanc notes .
Quids — yucca , agave , or cornstalks , probably chewed for perceived or actual medicinal benefit — do n’t appear in collections from some of Harvard ’s earliest expeditions .
“ By 1910 , the concept of what to save was growing , ” he says , and quids were routinely collected , but even as late as the 1960s there were young researchers who did n’t save coprolites .
“ They ’d throw them at each other because they thought it was funny , ” he says .
“ Fortunately , ” he adds , “ there were people who believed such objects were important , knew where they were kept , and continued to keep them , ” says LeBlanc .
“ The key is the quality of the collection . ”

A Viking ship is late in its return home from the newly discovered lands far west .
Winter is around the corner and the weather will soon turn ugly .
It 's imperative that the helmsman maintains the course due East .
But where exactly is Home ?
The sky is becoming more cloudy every passing day .
Most nights the stars are not visible and even during the day the sun has difficulty breaking through .
Daylight is short and during good part the sun illuminates the sky from below the horizon . . . somewhere .
Hanging from the top of the knorrship mast a sailor squints his eyes looking for clues in the brightness of the clouds . . . to no avail .
Then Leif the Lucky spots an opening in the clouds .
He reaches for the pouch hanging from his waist and takes out his Sunstone .
Through the crystal he looks at the small patch of blue sky .
He turns the rock until it becomes yellow .
Next he shouts to the helmsman with his stretched arm pointing starboard . . . towards Home .
Bees do it .
Ants do it .
Did the Vikings do it ?
Can it be that the Vikings used the polarization of skylight as a navigation compass ?
Did the Vikings find their way to America by looking at the sky through a crystal , the proverbial sunstone ?
The Icelandic sagas tell the story of how the Vikings sailed from Bergen on the coast of Norway to Iceland , continuing to Greenland and , likely , Newfoundland in the American continent .
This remarkable sailing achievement was realized circa 700 - 1100 AC , before the magnetic compass reached Europe from China ( it would n't have helped much , anyway , so close to the Magnetic Pole ) .
How did they steer true course in the long voyages out of land sight , especially in the common bad weather and low visibility of those high latitudes ?
In 1967 , a Danish archaeologist , Thorkild Ramskou , suggested that the Vikings might have used the polarization of the skylight for orientation when clouds hid the sun position .
They would have used as polarizers natural crystals available to them , the famous sunstones described in the sagas .
To find the location of the sun they only needed a clear patch of sky close to the zenith to determine the great circle passing through the sun .
The pros and the cons of this theory are the following .
The New Jersey Assembly voted Thursday to abolish the death penalty , poising the state to become the first since 1965 to repeal capital punishment .
The state Senate already passed the measure , and Gov. Jon Corzine , a death penalty foe , pledged to sign the bill , probably early next week .
Those on death row will have their sentences commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
Although New Jersey has not had an execution since 1963 , the campaign has drawn national attention , in part because it was launched by Lorry Post , the father of a murder victim .
Sister Helen Prejean , whose work against the death penalty was dramatized in the film “ Dead Man Walking , ” has made a dozen trips to New Jersey and predicted that other states would follow its lead .
However , recent attempts to abolish the death penalty in Colorado , Montana , Nebraska and New Mexico have faltered , although it seems possible that Maryland , whose governor opposes capital punishment , will go the same route as New Jersey .

Currently , there is a nationwide de facto moratorium on the death penalty , spurred by legal challenges to lethal injection , the method of execution in most states .
The Supreme Court will take up the issue in January .
Austin Sarat , a professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College and the author of two books on the death penalty , said New Jersey ’s action was a sign that the nation was “ in a period of national reconsideration of the death penalty . ”
He noted that both death sentences and executions had dropped in recent years .
Sarat predicted executions would be outlawed state by state but acknowledged that it was “ likely to be a long road to abolition . ”
At a news conference in Trenton , N.J. , Corzine said , “ We would be better served as a society by having a clear and certain outcome for individuals who carry out heinous crimes .
And that ’s what I think we are doing -- making certain that individuals will be in prison without any possibility of parole . ”

One of the death row inmates whose life will be spared is Jesse Timmendequas , who was convicted of molesting and murdering 7 - year - old Megan Kanka in 1994 .
That killing led to the passage of Megan ’s Law , which requires law enforcement agencies to notify the public when convicted sex offenders are living in their neighborhoods .
Megan ’s father , Richard Kanka , was among those who opposed the legislation .
“ For you people to sit there and want to repeal this , in this state , is a mistake , ” he testified at a hearing this year .
“ Anybody that ’s on death row belongs there . ”
But his position was not shared by Post , whose daughter was killed in Georgia .
Post ’s group , New Jerseyans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty , was started in a church basement eight years ago .
It has grown to 12,000 members and has forged an unusual coalition of clerics , legislators from both parties , families of slaying victims and law enforcement officials , all of whom decided that they wanted a change .
Although some members said they still favored the idea of the death penalty , there was a broad acknowledgment that it was not working in New Jersey .
A statewide poll taken this year showed that New Jersey residents , by a margin of 51 % to 41 % , preferred that inmates received life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than the death penalty .

This week , state Senate President Richard J. Codey , a Democrat , said he had voted for the death penalty law in 1982 because it provided for “ exhaustive appeals ” to ensure the right person was convicted .
But since then , although prosecutors have garnered 60 death sentences , 52 have been reversed and there have been no executions .
“ How can I argue the deterrent effect of the death penalty when we have n’t had one ? ”
Codey asked at a hearing in Trenton on Monday .
In late November , family members of 62 murder victims sent a letter to legislators urging passage of the abolition bill .
The relatives emphasized the personal toll the process had taken on them .
“ Capital punishment drags victims ’ loved ones through an agonizing and lengthy process , holding out the promise of one punishment in the beginning and often resulting in a life sentence in the end anyway , ” the authors wrote .

“ A life without parole sentence for killers right from the start would keep society safe , hold killers responsible for their brutal and depraved acts , and would start as soon as we left the courtroom instead of leaving us in limbo , ” the family members said .
Edward DeFazio , the district attorney in Hudson County , N.J. , who has played a key role in the abolition campaign , said in a letter to legislators that the death penalty had cost the state $ 250 million , with little to show for it .
“ New Jersey citizens have borne the brunt of the costs of those death penalty trials and reversals . . . diverting precious resources that could have made our jobs easier and kept the public safe , ” he said .
DeFazio served on a 13 - member commission that issued a 100 - page report in January recommending that the death penalty be repealed .
The group , which also included police chiefs , acknowledged that “ despite our very best intentions , the system makes mistakes and innocent people are wrongfully sentenced to death . ”
Months before the commission report , a man who spent seven years on death row for a killing was cleared by DNA testing .

The lone dissenter on the commission was John F. Russo , a former president of the state Senate who wrote the death penalty statute .
He contended that “ the fundamental problem ” was “ liberal judges and other individuals who have consistently disregarded the legislative will and refused to enforce the law as written . ”
But that view did not win the day .
Former real estate agent Celeste Fitzgerald , the chief organizer of the abolition campaign , said she was pleased with the outcome .
Advertisement
“ We will move forward with a sentence that offers certainty for victims ’ families and is more just , ” she said .
“ We have exposed the flaws in the death penalty and have shown how it harms us in practice , ” Fitzgerald said .
In particular , she said , capital punishment in the court system “ condemns the family members of murder victims to an indefinite life in limbo ” and ties them for years “ to the killer of their loved one . ”

Jane Hamsher has a copy of the full letter from Common Cause to McCain , here ’s a key paragraph :
Similarly , we are concerned that your recent actions in regard to public funding in the presidential primaries may undermine respect for the federal campaign finance laws , especially the presidential public financing system .
Having opted into the system last summer – and having signed a binding certification agreement with the FEC – it is clear to us that you need an FEC vote to allow you to withdraw .
Yes , McCain does needs a vote to withdraw – he alone ca n’t make that call .
McCain ca n’t get a vote .
Because of Mitch McConnell ’s games in the Senate , there are n’t enough FEC Commissioners .
So , McCain is stuck in the public finance sytem — and McCain is breaking the law with every dollar he spends .
You know things are bad when Common Cause has to tell McCain that “ it is vital that you respect the role of the FEC . ”
The so - called “ champion ” of campaign finance reform should n’t have to be told that .
Maybe this letter from Common Cause will perk the interest of the McCain traveling press corps — or anyone in the traditional media .
Do n’t count on it .
There 's a new Wi -Fi provider coming to your local Starbucks , and this one is offering some of its services for free .
Outmaneuvering its smaller rival T - Mobile , AT&T announced on Monday a new partnership with the coffee giant to start offering its own brand of Wi-Fi services this spring .
Once the rollout is complete , those who use Starbucks Cards will also be able to browse for up to two hours free at 7,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S , the wireless provider said .
Additionally , coffee drinkers without a Starbucks Card can purchase tiered access to the AT&T Wi-Fi network at Starbucks for $ 4 for two hours .
Monthly membership will also be offered at $ 20 per month , compared to T - Mobile 's current rates of $ 6 an hour , $ 10 a day , and $ 30 per month .
Monday 's deal also means AT&T is now set to completely replace T - Mobile as the main Wi -Fi provider at various U.S. - based Starbucks locations .
The relationship between T - Mobile and Starbucks will all but end once rollout is complete , a Starbucks spokesperson confirmed .
" This was part of a larger strategic decision on our part , " she said of Monday 's announcement , adding that AT&T was simply an " ideal partner , " who also happens to have provided Starbucks with point of sale and other store operating systems for 10 years .
As such , the Wi-Fi deal was characterized as an expansion of an existing , successful relationship , not a condemnation of T - Mobile and its services .
So where does this leave T - Mobile HotSpot customers ?
According to Starbucks , subscribers will be able to access AT&T's Wi-Fi services at no extra cost due for quite some time due to a separate roaming deal between AT&T and T - Mobile .
" T- Mobile HotSpot customers can continue to access Wi-Fi services at Starbucks now and for years to come , " said Joe Sims , vice president and general manager of the company 's Broadband Products and Services Group , in a Monday statement .
T- Mobile has been the exclusive wireless Wi-Fi provider in more than 5,000 Starbucks since 2001 and has even used this partnership to promote many of its own services .
One of those is the recently launched UMA service , HotSpots@Home , which lets customers with supported phones switch between the cell network and Wi-Fi HotSpots .
And while the relationship between T - Mobile and Starbucks appears to be coming to an end later this year , a T - Mobile representative confirmed with EPICENTER the new deal with AT&T will in no way compromise the company 's commitment to its own HotSpot Network .
If you 're an iPhone owner and are wondering how the new deal affects you , apparently the answer is not at all .
In September Apple announced a new partnership with Starbucks and T - Mobile to let iPhone and iPod touch users to access T - Mobile 's HotSpots for free in order to download and listen to music via the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store .
That iTunes Wi-Fi Store partnership is still in effect , but will contiue under under AT&T's Wi-Fi service .
Other than that , iPhone owners should n't expect any other preferential treatment or special access at Starbucks in the near term .
" This offer is for AT&T broadband customers who can access Wi-Fi in the stores over a Wi-Fi-enabled device .
[ i Phone users ] who are not broadband subscribers can't access for free at this time , " AT&T spokesperson Brad Mays told Ars Technica .

The extremely luminous afterglow of GRB 080319B was imaged by Swift 's X -ray Telescope ( left ) and Optical / Ultraviolet Telescope ( right ) .
This was by far the brightest gamma-ray burst afterglow ever seen .

Gamma - Ray Bursts are the most powerful explosive events in the Universe .
They occur in far - off galaxies and so are usually faint .
But on the morning of March 19th 2008 the Swift satellite found a burst which was so bright it could have been seen without binoculars or a telescope even though it was seven thousand times further away than the Andromeda galaxy .
The burst was discovered by the Swift satellite on a fantastic day for GRB hunters .
Swift typically finds only two a week ; but for the first time Swift found five bursts within 24 hours .
The second burst of the day is the new record holder .
The enormous energy released in the explosion – brighter than the light from all of the stars in five million Milky Way Galaxies – was caused by the death of a massive star which collapsed to form a black hole .
Dr. Julian Osborne of the University of Leicester , lead investigator for the Swift UK Science Data Centre , said “ It ’s great to find so many GRBs in one day , and the discovery of the brightest burst ever seen will allow us to explore this incredible explosion in exquisite detail . ”
The location of the burst was rapidly pinpointed using the UK - built X-ray and Optical cameras on Swift .
Dr. Paul O’Brien , also of the University of Leicester and a member of the Swift Science Team said , “ The explosion happened at a distance of over twenty billion light years from Earth .
To detect a naked eye object from such a distance really is extraordinary . ”
Astronomers around the world are now observing the decaying glow from this burst as it fades away .
These include UK teams from the Universities of Leicester , Warwick and Hertfordshire using the Gemini-North Telescope in Hawaii and the Liverpool John Moores University using the Liverpool Telescope on La Palma in the Canary Islands .
Professor Nial Tanvir , of the University of Leicester , said : “ Our Gemini observations allowed us to measure the distance to the GRB , and to investigate the behaviour of gas close to the burst as it was blasted by the energy of the explosion ” .

MONROE TOWNSHIP , N.J. 
Some men retire to a life of anonymity .
Not Ben - Ami Kadish .
Pick up a random copy of the newsletter for the Ponds , the retirement community here where Mr. Kadish lives with his wife , Doris .
Here is Mr. Kadish , a former military engineer arrested Tuesday on charges of spying for Israel a generation ago , delivering the latest duplicate bridge results :
He and Doris were East - West winners on Dec. 1 , 2006 .
There he is , reporting in his regular Jewish War Veterans column on a successful outing to the Veterans Memorial Home in Menlo Park , where he and some fellow former soldiers held a bingo game and admired the new reclining wheelchairs they had bought for the residents with money from selling Veterans Day poppies .
And there he is on Page 19 , in Irene Eisenberg ’s Yiddish Club column , in which she thanks Mr. Kadish , the club ’s co-founder , and other members of the hospitality committee “ for the bang - up job they always do . ”
There seemed to be no end to Mr. Kadish ’s public activity .
He organized hospital visits and prayers for the dead , advised acquaintances on how to buy Israel bonds , served meals on wheels , persuaded the condominium association to let him build a hut in his yard each autumn to welcome scores of people for the Jewish harvest festival Sukkot .
In his spare time , he tracked down 500 relatives and posted a family tree to a genealogy Web site .
Which is why the notion that he had engaged in espionage 25 years earlier was so hard to swallow for his white - haired neighbors in this gated community of 600 homes set among golf courses and nature trails an hour southwest of New York City .
In 1908 , an asteroid is thought to have entered the earth ’s atmosphere and exploded over a Siberian forest , leveling some 800 square miles of trees in what is known as the Tunguska Event .
If we knew today that another asteroid were on a path to intersect with our planet , what could we do ?
Massimiliano Vasile , a lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of Glasgow , recently concluded a two - year study comparing nine asteroid - deflection methods , rating them for efficiency , complexity and launch readiness .
The best method , called “ mirror bees , ” entails sending a group of small satellites equipped with mirrors 30 to 100 feet wide into space to “ swarm ” around an asteroid and trail it , Vasile explains .
The mirrors would be tilted to reflect sunlight onto the asteroid , vaporizing one spot and releasing a stream of gases that would slowly move it off course .
Vasile says this method is especially appealing because it could be scaled easily : 25 to 5,000 satellites could be used , depending on the size of the rock .
The losing ideas — satellites equipped with lasers ; detonating a nuclear explosion ; pushing the asteroid with a spacecraft , to name a few — might still have their place .
Vasile says improved technologies could make others appealing in the future .
( In March , NASA released a report on “ near Earth objects ” that deemed the nuclear - explosion method the most effective . )
When last I saw Arthur C. Clarke , in March of 2005 , his memory was already fading .
It was late afternoon .
We sat on the patio of the Galle Face Hotel , one of Arthur 's favorite spots in Colombo , Sri Lanka .
It had been nine years since my last visit to his adopted island .
Now I was back working with Mercy Corps , an international aid agency , on a tsunami relief project .
Clarke sipped his tea and stared west , where the Indian Ocean stretched in an uninhibited arc to the coast of Somalia .
" I do n't remember anything about working with Stanley ( Kubrick ) on 2001 , " he said , " or my months at the Chelsea Hotel .
I do n't remember my last scuba dive , or what my mother 's face looked like .
The only thing I remember with any real clarity is the first kiss with the love of my life – and our last words , before we parted . "
Clarke had n't remembered me , either , at our reunion two months earlier .
Despite our 35 years of friendship , he 'd glanced up in bewilderment when I entered his library and approached the desk that served as his command center .
But Arthur was never one to relinquish the upper hand , and opened with an aggressive challenge .
" Have you heard the Titan wind ? "
I shook my head dumbly , a gesture Clarke met with a look of total exasperation .
" Well , then , come here , come on , hurry up … " His impatience was immediately replaced with glee .
" Listen to this , " he said , clicking his mouse .
A static hiss sighed from the speakers .
" That 's it !
Just as I 'd written , 30 years ago .... "
Clarke rides a Chopper outside of " Leslie 's House , " his home in Colombo , Sri Lanka .

A NASA scientist – someone who'd read Imperial Earth as a kid , and remembered a reference to the winds on Saturn 's largest moon – had sent Clarke a recording , just in from the Huygens probe , of the gales blowing across Titan 's surface .
I had no idea such a recording even existed ; to Clarke , it was just another example of life imitating art .
I first met Arthur C. Clarke in 1970 , as a geek of 16 .
A year or so earlier , I 'd spent an entire afternoon ( and much of the evening ) in a Long Island movie theater , watching 2001 : A Space Odyssey three times in a row .
Afterwards , I began to plow my way through every science fiction book Clarke had written .
When I thought I was sufficiently steeped in his work , I wrote him a fan letter .
Clarke , who was in New York completing the manuscript for Rendezvous with Rama , responded with a postcard .
" I'm at the Hotel Chelsea , " he wrote .
" Give me a call ! "
The result of that meeting was one of the longest , and most important , friendships in my life .
During the four decades that followed , Arthur and I would stay in close touch , both of us passionate advocates for a human presence among the stars .
I 'd send him the latest U.S. space stamps , and news of my science studies .
Arthur , who often co-hosted coverage of the space missions at Cape Canaveral , would sometimes pass a picture postcard around a briefing table , and ask everyone present to sign .
One of the cards I received bears greetings from Neil Armstrong and Wernher von Braun , among others .
( Many years later I was able to return the favor by introducing Arthur to a fellow cosmology buff , the Dalai Lama . )
Arthur C. Clarke was one of the most generous writers , and scientists , of this or any age .
His novels and essays hold out hope not just for the survival of humanity , but for our transcendence .
He was a devoted humanist , and rarely refused a request to meet a fan – even casual visitors who simply wished to shake his hand .
( His generosity did have its limits .
Once , in one of my own books , I remarked that Arthur had displayed consummate selflessness by refusing to patent the communications satellite .
I sent him a copy , thinking he'd be pleased .
" You ca n't patent an orbit , " he dryly informed me .
" And the only reason I did n't patent the Comsat was that I did n't know how to build one .
Had I been a bit smarter , I 'd be a trillionaire . " )
But his full contribution will be impossible to evaluate .
Clarke was so influential a visionary , and contributed so much to technological culture , that one can hardly tell where his imagination ends and our reality begins .
From geosynchronous orbits to space elevators , from The Sands of Mars to The Songs of Distant Earth , Clarke 's vision is marbled through the bedrock of today 's scientific zeitgeist .
During the four decades of our friendship , I visited Clarke in Sri Lanka four times : in 1983 , 1993 ( for Wired 1.03 ) , 1996 ( for a book about Star Trek , which blossomed out of Gene Roddenberry 's admiration for Clarke ) , and 2005 .
Each visit to his " technoasis , " in the suburbs of Colombo , was a nonstop encounter with the latest gadgets , books , video clips , toys and jokes on Clarke 's radar .
On one occasion , he spent hours showing me time - lapse animation of the terraforming of Mars ; on another , he turned on a monitor and used a video hookup , connected to his powerful new telescope , to provide the illusion of a trip to the moon .
A master of the lightning joust , a lover of practical jokes and a shark at table tennis , Clarke was one of the most animated people I 've known .
A few days before our last meeting at the Galle Face Hotel , I 'd been riding along the Colombo waterfront with Arthur 's close friend , Valerie Ekanayake .
We 'd spied his vintage Mercedes by the beach , and pulled up alongside .
This would be our second meeting in a week .
Valerie knocked on Clarke 's window , and pointed to me .
" Do you remember Jeff ? " Clarke rolled his eyes .
" I 'd just this minute managed to forget . "
During our final encounter , though , Clarke seemed melancholy and circumspect .
There was no way to avoid a comparison with the beleaguered HAL , who remains self - aware as his magnificent consciousness is slowly dissembled .
As the sun lowered toward the ocean , I understood that Clarke – who never believed in any notion of an external god , heaven or hell – knew that his own mind would soon be going , dissolving into an even larger sea .
We sat in silence , aware that the world was turning , and that this might be our last moment together .
Suddenly , Arthur reached over the table .
" Give me your sunglasses , " he demanded .
" Quick , quick ! " I did .
He grabbed them , and slipped them on over his own .
" This , " he declared , leaning back , " is the best time to see sunspots – if there are any . "
Though it had been 12 years , I clearly remembered the last line of our 1993 Wired interview .
It was Clarke 's chosen epitaph , which he shared with gleeful pride : " He never grew up – but he never stopped growing . "
I watched my old friend as he stared at the sun , studying its face with undiminished curiosity .
You might think that sportsmanship is dead , what with the steroids and signal - stealing cameras in the headlines .
And you 'd be right .
But what you may not realize is that sportsmanship died long , long ago .
In fact , these modern performance enhancers can't hold a candle to some of the ballsiest and outright insane cheats throughout sporting history .

The Spanish Rig the Paralympics
One thing people would never sully with deception is the Paralympics ( which is like the Special Olympics , where people with disabilities compete ) .
Right ?
Who would stoop as low as that ?

The short answer : the Spanish .
In an act of desperation so pathetic it inspires pity , some of the players on the Spaniards ' gold medal - winning Paralympic basketball team turned out not be disabled at all .
Yes , that South Park episode and that Johnny Knoxville movie both turned out to be based on a true story .
Undercover journalist , Carlos Ribagorda , blew the lid off the scandal .
You may assume that only one or two of the overall squad was ineligible , but that would be underestimating the desperation of the Spanish .
A whopping 10 of the 12 members of the basketball squad had no mental difficulty .
They were just athletes that sucked enough to not make it into the Olympic team .

Based on actual events
Did it work ?
The Spaniards were disqualified from the basketball competition and stripped of their title .
There was no evidence of any wrongdoing in other Paralympic events , and we 're going to accept that the rest of them were disabled .
The alternative , which is that most of their athletes were normal and yet only finished third overall , is too sad to contemplate .
Iraq war protesters arrested at IRS headquarters RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday March 19 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Police arrested more than a dozen people Wednesday morning who crossed a barricade and blocked entrances at the Internal Revenue Service building , the start of a day of protests marking the fifth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
A crowd gathered outside the IRS headquarters , chanting This is a Crime Scene ' ' and You 're Arresting the Wrong People . ''
A marching band led protesters down the street near the National Mall and around the IRS building before dozens demonstrators gathered at the entrance .
Protesters blocked the main entrance for a time , but no federal workers appeared to be trying to use those doors .
Police detained 13 people who sat down at a side entrance .
The demonstrators said they were focusing on the IRS because it gathers taxes that are used to fund the war .
Anti-war protests and vigils were planned throughout the day around the nation .
At the American Petroleum Institute in downtown Washington , dozens of protesters held signs reading Out of Iraq '' and No war , no warming , '' and chanted ``No blood for Oil ! ''
Craig Etchison , 62 , a retired college professor from Cumberland , Md. , and a Vietnam veteran , said he has been protesting the war for years .
I 've watched with horror as Bush has lied about this war , '' he said in front of the building .
I 'm appalled at the number of civilians we 've killed just as we did in Vietnam . ''
College students from New Jersey to North Dakota have planned walkouts , while students at the University of Minnesota vowed to shut down military recruiting offices on campus .
This is the first time coordinated direct actions of civil disobedience are happening , '' said Barbra Bearden , communications manager for the group Peace Action .
People who have never done this kind of action are stepping up and deciding now is the time to do it . ''
In suburban Miami , Linda Belgrave , a sociology professor at the University of Miami , and a handful of protesters dressed in black waved anti-war signs at drivers stuck in early morning rush - hour traffic near the U.S. Southern Command complex .
Belgrave said the group planned to lay flowers at the complex 's entry fence later Wednesday morning .
`` This is the beginning of the sixth year of this horror and it's got to end , '' said Belgrave , 57 .
The Iraq war has been unpopular both abroad and in the United States , although an Associated Press - Ipsos poll in December showed that growing numbers think the U.S. is making progress and will eventually be able to claim some success in Iraq .
The findings , a rarity in the relentlessly unpopular war , came amid diminishing U.S. and Iraqi casualties and the start of modest troop withdrawals .
Still , majorities remain upset about the conflict and convinced the invasion was a mistake , and the issue still splits the country deeply along party lines .
Activists cite frustration that the war has dragged on for so long and hope the more dramatic actions will galvanize others to protest .

Abstract
Context Pesticides continue to be used on school property , and some schools are at risk of pesticide drift exposure from neighboring farms , which leads to pesticide exposure among students and school employees .
However , information on the magnitude of illnesses and risk factors associated with these pesticide exposures is not available .
Objective
To estimate the magnitude of and associated risk factors for pesticide - related illnesses at schools .
Design , Setting , and Participants Analysis of surveillance data from 1998 to 2002 of 2593 persons with acute pesticide - related illnesses associated with exposure at schools .
Nationwide information on pesticide - related illnesses is routinely collected by 3 national pesticide surveillance systems : the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ’s Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks pesticides program , the California Department of Pesticide Regulation , and the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System .
Main Outcome Measures Incidence rates and severity of acute pesticide - related illnesses .
Results Incidence rates for 1998 - 2002 were 7.4 cases per million children and 27.3 cases per million school employee full - time equivalents .
The incidence rates among children increased significantly from 1998 to 2002 .
Illness of high severity was found in 3 cases ( 0.1 % ) , moderate severity in 275 cases ( 11 % ) , and low severity in 2315 cases ( 89 % ) .
Most illnesses were associated with insecticides ( n = 895 , 35 % ) , disinfectants ( n = 830 , 32 % ) , repellents ( n = 335 , 13 % ) , or herbicides ( n = 279 , 11 % ) .
Among 406 cases with detailed information on the source of pesticide exposure , 281 ( 69 % ) were associated with pesticides used at schools and 125 ( 31 % ) were associated with pesticide drift exposure from farmland .
Conclusions Pesticide exposure at schools produces acute illnesses among school employees and students .
To prevent pesticide - related illnesses at schools , implementation of integrated pest management programs in schools , practices to reduce pesticide drift , and adoption of pesticide spray buffer zones around schools are recommended .
Exposure to pesticides in the school environment is a health risk facing children and school employees .
Despite efforts of several organizations and laws in several states to reduce pesticide use at and around schools , 1 pesticides continue to be used in schools .
2
Another source of pesticide exposure at schools is from pesticides used on farmland contiguous to school facilities .
However , as a result of the work of the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , advocacy groups , universities , state regulators , the pest control industry , and others , and laws or strong voluntary programs in several states , pesticide use has been reduced in some school districts .
3
Currently , there are no specific federal requirements on limiting pesticide exposures at schools .
Under the Federal Insecticide , Fungicide , and Rodenticide Act , pesticides must be registered with the EPA before they are sold or distributed .
4 The Food Quality Protection Act5 of 1996 amended the Federal Insecticide , Fungicide , and Rodenticide Act , bolstering the protection of children through requiring that pesticides used on foods produce no harm .
However , there are no specific provisions in these laws about the use of pesticides at schools .
1,6
The Federal Insecticide , Fungicide , and Rodenticide Act is often supplemented by more stringent state pesticide laws to protect children from pesticides at schools .
For example , 18 states recommend ( n = 6 ) or require ( n = 12 ) schools to use integrated pest management strategies and 7 states restrict pesticide applications in areas neighboring a school .
7
However , there are still large gaps throughout the country where children may not be afforded adequate protection .

Pesticide poisoning is a commonly underdiagnosed illness in the United States today .
The clinical findings of acute pesticide poisoning are rarely pathognomonic but instead can resemble acute upper respiratory tract illness , conjunctivitis , or gastrointestinal illness , among other conditions .
Detailed description of the diverse syndromes associated with different types of pesticides is available .9
Although some information about acute illnesses associated with pesticide exposures at schools is available , 10,11 there has not been an effort to provide a nationwide summary of this health problem .
To estimate the magnitude of and the risk factors for pesticide - related illnesses associated with exposures at schools , we examined information from state - based pesticide poisoning surveillance systems ( the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ’s Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks [ SENSOR ] pesticides program and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation [ CDPR ] ) , and the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System ( TESS ) , which is a national database of all calls made to poison control centers and is maintained by the American Association of Poison Control Centers .

Methods
Study Design and Participants
School employees , parents , and students who developed acute pesticide - related illnesses from pesticide exposure at child care centers and elementary and secondary schools from 1998 to 2002 were identified ( Table 1 ) .
Data were obtained from states participating in the SENSOR pesticides program ( California , Washington , Texas , Florida , Louisiana , New York , Oregon , and Michigan ) , CDPR ( California ) , and TESS ( all US states and District of Columbia , with the exception of Hawaii ) .
The data used in these analyses were surveillance data and as such are exempt from consideration by the human subjects review board and need for informed consent .
Integrating data from these 3 surveillance systems provides the best available understanding of the problem of pesticide poisoning at schools .
The states participating in the SENSOR and CDPR programs obtain information from multiple sources ( government agencies , poison control centers , and reports from health care organizations ) and conduct active case follow - up.12
In addition , all cases identified by the CDPR are referred to the relevant county agricultural commissioner who investigates the exposure circumstances .
10,12 The TESS data are provided by approximately 67 US poison control centers .
13 Approximately 13 % of their calls come from physicians treating patients who are exposed and 87 % come from patients or their relatives .
12,13
Cases were included if health effects developed subsequent to pesticide exposure and if these effects were consistent with the known toxicology of the pesticide product , as determined by state surveillance professionals ( SENSOR and CDPR cases ) or a poison control center specialist ( TESS cases ) .
The states participating in the SENSOR pesticides program adopted a standardized case definition in 1998 , and CDPR uses a similar case definition .
Briefly , the case definition required information on pesticide exposure , health effects , and evidence supporting an association between the pesticide exposure and the health effects .
A full description of the standardized case definition has been previously published .
12 Identification of TESS cases relied on the experience and judgment of the poison control center specialist managing the specific case .
Multiple cases exposed in a single exposure incident were identified as 1 exposure event .
Exclusion criteria included exposure to substances other than pesticides , suicides , intentional abuse , and malicious use .
SENSOR and CDPR primarily capture work - related pesticide poisoning cases , whereas TESS primarily captures non–work - related cases ( Table 1 ) .
Detailed information on work - related cases was provided by SENSOR and CDPR only .
The SENSOR and CDPR cases were further classified into exposure to pesticides applied on school grounds when indoor and outdoor pesticide applications on school grounds resulted in illness , and to pesticide drift when pesticide drift from applications to neighboring farmland resulted in illness among students and school employees .
For the present analyses , the toxicity category of the pesticide product was retrieved from a data set made available by the EPA .
The EPA assigns acute toxicity category I to the most toxic pesticide products and category IV to the least toxic pesticide .14
Illness severity was categorized for SENSOR and CDPR cases using standardized criteria .15 State agencies classified severity for the cases they identified in 2001 and 2002 .
Two authors ( W.A.A. and G.M.C. ) assigned severity to 1998 - 2000 SENSOR cases , all CDPR cases , and all TESS cases .
16 High severity includes cases in which the illness or injury is severe enough to be considered life - threatening and commonly involves hospitalization to prevent death .
Signs and symptoms include seizures and pulmonary edema .
Moderate severity illness or injury includes cases of less severe illness or injury often involving systemic manifestations requiring treatment .
The individual is able to return to normal functioning without any residual disability .
Low severity illness or injury typically resolves without treatment and is often manifested by skin , eye , or upper respiratory tract irritation .
15
Data quality control procedures included the elimination of duplicates between SENSOR ( California ) and CDPR , and between SENSOR and CDPR combined and TESS .
To detect duplicates between SENSOR and CDPR combined and TESS , a case - by - case comparison was performed when a reporting source for SENSOR and CDPR cases was a poison control center .
Cases that matched each other on state , date of exposure , age , sex , and pesticide name were assumed to involve the same individual .
Such individuals were included only once in the state agency totals .
Six CDPR and 8 TESS duplicates were deleted .
Data Analysis
SAS release 8.02 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) and Epi Info version 3.2.2 ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , Ga ) were used for data management and statistical analysis .
Age was stratified into children ( < 18 years ) and adults ( ≥18 years ) .
Illness incidence rates among children were calculated .
Rate numerators were obtained by summing the number of ill children reported by year , and denominators were obtained from the US Census data17 by summing the number of children in the corresponding state and year .
Denominators were adjusted by subtracting estimates of preschoolers not attending organized child care centers18 and home - schooled children.19
Illness incidence rates among school employees were calculated for SENSOR and CDPR cases only .
Denominators were obtained from the Current Population Survey20 by summing the number of full - time equivalents employed in schools in states and years that contributed to the numerator .
Non–work - related cases ( eg , parents ) and cases with unknown work - related status , which included all TESS cases , were not included in these calculations .
We used odds ratios ( ORs ) to assess whether age , sex , acute toxicity pesticide category , surveillance system , or site of pesticide applications were associated with severity of illness .
Odds ratios , 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) , χ 2 tests , and P values were calculated using the Epi Info Statcalc utility .
SAS release 8.02 was used to calculate the Poisson regression test for trends in incidence rates across the years of exposure .
P≤.05 was considered statistically significant .
Results
From 1998 to 2002 , 2593 individuals were identified with acute pesticide - related illnesses associated with pesticide exposures at schools .
SENSOR identified 147 cases ( 6 % ) , CDPR identified 259 cases ( 10 % ) , and TESS identified 2187 cases ( 84 % ) ( Table 2 ) .
Most illnesses reported by SENSOR ( n = 96 , 65 % ) and CDPR ( n = 158 , 61 % ) were adults , whereas most cases reported by TESS were children ( n = 1831 , 84 % ) .
Among the 2181 persons with known exact age , the mean age for children was 9.5 years ( range , 0.5 - 17.2 years ) and the mean age for adults was 36.1 years ( range , 18 - 76 years ) .
Three cases of high severity illness were identified .
There were no fatalities reported .
The odds of high and moderate severity illness were higher among cases reported by SENSOR and CDPR ( 15 % ) compared with TESS ( 10 % ) ( OR , 1.6 ; 95 % CI , 1.1 - 2.2 ) , among adults ( 18 % ) compared with children ( 8 % ) ( OR , 2.6 ; 95 % CI , 2.0 - 3.5 ) , and among females ( 12 % ) compared with males ( 8 % ) ( OR , 1.5 ; 95 % CI , 1.2-2.0 ) .
Moderate severity illness was more common ( Table 3 ) among those exposed to fumigants ( n = 4 , 40 % ) , herbicides ( n = 41 , 15 % ) , insecticides ( n = 83 , 9 % ) , and disinfectants ( n = 101 , 12 % ) .
Table 4 describes symptoms of high and moderate severity cases .
Insecticides were associated with 895 illnesses ( Table 2 ) .
The most frequent insecticides were pyrethrins ( n = 119 , 13 % of all insecticides ) , chlorpyrifos ( n = 116 , 13 % ) , malathion ( n = 84 , 9 % ) , diazinon ( n = 78 , 9 % ) , and pyrethroids ( n = 47 , 5 % ) .
Disinfectants were associated with 830 illnesses .
The most frequent disinfectants were sodium hypochlorite ( n = 175 , 21 % of all disinfectants ) , phenol compounds ( n = 175 , 21 % ) , pine oil ( n = 104 , 13 % ) , and quaternary ammonium compounds ( n = 81 , 10 % ) .
Repellents were associated with 335 illnesses , including naphthalene ( n = 136 , 41 % ) and diethyl toluamide ( DEET , n = 127 , 38 % ) .
Herbicides were associated with 279 illnesses , including glyphosate ( n = 100 , 36 % ) , 2,4- dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( n = 53 , 19 % ) , and pendimethalin ( n = 40 , 14 % ) .
Information on the toxicity category of pesticides associated with illnesses was available for 1686 cases ( Table 3 ) .
Children were less likely to be exposed to toxicity category I pesticides compared with adults ( 14 % of children and 42 % of adults , P<.001 ) .
The odds of high and moderate severity illness were higher among cases exposed to toxicity category I ( 18 % ) than cases exposed to toxicity category III pesticides ( 12 % ) ( OR , 1.5 ; 95 % CI , 1.1 - 2.2 ) .
The pesticide active ingredients associated with high and moderate severity illness are shown in Table 5 .
Incidence Rates
The overall incidence rate among children for 1998 - 2002 was 7.4 cases per million children ( Table 6 ) .
The yearly incidence rates increased from 1998 through 2002 for preschool children ( P<.001 ) , school - aged children ( P = .002 ) , and all combined ( P<.001 ) .
The overall incidence rate among adults was 27.3 cases per million full - time equivalents ( Table 7 ) , and the yearly incidence rates decreased from 1998 through 2002 ( P<.001 ) .
Illnesses Reported by SENSOR and CDPR
The SENSOR and CDPR results are combined ( Table 2 ) because the case definition and level of detail are similar .
A total of 406 persons were exposed to pesticides in 173 events for a mean of 2.3 cases per exposure event ( range , 1 - 61 cases ) .
Eleven exposure events accounted for 208 cases ( 51 % ) .
The 244 work - related cases were exposed in 155 events .
Occupational Illnesses .
Among the 244 work - related cases , 144 ( 59 % ) were not applying pesticides , 93 ( 38 % ) were applying or handling pesticides , and 7 ( 3 % ) had no information available .
Among the 144 employees not applying pesticides , 96 ( 67 % ) were exposed to pesticides applied on school grounds and 48 ( 33 % ) were exposed to pesticide drift from neighboring farmland .
Sixty - three nonapplicator illnesses ( 44 % ) were among teachers .
Among the 93 school employees who were applying or handling pesticides , there were 41 custodians and gardeners , 26 food preparation workers , 7 teachers , 7 maintenance workers , and 12 unspecified school employees .
Illnesses Associated With Exposure to Pesticides Applied on School Grounds and Pesticide Drift From Farmland .
A total of 281 cases ( 69 % ) that were reported to SENSOR and CDPR were exposed to pesticide applications on school grounds ( Table 8 ) .
Insecticides ( n = 156 , 56 % ) and disinfectants ( n = 99 , 35 % ) accounted for most of the cases .
The most common active ingredients were diazinon ( n = 64 , 23 % ) , sodium hypochlorite ( n = 47 , 17 % ) , chlorpyrifos ( n = 40 , 14 % ) , quaternary ammonium compound ( n = 38 , 14 % ) , and malathion ( n = 14 , 5 % ) .
A total of 125 cases ( 31 % ) were exposed to pesticide drift .
Insecticides accounted for 114 cases ( 91 % ) and fumigants for 9 cases ( 7 % ) .
The most common active ingredients were chlorpyrifos ( n = 28 , 22 % ) , methamidophos combined with chlorothalonil and propargite ( n = 25 , 20 % ) , mancozeb combined with glyphosate ( n = 20 , 16 % ) , cyfluthrin combined with dicofol ( n = 16 , 13 % ) , and malathion ( n = 13 , 10 % ) .
Exposure via pesticide drift compared with pesticides applied on school grounds did not increase the odds of high and moderate severity illness ( OR , 0.6 ; 95 % CI , 0.3 - 1.2 ; P = .09 ) .
A higher proportion of children compared with adults were exposed via drift from neighboring farmland ( 40 % vs 25 % , P = .001 ) .
Comment
These findings indicate that pesticide exposures at schools continue to produce acute illnesses among school employees and students in the United States , albeit mainly of low severity and with relatively low incidence rates .
Illnesses were associated with pesticides applied on school grounds and with pesticide drift from neighboring farmland .
The pesticide exposures at schools might be associated in part with several factors : a lack of federal and state regulations regarding pesticide usage in schools1 ; regulatory noncompliance by school management , school employees , and pesticide applicators in states in which regulations and recommendations have been passed ; and insufficient involvement of stakeholders ( eg , parents , teachers , students , school administrators , pest managers ) .
6
We found that the pesticide poisoning incidence rates among children increased during the period of our report .
Given that 40 % ( n = 59 ) of SENSOR and CDPR cases involving children were exposed to pesticide drift and , given increasing suburban sprawl , this trend among children might be related to an increased number of schools situated next to farmland .
6
Additional studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis .
Hypotheses for the decreasing trend in illness rates among school employees include changes in pesticide use practices and increased awareness of the toxic effects of pesticides .
Incidence rates among school employees were found to be higher than incidence rates among children .
Possible explanations include school employees are called to protect children when incidents occur , whereas students are often quickly evacuated ; school employees are at schools for more hours compared with students ; and some school employees handle or apply pesticides .
Based on SENSOR and CDPR data , most cases of acute pesticide - related illnesses were associated with pesticides applied on school grounds ( n = 281 , 69 % ) .
Repeated pesticide applications on school grounds raise concerns about persistent low level exposures to pesticides at schools .
It is known that some pesticides degrade slowly when they are not exposed to sun , rain , and bacterial action in the soil .21 - 24
In addition , pesticide residues on the school grounds might be tracked into school buildings by students and school employees .
The chronic long - term impacts of pesticide exposures have not been comprehensively evaluated ; therefore , the potential for chronic health effects from pesticide exposures at schools should not be dismissed .
25 Unfortunately , the surveillance methods used in our report are inadequate for assessing chronic effects .
Although insecticides were most frequently associated with pesticide - related illnesses ( n = 895 , 35 % ) , we found that exposure to disinfectants at schools might also be a cause for concern .
First , disinfectants accounted for 830 ( 32 % ) of 2593 total cases and for 101 ( 37 % ) of 275 moderate severity cases .
Second , 259 ( 56 % ) of 461 cases of disinfectant exposure with toxicity category available were of toxicity category I . Finally , most of the disinfectants associated with moderate illnesses were products commonly used at schools ( sodium hypochlorite and quaternary ammonium compounds ) .
We also found acute illnesses associated with exposure to pesticide drift from neighboring farmland .
These exposures might have resulted from pesticide applicators not complying with pesticide labels , regulations , and / or guidance to avoid pesticide spray drift , or lack of federal and state regulations regarding pesticide application around schools .
Additionally , pesticide drift from neighboring farm fields might increase pesticide exposure inside schools .
Some studies 26 - 29 suggest that dwellings adjacent to fields can be contaminated by pesticide drift during applications and subsequent wind recirculation of dust from the fields .
To prevent illnesses associated with pesticide applications on or near school grounds , there is a need to reduce pesticide use .
This can be accomplished by implementing integrated pest management at schools and using methods that reduce pesticide drift from farmland .
Integrated pest management programs can reduce pesticide use at schools .
3,30 Integrated pest management is endorsed by the EPA,3 National Parent Teacher Association ,31 National Education Association , and other organizations .
The elements of integrated pest management are detailed in the Box .
Useful guidance and references on integrated pest management in schools are widely available .
3,32 Some disadvantages of integrated pest management implementation include the requirements of more involvement of school employees , parents , and students , and the need to be educated on pest biology and integrated pest management .
Finally , some economic investment is usually required at the outset of an integrated pest management program .
However , over the long term , the costs of integrated pest management have been found to be lower than traditional pest control .

Recommendations to Reduce Pesticide Exposures at Schools
Pesticides Applied on School Property
Implement school integrated pest management programs :
Monitor for pest problems .
Identify the sources of any pest problems .
Eliminate the sources of any pest problems , using pesticides only as a last resort .
Use nontoxic methods , such as ensuring sanitary conditions and structural integrity .
If nontoxic pest control methods are impractical or unsuccessful , then use pesticides having the lowest possible toxicity .
Pesticides in US Environmental Protection Agency toxicity categories I and II should be avoided if possible .
If pesticides are used : Provide prior written notification of the application .
Post notices in designated areas at the school .
Students and staff should not be present during pesticide applications .
Restrict entry into a previously treated area for a specified duration following an application .
Call a poison control center or seek medical attention if pesticide - related illnesses arise .
Trained and qualified workers should handle and apply pesticides .
They must be provided with appropriate safety equipment .
Put the school ’s policy on pest control in writing and distribute it to school stakeholders periodically ( eg , at the beginning of the school year ) .
Involve and train stakeholders ( school management , parents , teachers , students , and pesticide applicators ) .
Pesticide Drift From Neighboring Farmland
Reduce or eliminate application methods that result in drift .
Timing of pesticide applications .
Applications should be performed when students and school employees are not present .
Farmers and pesticide applicators should comply with labels , regulations , and guidance to avoid pesticide spray drift .
Pesticides should be applied by trained applicators .
Establish and enforce nonspray buffer zones around schools .
Size of buffer zone depends on toxicity of pesticide , type of application ( ground or aerial ) , and weather conditions .
For example , 7 states require buffer zones ranging from 300 feet to 2.5 miles around schools .
Underreporting
Improvement in pesticide poisoning surveillance is needed .
Every state should implement an acute pesticide - related illness surveillance system .
Acute pesticide - related illnesses should be a reportable condition in all states .
We tried to identify illness rate differences among children across states with different integrated pest management laws ( mandatory , voluntary , without laws ) .
However , this comparison was not meaningful because these laws have tremendous variation across states in terms of coverage , enforcement , and implementation .
Additionally , 40 % of cases among children in SENSOR and CDPR were exposed to pesticide drift .
A similar proportion of children in the entire data set might have been exposed to pesticide drift but these cases could not be identified in TESS .
Integrated pest management practices in schools are not designed to prevent exposures to pesticide drift .
There were too few SENSOR and CDPR cases involving onsite applications in schools ( n = 281 ) to assess integrated pest management laws .
Our findings are subject to at least 3 limitations .
First , these results should be considered low estimates of the magnitude of the problem because many cases of pesticide poisoning are likely not reported to surveillance systems or poison control centers .
Individuals who do not seek medical care or report their illness to a surveillance system or a poison control center will not be identified .
Even when individuals seek medical care , their illness may not be recognized as pesticide - related , because of the nonpathognomonic nature of the signs and symptoms and because clinicians receive little training on these illnesses .
33,34 Second , although all of these cases met the definition criteria , the possibility of some false - positives cannot be excluded .
Given both the nonspecificity of the clinical findings of pesticide poisoning and the lack of a criterion standard diagnostic test , some illnesses temporally related to pesticide exposures may be coincidental and not caused by these exposures .
Third , although the case definition was similar , some characteristics of the populations reported by these 3 systems were different .
TESS was efficient in capturing data for children , but it did not collect information on occupation , work - relatedness , and the activity the person was performing when exposed to pesticides .
The SENSOR and CDPR data apply to 8 states and principally identify work - related cases .
Not all states participating in SENSOR collect information on nonoccupational cases ; therefore , many cases among children were likely missed by SENSOR and CDPR .
None of these data sources are comprehensive .
The literature suggests that less than one third of poisoning cases treated in health care facilities are reported to poison control centers and in states where SENSOR and TESS systems are in place , TESS identified only 10 % of the cases identified by SENSOR.35
In conclusion , despite the limitations of these 3 surveillance systems , our report is useful in providing national estimates of the magnitude of pesticide - related illnesses among school employees and students , and in identifying the risk factors that should be targeted for prevention .
Strategies recommended to reduce pesticide exposures at schools include adopting integrated pest management programs and using methods to reduce pesticide drift from farmland .

Prologue
I sat staring at the Director of Processing , E - meter cans in my hands , trying to comprehend what he was saying to me .
" From now on , " he said to me in the blank - faced , unblinking eyes and monotone voice of all good Scientology auditors , " you will be confined to your room .
A guard will be posted outside your room at all times .
You are not to leave your room for any reason .
Your meals will be brought up to you .
Do you understand ? "
I was dumbfounded .
I was being punished .
But for what ?
I looked up at him .
" What did I do wrong ? " I stammered .
But he would n't tell me .
" This is for the security of the Org ( organization ) , " he responded .
" That is all I can tell you .
Now , you may go . "
From nowhere , a young girl appeared at my side .
" Dana , " commanded the D of P ( Director of Processing ) , " Will you please escort Ms. Wakefield to her room .
Now . "
I was dismissed .
I sat on my bed , trying to understand .
At first , I dared to hope .
" Over the rainbow , " I thought .
" They 're going to send me over the rainbow . "
This was the term used to refer to the secret location of our founder L. Ron Hubbard .
No one except for a few higher - ups knew where he and his personal staff were located .
It was a tightly kept secret .
" They 're going to send me over the rainbow because I 've been having trouble with my auditing ( Scientology counseling ) . "
It was rumored that sometimes difficult preclears were sent " over the rainbow " to have their cases straightened out by Hubbard 's assistant , David Mayo , or even perhaps by Hubbard himself .
I walked to the door of my room , testing .
A young man was seated on the floor next to my door .
He looked up at me threateningly .
I retreated back to my bed .
As promised , my meals appeared on schedule .
The days passed .
Slowly my hope began to fade .
I seemed to have been forgotten by the world .
One night , I looked outside my room , and saw that my guard had fallen asleep .
I slipped out of the room and crept down the hall to the stairway at the end of the hall .
I walked down the stairs and let myself outside .
It was a clear night with an almost full moon .
I began to walk through the silent neighborhood east of the Org.
Several blocks away I found a small shelter by the bay with seats overlooking the black water .
I sat and looked out over the water , trying to think .
For some reason , my mind refused to cooperate .
I had the sensation of trying to work through thick mud .
What was I to do ?
Where was I to go ?
A few blocks away was the Org , my safety .
Here , outside , was the dangerous " wog " world .
As I later tried to explain to people outside Scientology , I was like a two year old child .
I was incapable of leaving home .
They owned my soul .
The ties binding me to the Org , though invisible , were more powerful than any physical bond could have been .
I was in a trap more powerful than any cage with iron bars and a lock .
Mentally I belonged to them .
Slowly I began to walk back to the Org .
I opened the door and returned quietly to my room .
The guard was still sleeping .
Not knowing what else to do , I went to bed .
The days passed .
One night , three people from the Guardian 's Office came to my room .
They told me to pack .
" Tomorrow , " they told me , " you will be taken to the airport .
You are to fly anywhere out of the state of Florida .
You will not be able to return here .
You are to stay out of any Scientology center wherever you go . "
I was in shock .
I understood what it meant .
I was being offloaded .
I started to cry .
I begged them to change their minds , but it was useless .
The orders had come from above .
My shock turned to anger .
They could n't just get rid of me like this .
For twelve years I had given them everything I had .
My time .
My money .
I had slaved for them .
They could n't just throw me out .
But I knew they could .
I had seen it happen to plenty of others .
My vain hopes of going over the rainbow were completely dashed .
I tried to think after they had left my room .
Offloaded .
But why ?
Slowly , I understood .
It was the Swiss woman .
A week earlier , a Swiss woman who was on the same advanced levels as I was , had thrown herself off the breakwater by the Org and drowned .
It had been in the papers and when it was discovered that she was a Scientologist , it had caused embarrassment for the Org .
It was well known that I was doing poorly with my auditing .
I had been having terrible nightmares and waking up screaming in the middle of the night .
During the day I was n't doing much better .
I was an embarrassment to the Org , and as I was always complaining about my auditing I set a bad example for the other preclears , some of whom had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to be here .
I understood .
The Swiss woman .
They were afraid I was going to commit suicide too .
I had practically said so in my auditing .
So I packed .
The next morning I was taken to Tampa International Airport in a van , under guard .
They asked me where I wanted to go .
Still in shock and feeling like I was living a bad dream , I answered reluctantly , " Madison , Wisconsin . "
Where my parents lived .
I had no place else to go .
The flight passed like a dream .
My guard sat beside me .
I looked down at the snowy , February fields of Wisconsin .
It was all too much to comprehend .
For twelve years , there had ceased to be life outside of Scientology for me .
At that point , death would have been preferable to exile .
Actually , I anticipated death .
For it was well rumored in Scientology that to leave with an incomplete level of auditing could result in death within twelve days .
I got off the plane and my guard disappeared .
I looked around for my parents whom I had called from Florida to let them know I was coming .
I did n't see them .
Suddenly , I was alone and adrift in the wog world .
The thought filled me with terror .
Over the past several months , I have been privileged to attend ( and sometimes endure ) several significant gatherings of a variety of conservatives .
Some of the meetings were large ; others were small .
The meetings sometimes featured mostly grassroots activists and sometimes very high - profile and notable conservative icons .
In some of these meetings , I was allowed a platform to speak ; in others , I was merely a spectator .
In most of the meetings , there was a large percentage of Christian conservatives present .
The meetings occurred in locations all over the country .
After witnessing the philosophizing , postulating , and pontificating of the various conservative speakers ( or those to whom I spoke in private conversation ) , I am left with the very profound and distinct impression that the so - called conservative movement is dead .
It is not dying : it is dead .
Totally and thoroughly dead .
Oh , the spokesmen ( and women ) of the various conservative organizations will strongly argue that the conservative movement is as alive and vibrant as ever .
They are either delusional or in denial .
The truth is , there is no conservative movement in America today .
Most conservatives -- even Christian conservatives -- have embraced philosophies and ideals that are antithetical to genuine conservatism .
In fact , my experience with these people leads me to the conclusion that today 's conservatives do not even know what true conservatism is -- or was .
For example , I could not tell you how many times I have listened as speaker after speaker praised and promoted the candidacy of the " conservative " John McCain .
These are the same people , mind you , that in 2004 properly identified McCain as the conservative phony that he was -- and still is .
Many of the same conservative organizations that rejected and repudiated McCain 's 2004 candidacy now boldly extol its virtues .
But it is not John McCain that has changed : it is today 's conservatives .
The reason for this reversal of " convictions " is that this time John McCain is the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee .
And if today 's conservatives believe in anything , they believe in the Republican Party .
They might turn their backs on their best friends ; they might forsake their pastor and church ; they might even divorce their wife or husband ; but , one thing they will not do is forsake the Republican Party .
This rabid devotion to the GOP has made mincemeat out of a once - great movement .
Of course , there are modern - day prophets .
Men such as Alan Keyes , Judge Roy Moore , and Ron Paul , for example .
For the most part , however , America 's conservatives -- including Christian conservatives -- have dismissed these " voices in the wilderness " with either utter contempt or wholesale indifference .
These prophets are about as welcome as an outbreak of influenza .
Even as a pastor , I am not immune to the odious attitudes and actions of Christian brethren .
I have seen people I thought were my closest friends -- people I have helped in untold ways -- turn and walk away , without so much as a goodbye .
I have watched as my own dear wife and children have been subjected to insults , tongue - lashings , and even obscene gestures by these " loving " Christian brothers and sisters .
I have witnessed my preacher brethren refuse to even " reason together " over the omnipresent threats to our liberty and independence .
The beginning of the end came when Christian conservatives began idolizing President George W. Bush .
They have done this to the point that they have come to accept just about any and all abuses against the Constitution , Bill of Rights , Declaration principles , and even our very way of life .
Furthermore , they have become robotic foot soldiers for universal and everlasting war .
At the same time , however , they see no harm in the decimation of individual liberties , as long as it is a Republican who is stealing them .
But these same Christians will cry and wail -- to the point of almost cutting themselves -- against the thought of a Democrat doing the same thing .
But , pray tell me , since when does it matter what the brand name is on the tyrant 's sword ?
Are not our liberties just as dead ?
But look at how our modern prophets have been treated .
Alan Keyes has been forcibly removed from debate platforms , only to be released in remote , crime infested neighborhoods at night by Republican Party operatives .
Roy Moore was lampooned and utterly destroyed by Republican Party operatives ( including those within George W. Bush 's White House ) in his attempt to become Alabama 's governor .
And , in his recent Presidential campaign , Ron Paul has been subjected to the most insidious attacks by Republican Party operatives that I have ever witnessed .
Regardless of how the Republican Party has compromised , capitulated , and castrated genuine conservative principles , conservatives -- including Christian conservatives -- continue to refer to the GOP as " God 's Own Party , " and other such nonsense .
In fact , the current lapdog performance of modern conservatives to the candidacy of John McCain demonstrates just how far down the road of destruction they will go in order to grovel before the Republican Party .
National Right to Life even had the gall to say that it is " grateful " for John McCain 's " strong pro-life " record .
What balderdash !
McCain has repeatedly voted to spend Title X tax dollars to underwrite the nation 's largest abortion provider , Planned Parenthood .
He publicly supports killing unborn babies conceived via rape or incest .
And he continues to lie to the American people about killing babies " to save the life of the mother , " which almost any OB / GYN doctor will tell you almost NEVER occurs .
According to the OB / GYN physicians that I have spoken to , the only pregnancies that pose a legitimate health risk to the mother are those where the unborn baby has already perished .
How can National Right to Life -- an organization that once vociferously opposed Senator McCain - - now compromise the life issue in such an egregious manner and support the corrupt candidacy of John McCain ?
I 'll tell you how : NRL is bought and paid for by Republican donors .
And that is the problem with the vast majority of our " conservative " organizations today .
As the old saying goes , " He who pays the piper calls the tune . "
In fact , I will say it straight out : there is no hope for America within today 's conservative -- even Christian conservative -- movement .
None . Zero. Zilch .
The closest movement to reclaiming America 's freedom and independence was the recent Presidential campaign of Congressman Ron Paul .
With Congressman
Paul effectively neutered and neutralized ( by a hostile media and mercenary Republican hierarchy ) , the only hope is in America 's churches and a burgeoning independent movement .
I only wish I could expect today 's pastors and churches to stand in the gap for our nation .
They have the power to thwart the forces of globalism , corporatism , elitism , and liberalism that are destroying America .
So far , however , this has been nothing but wishful fantasy .
Most of our beloved Christian leaders are as beholden to the same Republican donors as are the previously mentioned conservative organizations .
And just as impotent .
That leaves The Constitution Party as the only political party with the courage and convictions to set the ship of state aright .
With someone such as Judge Roy Moore at the helm , true Christians and constitutionalists would at least have an opportunity to vote for someone in November without being forced to hold their noses and surrender their principles .
After attending numerous meetings of conservative activists , I am more convinced than ever that , ultimately , the survival of liberty in America does not depend upon political parties , special interest groups , or corporations .
In these United States of America , God has put the destiny of the country squarely in the hands of " We the people . "
It will not be conservatives or liberals , Republicans or Democrats , Christians or unbelievers that restore America .
It will be individuals from all walks of life , all backgrounds , and all political persuasions who love liberty enough to fight to maintain it .
Ultimately , of course , all nations -- just like all individuals -- must give an account to our Creator for how we protected the freedoms and liberties that He gave us .
Right now , we are not doing a very good job .

Pitch correction software has applications from restoration and mix-rescue to outright distortion of a voice or instrument .
I ’ll discuss some of the more tasteful uses of these auto - tune tools ( whether the original from Antares , or a variant like the free GSnap ) below .
But first I thought I ’d highlight their misuse to illustrate the effects we usually try to avoid .
So , listen here to 10 of pop music ’s most blatant auto - tune abuses :
If you ’re unfamiliar with Auto - tune , and especially if you listen to much pop and rock , you might not hear it initially .
When overdone , the effect yields an unnatural yodel or warble in a singer ’s voice .
But the sound is so commonplace in modern mainstream music that your ears may have tuned out the auto - tune !
The songs in this clip , in order , and the phrases most affected by auto - tuning to help you spot them :
Dixie Chicks – The Long Way Around – Noticeable on “ parents ” and “ but I . ”
T- Pain – I ’m Sprung – Especially obvious on “ homies ” and “ lady . ”
Avril Lavigne – Complicated – Listen to “ way , ” “ when , ” “ driving , ” “ you ’re . ”
Uncle Kracker – Follow Me
The whole vocal sounds strained , but especially the word “ goodbye . ”
Maroon 5 – She Will Be Loved – Listen for “ rain ” and “ smile . ”
Natasha Bedingfield – Love Like
This – “ Apart ” and “ life . ”
Sean Kingston – Beautiful girls – “ OoooOver ” does n’t sound human .
JoJo – Too Little Too Late – Appropriately , “ problem ” stands out .
Rascal Flatts – Life is a Highway
Every vocal , foreground and background , is treated , but “ drive ” in particular .
New Found Glory – Hit or Miss – “ Thriller ” , and every time Jordan sings “ I . ”
The Cher Effect
When used noticeably , an auto - tuner produces what most call “ The Cher Effect “ , named for her trademark sound in the song Believe * .
( In essence , we named the effect like scientists naming a new disease after its first victim . )
Treated this heavily , a vocal track sounds synthetic , and obviously processed .
But not all auto - tuning is so blatant .
In the sample above , it ’s harder to hear the pitch correction on Uncle Kracker and Avril than on T - Pain and Bedingfield .
Tasteful Uses
As with any tool , a little care can yield great results .
Some simple things to keep in mind about pitch correction tools :
Performance : Most importantly , an auto - tuner is n’t a shortcut to a perfect performance .
If you ca n’t sing the song properly , no amount of post - processing will make it sound like you did .
So when your pitch matters , and you do n’t want to correct it with an effect , you ’ll need to work on your performance until it ’s right .

If your pitch correction software offers a graphical mode ( like Antares Auto - Tune and Melodyne , ) learn how to work with it .
The default “ auto ” modes are OK for basic corrections , but often produce noticeable yodeling .

Backing vocals :
In general , you can get away with more pitch correction on backing vocals than lead vocals .

Outdated : Obvious vocoder - style autotuning is dated , and borders on kitschy .
The synthetic warbling vocal sound marks songs as having come from a specific era , the same way gated - reverb on drums instantly places a song in the 1980’s .
Remember :
If you make the auto tuner obvious , people will say your song uses “ the Cher effect . ”
Let this be a guideline .
Be sure it ’s needed
Two songs have auto tuners on my mind today : Snoop ’s Sensual Seduction ( because of Anil Dash ’s ruminations on the death of the analog vocoder , ) and Natasha Bedingfield ’s Love Like
This , which I heard on the radio .
In the former , the auto tuner is clearly a gimmick .
But every time I hear Bedingfield ’s song , I ’m struck by the same question :
Why do that to her voice ?
She ’s a fantastic singer , and once you ’ve heard the song without the cheesy auto tuner effect , it ’s hard to take the radio single seriously .
And there ’s a lesson in that for home recordists , ( even those of us who do n’t write pop music , ) which echoes the rule of mixing :
If an effect significantly changes the sound of a track , especially one so important as the lead vocal , be sure that change improves the song before committing it to the mix .

去年読んだ中で一番驚いた論文 、Earl Thompson 「 The Tulipmania : Fact or Artifact ?
」Public Choice , Vol. 130 , Nos. 1 - 2 , Jan 2007 , pp. 99-114 . の紹介( ちなみに Wikipedia 経由で知りました ) 。オランダで1636年の終わりから1637年の始めに起きたといわれているチューリップバブルは実は単なる歴史家の勘違いで、実際にはバブルは起きていなかったという説を
Thompson 氏は唱えています 。
まずは予備知識から 。
始めに確認しておきたいのは、チューリップがどんなに高額で売買されていたとしても、それを指してバブルだとは言わないということ。ものの値段というのは供給と需要で決まります。チューリップは種ではなく球根から育てないといけなくて、大量生産が難しかった。またその当時高額で取り引きされていた花びらにきれいな斑が入ったチューリップは実はモザイクウィルスによる病気が原因でした。そのため同じ球根から育てたとしても同じ斑のチューリップができるとは限りませんでした。というわけで、供給は質、量ともに限られていました。需要に関しても、貿易で儲けた豪商たちが自分達の邸宅の庭をチューリップで彩ることに熱心でした。というわけで、1630年代においては供給と需要の両面からみてチューリップが高額で取り引きされてもおかしくなかったし、実際取り引きされていました。
そもそもチューリップバブルとは「1636年の終わりから1637年の始めに起きたチューリップの先物価格の異常な上昇と下落」のことを指します。異常な上昇をしたのは「先物価格」なんです。そして、先物価格が下落した後に何が起こったかというと、1636年11月から1637年2月までの売買契約は数%の違約金を払えば免除できるということになったんです。この「徳政令」のおかげでチューリップバブルで破産するような人はほとんどいませんでした。チューリップバブル以後もオランダの花卉産業は衰退することなく逆に国外への輸出を増やし、現在まで続く繁栄を謳歌しています。
予備知識はここまで 。
さて、チューリップバブルが言われている程のイベントではないことがわかったとしても、それでも先物価格の変動の謎は残ります。この変動を
Thompson 氏は驚くべき逆転の発想によって説明しています。それは以下のようなものです。
先物価格の上昇と下落が起こったから「徳政令」が出たのではなくて、「徳政令」が出ることを市場参加者が合理的に予測していたからそれを反映して先物価格の上昇と下落が起こったのである
Thompson 氏の説は簡単にまとめると以下のようになります。1636年10月、市場参加者が予想もしていなかったような事態が起きます。後に30年戦争と呼ばれる戦いにおいてフランスがドイツを打ち破ったのです。ドイツの王侯貴族はチューリップの大口需要者でした。それらの需要が突如なくなりチューリップ価格は暴落します。チューリップの先物契約に投資していた中には政治家も含まれており、彼らは自分達の損を回避するために「徳政令」を画策します。近いうちに出されるであろう「徳政令」により、市場で取引されているチューリップの先物は先物ではなく今でいう「コールオプション」になることを市場参加者たちは正しく予想し理解しました。これにより、「チューリップの先物価格」は将来の予想価格を表すものではなく、「数%の違約金」とつりあうような「コールオプションの行使価格」となり、それに見合うような値に急上昇しました。市場は常に合理的だったんだけど、後世の歴史家がチューリップの先物価格の意味がこの時期でだけ変わっていることに気づかなかったことが「チューリップバブル」という神話が生まれた原因なのです。
うーんじつに面白い。このストーリーを全面的に信じることはできないけど、話としては非常に面白いと僕は思います。
Last week we heard the results of an experiment in double dipping .
Prof. Paul L. Dawson of Clemson University wanted to test the conventional wisdom that redipping a chip after you 've bitten some off will spread germs in the community dip .
Of course , he had state - of - the - art equipment and plenty of students for his experiment , which found up to 10,000 bacteria can be transferred to the dip by each double - dipper .
But people who have no such resources do their own experiments every day .
1. Nailing Jelly to a Wall
You 've heard the phrase " like nailing jelly to the wall " to describe a difficult task .
Graeme Cole decided to find out exactly how difficult it was to nail jelly ( or Jello for Americans ) to a wall .
He chronicled his experiment step - by - step with pictures .
2. Does Toast Always Land Butter Side Down ?
Does toast really tend to fall jelly side down more often than dry side down ?
The Cockeyed.com Science Club put that old idea to the test !
They toasted and buttered two entire loaves of bread and dropped each piece .
The first loaf had a 20 % " survival "  rate , meaning the toast landed butter side up .
The second loaf , to which they added honey , jam , or Nutella to each piece of toast , only had a 5 % survival rate !
Continue reading for more people who tried it out .
3. Will Pineapple Remove Fingerprints ?
Thomas Scott heard that pineapple will remove your fingerprints .
From your fingers .
He was inspired to test this theory , and recorded the experience on video .
The results showed that not all home experiments are altogether safe .
Sometimes it 's better to learn from the experience of others .
4. Grilled Cheese Made with an Iron
Roy and Laura were impressed by the grilled cheese sandwiches made with a steam iron in the movie Benny and Joon , and wondered if the technique could be duplicated by " ordinary folks in an ordinary kitchen . "
They recreated the scene and documented the process in pictures .
Their conclusion ?
The " wool " setting is best .
5. Frying an Egg in a Computer
Trubador set up a heat sink inside his computer , and fried an egg , just to show us that it can be done .
It took a little longer than using a stove , but the results were edible !
6. Combined Oil Cooling and Deep Frying
Sc4 freak began with one experiment and ended up with something completely different .
I had recently read a few articles on submersion cooling , where you take your computer and dump it into a tub of non-electrically - conductive oil .
It seemed to work really well , and was cheap .
So I saw it as a type of poor man 's water - cooling .
I bought a large aluminium oven tray and 9 litres of canola oil .
Yes , he submerged his motherboard in cooking oil .
The computer worked just fine .
But he was hungry and had used all the cooking oil .
The solution ?
Put the fries in the cooling tray with the motherboard !
He heated the oil , cooked the fries , and kept playing Quake to see how long the computer would function .
Have you ever heard some nugget of " conventional wisdom " that you wanted to test in the real world ?
Or better yet , have you ever actually tried such a test ?
Digg this !
TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Choking pollution and sapping heat will be the major concerns for the world ’s elite marathon runners at this year ’s Beijing Olympics .
More than 30,000 runners fill the roadway in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office at the start of the 2008 Tokyo Marathon February 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Itsuo Inouye / Pool
But for millions of other marathon men and women , concerns are of an altogether more painful nature .
After his first assault at a marathon last year banker Brian Jones was shocked to discover the sharp pain in his chest was not cardiovascular , but bleeding nipples .
“ When I took my shirt off at the end it was white -- apart from two particular parts of it , ” he told Reuters in an interview after completing his second Tokyo Marathon at the weekend .
“ It looked like I had been shot by a sniper .
This year I bought some Vaseline .
It worked , although I had nasty chafing elsewhere . ”
Such dark thoughts are unlikely to have troubled Sunday ’s winner , Switzerland ’s Viktor Roethlin , who powered to victory in two hours , seven minutes and 23 seconds .
But for around 30,000 fun runners who took part in Tokyo , issues such as chafing can trigger deep despair .
“ I struggled to find a comfortable pair of underwear this morning , ” said Jones , who clocked 4:37:46 , beating his 2007 time by 11 minutes .
“ I walked two kilometers this year , between 34 and 36 km , because my leg seized up .
The last 20 - K was freezing .
The wind was absolutely brutal . ”
Jones credited the Japanese crowds lining the roads for helping him get to the finish .
“ It was amazing , ” smiled the 33 - year - old bank employee .
“ Random people on the side of the street just appear with muscle sprays and start graffitiying the back of your leg . ”
“ AGONY ”
Jones admitted to having had second thoughts about running again after a traumatic first attempt last year when he suffered an early knee injury .
“ I was in agony last year , ” said the Londoner .
“ My feet were all blistered and bleeding .
My knee blew up .
I could barely walk .
Yesterday morning I was terrified .
“ You read stories of runners who are fit and who train properly and they end up with serious problems , respiratory problems or someone had a heart attack . ”
Worse even than the fear of sudden death , however , was the humiliation of being overtaken by pensioners at the 20 km mark .
“ I thought I was doing quite well and then there ’s some 70 - year - old granny I ’m just catching up to , ” Jones said with a sheepish grin .
With Tokyo’s elderly destroying his morale , and one runner further unbalancing him by trotting backwards down a hill , Jones had to trick his brain into staying focused .
“ There was one woman dressed as a nurse , or a maid .
I followed her for a bit , ” he said .
“ You think about anything to take your mind off the pain . ”
Even during the most tortuous moments of Sunday ’s race , quitting was never an option for Jones .
“ I never thought I would n’t finish , ” he said .
“ When it was really bad , when I got to about the 33 km mark , it was n’t a mental thing .
It was just that my legs could n’t move .
“ I had cramp in my thighs , the back of my hamstrings , my calf and my shins -- if that ’s possible . ”
Despite the pain , however , would he do it all again ?
“ Even though it hurts like hell it is fun , oddly , ” said Jones .
“ Last year finishing at all was a miracle .
When I finished I was close to breaking down .
“ But I remember instantly thinking ‘ I ’m going to do that again . ’
Yesterday I did n’t have that same feeling , although I was a little more philosophical this morning ... ”

The latest version of Ubuntu server edition comes with both server and desktop kernels .
How do they differ , and what options are available with each ?
Last week we looked at Ubuntu Server 's documentation , discussed hardware requirements , tried to figure out what sets Ubuntu Server apart from Ubuntu Desktop , and what 's included in the current release , 7.10 ( Gutsy Gibbon ) .
Ubuntu itself is not very helpful with these things , and I do n't like to write reviews that complain without also offering some answers , so today we 're going to learn how to dig into Ubuntu without installing it and find out these things for ourselves .
We still need the installation .iso image , but at least we wo n't have to install it or even burn it to a CD to learn some useful information .
What Is a " Server " Kernel ?
We 're going to compare the / boot / config - 2.6.22-14- server and / boot / config -2.6.22 -14 - generic files and find out exactly what Ubuntu considers a server kernel vs. a desktop kernel is .
We 'll do this by mounting the installation .iso in a temporary directory , and then extract and compare the two files :
# mkdir temp # mount -o loop ubuntu-7.10 - server-i386.iso # cd temp # find temp - name linux - image * temp/pool/main/l/linux-meta/linux-image-generic_
2.6.22.14.21_i386.deb temp/pool/main/l/linux-meta/linux-image-server_
2.6.22.14.21_i386.deb temp/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.22/linux-image-
2.6.22-14-generic_2.6.22-14.46_i386.deb
temp/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.22/linux-image-
2.6.22-14-server_2.6.22-14.46_i386.deb
Check it out , we get both desktop and server kernels in one location , so this is going to be easy .
We want the last two , as those are the real kernel packages , which the linux - meta packages are not .
Copy them into separate directories for unpacking .
. deb packages are special archives that contain ordinary tar archives , and these two packages contain files with the same names : control.tar.gz , data.tar.bz2 , and debian - binary .
So you can't unpack them in the same directory .
Use the ar and tar commands to unpack the .debs , and then to unpack their data .tar. gz files :
# ar -x linux - image - 2.6.22-14-server_2.6.22-14.46_i386.deb # tar jxvf data.tar.bz2
Now you can pluck out the boot / config - 2.6.22 -14 - server and boot / config - 2.6.22 - 14 - generic files , copy them into the same directory for convenience , and diff them :
# diff --suppress-common-lines -y config-2.6.22-14-server
config-2.6.22-14-generic
This gives us some nice manageable output  around 50 lines , rather than about 3,100 lines per file .
So let 's take a look at diff 's output to see what 's different .
I/O Scheduler
There are four different types of I/O scheduling : CFQ ( Completely Fair Queuing ) , Deadline , NOOP , and Anticipatory .
Ubuntu makes CFQ the default for desktop kernels , and Deadline for server kernels .
The goal is the same for all of them : to optimize hard disk bandwidth for different classes of workloads .
In your configuration file , this is the CONFIG_DEFAULT_IOSCHED option , plus the CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ , _DEADLINE , _AS , and _NOOP options .
CFQ tries to balance all read / write requests equally .
tries to balance all read / write requests equally .
Deadline gives a higher priority to read requests , and will re-order read / write requests aggressively to meet the goal of completing read requests within a specified time , without " starving " write requests , which are not given deadlines .

Anticipatory aims to reduce latency by giving priority to already - running applications .
It is supposed to be suitable for smaller systems with one or two hard disks , and single or dual - core CPUs .

It is supposed to be suitable for smaller systems with one or two hard disks , and single or dual - core CPUs .
NOOP is a minimal scheduler for systems with hardware that handles I/O scheduling , like large SCSI RAID arrays .
The question of which one is appropriate depends on your systems and how you use them : how many CPUs , how many hard disks and controllers , what types of applications , and the loads your systems have to handle .
You can run benchmarks , and then tune your systems accordingly .
You can pass scheduler options in as boot - time options , or you can even enable different schedulers per block device and change them on - the - fly ( see Resources ) .
The Ubuntu defaults are good starting points , and if you must tweak the settings , they 're just as tweakable as on any Linux .
Preemption
The server kernel has kernel preemption turned off ( CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y ) , while the desktop kernel has it enabled ( CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y , CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y ) .
Preemption works along with scheduling to fine - tune performance , efficiency and responsiveness .
In non-preemptive kernels , kernel code runs until completion ; the scheduler can't touch it until it 's finished .
But the Linux kernel allows tasks to be interrupted at nearly any point ( but not when it is unsafe , which is a whole huge fascinating topic all by itself ) , so that tasks of lesser - priority can jump to the head of the line .
This is appropriate for desktop systems because users typically have several things going at once : writing documents , playing music , Web surfing , downloading and so on .
Users do n't care how responsive background applications are ; they care only about the ones they 're actively using .
So if loading a Web page takes a little longer while the user is writing an e-mail , it 's an acceptable trade - off .
Overall efficiency and performance are actually reduced but not in a way that annoys the user .
On servers you want to minimize any and all performance hits , so turning off preemption is usually the best practice .
Memory
The 32 - bit server kernel supports up to 64 GB of memory ; the desktop kernel , a mere 4 GB ( CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y , CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y ) .
You 'll only see these options in 32 - bit kernels because the 32 - bit address space is big enough to support only 4 GB without trickery .
Or by using the Intel Physical Address Extension ( PAE ) mode , if you want to get technical .
Linux supports PAE , and you also need PAE support in your CPU .
Anything newer than a Pentium Pro or AMD K6 - 3 should be fine .
On a 64 - bit system you wo n't see any memory options because it does n't need hacks to overcome a lack of memory addressing space ; you should be fine until your needs exceed 16 exabytes of RAM .
Ticks and HZ
Both kernels support on - demand interrupt timers ( CONFIG_NO_HZ=y ) , or the so - called " tickless " option .
This means that during periods of no activity , the system goes into a truly idle state , which is supposed to save on power and cooling .
If you thought that the 312 - key Chromatone synthesizer had a few more keys than your everyday piano , just wait ’til you get a load of the Tonal Plexus and its even more plentiful keyboard design .
The Tonal Plexus series of keyboards is a micro- tonal input device featuring rows and rows of buttons which generate tones with far more precision than an 88 - key piano can handle .
Created by H - Pi Intstruments , the Tonal Plexus comes in variants from a compact 2 - octave , 422 key controller , all the way up to a gigantic 8 - octave keyboard with a whopping 1688 keys .
The keyboard layout is based on a traditional piano keyboard pattern of 7 white and 5 black keys , but each key gets a bunch of additional variants , including 7 naturals , 7 sharps , 7 flats , 7 double - sharps , 7 double flats , 6 triple - sharps and 6 triple - flats .
In case you ’re keeping count , that ’s 211 unique keys per octave .
For some reason , I do n’t think that you ’ll ever run out of notes on this keyboard .

Mark Crispin Miller is a professor of media , culture and communication at New York University .
He 's also a man on a mission : to make the case for electoral reform .
Miller climbs into the minutiae of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections - voter caging in Florida , ballot stickers in Ohio , and lots of unseemly details in between .
The core of his argument unfolded in " None Dare Call It Stolen : Ohio , the Election , and America 's Servile Press " which appeared in the August 2005 issue of Harper 's .
It evolved into Fooled Again : The Real Case for Electoral Reform in 2005 .
And in the end , he tells us that notwithstanding the reassurances of the mainstream media , we have no reason to be confident in the formally reported results of those two elections .
The paperback edition came out earlier this year , with an extensive afterward and much updated material .
No Comment puts six questions to _Harper 's contributor , author and media critic , Mark Crispin Miller , about his book , the mainstream media , and the art of political persecution in America today .
1 . One of the most striking things I saw in your book was on the fly page , where you very cleverly juxtapose quotations from Tom Paine , T.W. Adorno and Tom DeLay - all of them are on the topic of truth and power , it seems to me .
But the Adorno quote is particularly fascinating , it 's taken from an essay he wrote at the end of World War II , in which he 's drawing a very important lesson : that the totalitarian states the Allies were battling had mastered the technique of using power to generate their own truth , and to make anything inconsistent with it seem a lie .
And this is precisely the same point that George Orwell and Victor Klemperer made , both writing the same year .
Of course , as I read your book , your point is not that America has become a totalitarian state , but rather that political forces within the country are making rather more subtle use of the same techniques .
Am I reading this correctly ?
Well , yes and no .
On the one hand , Bush & Co. 's vast inversions of the truth - distortions infinitely larger than mere lying - are the product of a conscious and deliberate " technique , " as you put it .
And yet , they 're also , at the same time , a ferociously sincere expression of the way these mad authoritarians perceive reality .
In other words , when Bush and Cheney and their cohorts say that up is down and black is white , they are not just dispassionately following a certain set of rules for doing propaganda .
Such fierce untruthfulness comes to them naturally , because their world - view is completely paranoid .
I think Adorno understood this ; and so did both Orwell and Klemperer .
" Doublethink " is Orwell 's deft conception of this sort of simultaneous dissimulation and fanatical conviction : deliberate deception based on ( partial ) self - deception .
And Klemperer was acutely conscious of the Nazis ' quasi- religious zealotry .
In his diary he repeatedly makes note of Hitler 's wild medieval frame of mind ( at one point he refers to Hitler 's oratory as " the mad bawling of a priest " ) , yet also notes the element of mammoth orchestration in the Nazi propaganda - a genius for spectacular manipulation that reminds him of the works of Hollywood .
Klemperer understood , in short , that what made Hitler and the Nazi movement so profoundly and unusually dangerous was this combination of crusading zest and up - to - date technique .
As I point out in Fooled Again , that sort of ferocious cunning has , throughout the centuries , marked paranoid crusades of every kind .
Certainly we see it in Bush / Cheney 's movement , which includes radical theocrats , neocon extremists , dedicated neo-Confederates , and other types who tend to see themselves as victims and their struggle , therefore , as defensive .
In their eyes , the very people whom they 're trying to destroy are ruthless and relentless , full of hate and fury , while they themselves are innocent , outnumbered , " fighting back . "
In short , Bush / Cheney 's movement is projective , lividly imputing their own darkest impulses to everybody else .
Such projectivity , I argue , drove the Crusaders of the Middle Ages , and the Western efforts to annihilate the " savages " on the American frontiers .
Nazism also was essentially projective , as Hitler and his men consistently imputed their own wrath and vengefulness and lust for power to " world Jewry " - against which they were fighting , they believed , in self - defense .
We see the same mentality in the Islamist , Christianist and ultra-Zionist movements ; and , overwhelmingly , among the Bush Republicans , whose program , I believe , is ultimately pathological .
The Bushevik is fatally obsessed with wiping out the " terrorist " within himself - and , no less , the homosexual within .
How many of those ranting homophobes have turned out to be cruisers in the dark ?
Bush / Cheney's G.O.P. is , above all , the Party of the Closet ; and therefore suicidally engaged in trying to straighten out , or murder , all those other " perverts " the world over .
Such is the animus that motivates the Busheviks ' " techniques " of lying and manipulation .
2 . The center stage for the 2004 election was in Ohio , and the major foci of the extensive afterword to your book are the U.S. press 's treatment of the issue of election fraud , and the evidence of further fraud in the '06 election .
Even now , three years after the election , the Ohio story seems still to be unfolding .
Earlier this month , Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner acknowledged that the 2004 presidential election in Ohio - which put Bush over the top , delivering the state to him in the face of exit polls that gave the nod to Kerry - may well have been stolen .
In fact there were a series of prosecutions of voting officials in connection with fraud , a report led by House Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers pointed to a slew of gross irregularities .
Yet Brunner 's remarks still provoked a storm of ridicule from Ohio Republicans and drew little attention in the mainstream media .
This shows that even when concerns are raised by the state 's senior elections officer , they are n't taken seriously .
How do those concerned about fair elections overcome the " tin-hat - wearing loon " tactics used by the Republicans to dismiss the issue ?
This sort of resistance is , at long last , just now starting to break down , because there 's finally so much evidence of fraud , or of the likelihood of fraud , that anyone who keeps on trying to laugh it off now looks suspicious .
Not that the Bush Republicans will stop deriding all discussion of that evidence .
They must resort to ridicule because their only hope lies in preventing others from examining that evidence , which is in fact conclusive .
Better , then , that all the evidence be cast as lunacy ; and , as you note , the press has so far bought that view , and thereby helped the GOP to bury the explosive facts .
( The Democrats have mostly done the same . )
But now the press is starting to recover from such blindness .
Certainly the risks of electronic voting are widely recognized today , with organs like The New York Times Magazine , and several Secretaries of State throughout the nation , speaking out against the use of paperless e-voting machinery .
This is a promising first step , although we have a long way yet to go , as such critics still refuse to use the f - word - fraud - preferring to insist , or to pretend , that the machines are merely insecure and prone to breakdown .
Until we face the fact that Bush & Co. is bent on the subversion of U.S. democracy , and that they 'll always find a way to block the vote , we will continue to consider weak " reforms " that wo n't deter or hinder them .
Blind to the regime 's subversive program , the Times and those well - meaning civil servants , among others , now propose replacing all the paperless machines with optical scanners .
While that 's a good idea , it is n't good enough , as op - scans too can be , and have been , manipulated - and , more important , op - scans too make it impossible to count the vote in public .
Secret vote counts have no place in any real democracy , and it is therefore staggering that any good American would call for them .
There is no doubt that the op - scans were manipulated in the New Hampshire primary , as Hillary won by six points where the votes were counted by those gadgets , while Obama won by six points where the ballots were hand - counted - and , contrary to a lot of comfy punditry , there was actually no demographic factor that explains the difference .
( I suspect that Republicans manipulated the machines , to ensure that Hillary will be the candidate they run against . )
The startling outcome in New Hampshire also helped to wake some people up : Bill Maher spoke very powerfully about it on his show , along with Catherine Crier and Mark Cuban ; and when Tony Snow , predictably , attempted to make all of them sound crazy , he only made himself look ludicrous .
The audience was clearly on the other side .
It marked a real breakthrough , as Maher had never yet dared to touch the subject of election fraud .
3 . Another festering concern out of Ohio was the Warren County " lockdown " in which a series of bizarre " homeland security measures " were taken in connection with voting and voting tabulation in a county which produced a suspiciously large margin for Bush in 2004 .
Brunner is pressing questions about the Warren County machinations today .
Do you consider the Warren County incident significant ?
Do you see any other cases in which " homeland security " has been linked to electoral shenanigans ?
The Warren County lockdown was a flagrant case of fraud , and so it 's good news that Jean Brunner , Ohio's Secretary of State , has promised to revisit it .
( Here 's hoping that she does . )
It was indeed significant , as Warren County was among the last to report its final numbers on Election Night , 2004 .
The ploy 's outlandishness and timing make quite clear that Bush 's team was waiting to see how the numbers looked throughout Ohio , so that they'd know how many " votes " were yet required to call their " victory " in that state .
It was quite an episode .
First of all , the men in charge asserted , falsely , that there might be a terrorist attack on that small semi-rural county ( whose entire population is half the size of Akron 's ) , and therefore told the press to leave the premises .
According to two witnesses , moreover , the party animals in charge then had some ballot boxes stealthily transferred to an unauthorized location under the control of party hacks .
( Right after the election , the FBI denied outright that that there had been a terrorist alert . )
I do n't know of any other case in which " homeland security " was used to perpetrate election fraud per se ( although nothing would surprise me ) .
In a related episode , however , Tom DeLay contacted DHS to get them to round up those Texas Democrats who had left the state in protest over his ( successful ) effort at redistricting the state to the Republicans ' advantage .
[ Editor 's note : I believe the Democratic legislators were leaving the state to deny the Republicans a quorum so that they could not effectuate the redistricting .
Until DeLay 's campaign , district lines had been drawn every 10 years after the Federal Census , but DeLay pressued Republican state legislatures to apply new computer technology for ultra - gerrymandered districts between censuses , when no redistricting should have been warranted .
- JJM ]
Although not an instance of election fraud , that bald stroke of partisan gerrymandering - upheld later by Bush / Cheney 's Supreme Court - was surely part of Bush & Co. 's crusade to thwart the will of the electorate .
4 . You say that the Republican Party 's plan to manipulate the elections does n't focus on a single massive fraud , but rather on thousands of small ones .
That makes sense in light of the fact that the presidential election is effectively a series of mini-elections conducted in counties and precincts around the country , with different voting , monitoring and tallying procedures .
But if you had to pick three points where the voting process is vulnerable , what would they be ?
(1) Computerized equipment - not just the e-voting machinery of both kinds ( DRE machines , which use no paper , and optical scanners , which do ) , but also the electronic databases that have now replaced traditional voter rolls .
Richard Wolf of USA Today reported recently that thousands of Americans - mostly Democrats - have been disenfranchised nationwide , their names having simply vanished from those databases .
(2) Jim Crow legislation - such as Indiana 's voter ID bill - and a Supreme Court intent on nullifying the legacy of the Warren Court vis -a - vis voting rights .
( To this I would add Bush v. Gore , whereby the Court simply asserted its prerogative to override the voters ' will . )
The Indiana law , and similar laws in several other states , suggest that the Bush Republicans are moving toward the mass pre-emption of our votes , which is a tidier way to disenfranchise the electorate than using those increasingly notorious machines .
(3) A politicized Department of Justice , which , like the Court , is now keen to reverse the activist pro-democratic legacy of its Voting Rights Division since the passage of the Voting Rights
Act in the sixties .
Not only has the Justice Department stopped prosecuting violations of our voting rights ( focusing instead on violations of so - called " religious freedom " ) , but they are now busily conducting voter purges nationwide - taking aim , of course , at Democratic constituencies .
(4) If I may add a fourth concern , it is the media 's pernicious influence on our electoral process .
Not only do the networks , and the major papers , tune out nearly all important news about our voting rights and the integrity of our elections .
Even more destructive is the TV networks ' practive of calling " victories " on Election Night - long before the votes have even been accounted for , much less counted .
By doing so , they close the door on all post- election efforts to make sure that there has been a righteous count : audits , recounts , and even first counts , since they occur belatedly , all seem like the mere desperate measures of " sore losers . "
5 . What 's the fix for the nation 's broken elections system ?
Give me the first steps you 'd take .
(1) Repeal the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) .
(2) Replace all electronic voting with hand - counted paper ballots ( HCPB ) .
(3) Get rid of computerized voter rolls .
(4) Keep all private vendors out of the election process .
(5) Make it illegal for the TV networks to declare who won before the vote - count is complete .
(6) Set up an exit polling system , publicly supported , to keep the vote - counts honest .
(7) Get rid of voter registration rules , by having every citizen be duly registered on his / her 18th birthday .
(8) Ban all state requirements for state - issued ID 's at the polls .
(9) Put all polling places under video surveillance , to spot voter fraud , monitor election personnel , and track the turnout .
( 10 ) Have Election Day declared a federal holiday , requiring all employers to allow their workers time to vote .
( 11 ) Make it illegal for Secretaries of State to co-chair political campaigns ( or otherwise assist or favor them ) .
( 12 ) Make election fraud a major felony , with life imprisonment - and disenfranchisement - for all repeat offenders .
6. America 's elections have also been influenced by factors outside of the election process proper .
For instance , by the use of criminal prosecutions in order to influence elections .
On December 7 , 2006 , the Bush Administration dismissed seven U.S. attorneys .
While the Justice Department has obstructed a thorough investigation of these cases by Congress , it nevertheless appears that each of these dismissals had to do with elections .
Either the U.S. Attorney was not playing the Republican " voter fraud " game by bringing prosecutions against those involved in voter registration drives , was prosecuting a Republican , or had refused to bring timely charges against a Democrat - all steps calculated to skewer the election results .
But the most astonishing case is certainly the prosecution of Alabama Governor Don E. Siegelman .
He claimed as the prosecution proceeded against him that he was a political target , and he was ridiculed in the Alabama media for making that claim - essentially no one believed him .
But now thanks to some Republican whistleblowers we know that Siegelman was in fact targeted for political purposes - as part of an effort to manipulate the elections .
Why did it take so long to get to the bottom of the Siegelman case , and why did the media - especially the local media in Alabama - perform so miserably throughout this process ?
Don Siegelman 's ordeal is certainly a major shocker ( as you have poignantly implied by dubbing him " the Man in the Iron Mask " ) .
The press 's burial of the story tells us much about the dismal state of U.S. journalism , national and local - and also on the left , which has n't really told this story , either .
So far , MSNBC 's Dan Abrams dealt with it in a single episode of his series of exposés , " Bush Justice , " and there was a passing reference to it in one editorial in The New York Times .
Both bits came out some six months after Siegelman began to serve his sentence ; and since then there 's been nothing .
A friend of mine at ABC has told me that the newsfolk there are strongly disinclined to look into the case of any politician who has been convicted of a crime , as doing so , they fear , would open them to charges of a party bias ( which no doubt means " liberal bias " ) .
If that 's the case , it means that our Free Press has failed disastrously to do its constutional duty as a watchdog on the actions of the government , which evidently can jail anyone it wants , and as improperly or groundlessly as it sees fit , and the reporters will just sit there .
Whatever they may tell themselves at ABC or any other network , what we have here is a corporate press that kowtows to the right , and does it mainly by adhering to the noxious paradigm of " balance , " which requires going blind to any crime or wrong that can't be said to have been perpetrated " on both sides . "
The fact that Siegelman has clearly been the victim of a punitive Republican cabal is not a fact that our reporters will report , as there is nothing on the Democratic side remotely comparable to the machine that has been persecuting him ( and several other Democrats ) ; nor is there any case of a Republican being treated by the opposition in that way .
Thus unable to deplore bipartisan malfeasance , the journalists simply look the other way .
Election fraud is a huge part of this whole story , or non-story .
Since it 's the Bush Republicans alone who have been massively defrauding the electorate , the press has stayed away from it , although it 's easily the biggest story of them all .
Although the U.S. Attorney scandal got a ton of coverage , few journalists dared to point out that the whole huge stinking mess had everything to do with rigging our elections .
( Adam Cohen did make this seminal point in an important New York Times editorial , but no - one else would dare connect those dots . )
That aspect of Siegelman 's ordeal - an aspect crucial to to his case , as he himself has said - has been suppressed even in what little coverage there has been , as neither Dan Abrams nor that lone Times editorial mentioned what went down in Alabama in the 2002 election .
The silence of the lambs in Alabama 's press is , unfortunately , not unusual .
Throughout the sordid history of Ohio's vast electoral meltdown , most of that state 's newspapers have been AWOL , or have even ridiculed the very notion of election fraud .
In Alabama , the problem is compounded by the role of Newhouse Newspapers , which is among the worst chains in the country , and which owns Alabama 's largest dailies .
Newhouse is fixated on the bottom line , and therefore devoid of civic conscience , nor interested at all in real investigative journalism .
As Alabama is corrupt from top to bottom , those newspapers are not only disinclined to blow the whistle , but probably complicit in the wrongs .
The paperback edition of Fooled Again is out now , updating the hardcover with a lengthy discussion of voting fraud questions that appeared in the 2006 elections .

Mike Small and his wife , Karen , sat down last Thursday to a dinner of smoked fish pie crusted with mashed potato and served with purple - sprouting broccoli , an unremarkable family meal except for one key factor : every ingredient came from sources close to their home in Burntisland , Fife .
' The fish was Fife - landed , while the potatoes and broccoli were grown on nearby farms , ' he says .
Nor was this a one - off culinary event .
For the past six months Mike and Karen and their two children , Sorley and Alex , have consumed only food and drink bought in their home district .
This is the Fife Diet , developed by Mike Small as a response to the environmental dangers posed by carbon - emitting imports of Peruvian avocados , Kenyan green beans , New Zealand lamb and all those other foreign foodstuffs that now fill the shelves of our supermarkets .
Each of these imported products involves the emission of carbon dioxide from the planes and ships that brought them to our shores .
So Mike Small argues that we should eat local produce and save the planet , an idea that has obliged his family - and a growing number of adherents to his cause - to eat meals of local lamb , pork and a great many dishes based on parsnips , beetroots , kale , potatoes , leeks and all the other root vegetables that typify the agricultural output of this wind - swept corner of Scotland .
This is the future of ethical eating , insists Small : the consumption of local produce at all costs .
It is an attitude now shared by thousands around the UK and overseas , individuals who have decided to reject foods that have been transported over long distances by road , air or sea to their dinner plates .
They even have their own name for themselves - locavores - and insist that their way is the only one to save the planet .
But the idea that ' only local is good ' has come under attack .
For a start , food grown in areas where there is high use of fertilisers and tractors is likely to be anything but carbon - friendly , it is pointed out .
At the same time the argument against food miles - which show how far a product has been shipped and therefore how much carbon has been emitted in its transport - has been savaged by experts .
' The concept of food miles is unhelpful and stupid .
It does n't inform about anything except the distance travelled , ' Dr Adrian Williams , of the National Resources Management Centre at Cranfield University , told The Observer last week .
Given that the food miles cause was hailed only a few months ago as the means to empower the carbon - conscious consumer , such criticisms are striking , and suggest that some careful reassessment of the concept 's usefulness has been going on .
Certainly the issues involved no longer seem clear - cut .
Consider that supermarket stalwart : green beans from Kenya .
These are air - freighted to stores to allow consumers to buy fresh beans when British varieties are out of season .
Each packet has a little sticker with the image of a plane on it to indicate that carbon dioxide from aviation fuel was emitted in bringing them to this country .
And that , surely , is bad , campaigners argue .
Rising levels of carbon dioxide are trapping more and more sunlight and inexorably heating the planet , after all .
But a warning that beans have been air - freighted does not mean we should automatically switch to British varieties if we want to help the climate .
Beans in Kenya are produced in a highly environmentally - friendly manner .
' Beans there are grown using manual labour - nothing is mechanised , ' says Professor Gareth Edwards - Jones of Bangor University , an expert on African agriculture .
' They do n't use tractors , they use cow muck as fertiliser ; and they have low - tech irrigation systems in Kenya .
They also provide employment to many people in the developing world .
So you have to weigh that against the air miles used to get them to the supermarket . '
When you do that - and incorporate these different factors - you make the counter - intuitive discovery that air - transported green beans from Kenya could actually account for the emission of less carbon dioxide than British beans .
The latter are grown in fields on which oil - based fertilisers have been sprayed and which are ploughed by tractors that burn diesel .
In the words of Gareth Thomas , Minister for Trade and Development , speaking at a recent Department for International Development air - freight seminar : ' Driving 6.5 miles to buy your shopping emits more carbon than flying a pack of Kenyan green beans to the UK . '
' Half the people who boycott air - freighted beans think they are doing some good for the environment .
Then they go on a budget airline holiday to Prague the next weekend , ' adds Bill Vorley , head of sustainable markets for the International Institute for Environment and Development .
' They are just making gestures . '
It is not that the concept of food miles is wrong ; it is just too simplistic , say experts .
In fact , balancing your diet with its carbon costs turns out to be a fiendishly tricky business .
Consider these two staples : apples and lettuce .
The former are harvested in September and October .
Some are sold fresh ; the rest are chill stored .
For most of the following year , they still represent good value - in terms of carbon emissions - for British shoppers .
But by August those Coxs and Braeburns will have been in store for 10 months .
The amount of energy used to keep them fresh for that length of time will then overtake the carbon cost of shipping them from New Zealand .
It is therefore better for the environment if UK shoppers buy apples from New Zealand in July and August rather than those of British origin .
Then there is the example of lettuces .
In Britain these are grown in winter , in greenhouses or polytunnels which require heating .
At those times it is better - in terms of carbon emissions - to buy field - grown lettuce from Spain .
But in summer , when no heating is required , British is best .
Picking the right sources for your apples and lettuces depends on the time of year .
' Working out carbon footprints is horribly complicated , ' says Edwards - Jones .
' It is not just where something is grown and how far it has to travel , but also how it is grown , how it is stored , how it is prepared . '
This uncertainty even extends to the Soil Association , which announced last year that it was considering halting its endorsement of air - freighted organic food because their emissions negated the benefits of growing it organically .
But now the organisation has dropped the plan and is to continue to endorse air - freighted organic food , provided it is grown under conditions that meet its ethical trade standards .
In addition , the government has revealed that it is changing its stance on food miles , as was recently stressed by Gareth Thomas .
' Food miles alone are not the best way to judge whether the food we eat is sustainable .
We need a better - informed food miles debate .
Long term , the only fair option is to ensure the prices of the goods we consume , including organic produce , cover the environmental costs wherever the goods are from .
We also need a labelling system that tells consumers about how the product is reducing poverty . '
Nor is this argument lost on the nation 's supermarkets .
' An airplane sticker is of no environmental value whatsoever , as studies have shown air - freighted products are not necessarily less sustainable than local produce grown in heated greenhouses , ' said a spokesman for Tesco .
' Thus we may remove those plane labels in future .
What people are actually interested in is the amount of carbon that is emitted during a product 's manufacture and import . '
As a result , Tesco has promised to put carbon labels on 30 of its own - brand products in the near future : six types of potatoes , 11 types of tomatoes , five types of washing power and liquid capsules , four types of orange juice and six types of light bulbs .
' We want to see how customers react and find out how it affects their purchasing behaviour , ' added the spokesman .
In fact , these carbon cost labels have already been tested on a small range of products , including Walkers crisps and Cadburys chocolates .
Packets and wrappers have a small C with a downward arrow through it , beside a figure which represents the number of grams of carbon dioxide emitted during the manufacture of that product .
In this way it is revealed that packets of Walker 's Ready Salted and Salt and Vinegar crisps each generate 75g of carbon , while the cheese and onion variety produced only 74g .
Now this limited range of products is to be expanded and will appear in Tesco and other stores , says the Carbon Trust which - with the British Standards Institute - has been involved in calculating how a meaningful carbon inventory can be compiled for foodstuffs .
Not surprisingly , such exercises have proved to be extraordinarily tricky , says Graham Sinden of the Carbon Trust .
' You have to take into account emissions that occurred in the farmyard , for example .
Cows and sheep produce methane , which is far more damaging a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
Similarly , fertilisers produce nitrogen oxides that are also dangerous .
Then you have the issue of transport and processing .
Taking a sheep to the slaughterhouse produces carbon emissions , for instance .
Cooking is another factor .
That requires heat that in turn releases carbon dioxide .
After that you need to store products .
That often requires refrigeration , which requires electricity , which releases carbon dioxide .
Estimating how long a product will be kept in a store and how efficient is its refrigeration is not easy to assess , but it has to be done .
' Then you have to work out how long your product will be kept at home once it has been purchased .
You also have to estimate how efficiently it will be cooked .
And finally you have to work out how much carbon is involved in its packaging and how much will be emitted in disposing of those wrappers and labels once discarded . '
For some products , such as crisps , a carbon number is easy to calculate .
But for others , the process will be much more awkward .
How can you accurately calculate a pizza 's carbon footprint when it often comes with a variety of toppings ?
Even if you could get a carbon label that accurately reflects a product 's impact on the environment and identify products that have high footprints , would you be right in boycotting them ?
In many cases , such as brands of coffee , these products come from struggling third world nations .
Using our Western concerns with the climate as an excuse to increase poverty there has dubious ethical consequences .
In short , the issue of trying to reduce the emissions produced by food is bedevilled by complexity .
Even replacing food miles with a carbon footprint figure will only partly simplify the issues , a point stressed by Tara Garnett of the Food Climate Research Network .
' There is only one way of being sure that you cut down on your carbon emissions when buying food : stop eating meat , milk , butter and cheese , ' said Garnett .
' These come from ruminants - sheep and cattle - that produce a great deal of harmful methane .
In other words , it is not the source of the food that matters but the kind of food you eat .
Whether people are prepared to cut these from their shopping lists is a different issue , however . '
The chickpea : A green dilemma
Chickpeas are sold in supermarkets in two versions : dried or cooked .
The carbon footprint of the latter is far higher than the former .
The only processing involved in drying chickpeas is to lay them out in the sun to drive off moisture .
By contrast , heat is needed to cook chickpeas before they are tinned .
Hence the carbon gram total for tins of cooked chickpeas would be far greater than those on packets of the dried variety .
' That seems straightforward , ' says Graham Sinden , of the Carbon Trust .
' But you can't eat dried chickpeas .
You have to cook them .
And when you take them home you find the carbon you emitted when cooking those chickpeas exceeds the figure for the tinned variety - because cooking small portions at home is inefficient compared with that of large industrial kitchens . '
As a result , when the trust system is taken up and used widely , the gram measure on a packet of dried chickpeas will include an estimate of the heat that will be used in a customer 's home to cook them .
But that figure will be a guess , for it will depend on whether the customer uses gas or electricity for cooking .
The former is more efficient and less prone to carbon emissions .
As for individuals who use renewable energy to heat their homes and kitchens , they would completely negate the point of carbon labels in many cases .
' That is why it is impossible to have accurate carbon labels on a lot of products , ' says Gareth Edwards - Jones , of Bangor University .

My theory is that British people , particularly educated British people , are raised to appreciate irony .
Or perhaps they are embued with an extremely peculiar sense of humor .
Or perhaps I am generalizing from an extremely tiny sample in order to find meaning in this dark and increasingly hostile world .
How do you like my sense of humor so far ?

I have recently been made aware of the personals ads in the London Review of Books .
These are unlike such ads elsewhere .
I thought it might be good to use some American ads to serve as a contrast , so I went to Match.com .
In order to see its ads , I had to sign up - not put up an ad , just register .

I 'm an American too !

Progressive politics and the Green Party : home and abroad .
April 9 , 2008
Posted by WorldbyStorm in Irish Politics
An interesting snippet in the current edition of Prospect raises some uncomfortable questions as regards Green parties across Europe , and these questions have a direct relevance to the sort of projects being championed here and at Dublin Opinion , Notes on the Front and the Irish Left Review .
Because in piece on ‘ the rise of the Green Conservatives ’ we are informed that :
Green conservatism is in the air .
Cameron ’s Tories are out - greening new Labour ; in the US , former Bush speechwriter David Frum has outlined an eco-friendly agenda to help renew Republicanism .
But it is in Germany , writes Hans Kundnani , that a right - green alliance is actually taking root .
In the city - state of Hamburg , the Christian Democrats and Greens are negotiating a “ black - green ” coalition that could redraw Germany ’s political map much as the “ red - green ” experiment of the 1980s and 1990s did .
It ’s certainly true that this wave of green thinking is being surfed by some unexpected people .
The depth of their commitment is , of course , a rather different matter .
Whether Cameron has a visceral attachment to such politics is a very very open question .
That it has softened his image is beyond doubt .
The late arrival of US conservatism at the feast is even more questionable , although intriguingly the US evangelical movement is fracturing to some degree around just this issue with a considerable number of evangelicals seeing it as central to their faith .
But , as ever , such matters are symptomatic of broader political processes :
This development is largely a consequence of the new arithmetic of power in Germany .
Since Oskar Lafontaine ’s left - wing party merged with the PDS ( the former East German communists ) last year , a five - party system has emerged in which it is increasingly difficult for either of the two traditional blocs — the Christian Democrats / Free Democrats on the right and the Social Democrats / Greens on the left — to form a stable coalition .
So , the logic of democratic , and in particular proportional representational , politics is such that it crushes forces together , even those which appear seemingly disparate .
That this is partially due to the further left in the shape of the Left Party is fascinating in itself ( worth noting the Green currents within that party ) .
The piece continues that :
The Greens are keen to reduce their dependence on the Social Democrats — and they have more in common with the Christian Democrats than one might think .
When the German environmental movement emerged out of “ citizens ’ initiatives ” against nuclear power in the late 1970s , it included Social Democrats and Christian Democrats , and drew heavily on a right - wing , anti-modernist tradition going back to the German Romantics .
And one might suggest that the Greens see an opportunity to wield the sort of power once held by the Free Democrats .
But , the fact that there are philosophical convergences should hardly be news to those of us interested in Green thinking .
But a crucial point is raised later :
One influential figure who now straddles this divide is Thomas Schmid , a former comrade of Joschka Fischer , and now editor of the conservative daily Die Welt .
Moreover , the Greens , unlike the Social Democrats , have always been a middle - class party with a liberal economic wing .
Until recently , a major stumbling block to a black - green alliance was the Christian Democrats ’ anti-immigrant rhetoric .
But that now seems to be in retreat .
If so , the new alliance could have a future beyond Hamburg .
I think the class basis of the Green parties is significant , and its importance is reflected in the recent tactics of the Irish Green party .
I do n’t want to suggest for a moment that there was a lack of sincerity in GP members when it came to campaigning issues , indeed quite the opposite .
That was how the GP developed a public profile and began the long march towards some degree of state power .
But , in that march the party itself changed while the perception of it remained quite similar .
It does n’t entirely strike me as odd that the poll ratings have increased .
Consider this , up until very recently the discourse in politics about the Green party from Fianna Fáil and others was one where they were portrayed as near extremist or lunatic on a range of issues .
That their public outings such as chaining themselves to trees on O’Connell Street fitted directly into this discourse only serves to demonstrate how important that was to them .
However , as they have assumed power that rather precious side of their public image has been downplayed in favour of a much more sober presentation .
To the point indeed that a grim looking John Gormley stood just behind Bertie Ahern during the latter ’s resignation statement .
That ’s quite some distance to travel , whatever ones thoughts on the issues .
But it also seems to point to a sense that while the campaigning activity was important , as power came within grasp it became less important .
Now , in the dynamic pointed to earlier , the reality of a global political environment becoming more open and accepting of Green issues and their reification to issues of ‘ high ’ state consideration the campaigning side could be jettisoned , at least in part , or seen as as lesser to what is being described as a potential planetary crisis .
And in that context the attraction of linking up with parties of left or right , but most important of government , because enormously important .
And for the Green parties there is sufficient wriggle room ideologically .
They can indeed be business friendly , or socially conscious , or both simultaneously .
This is not to say that somehow they ’re a cuckoo in the nest of the left .
Their instincts are broadly centre left , but it is to suggest that bringing them into future alliances of the left may be more difficult than it seemed even twelve months ago .
And returning to the poll rating , what is fascinating is how it continues to slide upwards .
Self - evidently people like the Green Party in government , and the more they see them there the more they like it .
Where is this new found ( and possibly entirely ephemeral ) support coming from ?
I do n’t know , but of course even small increments in their overall support are useful for them considering the relatively low base they start from .
Is it a sense of a sort of ‘ tamed ’ radicalism that appeals to an electorate tired after a decade of FF / PD ?
Or is it a sense that Green thinking is part of a wave , and therefore they might actually be right .
It ’s all very puzzling , not least I suspect to the GP itself .
Because by the yardstick of previous political dynamics they should have eviscerated their support by going into government and being forced to oversee a raft of contentious decisions .
And yet , remarkably they have n’t .
Which suggests to me that their base is somewhat more conservative than was once thought , or that they are attracting a new and rather less radical base than before , and in sufficient numbers to avoid attrition from their more radical fractions .
Interesting .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
Two passenger trains collided in eastern China on Monday , killing at least 70 people and injuring hundreds as carriages jumped the tracks and toppled into a ditch , state media said .
At least 420 people were taken to hospital , with 70 in critical condition , Xinhua news agency said , suggesting the death toll could rise further .
Xinhua said authorities had determined the crash -- the worst in China since 1997 -- was caused by human error , and that one of the trains might have been traveling much faster than the speed limit .
“ Although investigations are continuing , some investigators said that T195 was traveling at 131 kilometers per hour before the accident , far in excess of the speed limit of 80 km/h , ” it added .
One train was en route from Beijing to the seaside resort of Qingdao when the accident occurred in Zibo , Shandong province .
The second train was from the resort of Yantai , in Shandong .
One passenger described escaping the wreckage with her 13 - year - old daughter through a massive crack in the floor .
“ We were still sleeping when the accident occurred , ” Xinhua quoted the woman , surnamed Yu , as saying .
“ I suddenly woke up when I felt the train stopped with a jolt .
In a minute or two it started off again , but soon toppled . ”
The accident , which happened at a bend , caused the carriages to topple into a ditch , Xinhua reported , adding that bloodstained sheets and broken Thermos flasks littered the ground .
The director and Communist Party chief of the Jinan Railway Bureau , which oversees the line linking Qingdao and the provincial capital Jinan , had been sacked and would be investigated by the Ministry of Railways , Xinhua said .

Four of the injured were French nationals , three from the same family and one of their friends , all of whom were taken to hospital with bone fractures , the report said , adding no foreigners were among the dead .
Workers finished repairing the damaged line on Monday evening , and services were expected to be restored by Tuesday morning , Xinhua said .
OLYMPICS COACH INJURED
A coach of China ’s sailing team who was en route to Qingdao , host of the sailing events for the Beijing Olympics , was seriously hurt and facing amputation of his legs , state television reported .
It did not give his name , and an official reached at the Chinese Yachting Association had no information .
Pictures posted at the news portal www.sina.com showed carriages overturned and rescue workers milling around passengers wrapped in blankets .
The local Qilu Evening News said the railway had begun a new timetable on Monday .
Xinhua said rescuers had been working to remove the wrecked coaches from the tracks to ensure traffic along the line could resume on Tuesday morning .
State television said the rail line was built in 1897 and was due to be retired for all but goods trains in favor of a high - speed link to be ready in time to carry passengers from Beijing to Qingdao for the Olympic sailing events .
Railway Minister Liu Zhijun had arrived at the site and President Hu Jintao had dispatched Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang to the scene , Xinhua said .

“ The city government of Zibo has sent a 1,500 - member strong team to help and console the victims ’ families , ” it said , adding Railways spokesman Wang Yongping had expressed deep condolences for the victims .
In January , a high - speed train ran through a group of maintenance workers in the dark in Shandong , killing 18 .
China has invested about $ 100 billion in its railways in the past few years and is expanding the system to accommodate what is the world ’s most dense passenger and freight network .
As it stands , China ’s railways can barely keep pace with the country ’s breakneck economic growth or with the hundreds of millions of workers who are flocking from the countryside to booming cities .
Monday ’s accident was the worst in China since 1997 , when more than 100 people were killed in a train crash in the central province of Hunan .
A deal has been agreed that will place a financial value on rainforests – paying , for the first time , for their upkeep as " utilities " that provide vital services such as rainfall generation , carbon storage and climate regulation .
The agreement , to be announced tomorrow in New York , will secure the future of one million acres of pristine rainforest in Guyana , the first move of its kind , and will open the way for financial markets to play a key role in safeguarding the fate of the world 's forests .
The initiative follows Guyana 's extraordinary offer , revealed in The Independent in November , to place its entire standing forest under the protection of a British - led international body in return for development aid .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Hylton Murray - Philipson , director of the London - based financiers Canopy Capital , who sealed the deal with the Iwokrama rainforest , said : " How can it be that Google 's services are worth billions but those from all the world 's rainforests amount to nothing ? "
The past year has been a pivotal one for the fast - disappearing tropical forests that form a cooling band around the equator because the world has recognised deforestation as the second leading cause of CO2 emissions .
Leaders at the UN climate summit in Bali in December agreed to include efforts to halt the destruction of forests in a new global deal to save the world from runaway climate change .
" As atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide rise , emissions will carry an ever - mounting cost and conservation will acquire real value .
The investment community is beginning to wake up to this , " Mr Murray - Philipson added .
Guyana , sandwiched between the Latin American giants Venezuela and Brazil , is home to fewer than amillion people but 80 per cent of its land is covered by an intact rainforest larger than England .
The Guiana Shield is one of only four intact rainforests left on the planet and at its heart lies the Iwokrama reserve , gifted to the Commonwealth in 1989 as a laboratory for pioneering conservation projects .
Iwokrama , which means " place of refuge " in the Makushi language , is home to some of the world 's most endangered species including jaguar , giant river otter , anaconda and giant anteater .
Guyana 's President Bharrat Jagdeo , a former economist , has appealed for state and private sector help for the country to avoid succumbing to the rampant deforestation currently blighting Brazil and Indonesia , in an effort to raise living standards in one of Latin America 's poorest countries .
" Forests do much more for us than just store carbon ...
This first significant step is in keeping with President Jagdeo 's visionary approach to safeguarding all the forests of Guyana , " said Iwokrama 's chairman , Edward Glover .
The deal , drawn up by the international firm Stephenson Harwood , is the first serious attempt to pay for the ecosystem services provided by rainforests .
" We should move beyond emissions - based trading to measure and place a value on all the services they provide , " said Mr Glover .
In addition to providing shelter to half the world 's terrestrial species and one billion of the earth 's poorest people , forests such as Iwokrama act as pumps , drawing water from the Atlantic Ocean inland to the Amazon and Guiana Shield where they help to seed clouds and deliver moisture over vast distances .
The Amazon generates the rain that falls on the vast soya estates of Sao Paulo , helping to make Brazil the second biggest agricultural exporter in the world .
Guyana 's attempt to secure its entire standing forest has received the backing of the British environment minister Phil Woolas and Downing Street has told The Independent that it is " considering the offer " .
President Jagdeo met with Gordon Brown on the sidelines of a recent Commonwealth Summit in Uganda where they discussed the proposal .
The UN road map to a deal to replace the Kyoto protocols foresees payments from wealthy climate - polluting nations to developing countries to compensate for potential income lost through avoiding deforestation .
But there are fears that this formula may simply displace the demand for timber and cheap agricultural land .
Andrew Mitchell , head of the Global Canopy Programme , an alliance of rainforest scientists , said : " The decision on forests at December 's conference in Bali is a major step in tackling climate change but it fails to reward countries such as Guyana that are n't cutting down their forests . "
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - A Japanese sailor has set out from Hawaii for Japan , hoping to complete the 7,000 km ( 4,400 mile ) journey using only the power of the waves beneath his boat .

Garlanded with flowers , 69 - year - old adventurer Kenichi Horie waved from the deck of his catamaran - like boat as he set off on the latest of many challenges he has taken on since he became the first Japanese to sail solo across the Pacific in 1962 , a video of his departure from Hawaii showed .
The vessel for his latest adventure , the Suntory Mermaid II , has two wings in front which convert the energy from waves into a movement similar to a dolphin ’s kicks , making it the world ’s first boat to be powered by the vertical motion of waves .
“ Twenty years ago while sailing , an accident broke my main mast which actually fell in the sea , ” the white - haired Horie said before setting sail on Sunday local time from Honolulu .
“ The boat kept rocking and I thought how great it would be to actually harness the power of those waves to push the boat forward . ”
He plans to reach his destination -- the port of Hino , about 450 km ( 280 miles ) southwest of Tokyo -- at a leisurely pace .
“ The speed of the boat is just faster than a human walking pace , perhaps not quite a jogging pace .
At this rate , I plan to take two and a half months to get to Japan , ” Horie said .
The trip is meant in part to promote the commercial viability of the invention , which Horie says will bring a new option to those seeking to travel in an environmentally friendly way .
“ Wind and solar power have been well developed , but with our human intelligence , we should be able to harness wave energy for greater and wider applications and eventually sustainable energy should be able to solve all the world ’s energy needs , ” he said .
The boat was built by a team at Japan ’s Tokai University , one member of which expressed concern about hazards Horie faces .
“ I think he is the most able of solo sailors , so I am not worried for him at all as an adventurer , ” said Yutaka Terao , a professor at Tokai University .
“ However , there is still the unexpected to worry about -- I mean , he could bump into a whale or something -- so we still worry for him . ”
Horie , who has sailed around the world solo , traveled the Pacific in a yacht made of recycled beer cans in 2002 .

Sir ,
As the back and forth about the accounting standards applicable to banks continues to rage , I , too should like to add my fiat money two penn ’orth .
Firstly , were they ever to be granted the leeway of being allowed to incubate their most rotten eggs at the non-current price , do you suppose that the banks would , in a spirit of fair play , be equally happy thereafter to extend loans to their personal , corporate , and hedge fund clients on the basis of what their collateral used to be worth , too ?
Secondly , where bonuses , raises , and employee share - option goodies can be shown to have been paid out solely on the basis of a speciously favourable mark - to - market registered during the upswing , could we expect to see a blizzard of large denomination cheques piling up at corporate HQ as the repentant millionaires remit back to the legions of misled shareholders what was falsely exacted from them in the course of the boom ?
No .
Did n’t think so .
The fact is that , by some twisted thread of history , banks have been accorded the unjust privilege of being allowed to ignore the crucial distinction between the monies entrusted to them in their wholly beneficial roles as giro , or transmission , agents and virtual safety deposit - box custodians with their equally laudable asset management function of investing people ’s term savings in range of creditworthy ventures , knowing all the while that this wholly legal act of embezzlement has a small , but significant , chance of going horribly awry , with devastating consequences not just for those caught in flagrante , but for the majority of their fellow fiduciary philanderers and their hapless customers – not to mention the poor , beleaguered taxpayers who will end up footing the bill for this expensive malfeasance .
Since fractional reserve banking is , in addition , the well - spring of that thoroughly avoidable and widely destructive bipolar disorder we know as the business cycle – i.e. , the boom and the bust – rather than consider exempting its practitioners from a genuinely inconvenient truth , we should instead be subjecting them – and them above all other entities – to the most stringent standards of truthfulness it is humanly possible to apply .
Then again , since bankers , as a class , have long shown a reprehensible ingenuity in using fiendishly clever financial innovations to play fast and loose with valuations , both in respect of those of their clients and of what is being carried ( even if only contingently ) on their own books – from Parmalat to sub-prime , as it were – such an attempt at rigour would probably prove futile , anyway .
Perhaps , then , we may as well let them do whatever they deem is most expedient and simply pull the covers over our heads , trusting to the fact that , by the time we next awaken , the central banks will have bought up all their asbestos - backed securities and that , if our sleep of reason lasts long enough , the resulting currency debasement and inflationary recession will have passed their monstrous worst by the time we begin to stir anew .
I remain , Sir ,
Yours faithfully ,

The flights were intended to be the airliners attacked , he said .
Wright said the seven targeted flights would have all departed within three hours from London on any given afternoon and been in the air simultaneously .
Each would have carried between 240 and 285 people .
But the group had expressed hopes of recruiting as many as 18 suicide bombers for the attacks , Wright said .
He told jurors that the suspects hoped to smuggle hydrogen peroxide explosives on board , disguised as soft drinks or mouthwash by using empty bottles and adding food dye to the mixture .
The explosives would then be assembled and detonated in mid-flight .
" They were prepared to board an aircraft with the necessary ingredients and equipment to construct and detonate a device that would bring about not only the loss of their own lives , but also all of those who happened by chance to be taking the same journey , " he said .
Airlines imposed tough new limits on the amount of liquids and gels passengers can carry on to flights as a result of the alleged plot .
" The plan was designed to bring about what would have been a civilian death toll on an almost unprecedented scale , " Wright said .
He said the plot was intended to be a " violent and deadly statement of intent " in the name of Islam , that would have repercussions across the world .
Law enforcement officials have not established whether the group planned to detonate the bombs in mid-flight over the Atlantic Ocean , or over North American cities .
" They would have been completely at the mercy of the suicide bombers , who would have been on board with their deadly cargo , " Wright said .
Following his arrest , Abdulla Ahmed Ali , 27 , was found to have a computer memory stick that stored vast amounts of detail on the times , aircraft types , departure terminals and flight paths for daily services bound from London to North America .
Seven specific journeys were highlighted within the files , but Ali had also logged details of other flights to Boston , Denver and Miami .
" They did not confine their ambitions to the seven flights , " Wright said .
The prosecutor said the men had not checked details of return journeys .
" They did n't appear interested in flying back to the United Kingdom on a return flight , " he said , Major disruption was caused to British airports and hundreds of flights were grounded when police arrested the suspects in August 2006 .
" The attack they contemplated was not long off , " when police rounded up the men , Wright said .
Discovery of the plot led to tight new restrictions on the items airline passengers can to take on board planes as carryon luggage .
All eight men , each of whom has family ties to Pakistan , are accused of conspiracy to murder and a charge of planning an act of violence likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft .
Both charges carry maximum sentences of life imprisonment .
The men are : Ali , 27 ; Assad Sarwar , 27 ; Tanvir Hussain , 27 ; Mohammed Gulzar , 26 ; Ibrahim Savant , 27 ; Arafat Waheed Khan , 26 ; Waheed Zaman , 23 and Umar Islam , 29 .
The is trial expected to last about six months .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 7  Brushing aside a veto threat from the White House , the House passed a package of energy measures on Thursday that includes a 40 percent increase in fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks sold in the United States .
But the measure stalled today in the Senate , as expected .
The bill ’s supporters say it will reduce the nation ’s dependence on imported oil , jump - start development of clean - energy technologies and sharply reduce the nation ’s production of heat - trapping gases like carbon dioxide .
But the complex and costly bill faces the prospect of a radical rewrite in the Senate because of opposition there to two provisions : $ 21 billion in new taxes , mostly on the oil industry , and a mandate that electric utilities must generate 15 percent of their power from alternative sources , like wind or solar .
The White House threatened to veto the bill if the final version contains those or several other provisions passed by the House .
The House vote was 235 to 181 , with 14 Republicans voting for it and 7 Democrats voting against .
But the measure was blocked in the Senate this morning , as it attracted 53 “ yes ” votes  7 short of the number needed to advance it .
Forty - two senators voted against it .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has turned down a request from former American president Jimmy Carter for a meeting during his visit to Israel next week .
The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni both said that their schedules will not allow a meeting , but an anonymous Israeli official told the Washington Times , " You draw your own conclusions . "
Other officials have expressed anger at Carter 's proposed meeting with Syrian - based Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal .
However , President Shimon Peres , Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Israel Is Our Home ( Yisrael Beiteinu ) leader Knesset Member Avigdor Lieberman have scheduled to meet with the former president , whose recent book compares Israeli policies on the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) with former apartheid policies in South Africa .
Carter is scheduled to visit Sderot as well as Palestinian Authority ( PA ) Chairman Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah before traveling to Syria .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil fell on Wednesday after hitting an all - time high above $ 99 a barrel as a stockpiles rose at a key U.S. storage hub and concerns mounted over the health of the world ’s top economy .
U.S. crude oil fell 29 cents to $ 97.74 a barrel by 2:03 p.m. EST after surging to a record $ 99.29 early in the session .
London Brent crude gave up 5 cents at $ 95.44 a barrel .
Prices dipped after U.S. government data showed a build in crude stocks at the delivery point for U.S. crude futures at Cushing , Oklahoma , encouraging profit - taking ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday .
Overall U.S. crude inventories fell , however , by an unexpected 1.1 million barrels last week , countering analysts calls for a 600,000 - barrel build .
“ The crude draw is bullish , however the market will be rangebound due to people being out for the holiday , ” said Dan Flynn , analyst at Alaron Trading .
“ The crude build at Cushing is catching up from the surprise draw in the previous week so that is neutral . ”
Adding pressure , U.S. stock markets fell sharply on fears that fallout from the credit crisis will hurt economic growth and news that U.S. consumer sentiment was at its lowest level in two years in November .
“ The Dow is down , leading economic indicators were low , and sentiment as well , ” Kyle Cooper at IAF Advisors .
Analysts have said wider problems with the U.S. economy could hurt oil demand growth as consumers are squeezed by higher mortgage and fuel costs .
Oil has surged about 45 percent since mid-August , driven by increased speculative investment , tighter supplies and a slide in the dollar , which has spurred buying of relatively cheap greenback - denominated commodities .
The dollar sank to a new record low against the euro and versus a basket of currencies on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its growth outlook for next year , boosting chances of another interest rate cut in December .
Rising oil costs could force more than three - quarters of Americans to tighten budgets by cutting fuel use or by slashing spending elsewhere , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll .
Some 32.5 percent of people surveyed said they would drive less if oil prices kept rising , while 20.8 percent said they would try to conserve energy at home and 22.8 percent said they would cut spending on retail and entertainment .
Gold and platinum have also rallied in response to the falling dollar , although copper and zinc have slumped to multi- month lows on concerns the U.S. mortgage crisis could slow economic growth and demand .
U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman called on OPEC to pump more oil to bring prices down .
But officials from the cartel , which meets on December 5 in Abu Dhabi to chart supply policy , have said the market is well - supplied and it is up to consumer countries to curb speculation through regulation .

Fossilised faeces found in a US cave may help solve the riddle of when and how humans came to the Americas .
The samples date back just over 14,000 years , before the time of the Clovis culture .
Clovis people dominated North and Central America around 13,000 years ago , and whether any groups came before them has been controversial .
In the journal Science , the researchers describe how their conclusion hinged on modern genetic analysis .
The 14 faecal fragments were discovered in caves near a lake in the north - western US state of Oregon , among other signs of ancient human occupation .
The first humans either had to walk or sail along the American west coast to get around the ice cap
Eske Willerslev
Copenhagen University
These included threads made from animal sinew and plant fibre , baskets , animal hides and wooden pegs .
The presence of these artefacts at various depths in the cave floor indicated it was populated for extensive periods - but by whom ?
" We found a little pit in the bottom of a cave , " related Dennis Jenkins from the University of Oregon , whose team excavated the Paisley Caves in 2002 and 2003 .
" It was full of camel , horse and mountain sheep bones , and in there we found a human coprolite . "
' Convincing evidence '
This and 13 other coprolites - fossilised faeces - proved the star attraction , because they contained tiny quantities of human mitochondrial DNA - genetic material found outside the nuclei of cells which is passed down from each mother to her children .
Several kinds of genetic analysis performed at several different laboratories confirmed that the DNA was human , and suggested the ancient cave residents were closely related to ethnic groups indigenous to Siberia and East Asia .
The Clovis culture featured elegant stone implements
This adds to other strands of evidence suggesting that the Americas were settled from Siberia - and the age of the samples indicates the migration happened before the emergence of the Clovis culture with its distinctive fluted stone blades .
" If this does n't convince what 's left of the ' Clovis first ' people , it should , " University of California scholar David Smith , who was not involved in the study , told Science journal .
In an era when the north of the Americas were heavily glaciated , the question then is : how did the pre-Clovis people make the journey ?
" The first humans either had to walk or sail along the American west coast to get around the ice cap , " contended Eske Willerslev , director of the Centre for Ancient Genetics at Copenhagen University , who led the DNA work on the new study .
" That is , unless they arrived so long before the last ice age that the land passage was n't yet blocked by ice . "

What are these ?
Typically , Django sites are designed with the assumption that they ’ll have a domain or subdomain to themselves .
Often times this is fine , but if you ’re developing a web application designed for redistribution , sometimes you ca n’t make that assumption .
During development of Review Board , many of our users wanted the ability to install Review Board into a subdirectory of one of their domains , rather than a subdomain .
There ’s a few rules that are important when making your site relocatable :
Always use MEDIA_URL when referring to your media directory , so that people can customize where they put their media files .
when referring to your media directory , so that people can customize where they put their media files .
Do n’t hard - code URLs in templates .
Use the { % url %} tag or get_absolute_url ( ) when possible .
These solve some of the issues , but does n’t address relocating a Django site to a subdirectory .
Djblets fills in this gap by providing a special URL handler designed to act as a prefix for all your projects ’
URLs .
To make use of this , you need to modify your settings .py file as follows :
settings.py
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
= ( ... ' djblets.util.context_processors.siteRoot ' , ) SITE_ROOT_URLCONF
= ' yourproject.urls '
ROOT_URLCONF = ' djblets.util.rooturl ' SITE_ROOT = '/'
SITE_ROOT specifies where the site is located .
By default , this should be “ / ” , but this can be changed to point to any path .
For example , “ / myproject / ” .
Note that it should always have a leading and a trailing slash .
The custom template context processor ( djblets.util.context_processors.siteRoot ) will make SITE_ROOT accessible to templates .
SITE_ROOT should be used in templates when you need to refer to URLs that are n’t designed to respect SITE_ROOT ( such as User.get_absolute_url ) .
Your own custom applications should always respect SITE_ROOT whenever providing a URL .
ROOT_URLCONF is typically what you would set to point to your project ’s URL .
However , in this case , you ’ll be pointing it to djblets.util.rooturl .
This in turn will forward all URLs to your project ’s handler , defined in SITE_ROOT_URLCONF .
This is all you need to have a fully relocatable Django site !
To sum up :
Add djblets.util.context_processors.siteRoot to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
.
Set SITE_ROOT_URLCONF
to your project ’s URL handler .
Set ROOT_URLCONF to ‘ djblets.util.rooturl ’
Prefix any URLs with SITE_ROOT in your templates , unless the URL would already take SITE_ROOT into account .
This is functionality that will hopefully make its way into Django at some point .
For now , you have an easy way of unrooting your Django project .
Comedian Lee Camp : Fox News a ' festival of ignorance '
" What is Fox News ? " asks comedian and activist Lee Camp on the air .
" It 's just a parade of propaganda , is n't it ?
It 's just a ... festival of ignorance .
" A million people are dead in Iraq .
Come on .
This is ridiculous .
What 's the point of this ? "
" This is insane , " Camp continues .
" Go out -- leave your home .
Go outside !
Go hug your children !
Love your family , you know ?
Do something with your life . "
The anchor and panelist quickly act to drown out Camp 's speech before handing the show off to another Fox anchor , flanked by four buxom women in makeshift Star Trek uniforms , to promote a story about Captain Kirk 's sex appeal .
The following clip was aired on Fox News ' FOX & Friends on February 23 , 2008 .

18歳未満の人たちがインターネット上の「有害情報」に触れないようにする対策を講じる法律案ってのが、3月の中頃から末頃にかけて、姿を現してきた。朝日新聞の記事では少し紹介されているが、それ以外の大手マスコミには全然出てない。っていうか、ペーパーメディアの人間は全然ヤバさを認識してない。あるいは、分かっててトボけている。この法律案、ものすごくヤバい。
この件については、個人・MIAU的にはある程度動いていたものの、全く表沙汰にしなかった。沈黙していた理由は、早くから表立って行動してしまうと、情報をリークしてくれた人を潰してしまう可能性があったからだが、ここ数日で他のルートからも、法律の骨子、条文、概要の3点セットが回ってきたので、もう堂々と話して大騒ぎすることに決めた。
もう、スゲームカつくんだよこの法案！ この法案は、推進者の性格も加味して考えると、児童ポルノ法よりヤバい。つーか、この国は中国になりたいのか？
まず状況を整理しよう。本当は全部丸ごとコピペしたいところなんだが、そいつはもうちょっと待ってほしいので、とりあえず俺の要約と説明で耐えてくれ。
で、これらの法案の何がヤバくてムカつくのかという具体的な中身についてだが、民主党法案はかなりラフな体裁になっているのと、内容自体は不思議なくらいに自民党案とソックリなので、完成形が見えている自民党案に基づいて話しておこう。
内閣府に設置される少人数の青少年健全育成推進委員会（最大数5人）っていう組織が、インターネット上の全てのコンテンツについて、青少年に有害か無害かについての判断基準を作成します。ちなみにその基準への異議申し立ては、多分無理。（法案19条から31条）
「行政訴訟できるから問題無いんだ、誤魔化すなボケ」という批判は誤りだ。この法案では、ISPやキャリアなら行政訴訟できるが、サイト管理者などの個人は委員会の行政行為にケチをつける方法が無い。そしてそのシステムでも憲法上問題が無いとされている。だからぼかして書いたんだよ。(2008/04/15 17:56追記 )
個人も含む全てのウェブサイトの管理者は、上記の有害コンテンツの基準に合致した場合、サイトを丸ごと未成年が入れない会員制にするか、フィルタリングソフトへ自らのサイトをフィルタ対象として申請することなどが、求められます。（3条1項） 全てのISP、ASP事業者などには、有害コンテンツの削除やサービスの停止が求められ、従わない場合の罰則も設けられます。結果としてウェブコンテンツの削除は行われることになります。（3条） 全てのPC・携帯電話について、国の基準に基づいたフィルタリングソフトウェアをプレインストール、あるいは、フィルタリングサービスに強制加入することが、PCメーカー（努力義務）及びキャリア（提供義務）に求められます。（5条、8条）
これらが、ネタじゃなくて大マジ。俺、手元の法律案見ながら書いてるもの。アリエネーよ。なんか心底寒くなってこない？
俺なりに問題点を3つくらいに整理すると、
表現の自由の問題 自治体レベルならいざ知らず、内閣府で委員会を設けて基準を示す上、間接的とは言え削除が行われるのは、検閲だろう！ ……と叫びたくなるわけだが、だがしかし高市議員が老獪なのは、ちゃんと逃げ道を用意しているところ。それはつまり、内閣府の委員会自体は、単に基準を示しているだけで、実際のコンテンツの削除やらサービス停止やらフィルタアウトやらを行うのは、民間の事業者だっていう構図だ。で、コンテンツを封じたのは民間の事業者なので、文句はそっちへ言ってね、そのために調停機関は作るから、となっている。国は直接手を下してない、だから検閲ではない、どうだ文句あるか、という筋道。池田氏はこの調停機関の存在を評価されてるけど、俺は全然評価できないな。 って書いたら、池田氏か ら 「 いかなる規制にも絶対反対 」 「『紛争処理機関も認めない』」とか要約されちゃったよ。おいおい、あなたは味方を背後から撃つのが趣味なのか？ 俺としてもMIAUとしても、ナイーブな自由主義や無政府主義の肯定なんか、したことないだろう。検閲じゃないという逃げ道に、あの国分さんのIAJapanが中心となるだろうADR機関には、反対なんだよ(2008/04/05 16:34追記 ) 実効性や技術上の問題 例えば、性的・暴力的な言葉があるという理由でWikipedia全体をフィルタするのって、本当に青少年の利益になっているのかね？
という疑問は当然沸き起こるわけだけど、これにも反論は用意されている。「青少年の健全な育成のために、多少の弊害は止むを得ない」。だから多少ってどこまでなんだよ。 あるいは、PCメーカや携帯キャリアのコスト上昇分に見合うだけの効果、「青少年を守る」という社会的な利益が得られるのかどうかの検証を経たのか、というような、極めて合理的な反論もありえるだろう。ところがだ、これも反論はあるんだな。「コスト云々と称して健全育成のための努力をしないことは社会的・倫理的に許されない」。 また、LinuxのようなオープンなOSを用いたPCが作れなくなるんじゃないかとか、個人のウェブサイトを封じるような行為は、日本からのイノベーションや、自由な情報発信を殺すんじゃないか、というような、疑問もありえるだろう。でも、反論はきっとこんな感じ。「
Linux ？ ナニソレ？ まあ、作りたいなら法律守ってがんばれば？ 」 教育など他の面からの視点が無い 実はこの法案には、 「 インターネットの適切な利用に関する教育の推進等」という条文があるんだが（15条～18条）、そこで述べられている教育ってのは、「ガキにフィルタリングソフトウェアを使わせるために、学校とか自治体とか国とかはいっぱい努力しろ」という、とても清清しい内容である。違うだろ！
フィルタリングソフトウェアを使わなくても問題なく情報社会で生きていけるような技術なり、倫理なりを身に着けること、そういう教育へ注力する方がずっと大事だろうが！
そんな教育のメソッドが無いっていうなら、それこそ国がカネを出して確立するべきところだろう。
つまり、この法案で何がしたいのかというと、
18歳未満には国によってコントロールされた情報しか見せない
日本でインターネットに関係する全ての人間は、そのための犠牲を払え
ってこと。これじゃあ、中国のグレートファイアーウォールを嘲笑できませんよ。この法案が成立した暁には、日本の18歳未満がつなぐ「ソレ」は、もう“ the Internet ” じゃない 。
で、自民党議員の目から見ていると、ガソリンだの日銀総裁だのグダグダ揉めている国会の混乱に乗じて、提出する気満点なんだってさ。民主党案ははっきり言ってズタボロの出来なので、対案として自民党案が出てきたら、「青少年は守らんとねー」、「やっぱり自民党案はしっかりしてるなー」って流れになるだろうし、下手するとそんな議論にもならずにススッと通ってしまうかもしれない。もうね、久しぶりに、心の底から腹が立った。
俺はね、政治的な活動って、大嫌いなんだよ。絵描いてる方が好きだし、実は高校の頃は音大目指してたくらい音楽も好きなんだ。上手い飯食うのも作るのも好きだし、一応まだ学生でもあるから、調べものしてたり、あとコード書いたりするのとか、そういう方が何倍も好きだし、お金にもなる。MIAU のような活動、別に一銭にもなっとらんのだ。
でもさ、児童ポルノ法の改正案もムカついたけど、この法案には反吐が出る。分かったよ、政治活動って、こういうのが原動力になってやることだったんだね。だから、がんばって騒ぐことにする。
The Conservative radio pundit industrial - complex is led by the most successful radio talk host of all time , Rush Limbaugh , currently riding out a quarter - billion dollar contract .
His successor - apparent is Sean Hannity , followed by the likes of Laura Ingraham , Glenn Beck , Bill O'Reilly , Mark Levin and dozens more who are proven successes in selling advertising and generating profits , both nationally and in many local markets .
These broadcasters are careful not to call themselves newspersons or journalists , preferring the " disclaimer " that they are merely " entertainers " .
Because this blending of personality , passion and salesmanship intentionally and repetitively massages current events and historical fact to promote a singular political viewpoint , it plainly meets any historical definition of propaganda .
Hannity and Limbaugh omit basic and essential counterpoints to their arguments , carefully prune callers and routinely ignore many important national stories critical of NeoCon politicians and their cronies in business .
The most listened - to broadcasters on the air today by far , should they have any responsibility to meet " traditional " broadcasting ethics when discussing politics on public airwaves ?
If so , what should be the criteria and who would be the enforcer / arbiter for this ?
This thread invites discussion on what broadcasting in America should be , in light of what it 's come to .
America abandoned government - imposed regulation on journalistic balance in 1987 and today the biggest player in radio boldly ignores any appearance of self - regulation in the representation of our society 's actual sociopolitical balance .
Creating a Warm and Fuzzy NeoCon Habitat
Imagine a radio safe haven where you can come to hear the latest political developments and discussion , but where , like the Harlem Globetrotters , the same side always wins .
First , Rush and Hannity will offer pure right wing solace , insulating you from the complexities of counterpoints .
Then , you can even join in and blow off some steam in bashing the opposition .
This is particularly shifty when they speak of morality , " character " or " values " because , unlike schools and most parents , they condone the smear job , impugning the dignity of their ideological opponents with a menu of " dirty trick " tactics : guilt - by - association , overgeneralization , exaggeration , name - calling and fear mongering using nebulous , unspecified predictions of chaos and calamity .
At the same time they claim to be presenting " the truth " in a " fair and balanced " way , they shuffle off the most basic responsibilities of public reporting - presenting the whole story .
When public radio was first introduced after World War I , the government knew well how the new medium might be abused .
It was therefore regulated to promote responsible , socially uplifting programming only , including news , weather , entertainment and public service messages .
To prevent the " noise pollution " advertising represented , spots were limited during family listening hours .
During the Great Depression however , station owners succumbed to round - the - clock advertising as the only way to stay afloat .
Once given this toe - hold , sponsors began to leverage their financial clout to influence programming .
This leads us to questions of responsibility on public airwaves .
For decades , the FCC has sought to impose fines on broadcasters like Howard Stern for scatological content , purportedly policing radio for social appropriateness , but have not considered the civic impact of lopsided political speech - not only on our young , but anyone underinformed on a given issue .
Leaving America in The Dark
Limbaugh and Hannity know there is more then one side to a story , but choose to present only the news and opinions they select .
This intellectual dishonesty keeps things cut and dry , unlike real life .
Personally , I hope my daughters can learn to understand the many complex sides of an issue , discerning as Oscar Wilde said , " The truth is rarely pure and never simple " .
If Sean Hannity hopes the same for his children , he certainly does not for his listeners , those who patronize his sponsors , vote and contribute as he indicates , and evangelize his causes against his opponents .
As parents , journalistic integrity should be an important moral issue .
It is the responsibility of any ethical person , including commentator - entertainers to refrain from knowingly presenting relevant facts in an incomplete manner .
For example , Hannity was recently surveying young voters , asking them to name a single accomplishment of Barack Obama's .
No respondent listed a single accomplishment .
Sean intimated that Obama 's success stems solely from his charm and that his presidential qualifications should be questioned .
Yet Hannity failed to ask the same voters to list a single accomplishment of John McCain , Hillary Clinton or any other politician , conflating general political ignorance with ominous misgivings over Obama .
Each and every day , he presents discussions in this same logical vacuum .
Basic fourth grade essay writing teaches children to consider all available information , weighing multiple sides with logic and intelligence .
Ninth grade debating teaches kids to challenge assumptions , scrutinize information carefully and construct reasoned conclusions only after arguments have been vetted in open discussion .
Journalism 101 instructs us to gather information objectively , reporting multiple perspectives responsibly so as to allow listeners to formulate their own opinions .
These disciplines also teach the history of " yellow journalism " , a blight on American society in which competing newspaper publishers slanted the news to increase profits , prestige or readership , intertwining commerce and politics in dereliction of journalistic ethics .
Worse still was the growing scourge of propaganda -- state - sponsored stories planted in media to persuade or mislead , intentionally fomenting fear or hate .
The original 1928 book Propaganda was first published by Edward Bernays , the nephew of Sigmund Freud who made considerable use of his uncle 's revolutionary psychological insights .
Considered " the father of public relations " , Bernays fabricated news and hatched publicity stunts for decades , aiding the U.S. government and largest corporations , including the staging of fake rallies of support , and fake riots in third world countries to justify military thuggery .
Cited by Hitler and Goebbels as a major influence , Bernays showed how to crystallize public opinion by simultaneously cross-applying fear and intimidation with promises of security , familial warmth and inclusion - the classic good guy / bad guy manipulation .
Essential to this is the flow of information - who gets heard and what is said .
After World War II , a growing anti-propaganda tradition in the U.S. culminated in the Smith - Mundt Act of 1948 , outlawing domestic dissemination of deceptive materials .
Then , the Fairness Doctrine of 1949 would designate radio stations with FCC licenses as " public trustees " , required to make " every reasonable attempt to cover contrasting points of view " .
This mandated equal time for subjects of personal attacks and balanced access for political candidates , among other provisions .
Enforcement of these laws would be lax , however , demonstrated by the " red scare " era , the U.S. government and surrogate forces sought to galvanize public sentiment against the threat of communism .
The growth of the polling industry helped ease America 's collective paranoia , reassuring us that not as many people actually shared the gripping fear of danger the government told us was imminent .
But when Rush Limbaugh went on the air , it was a new day in media .
The Fairness Doctrine was struck down , and a for - profit political spin machine revved up , preaching a subset of Conservative values at variance with Goldwater or Eisenhower , but which coincided well with arms build - ups , aggressive foreign policy stances including covert operations , anti-environmental causes , Ayn Rand - style defenses of wealth accumulation - and of course , selling consumer goods and services .
Taking Root in Hometown , USA
Through the late 80s , the top rated morning drive - time shock jock Howard Stern , had already pioneered the art of on - air " legalized " slander in the post - Fairness Doctine era , viciously excoriating public figures he found vapid or who he felt had copied his shtick .
Indeed , Stern claimed that Limbaugh 's show took off only after Rush learned from him " how to grow balls " .

A good financial situation is an intricate balancing act between how much you make and how much you spend .
I am currently on a quest to find as many different ways as possible to make more money – just take a look at the massive collection of extra money making ideas that has been coming together , and you ’ll see why I believe that anyone can make more money .
That said , the other side of the balance is equally important .
And that is how you spend your money .
Or rather , how you protect yourself from spending too much money .
Without this balancing aspect , no matter how much you make , you will never have enough .
Here ’s what I do to live frugally and keep my spending in check .
Cook at home as often as possible : I love cooking exotic dishes once in a while .
And I * hate* regular everyday cooking .
I am a foodie and at the end of a busy day spending an hour in the kitchen to fix a plain ( aka “ healthy and nutritious ” ) meal just does n’t feel like it is worth the effort .
But I have been trying hard to get into the habit of cooking at least 5 times each week and some of the things I laid out in this article and this article have been coming in pretty handy .
Take lunch with me to work at least 3 times a week :
This is one thing I am really proud of .
Even during my bleakest unfrugal days , I have stuck with this schedule .
It has been a little over a year 5 years (! ) since I started working , and in the entire period I think I have gone out for lunch more than twice a week only 4 - 5 times less than a dozen times , and even during those weeks , the max I ate out was 3 times a week .
We have coffee and breakfast at home , rest of the time we drink free coffee available at office .
We do n’t entirely ban coffee houses or starbucks , but usually reserve it for occasions when we meet old friends .
Over time , we have come to associate coffee houses , with lazy leisurely evenings spent catching up and swapping old stories .
And being loathe to spoil that association keeps us away from running in and out for an overpriced cup of coffee that is drank in a hurry at the desk or while driving .
We do n’t have a telephone land line :
We have gone for over 4 years now without a phone land line and have not missed it a bit .
We both make sure that our cell phones stay charged all the time , so we are never at a loss of an instrument to make calls from .
On the cell phone we have the least expensive plans with fairly low minutes , but since many of our friends have the same service provider , we get to talk to them for free .
Only once in the past 4 years have we paid for extra minutes .
Shop for pretty much everything during “ sale ” and after researching the prices thoroughly .
Avoid impulse buy .
One of the first lessons someone told me when I landed in the US is that if you pay full price to buy anything , you are a sucker .
At first I thought it was a joke .
But now , I firmly believe it .
As long as you can avoid impulse buying , you can get pretty much anything on sale .
Drive our cars to death : People who are regular visitors to this blog may be surprised that I have listed this here since I recently confessed that we bought a fairly unfrugal car .
Over the long run though , our car ownership turns out to be quite frugal .
We take good care of our cars ( regular oil changes , get necessary repairs done as soon as we possibly can etc. , ) and drive the car until the wheels fall off – literally .
The car we just replaced was 14 years old and had 165 K miles on it and we drove it until the engine finally quit on us .
Both our current cars now are pre-owned and we plan to use them ( hopefully ) past the 150 K mile mark too !
Hang out with like minded friends :
It ’s not just how frugal you are , but who you hang out with .
If all the friends around you are spenders , then some time or the other you will crack up and give up being frugal .
In our case , we have been fortunate enough to have friends who are fairly like - minded .
Even though frugality is not the core of our conversation or anything , we still end up making choices that do not require too much expenditure , and still end up having a blast .
Watch movies at discount theatre , or watch it before 6:00 pm if it is a regular cinema hall .
Both the better half and I like watching movies in the theatre .
Since it is something that we really enjoy and it helps us unwind , we do n’t bother to curb this indulgence .
Instead , we try to wait for the movies to screen on the discount cinema ( $ 2 per ticket ) .
And , if we really do n’t want to wait for 3 months for a particular movie , we catch it before 6:00 pm when the tickets are less expensive .
Go to the movies on a full stomach :
We very rarely get popcorn or soda at the movies .
I mean , what ’s the point in watching a movie in a discount cinema for $ 2 per person , if you blow $ 6 per person on pop corn and soda ?
I go grocery shopping when I am too hungry or too tired : Basically any time that I really do n’t want to be doing grocery shopping .
And I go only once a week , no matter what I remember / forget to bring .
Believe it or not , this is the most efficient and money - saving way to shop .
At least in my case , since I am ever curious and if I have the time , I will walk through all the aisles looking for new and strange items and buy them so I can “ try them out ” .
Make a list before going shopping :
This is particularly important when I go to Costco !
Like I said earlier , I get easily tempted to buy something that looks new and interesting .
And at places like Costco , that can be quite damaging since the portion sizes are large and so , even though the unit price may be less than the regular store , the large portion sizes make buying unnecessary junk a big costly mistake .
Stock up non-perishable items on sale :
When I find the things we use often go on sale , I generally stock them up .
That particular grocery run my bill will be pretty huge , but I make it a point that during the subsequent trips , my bill is small so the average is around what I have budgeted for .
Keep an eye on expiry dates : I hate throwing out stuff because they have expired – so while buying stuff , I check to make sure I buy something with the farthest expiry date .
This is true particularly with meats and milk – the grocery store always puts the stock with the closest expiry date at the front .
And every once in a while I have a “ clearance week ” when I do minimal grocery shopping and clear out the fridge , freezer and some of the canned goods .
We do n’t buy anything at the vending machines .
Neither of us have the habit of snacking , but in Texas if you spend some time outdoors , it is usually very tempting to grab a coke at the vending machine .
To avoid this temptation , if we plan on staying out for long , then during the previous day , we fill a bottle of water and shove it in the freezer .
Next day we take the frozen bottle of ice in the car and generally we get to drink cold water ( or at least “ not hot ” water ) for the better part of the day .
Buy second hand when possible : I do not like buying some things second hand ( eg. clothes , mattress etc. ) but I have no hassles buying some other things second hand ( eg. books , car etc . ) .
So whenever , I have no stigma against something , I try to buy it second hand .
Maybe not as frugal as a lot of people out there , but still every bit helps .
We throw away the advertising mailers left in our mailbox without even looking .
We only make an exception when we need something and know that it is possible to get a discount using the coupon in the mailer ( e.g. , haircut coupons – ( gasp ! )
Yep , I use a coupon to get a haircut ) .
We have a habit of switching off electric items when they are not in use .
For instance , when we walk out of a room , we make sure the lights and fan are switched off .
When I am not watching TV ( which is most of the time ) , I keep the TV off .
When we go out for work we switch off the A/C ( the jury is still out on whether this is good or it is better to keep it on at a constant temp , but we just do this out of habit ) .
We DIY things when possible :
The lawn is taken care of by the better half , and home cleaning by me .
In the 2.5 years of owning the home , I have had the maid service come in once to help me with the cleaning .
The temptation is very strong to let them come in and help again .
Until now , I have not given in and have stuck to keeping the house clean myself .
Currently , my plan is to have them come over once every 3 - 6 months to do a thorough cleaning ( particularly bathrooms , over side of fans , window blinds etc. that I do n’t do often ) and do incremental cleaning by myself during the rest of the time .
Additionally , small repairs around the house are handled by the better half with me acting as the able assistant 🙂
When we travel , we usually search for discount airfares and in the nights , do n’t hesitate to crash in Motel 6 or Super 8 .
Or any place with or without a numeral in the name for that matter as long as they let us stay for cheap and do n’t look like they could be a candidate for the set of a scary slasher movie .
And if they throw in the breakfast , all the more better 🙂
Every now and then we love going to a good ol ’ buffet place .
All - you - can - eat buffets are great ways to have a frugal feast .
No they do not serve gourmet food in buffets ( unless you are in Vegas ) , but when you are hungry , there is no better way to get the best value for the buck than to go for the most extensive buffet place around .
We have tried out a few in our area and now know the ones we like best and on days that we feel like packing in a lot of food , we skip the restaurant and go get in line for the buffet .
( As a side note , if you are a fellow buffet - lover , you should read this post by Nick @ Punny Money – funny and informative – can it get any better ? )
That ’s all I can think of now .
As you can see , I do n’t particularly deprive myself of anything , but when possible , I try to incorporate little bits of frugality in every day things .
Every small bit helps .
I will not tag anyone in this post , but I do encourage those of you on the unfrugal part of your cyclical behavior to go ahead and do this exercise .
Just thinking about it and writing it down , has filled me with renewed determination to stay frugal during the coming days .
As I have mentioned before , for some people living a simple and frugal life comes naturally .
But for the rest of us , it takes conscious effort , determination and a fair amount of discipline to incorporate frugality in our lives .
And an exercise like this goes a long way in helping us stay on track .
PS : If you do n’t have a blog , feel free to use the comments section below as a scratch pad , or send me an email with your list and I will publish it here .
